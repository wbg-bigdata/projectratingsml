PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND - LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1492-TH)
PREFACE
This report reviews the achievements under Loan 1492-TH to the
Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT), to help finance the
establishment of an industrial estate/export processing zone at Lat Krabang
near Bangkok. The Bank loan of US$4.75 million was to cover about 44% of
the total development cost of the proposed project including land acquisi-
tion (not financed from loan proceeds), dike construction, power, water,
sewerage treatment and telephone facilities. The Loan was approved on
October 31, 1977, declared effective on March 24, 1978 and fully disbursed
on September 8, 1981, before the original closing date (December 31, 1981).
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is prepared by the Industrial
Development and Finance Division of the Projects Department East Asia and
Pacific Regional Office, based on a draft PCR prepared by IEAT, discussions
in the field in April 1982 and a file review. It focusses on the level of
achievements under the loan's objectives, issues faced by IEAT and lessons
learned during the project implementation period. It generally covers the
period 1977 to September 1981, but brings some aspects of the institution's
situation up to date. The Borrower's comments have been taken into account
in finalizing this report and are shown as Annex 17.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND - LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1492-TH)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Bank concluded during its discussions with the Thai Government
in the early 1970s that industrial estates were needed in Thailand to
stimulate industrial investment and to respond effectively to the anticipated
demand for factory sites and services. It consequently supported IEAT's plan
to develop an industrial estate cum export processing zone at Lat Krabang, and
extended a loan to help IEAT finance this project. The Lat Krabang estate was
expected to serve as a catalyst for a more comprehensive estate development
program in Thailand.
The principal objective of the Loan was to assist the Government's
policy to divert industrial development away from the congested metropolitan
area by providing fully serviced industrial sites on Bangkok's periphery.
It was hoped that this first step towards a spatially more balanced pattern
of industrial development would also contribute to more even income distri-
bution and facilitate land use and industrial and social infrastructure
planning. Moreover, the project was designed as the Government's first
organized approach to industrial pollution control, and consequently expected
to influence the concept of other estates in the country. Readily available
industrial sites were also expected to reduce the intervals between project
conception and start-up operation as well as foster concepts of plant and
process engineering. The EPZ was aimed at expanding export and import
substitution activities. Substantive institution building efforts were part
of the project concept.
Estate development was satisfactory, despite several problems such
as contractor disputes, work coordination and supervision deficiencies and
design changes during construction. Actual construction cost exceeded
appraisal estimates by some 9% only. However, number and type of estate
customers did not fully conform to appraisal expectations, nor were employ-
ment targets reached. Inadequate promotion efforts and lack of appropriate
advance factory space have affected the occupation of the EPZ and the
prospects for an efficient start-up of these facilities. Faster than
expected land disposal has resulted in a higher than expected project return
as measured by the IRR. Experience with the project suggests some lessons
for future estate development:
- Due to the absence of a formal development strategy addressing
issues such as occupancy priorities, modified project objectives
such as fast return of capital investment were introduced during
project implementation. Actual estate occupancy in terms of the
number and type of firms has consequently not fully born out
appraisal expectations and the estate area was generally sold to
large and solvent firms without due regard for smaller
enterprises. Future-estate development should be based on the
adoption of a sound development strategy and on specific estate
customer selection criteria.



- iv -
-  Design changes and modifications of the original concept such as
the substitution of a bonded warehouse for advance factory
buildings, have impeded project construction and affected the
viability of the estate, particularly the EPZ. Such changes,
if unavoidable, should be kept to a minimum; be based on proper
technical, financial and market analysis, and should be in line
with the development strategy.
-  In view of the not fully satisfactory occupation of the EPZ,
the future EPZ development program should be based on a
study which determines the role of such facilities in the
overall industrial development process in Thailand. Further-
more, the potential should be explored of a closer cooperation
between IEAT and the Thai Factory Development Co., Ltd., which
provides advance factory buildings particularly to small
enterprises.
- The employment of independent contractors for the various
construction components has increased the complexity of
work coordination and supervision. IEAT may wish to consider
the employment of one principal contractor for future estate
development who should be authorized, however, to enter into
subcontracting arrangements for components beyond his tech-
nical capabilities.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND - LAT KRABANK INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(LOAN 1492-TH)
A. Project History
1.01      Thailand's first industrial estate was established in the late
1960s at Bang Chan, 30 km east of Bangkok's city center, under the
auspices of the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Work. In
1970, the Bank began discussions with the Government on policy /1 and
institutional requirements for efficient industrial estate development in
Thailand. These discussions resulted in the creation in October 1973 of
IEAT,/2 which assumed administrative responsibility for the Bang Chan
estate. After consultation with the Bank, IEAT decided to construct a
second estate at Minburi, on the basis of a feasibility study prepared in
August 1974 with technical assistance provided by UNDP/UNIDO. The Bank
appraised the Minburi project in late 1974 but loan negotiations were
postponed due to difficulties in acquiring the proposed site. Eventually
another location at Lat Krabang was selected, 15 km south of Minburi and 35
km east of Bangkok. Since reappraisal in November 1976 confinned the
project's viability, the Bank approved on October 31, 1977 /3 a loan of
$4.75 million for the project.
B. The Environment
1.02      The past two decades were a period of unprecedented economic
development in Thailand, with growth rates of real GDP averaging 8.2 p.a.
during 1960-70 and 7.7% during 1970-79.   Industrial growth, spearheaded by
/1  Some form of policy dialogue was continued particularly during project
supervision and was aimed at persuading IEAT to develop a coherent
nationwide 5-year estate development program in cooperation with the
Government. This program has emerged and IEAT is currently discussing its
resource requirements with the Government and various financial and
international institutions.
/2  IEAT was established as an autonomous business-oriented government
agency, under power granted by Decree No. 339 of the National Executive
Council.
/3  The loan has a 20 years maturity, including 5 years of grace and
carries an interest rate of 7.9% p.a.

manufacturing, has averaged 11.6% and 10.4% during the same periods and a
significant industrial sector emerged in and around Bangkok. Private
investments, largely financed by domestic savings, averaged about 18% of GDP
and contributed to the high industrial growth rates.   The share of industry
in GDP rose from 13% in 1960 to 28.2% in 1979, with manufacturing accounting
for almost 20% of GDP.   In addition to the rapid modernization of the
production base, incremental employment between 1968-78 grew at nearly 10%
p.a. Manufacturing absorbed an increasing share (20%) of the increment to
the labor force. Manufactured exports increased annually by 44% in value
terms.  By the mid-1970s, however, the Thai economy started to face
increasing problems, compounded by the oil price increase and declining
terms of trade. To encourage the growth of domestic industries, the
Government has maintained high protection rates.   However, the Government is
making progress in developing a more rational tariff and incentive system in
the context of the Board of Investment (BOI) study,/1 and the Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL)./2
1.03      Geographical Concentration of Industry. Market forces have
resulted in the concentration of industry in Bangkok and the Central region,
which accounted for 84% (in terms of value added) of industrial production
in 1977. This has contributed to heavy migration from the countryside to
the metropolitan area with its associated problems of housing shortages,
environmental effects, traffic congestion and other diseconomies. Regional
cities generally appeared to lack the preconditions - including adequate
infrastructure - necessary for rapid development of medium and large indus-
tries and were rather suited for small industries with simple technologies
and less skilled manpower requirements. To promote decentralization of
industrial development and prevent further congestion in Bangkok, the Board
of Investment (BOI) developed an investment incentive scheme with a
locational component in 1973. A concept of growth centers was introduced,
delineating ten investment promotion zones (four from 1978 onward). This
incentive system, however, has not resulted in a major shift of investment
and Bangkok continued to account for a large share of total investment
approvals under the scheme./3   Generally, industrial development policies
have not contributed very much towards the process of industrialization in
the provinces. Investment promotion and protection policies have, until
recently, largely benefited import substitution industries which market their
produce mainly in Bangkok.

1.04      Industrial Estate Policy.   The Industrial Estate Authority of
Thailand was established in 1973 to provide industrial sites served with
the necessary infrastructure.   IEAT has developed its investment plan in
line with the fourth National Economic and Social Development Plan's (NESDP)
regional industry development objectives. IEAT's estate development plan,
however, did not materialize and was carried forward into the fifth NESD
plan period, which focusses on decentralized industrial development and on
reorienting the industrial sector towards export-oriented industries. As
a government agency, IEAT is expected to support these objectives and has
consequently redesigned its own five-year estate development program several
times to reflect the Government's varying regional priorities. It now
foresees the development of estates in the north and south of Thailand, in
Samut Sakorn and Laem Chabang (Eastern Seaboard) as well as an expansion
(third phase) of Lat Krabang. While the Lat Krabang estate does not support
a major shift in the regional location of industries, it does promote the
more rational development in the Bangkok area, alleviating problems of urban
congestion and polution. IEAT has not yet formulated an estate development
strategy despite urging by the Bank.   Such a strategy was expected to
outline IEAT's industrial development program for the next 5 years and
contain its development objectives, pertinent targets and necessary
interaction with the Government.
C. Project Description and Features
1.05      The project comprised the development of a 1,007 rai (162 ha)
industrial estate about 35 km east of Bangkok into industrial sites served
with roads, drainage, water, power and other basic infrastructure at an
estimated total cost of B 198 million. External infrastructure, such as
improvement of the access road to the estate and workers' housing, was also
included in the project. Developed sites were to be sold or leased to
entrepreneurs wishing to establish their own factories.    The project was
expected to accommodate up to 120 medium-size factories and an additional
20-30 small and medium enterprises in its standard factory buildings (SFBs).
About 120 rai (20 ha) of the estate area were earmarked for an export
processing zone (EPZ), intended as a pilot project to test the demand for
such facilities.  Technical assistance for project execution was provided
by UNIDO.
1.06      IEAT originally intended to develop the estate in two phases, to
minimize the risk of developing sites in excess of the immediate demand.
This approach was later abandoned, however, due to the emergence of brighter
market prospects for its estate sites (excluding the EPZ) during the initial
period of project development.   The various components of estate develop-
ment, which are shown in Annex 2, included the construction of a dike,
channels and a pumping station to prevent the project site from flooding.
The interlinking road network with a total length of more than 10 km, covers
slightly more than 14% of the estate area.   The Metropolitan Electricity
Authority (MEA) provides the estate with a 25 MW power line. All normal

effluents are treated in a waste treatment plant, while aggressive solvents
require pretreatment at plant level. Four wells with a capacity of 800 cu
m/h each and two storage tanks supply the estate with water.    IEAT's
original building plan foresaw the construction of an administration build-
ing (1,000 sq m), workshop (500 sq m), five standard factory buildings
(SFBs) of 2,160 sq m each to accommodate small and medium enterprises on a
rental basis and housing units (totalling 2,500 sq m) for IEAT staff. Four
of the five SFBs were planned for construction in the EPZ for which some 20
ha were delineated.   The Government undertook /1 to improve and surface
around 10 km of the access road to the estate 7T by end 1978 and also to
cause the National Housing Authority (NHA) to start with the construction of
housing units for estate workers in the vicinity of the estate. The issues
dealt with during project appraisal and agreed upon during negotiations are
listed in Annex 16.
D. Project Objectives, Benefits and Recommendations
1.07      The principal objective of the project was to assist the Govern-
ment's policy, designed to divert industrial development away from the
congested metropolitan area, by providing fully serviced industrial sites
outside of the Bangkok city limits. Estate development outside Bangkok, and
later on also in other parts of the country, was expected to contribute to a
better balanced distribution of industrial growth. A number of other objec-
tives were also quoted in the SAR without any specific order of priority.
By providing common waste treatment facilities, the project was designed as
the Government's first organized approach to industrial pollution control.
As a pilot project, it was expected to influence design and implementation
of future estate projects in other parts of the country. Moreover, it was
expected that readily available industrial sites would foster modern con-
cepts of plant and process engineering, reduce the intervals between project
conception and start-up operation and thus minimize delays and frictions in
project implementation. The inclusion of an export processing zone in the
project design was aimed at expanding and promoting export and import
substitution activities.   Finally, it was expected that national land use as
well as industrial and social infrastructure planning would be facilitated
in response to the guided concentration of industry. In this context the
Government undertook to support IEAT's estate development efforts by
establishing workers' housing and other social infrastructure in this area
through its National Housing Authority. The project was expected to achieve
these objectives within the framework of a commercially viable undertaking,
yielding FRRs of 18.1% and 11.5% in nominal and real terms, respectively.
The project also aimed at substantive institution building efforts as
indicated in the agreements reached during negotiations (Annex 16).

1.08      Project benefits were expect to coxnprise the generation of 12f)(Y
permanent jobs, the investment of around US$150 million in production
facilities, and the generation of an annual output of some US$200 million
(of which US$60 million in value added) by estate occupants. At the time of
appraisal it was expected that developed sites would be sold or leased in
the proportion of 80:20 to 120 medium size enterprises and that priority
would be given to labor-intensive projects which did not have the resources
to develop their own sites.
1.09      Several Executive Directors raised the following project-related
issues prior to the presentation of the Loan to the Board (under special
procedure): IEAT's poor financial showing during the initial operational
years cast some doubts on its ability to generate enough funds internally
to fully finance the project cost. In response, the financial loan cove-
nants were quoted which were introduced to ensure IEAT's sound financial
performance in the future on the basis of realistic and competitive prices
for its sites and services (see paras. 1.20-1.21).   Another question
focussed on the need for special incentives to attract labor-intensive
industries.  In response to this question, it was mentioned that estates
such as Lat Krabang normally tend to attract small and medium industries
with labor-intensive production programs. Moreover, IEAT's construction
program also foresaw the establishment of standard factory buildings (SFBs)
for small enterprises, while its guidelines were aimed at attracting
labor-intensive projects.   However, actual occupancy did not bear out these
expectations (see para. 1.17), and, in retrospect, the guidelines proved
ineffective.
F. Project Implementation
1.10      Contract Awards.   J.V. Consult, a consortium of consultants consis-
ting of four Thai engineering consultancy firms in association with an
US firm, was awarded the contract of designing the masterplan for the estate
and was also assigned responsibility for project supervision and final
inspection after work completion. Prior to this assignment, a group of
engineering consultants was selected, in concurrence with the Bank, for the
immediate construction of a dike /1 before the monsoon, to prevent a further
delay in the development of the estate.   In the course of its supervision
work, J.V. Consult proposed to modify and strengthen the dike to improve its
safety, but contested responsibility for subsequent slidings and settlements
that occurred. The matter was eventually settled in J.V. Consult's favor by
arbitration./2   Civil works and superstructure contracts were awarded in

compliance with Bank procedures. The various contractors and their
performances are shown in Annex 4.
1.11      Construction Progress.   The original project proposal foresaw
estate development in two almost equal phases, to keep capital investment in
line with demand for sites. Demand for Lat Krabang sites, however, exceeded
expectations even during the early stage of project development which caused
IEAT to abandon its two-phased development plan concept. The progress in
project implementation is summarized in the following table (see also Annex
2) and is also closely reflected by the disbursement schedule (Annex 1).

Although construction work was behind schedule during the entire development
period, completion of the project (with the exception of the telephone
system) was delayed by only four months, despite extensive master plan
adjustments to accommodate larger customers. Construction of the individual
estate customers' factory buildings began in late 1980. The design changes
and master plan adjustments are also reflected in the actual land use plan
in the following table.

1.13.     Implementation Related Problems.   Work progress during construction
was satisfactory, particularly in view of IEAT's limited experience in
estate development. Project completion was only delayed by about four
months, while actual construction cost exceeded the original forecast by
some 3%. Some mistakes were nevertheless made, particularly in the areas
of project management and coordination, notwithstanding J.V. Consult's
assignment as estate construction supervisor. During the estate development
phase, IEAT was faced with the following problems:
(a) weather conditions were unconducive during the early development
stage and resulted in frequent flooding of the estate area;
(b) the Government did not undertake access road improvement by end-
1978, as originally expected, in spite of special efforts by
IEAT and the Bank./l The construction delay eventually resulted
in substantial cost escalation /2 which led to further delay
due to budget constraints.   Work eventually commenced in
December 1980;
(c) shortage of cement, diesel and gasoline at various construction
stages as well as the oil crises;
(d) frequent design changes due to the reallocation of land plots
to accommodate large enterprises and also to make the estate
compatible with the anticipated expansion. These changes resulted
in the modification of the infrastructural layout and in
renegotiations with the contractors. In 1979, a Bank supervision
mission advised IEAT to refrain from future-revisions;/3
(e) IEAT did not replace its full-time estate supervisor upon his
resignation, but transferred his reponsibilities to the Director
of the Technical Department who could only take charge of this
function on a part-time basis due to his heavy responsibilities
for the other estates and the emergence of IEAT's 5-year develop-
ment program;
(f) Design changes and cost escalation resulted in contractor disputes
with IEAT and between the contractors themselves, particularly
towards the end of the construction phase. IEAT's Board of

Directors refused to authorize payment for work extension due to
design changes and temporarily suspended payments altogether. The
issue was eventually dealt with by the newly appointed Governor
and resolved after IEAT's Board was reconstituted.
F.  Institution Building
1.14      Bank discussions with the Government on institutional requirements
for efficient industrial estate development started in 1970 and resulted in
the creation of IEAT in October 1973.   From then on, the Bank was involved
in a continuous institution building process through its project identifica-
tion, preparation and appraisal work that eventually cristallized in an
action program, discussed and agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 16).
This program included, inter alia, the following measures: development of
rules governing the operation of estates; guidelines on industry suita-
bility; factory design standards; plan of action to improve IEAT's financial
and operational performance; development of standard lease contracts in
consultation with the Bank; and financial targets and ceilings (para. 1.19).
Progress in implementation of the agreed measures was followed up during
Bank supervision. During the development period of Lat Krabang, IEAT was
also assisted by several UNDP/UNIDO experts,/l including an industrial
estate management advisor whose term has been extended until December 1982.
In addition to a review of IEAT's procurement and disbursement procedures
and of the appointment of the Lat Krabang Project Manager, various issues
were dealt with during project supervision, such as slow budget allocations
and reduction of lowest bids by the Budget Bureau after the contracts had
been awarded. The Bank also introduced a quarterly reporting fonmat,
covering Lat Krabang's construction progress, audited financial statements,
sales progress and impact from firms locating in the estate (the latter did
not materialize).   IEAT was also reminded to abstain from frequent design
changes (SPN report of 7/3/79).   IEAT has, in the meantime, developed into a
mature and well managed organization whose staff is experienced enough to
manage the existing estates as well as plan and realize its 5-year invest-
ment program, comprising the development of several estates (para. 1.04).
G.  Project Operation
1.15      Operations-Related Issues.   Project appraisal was based on the
assumption that the availability of serviced factory sites and other infra-
structure such as housing, the major constraints for local and overseas

investors, would speed up industrial investment and reduce the time required
between investment approval and start-up operation./l It was also expected
that developed sites would be sold or leased in the proportion of 80:20 to
some 120/2 medium size enterprises. However, in the absence of a develop-
ment strategy /3 addressing, inter alia, issues such as occupancy priori-
ties, IEAT resorted to the practice of fast site disposal /4 and quick
returns, particularly in view of the Government's decision to discontinue
its financial contributions to IEAT (since 1981). The estate area was
generally sold to large and solvent firms without due regard for smaller
enterprises that are largely dependent on leasing and long-term hire-
purchase agreements for factory sites and SFBs. Estate occupancy did
consequently not conform to appraisal estimates, making it difficult to
achieve the socio-economic objectives envisaged during project appraisal.
The implications of this practice were repeatedly discussed with IEAT's
management (see also Bank's letter to IEAT in conjunction with SPN mission
of July 1981). Discussions at this late stage of the project cycle, however,
could not be expected to yield any tangible result regarding Lat Krabang's
occupancy problem. Any new estate construction, however, should to be based
on a satisfactory development concept manifested in a formal development
strategy.
1.16      Twenty-five firms /5 have absorbed the entire estate area except a
small portion of 37 rai, compared with 120 firms expected at the time of
project appraisal. About 62% of the estate area has been acquired by
5 large customers, one of which alone occupies 23% (116 rai)./6 Their
production programs are diversified and include diesel engines, stationery,
detergents, and instant food. Nine estate occupants have been in operation
/1 It appears doubtful that this objective has been achieved, since only
eight companies were operational and four under construction in early
1982; construction work on some of the sites has been delayed or not
yet started in spite of a provision in the contracts that construction
must commence within one year after the land is sold.
/2 This target was later reduced in the estate master plan to some 75 firms.
/3 The Bank has repeatedly tried to cause the adoption of such a policy.
/4 IEAT sold about 65% of the estate area during the first year of sales
operations.

since early 1982. The majority of the projects are new ventures, mostly
with some form of foreign capital participation. On the basis of IEAT's
inconclusive data, total actual capital investment by private entrepreneurs
is expected to reach some US$172 million compared with the appraisal
estimate of US$150 million and will further increase when more customers
have settled in the EPZ. Chemical and machinery projects make up about 50%
of all estate customers. In terms of the estate's total capital investment
and employment, the machinery industry accounts for 58% and 47%, the chemical
industry for 24% each, the textile industry for 12% each and the food
industry for 3.3% and 5% respectively. Wood processing (furniture, toys),
stationary and office equipment projects make up the remainder. Details on
capital structure, sale performance and value added of IEAT's clients were
not available to the mission.
1.17      Employment density does not bear out appraisal estimates.     All 25
estate customers are now expected to employ some 4,000 workers at full capa-
city production or 8 workers per rai under productive use./1 This constitutes
a substantial revision of the original target of 17 jobs per rai.     If the
estate including the EPZ is fully occupied, total employment is expected to
reach about 5,300 workers, compared with an estimated 12,000 workers at
appraisal,/2 and would result in an investment cost in infrastructure
(excluding land) of $1,545 per job.
1.18      EPZ Operation.   IEAT's EPZ was officially inaugurated in April
1982, soon after agreement had been reached with the customs department
regarding its operational procedures. In deviation from the original
project concept, the EPZ now covers 19% (previously 12%) of the total estate
area and includes two SFBs with a total area of 1,762 sq m, as compared with
an expected four SBFs with an area of 10,800 sq m. Only two customers /3
have so far been attracted which is far from adequate for an effective EPZ
operation. The sluggish demand for EPZ facilities appears to be attribu-
table to IEAT's inadequate promotional efforts, insufficient information on
estate benefits and incentives, particularly for potential foreign investors,
and lack of appropriate standard factory buildings (SFBs) for medium-size
foreign investors. Part of the funds, originally allocated for SFBs, was
reallocated, with the concurrence of the Bank, for the construction of a

bonded warehouse (BW)./1 This BW is located adjacent to the EPZ and was
intended to relieve the congested port facilities. It was expected to cater
for estate customers and firms in the surrounding area.   The decision to
construct a BW was not based on thorough and consistent project evaluation
and the prospects of turning it into a profitable operation did not appear
to be very bright at the PCR stage. IEAT reported in the PCR comments,
however, that the BW has now become operational with the "tendency of being
prosperous," catering for the Bang Chan estate as well as Lat Krabang.
H. Financial Analysis
1.19      IEAT's Overall Financial Performance and Position.   IEAT's actual
and projected financial statements are presented in Annexes 11-14. IEAT's
income performance was fully satisfactory /2 during 1978-81 and the Lat
Krabang operation had a substantial share in this development (during
1979-80). Cumulative profits for this period amounted to B 122.2 million
(US$6.1 million), notwithstanding a 2.5 fold increase of the company's
administrative expenses. In relative terms, however, administrative expenses
showed a decline from 6.4% of total assets to 4.4% due to IEAT's rapidly
expanding asset base (over 50% p.a.). Since IEAT was not required to pay
dividends, it could notably improve its capital base. Total net worth as of
September 30, 1981, amounted to B 289.8 million including B 179.7 million
government contributions. Net worth improvements and a modest debt burden
kept total debt/equity and long-term debt/equity ratios at low levels of
0.63:1 and 0.36:1 as of September 30, 1981. IEAT's profitable operations
during the past few years resulted in the accumulation of substantial cash
resources (B 124 million) which IEAT intends to use partly to finance its
5-year development program, for which an overall financial forecast has not
yet been prepared. To strengthen IEAT's financial structure and ensure
timely discharge of its debt service obligations, IEAT undertook during
negotiations to maintain a liquidity ratio of at least 1.25:1, a debt/equity
ratio of 65:35 (or 1.86:1) and a minimum debt service cover of 1.5 for the
entire repayment period of the loan (1983-97). IEAT actual ratios during
1978-81 so far remained well within the agreed limits. Whether IEAT will be
able to operate within these limits in the future cannot be assessed at this
time, owing to the very complex 5-year estate development program for which
a consolidated projection has not yet been prepared.
1.20      Projected and Actual Prices for Lat Krabang Sites and Services.
IEAT undertook to set prices for developed sites in line with two prin-
ciples: (i) to maintain competitiveness with off-estate alternatives;

/2 Profits accounted for 6.4% of fixed assets in 1978, 32.0% in 1979,
27.8% in 1980 and 13.1% in 1981.

and (ii) to ensure a minimum financial return of 10% on the investment in
the estate. Such a return is also in line with the Government's current
instruction to its agencies to be self-financing. Lack of information on
off-estate site prices did not allow a direct comparison with such options
and evaluation of Lat Krabang's competitiveness. However, a comparison with
private estate sites and other IEAT estate locations (Annex 4) indicates
that IEAT maintained competitiveness for its industrial sites at Lat Krabang.
Prices in Lat Krabang ranged from B 285,000 to B 315,000 per rai /1 in 1979,
depending on the location within the estate, and increased to between
B 390,000-430,000 in 1981. These prices do not substantially deviate from
the appraisal estimates of B 313,000 (1979) and B 379,000 (1981). IEAT
currently charges B 516,000 and B 800,000 per rai for EPZ and commercial
sites (for stores, etc.) and charges rental fees of B 76,800 per rai for EPZ
land and B 720 per sq m for space in the standard factory buildings./2
1.21      Financial Performance of the Lat Krabang Estate. Projected vs.
actual financial statements for the development and initial operational
periods of Lat Krabang are attached as Annexes 6 and 7. IEAT was faced with
small losses during the estate's initial development period (1977-78), until
sites were ready for sale from 1979 onwards. Due to the faster than anti-
cipated disposal of estate land at competitive prices, Lat Krabang's financial
performance improved dramatically in 1979 and. 1980. In spite of a small
loss in 1981, IEAT could accumulate profits of B 55.9 million as of
September 30, 1981 and retain them. To ensure financial viability, debt
service and the use of capital in the project in a productive way, a
covenant was incorporated into the Loan Agreement. It requires IEAT to
pursue a price policy which ensures at least a 10% return in real terms on
Lat Krabang's net fixed estate assets in operation. On an average annual
basis, IEAT has achieved this target since 1979, but was faced with wide
fluctuations on a year-by-year basis, reflecting the pattern of land sales.
In nominal terms, the annual rate averaged 15.6%.
1.22      Revised Forecast for Lat Krabang.   While the revised projections
for the years 1982-98 are given in Annexes 9 and 10, the underlying basic
assumptions (as provided by IEAT) are shown in Annex 8. Early land
disposal /3 and the conceptional changes have rendered the original forecast
/1 These prices relate to 3-year hire purchase contracts which carried
interest rates of 12% until 1980 and 15% from 1981 onward.
/2 Expenses for electric power and telephone are passed on according to
normal MEA and TOT charges; customers are billed B 1,800/rai/year for
maintenance and B 3.60/m3 for water.
/3 Encouraged by the lively demand for industrial sites,. IEAT's has
immediately ventured into an expansion of Lat Krabang (phase 2), for
which the costs have been separately accounted for.

obsolete and made a revision of IEAT's income projection necessary. The
revised version also incorporates the delay in full occupancy of the EPZ and
commercial facilities, not expected before 1985 and 1984, respectively.
After accelerated income generation and high profits during the first two
years of operation (1979/80), Lat Krabang slipped into the red in 1981, but
is expected to regain profitability by 1983, when gradually growing rental
income from the EPZ, SFBs and bonded warehouse compensate for the declining
sales. Head office expenses have been distributed between the various
estates on the basis of their respective estimated claims on IEAT's
management and administrative resources. Lat Krabang's share for 1982/83
has been assumed to be 40%,/1 declining to 10% during the 1988-98 period.
1.23      Recalculation of the Financial Rate of Return.   The revised inter-
nal financial rates of return (FRRs) were calculated on the basis of actual
capital expenditure, operating costs and revenues for the period 1978-81,
mainly reflecting changes in the project concept such as faster investment
cost recovery due to accelerated site disposal. Faster cost recovery during
the initial project stage has resulted in a substantially improved FRR.
Based on a 25-year project life, the revised FRR is estimated to be 19.7%
in current terms and 16.9% in constant terms /2 compared with appraisal
estimates of 18.1% and 11.5% respectively. The original ERR of 14% was
derived from the financial data, which were adjusted to reflect economic
values. Since the FRR is well above appraisal estimates, an increase in the
ERR is also indicated. However, recalculation in the context of this report
has not been attempted.
I. Summary and Conclusions
1.24      Estate development was fully satisfactory and project completion
was only delayed by a few months, despite several problems such as con-
tractor disputes and design changes during the construction period. Actual
construction cost exceeded appraisal estimates by some 3% only. Although
the project has contributed toward the dispersal and facilitation of
industrial development away from Bangkok's congested metropolitan area and
the generation of employment through the provision of serviced industrial
sites, its number and type of estate customers did not fully conform to
appraisal expectations, nor were employment targets reached due to IEAT's
deviation from the original project concept. An UNDP/UNIDO pollution
control specialist assisted IEAT in designing and operating the waste
/1 During 1978-81, Lat Krabang was charged with 40% of IEAT's head office
expenses.
/2 The GDP deflator has been used to express 1978-81 current costs and
revenues in 1982 prices, except investment costs. A 6% inflation
rate has been assumed for the projection period (see Annex 15).

treatment facilities in compliance with generally accepted standards and
regulations to ensure satisfactory environmental protection. Inadequate
promotion efforts and lack of appropriate standard factory space have
affected the occupation of the EPZ and the prospects for an efficient
start-up for these facilities. Faster than expected land disposal at
competitive prices in conjunction with IEAT's decision to abandon its
leasing policy has resulted in a higher than expected project return as
measured by the IRR.
1.25      Several lessons can be learned from the project:
- development of Lat Krabang on the basis of an acceptable
formal development strategy, which outlines IEAT's prin-
cipal objectives and targets, would have assisted in the
realization of the original project concept and its socio-
economic objectives. Such a strategy should guide future
estate development;
- employment of independent contractors for the various
construction components increased the complexity of work
coordination and supervision. For the development of future
estates, IEAT may wish to consider employing one principal
contractor, who would assume overall responsibility for the
estate construction work. Such a principal contractor
should, however, be given authority to enter into subcon-
tracting arrangements for those components beyond his
technical capabilities;
- a permanent estate manager supported by additional engineering
staff should be employed in situ during the entire construction
period to coordinate and facilitate work progress;
- while design changes during construction should be kept to
the technical necessary minimum, substantive adjustments in
the project concept, such as substituting the bonded
warehouse for SFBs, should be based on proper technical,
financial and market analysis. Changes in the character of
the the project, contrary to project concept and development
strategy, should be avoided;
- experience with the occupancy pattern of Lat Krabang calls for
the development of specific selection criteria that reflect
the objectives of the development strategy; they should be
abided by. Such criteria and other relevant industrial
information should be obtained from estate clients on the
basis of contractual reporting requirements and reviewed in
regular intervals to evaluate estate progress;



- 16 -
- future EPZ development should be based on a study which identi-
fies the role of such facilities in the overall industrial
development process in Thailand. Proper promotion policies
should also be developed, which outline the benefits and
incentives particularly for potential foreign EPZ investors;
and
-   for its future estate development program, IEAT may wish to
explore the potential and benefits of a closer cooperation with
the Thai Factory Development Co., Ltd. to provide advance
factory buildings particularly for medium and small enterprises.
1.26      The Role of the Borrower.   The borrower's performance related to the
construction of the estate was satisfactory and Bank recommendations at the
time of project appraisal and supervision where generally accepted. Due to
the absence of a development strategy, however, policy priorities and
selection of estate occupants do not fully bear out appraisal expectations.
1.27      The Role of the Bank.   After appraisal, the responsibility for the
project was transferred in 1978 from the Industrial Projects Department to the
IDF Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office. Before the project was conceptualized, the Bank pursued a dialogue
with the Thai Government on policy and institutional requirements for
industrial estate development. This dialogue eventually resulted in the
creation of IEAT which was actively assisted by the Bank, particularly during
the initial phases of identification, designing and development of the Lat
Krabang project. The Bank's institution building efforts were particularly
aimed at assisting IEAT in the development and introduction of sound
operating procedures, financial standards and prudence limits and price
calculation guidelines. These efforts were continued during the project
supervision phase, contributing to the satisfactory development of Lat
Krabang, notwithstanding several frictions and mistakes made during its
construction period. In the course of its supervision work, the Bank also
encouraged IEAT to substitute its project-by-project approach of estate
development for a more coherent five-year development program. Although the
Bank was less successful in persuading IEAT to introduce a formal development
strategy for Lat Krabang, such a strategy should nevertheless guide IEAT's
future estate development. IEAT has, in the meantime, developed into a mature
institution and the Bank's institution building efforts have contributed to
this process.
