APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report analyzes a project to establish an industrial estate
at Lat Krabang, 35 kms east of Bangkok, on 1,007 rai (162 ha) of former rice
paddy land at an estimated cost of Bht 198 million (US$9.9 million). When
completed in 1980, the project will provide fully serviced industrial sites
for some 120 medium-scale factories employing up to 12,000 workers and stan-
dard factory buildings suitable for subdividing and rental to between 20 and
30 small and medium-scale industries.
ii.       Industry in Thailand has grown rapidly in the 1960s and '70s,
acting as the leading economic sector during most of that period. An equal
or better performance is needed in the future to complement the labor absorp-
tive capacity of the agricultural sector which is approaching saturation.
Thailand has a large and varied natural resource base. Its products are
competitive on the international market and export earnings have increased
more rapidly than import costs, despite Thailand's dependence on imported oil
for the major share of its energy requirements. Since 1972, manufacturing
investment has shifted emphasis from import substitution to export and this
trend is expected to continue. Although manufacturing growth and investment
during the 1977-1980 period may decline from the peak rates experienced in
1973/74, it is expected to be comparable to the sustained high levels of the
1960s. Therein lies one of the basic justifications for the project at this
time. Industrial estates are needed to respond effectively and economically
to the anticipated demand for factory sites and services; at the same time, by
facilitating a more rapid and less costly factory planning and construction
cycle, industrial investment is further stimulated.
iii.      The majority of new factories will continue to gravitate to the
greater Bangkok area as in the past and the project analyzed in this report,
as well as others to be initiated over the near-term, is designed to attract
industry away from the congested center of Bangkok to outlying sites zoned
and prepared for industrial use. In a later phase of the long-term national
industrial estate development plan, sites and services for industry will be
established in the Northern, Northeastern and Southern regions of Thailand
to help disperse industry more evenly throughout the nation.
iv.       Thailand's first industrial estate was established in the late
1960s at Bang Chan, under the management of the Department of Industrial
Works, Ministry of Industry. Based in part on the Bank's recommendations
as well as on the experience accumulating at this first estate, the creation
of an autonomous business-oriented Government agency to develop and manage
a planned national program became the first goal in the early 1970's. In
October 1973, the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) inaugurated



- ii -
operations under a decree of the National Executive Council. After prelimi-
nary studies, Minburi was selected as the highest priority location for
Thailend's second Government-sponsored industrial estate and, with UNIDO
technical assistance, a feasibility study was completed in August 1974 and
appraised by the Bank in late 1974. However, IEAT experienced difficulties in
acqulring the proposed site and another plot, located at Lat Krabang, some 15
km south of Minburi was acquired in late 1976.  This reappraisal confirms the
essential soundness of the project at the new location.
V.       -ihe project consists of the acquis'ilion of land and its development
imnr sutStable industrial sites by the construction of dikes to control flood-
ing, and the provision of power, water, telephones, sewage treatment and other
facilities. About 12% of the area will be allocated to an Export Processing
Zone (EMZ to test the demand for such facilities by national and interna-
tional firms producing entirely or primarily for the export market.  Stan-
dard factory buildings will be constructed for sub-division and rental to
SDall- and medium-scale industries. Technical assistance will be provided
to strengthen IEAT's management, planning and project execution capabilities
not only for this project but also for the long-range national program of
industrial estate and EPZ development.
vi.       Financing required for the project amounts to US$9.9 million equiv-
alent (Bht 198 million) and consists of: (i) equity of Bht 103 million
(US$5.2 million) to be provided partly by a national treasury commitment of
izh 77.,4 million (US$3.9 million) and partly through internal cash generation
0, Mt 25.7 million (US$1.3 million) from the sale of estate land; and (ii)
lon$-term debt of US$4.75 million equivalent from the Bank. The Bank loan,
corr esio:nding to 48% of total project investment, would be made directly to
!EAT for 20 years including 5 years grace at 7.9% interest and would finance
lanzd development, standard factory buildings and technical assistance.
Direct and indirect foreign exchange (FE) costs are estimated at approximately
46% o3f project cost, or US$4.6 million, so that the Bank loan would cover 100%
of the FE component plus $150.000 equivalent of LC costs.
viio      Based on the planned construction schedule, the estimated prices
£sr lend sales and factory rentals and the forecasted rates of occupancy, the
ff.nancial return in real terms over 25 years is 11.5% and the economic rate of
return 14%. Land sale prices and factory rentals will be based on the two
principles: (i) maintaining competitiveness with off-estate alternatives; and
'-i) insuring a minimum 10% financial return in real terms on the estate
investment. Prices will be reviewed annually and revised, if considered
necessary, in consultation with the Bank. Among the benefits to be generated
'y the project by the early 1980s, are the estimated 12,000 permanent factory
jobs plus 1,500 temporary construction jobs (between 1977 and 1980), investment
oS about US$150 million in productive facilities generating gross output of
some US$200 million and added value of US$60 million per annum, all in current
terms. The Export Processing Zone will contribute to increased export earnings
but there is no way of quantifying this factor in advance, even as a rough
estimate. In order to further stimulate employment creation, IEAT will,
wherever feasible, give priority for estate occupancy to firms whose operations



- iii -
are labor-intensive. The project will contribute to the dispersion of industry
away from the congestion of Bangkok's core and, as Government's first organized
attempt to control industrial pollution by providing adequate common waste
treatment facilities, will serve as a model for all future projects in this
respect. Finally, the growing concentration of industrial activity at Lat
Krabang/Bang Chan justifies a major workers' housing project in the area and
the eventual creation of a planned satellite new-town complete with all social
infrastructure needed to enhance the quality of life for an estimated local
population of up to 100,000.
viii.     On the basis of the agreements reached and summarized in this
report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$4.75 million on the
terms indicated in para. vi.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Thailand's first industrial estate was established in the late
1960's at Bang Chan, 30 kms east of Bangkok, under the management of the
Department of industrial Works, Ministry of Industry. It was the first
project cf a long range program to construct industrial estates and export
processing zones designed to provide needed sites and services for industry
a-way from the congested center of Bangkok in a first phase and additional
facilities at more distant regional locations in a second phase.
1.02      Since 1970, the Bank has been cooperating with the Thai Government
in analyzing policy and institutional instruments needed in support of effi-
cient industrial estate development.  Based in part on the Bank's recommenda-
tions as well as on the experience gained at Bang Chan, the creation of an
autonomous business-oriented Government agency to manage the planned national
program became the first goal and in October 1973 the Industrial Estate
Authority of Thailand (IEAT) was set up under powers granted by Decree No. 339
of the National Executive Council. Shortly thereafter, in consultation with
the Bank, it was concluded that construction of a second estate at Minburi,
some 5 kms east of Bang Chan, was one of the higher priorities of the several
alternative estate projects under consideration. With UNDP/UNIDO technical
assistance, IEAT completed a feasibility study of the estate project in
August 1974 and a Bank mission led by Mr. C. Goderez of the Industrit.l Pro-
jects Department appraised the project in late 1974. However IEAT was not
able to acquire the proposed site and another plot, located at Lat Krabang
some 15 km south of Minburi, was acquired in 1976. The project was reap-
praised in November 1976 by a mission consisting of Messrs. E. Siou and J.
Kuroda also of the Industrial Projects Department.
II. THE THAI SETTING
A.   General
2.01      With a total land area of 514,000 sq. kms. and a population of
over 40 million, Thailand is the largest, and economically one of the most
important, countries in the Indochina peninsula. Industry is the second
largest segment of the economy after agriculture with a 26% contribution to
GDP, employing about 6% of the estimated total labor force and accounting for
a 22% share of total merchandise exports in 1975 (Annex 1).
2.02      Thailand had been less vulnerable than many other developing coun-
tries to world economic fluctuations in the 1960's. Earnings from its
principal export commodities -- rice, rubber, maize, tin, tapioka, kenaf, teak
and tobacco -- have been stable and substantial (Annex 2). Between 1972 and
1975, however, the country's terms of trade deteriorated, as shown in Annex 3,
mainly due to the oil price hike in 1973/74 and some decline in export prices
in 1975. Given this situation, the Government recognizes the need to stimulate
the expansion and diversification of exports.



2-
2.03      With a population growth rate of 3.1%, which ranks among the highest
in the world, the annital Increment to the labor force is expected to grow
from some 450,000 at present to around 650,000 by 1985. As the availability
of virgin land suitable for cultivation will progressively be exhausted during
the remainder of this decade, agriculture will have difficulty in absorbing as
many new workers as it has done previously, and new employment opportunities
will have to be ereated increasingly in the non-agricultural sectors.
3.   The Industrial Sa,ctor - Structure, Performance and Growth Prospects
2.04      In its current stage of development, Thailand's industrial produc-
tion is characterized by a heavy bias in favor of consumer goods such as food
processing, textiles5 tobacco and footwear. According to Ministry of Industry
statistics for 1975, of some 45,000 registered manufacturing enterprises, about
32,000 (73%) produced consumer goods, about 6,700 (15%) produced capital
goods, and about 5,30) (12%) intermediate goods (Annex 4). Manufacturing
industry as a whole aichieved an annual growth of 12.4% in the decade 1960-69
and 18.2% in the years 1970-76 at current market prices (Annex 5).
2.05      Because of market concentration, proximity to the Government adminis-
trative center, superior infrastructure, easy access to imports and inter-
industry linkages, most industries, especially the larger modern plants,
have located in and around Bangkok (Annex 6). The Central Region (including
Bangkok) generates approximately 80% of total value-added in manufacturing and
absorbs some 60% of the manufacturing work force.
2.06      Incremental value added in manufacturing averaged 11% per year in
real terms through the 1960s, and although the rate of increase slowed to
about 7% in the early seventies, it still exceeded that of the economy as a
whole. As shown in Annex 5, this growth was largely due to the expansion of:
(i) intermediate goods industries such as paper, leather and rubber products,
chemicals and refined petroleum products, and the processing of nonmetallic
minerals; (ii) new dtrable consumer goods industries, including the assembly
of radio and television sets, motor vehicles, and electrical appliances; (iii)
the textile and beverage industries; and (iv) capital goods industries,
including basic metal and metal products.
2.07      Since 1973, a shift in emphasis from import substitution towards
export oriented manufacture has indeed become noticeable. For some industries
e.g., cement, textiles, garments, furniture, plywood and metal products, this
trend has been accelerated because they have gained both markets and interna-
tional competitiveness through increases in world demand and international
prices while domestic prices have remained relatively stable. Although world
economic dislocationE in 1974 and 1975 reduced the export demand for some of
these products, manufacturing exports as a whole continued to increase.
The value of manufactured exports was US$39 million in 1970, US$280 million
in 1973 and US$494 million in 1975; and their shares in the total merchandise
exports of the country was 5.2%, 17.2% and 20.3% respectively (Annex 7).



-3-
2.08      In the early seventies, capacity utilization improved steadily
(Annex 8), and this in turn stimulated capital investment in new facilities.
One indicator of the investment trend is the number of promotion certificates
granted by the Board of Investment (BOI) to industrial projects 1/, summarized
below from Annex 9:
Promoted Industrial Investment 1971-1976
Applications      Prom. Cert. Issued      Indicated Investment
(No.'s)             (No.'s)                (Bht Million)
1971            103                   59                      1,496
1972           180                    70                      4,005
1973           552                   115                      7,773
1974           228                   251                     18,021
1975           111                    86                      4,633
1976 (9 months) 88                    47                      1,384
The sharp increase in applications in 1973 reflected the remarkable indus-
trial buoyancy of the early 1970s, and the number of promotion certificates
issued in 1974 resulted from this peak. However, the number of applications
and the number of approvals have decreased thereafter, reflecting in part the
political instability prevailing within the country which discouraged both
domestic and foreign investors.  A rising trend in industrial investment is
expected to take place under the current improved domestic and international
situations.  A recent Bank study 2/ projected the overall economic growth rate
for Thailand over the Fourth Economic and Social Development Plan period
(1977-81) at 6.2% p.a., and industrial sector growth at 9.4% p.a. provided
that a suitable climate for private investment is maintained and demand for
manufactured exports grows as in the past. The study projects gross capital
investment in 1981 of the order of Bht 94 billion at 1962 constant prices,
which implies a doubling of the Bht 42 billion of investments which took place
in 1975.
C. Government Policy and Investment Incentives
2.09      After the political instability of the previous three years, the
newly established Government (October 1976) is firmly committed to helping
1/   Promotion certificates designate the industrial projects granted incen-
tives by BOI under terms of the Investment Promotion Act of 1972; details
of this Act are given in para 2.09 and Annex 10. Since 1971, according
to BOI statistics, about 60% of total manufacturing investment has been
granted "promoted" status and benefits; the balance consists of "other" or
"non-promoted" projects.

restore investors' confidence and accelerate growth.  As detailed in Annex 10,
under the Investment Promotion Act of 1972, BOI is empowered to grant invest-
ment guarantees and incentives. In selecting investments for promotion, BOI
takes into account the country's general development objectives, including
regional development, export growth, employment creation, skill upgrading and
encouragement of Thai participation with foreign capital in joint ventures.
BOI provides two kinds of incentives: (i) standard investment incentives
consist of guarantees against nationalization and competition by new state
enterprises; authorizations to own land, to transfer funds abroad, and to
hire foreign experts; tax reductions or exemptions from import duties and
business taxes on machinery and equipment, and exemption from corporate in-
come tax; and (ii) special promotional incentives relate to the geographic dis-
persal of investments and export oriented industries which include reduction
of import duties and business taxes, accelerated depreciation and reduction
of corporate income tax after expiration of standard income tax holiday.
D. Foreign Investment
2.10      Foreign direct investment has made substantial contributions to
the Thai economy, especially in textiles, metal products, transport equipment
and chemicals. Joint ventures of Thai and foreign partners accounted for 69%
of the registered capital (Bht 13,900 million or US$695 million) of all
enterprises which obtained promotional privileges between October 1960 and
September 1976, with foreign investors providing about 41% of the joint
venture capital (Annex 11). Japan is by far the principal source of Thailand's
foreign direct investment, followed by the U.S., the Republic of China, Hong
Kong and the U.K.
2.11      Prior to the enactment of the Alien Business Act in November 1972,
foreign investors were allowed to engage in any business activity in Thailand.
As detailed in Annex 12, this Act imposed restrictions on foreign investment in
some activities, e.g. rice farming, domestic trade in agricultural products,
construction and several service professions. Existing foreign firms engaged
in other agricultural production, light industry, handicrafts, most retail
trades, domestic transportation and heavy industry and mining are permitted to
continue operations, but are not allowed to increase their annual production or
sales by more than 30% over their 1972 level. Enterprises granted privileges
under the Investment Promotion Act, however, are exempted from this restric-
tion. Another law, the Alien Occupation Act, which reserves to Thai nationals
certain occupations including accounting, was approved in December 1972 but
has not been administered rigidly and, presumably, will continue to be admin-
istered reasonably under the present Government policy in favor of attracting
foreign investment.
E.  Pagrams for Regional Development and Industrial Estates
2.12      'he Government has been trying to disperse industries to the various
regions of the countrv through administrative decentralization, land reform
and establishment of trowth poles in the Northeast, the North, the East and



-5-
Lhe vouth (Annex 13).  However, regional development is still in its early
stage and, over the short- to medium-term, it is expected that investment
will gravitate, as in the past, mainly to the Bangkok area. A feasible
fra3? phase solution is to guide industry away from the congested urban
ca-nter to the rural periphery of the Greater Bangkok area. This will re-
quire a firmly administered land use plan (Annex 14), and the provision of
nrepared sites and services, housing and other facilities as incentives to
attract both industry and its work force to the outer locations. Although
the official land use plan under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1973,
has been approved by both the Cabinet and the National Assembly, its enforce-
ment in the Bangkok urban area has not as yet been very effective. During
negotiations, however, IEAT submitted satisfactory evidence of steps taken
under the Cabinet Resolution on Industrial Zoning of August 10, 1976 to
enforce more effectively the relocation of industry outside the congested
center of Bangkok.
2.13      Industrial estates not only contribute to more rapid industrializa-
tion but help maintain a balance between industrial growth and the planning
and implementation of infrastructure. By concentrating a number of firms in
one prepared area, as opposed to haphazard locational decisions by individual
investors, they can provide both offsite (external) and on-site (internal)
infrastructure more efficiently and at less cost. The Lat Krabang Industrial
Estate project will also include an area designated as an Export Processing
Zone (EPZ). This EPZ will be physically similar in all respects to the
general industrial estate. It will, however, be fenced and controlled by the
customs authorities so that the export-oriented industries located within the
EPZ will enjoy easy tariff-free entry of raw and intermediate materials and
reexport of finished products.
2.1.4     The project has been located in keeping with the zoning objectives
of the Bangkok Master Plan and is the first of several proposals under study
by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) for the greater Bangkok
area. These proposals are part of a long range plan which will include the
establishment of industrial estates in the Northern and Northeastern regions
as well as in the Bangkok area (Annex 15), as specified in the Fourth Five-
Year Plan (1977-81) published in January, 1977.
III. MARKET
A. Comparative Advantages of the Greater Bangkok Area
3.01      As already noted, it is likely that most new manufacturing facili-
ties will continue to be attracted to the Bangkok area for some years to come.
Bangkok is the capital and Government administrative center as well as the
country's major port and its financial and commercial center. Its concen-
tration of population (4.3 million) and relative wealth provide the largest



- 6 -
market for goods and labor inL Thailand.  Physical infrastructure, while
deficient in many respects, is superior to that available in other parts
of the country.
B. Demand fcr Industrial Land - Greater Bangkok Area
3.02      Growth of manufacturing investment in Thailand has been projected to
i981 by Bank staff (Annex 16). Assuming conservatively that 65% of all new
organized manufacturing investment will take place in the Greater Bangkok
area, demand for industrial land has been estimated, using historical data on
capital investment/land ratios obtained from BOI, as detailed in Annex 16.
According to this analysis, between 1977 and 1981 effective demand for
industrial sites in and near Bangkok is forecast to total 890 ha. The Lat
Krabang project will provide some 116 ha of land for sale/lease.during this
period, or only 13% of forecasted total demand.
C. Availability of industrial Land - Greater Bangkok Area
3.03      The Bangkok Master Plan defines areas encompassing a total of
9,655 ha reserved for industry in the municipality and the surrounding chang-
wats (provinces). At the end of 1976, about half of this land was already
occupied by industry. The table below summarizes land availability, including
existing industrial zones and planned estates, from the detailed tabulation of
Annex 17. It will be noted that only 470 ha of the 4,850 ha available are
intended to be developed as planned industrial estates.

3.04      An evaluation of these various sites, using as criteria their
size, physical characteristics, ease of access to the port and airport,
availability of labor, utilities and transportation and cost of develop-
ment, suggests that while the Lat Krabang estate does not achieve the highest
rating in every criterion taken individually, its characteristics overall
place it at or very close to the top of the list. Proximity and good access
to the seaport, airport and railway, and the absence of local urban congestion
are among its most attractive features.
D. Prospects for the Lat Krabang Industrial Estate
3.05      Many factors affect investors in selecting suitable locations for
factories.  The price and terms of sale of developed industria  estate land
are important considerations in comparison with the alternati"v costs of
acquiring raw land individually and then bearing all development expenditures.
Assuming competitive pricing, foreign investors are likely to favor an
industrial estate on account of the complex and difficult procedures for
acquiring land from private smallholders, and this bias has been set at 65%
for purposes of forecasting demand. 1/ Fully Thai-owned industries might be
relatively less biased in favor of estate sites, partly on account of local
land ownership interest, and the "capture ratio" for this class of enterprise
has been set at 50%. Using BOI data on past investments and land requirements
.for different categories of industry, the demand for estate land is projected
as follows:

1/   The history of a similar Bank supported project in Indonesia indicates
that a 65% "capture ratio" is conservative. Among medium-scale fac-
tories, it is higher; only very large factories tend to favor independent
locations.



-8-
The projected demand for 490 ha of estate sites exceeds by 58% the total
planned availability of estate sites which (as noted in para. 3.03) is esti-
mated at 309 ha by 1981. Not all of the planned estate construction will in
fact be completed by 1981, so that demand is likely to exceed supply by a
larger margin than here indicated.
3.06      The projected sale/lease of the Lat Krabang estate land is only
about 36 ha in 1979, 26 ha in 1980, 27 ha in 1981 and 27 ha in 1982-1983 for
a total of 116 ha. In 1981, the land sold/leased by the project will be 89 ha,
which is only 18% of the demand and 29% of the planned supply. As shown in
Annex 18, compared with the land sale prices set for the Nava Nakorn estate,
which is being privately developed, the sale/lease prices projected for the
Lat Krabang estate are conservative. The demand for space in the EPZ, for
which 20 ha have been allocated in the project site (about 12% of the plot),
is expected to be substantial, although an accurate demand forecast for the
EPZ cannot be made with presently available data. The historical rate of
growth in Southeast Asia of manufactured exports incorporating imported
components suggests that the EPZ will not face substantial difficulty in
disposing of its sites. Given Thailand's comparative advantages such as low
labor cost, geographic location and Government incentives, readily available
factory space at reasonable cost will provide an additional attraction to
industries of the types operating in Singapore, Malaysia, Hongkong, Taiwan and
Korea. This conclusion is supported by the interest that 19 firms have
already shown in occupying land within the EPZ at Lat Krabang.
E. Industries Expected on the Lat Krabang Industrial Estate
3.07      The estate will be open to industries of all types with the excep-
tion of those with very heavy pollutive activities, which cannot be handled
by the planned treatment facilities on the estate. It is expected, however,
that the occupancy pattern will be heavily biased towards medium-scale, rela-
tively clean factories, engaged in light manufacturing activities, as has
already occured at Bang Chan. Consumer goods industries (such as textiles,
furniture, electrical appliances, toys, shoe-manufacturing and leather prod-
ucts) are expected to be well represented; also intermediate goods (packag-
ing materials, electrical and electronic components), construction materials,
light metal-working and some chemical processing industries. The EPZ would
accommodate assembly type industries (e.g., textiles, electronics, watch
making) based on imported raw and intermediate materials.
IV, INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AUTHORITY OF THAILAND (IEAT)
4.01      IEAT, the executing agency for the project, is an autonomous gov-
ernment institution created under National Executive Council Decree No. 339,
promulgated December 13, 1972 (Annex 19), and responsible for planning and
executing all Government supported industrial estates and EPZs in Thailand.
Operations were initiated in October 1973 when the Bang Chan Estate was
turned over to IEAT by the Department of Industrial Works. Organizationally,



-9 ..
a governi. 3Board. appointed by the Cabinet is responsible for policy and
overal'L su..E-:3ion while operating management is headed by a Director General,
who i:s also ex,-officio member of the Board.  Functionally, there are five
departmnenrs: (i) Office of the Director General - responsible for policy
planning and overall control of operations, (ii) Technical and Projects -
p7eparatio-n of new projects, (iii) Operations-construction and management of
-ndustrlal estates and EPZs, (iv) Finance, and (v) Administration.
4.02      Details of IEAT's history, organization, operations and Board
composition are given in Annex 20 which also contains the Authority's finan-
cial history, briefly summarized below:

4.03      Revenues covered less than half of the expenses (including provision
for depreciation) in 1975, and the deficit became even larger in 1976. This is
primarily the result of two factors: (i) all land at Bang Chan had been
leased at low uneconomic rates by the former owner, the Department of In-
dustrial Works (Annex 21); and (ii) the full administrative costs of IEAT
have so far been charged to the Bang Chan estate, its sole existing operation,
even though most of these costs are connected with planning and development of
new projects. Deficits are covered by national budget appropriations and this
situation will of necessity continue until future estate operations begin to
generate sufficient income to close the gap. Nevertheless, measures should be
taken to bring central office expenses more in line with operating require-
ments. The number of headquarters staff could be reduced from the current
level of 95 without detriment either to Bang Chan or the overall operations
of IEAT. IEAT has agreed to undertake measures to improve its financial per-
formance both at headquarters and at Bang Chan and will to this end present
to the Bank by December 31, 1977 a suitable plan of action. Possible measures
to be considered would include; (i) adjusting contracts at Bang Chan to charge
more economic rates for rentals and all services provided to estates' occupants,
(ii) charging more economic fees to private estates and other organizations



for services rendered to then and (il.) reduction of headquarters staff by
redeployment of some of the existing personnel to the Lat Krabang project.
4.04      Although IEAT has gained experience in estate planning and opera-
.ions since its :Vintion in Octob*tr 1973, technical assistance will be
required to strengthan its management, engineering and commercial skills.  To
this end, a technical assistance component has been included in the project as
outllned in the next chapter.
V. T"HE PROJECT
A.     ie tS   -e
5.01      The project consists of:  (i) the acquisition by IEAT, the estate
omner, ef 1,007 rai (162 ha) of raw land at Lat Krabang, 35 kms. east of
Bangkok; (ii) development of serviced industrial sites suitable for some 120
medium-scale factories to be built by their owners; (iii) the construction of
standard factory buildings for rental to between 20 and 30 small- and medium-
scale industries; and (iv) establishment of an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) on
I20 ral (20 ha) of the land. Additionally, technical assistance will be
.provided to IEAT by both UNIDO and IBRD for purposes of project execution and
also to assist in planning future projects. More specifically, the components
O :` th.e project are:
si) Acquisition of 1,007 rai (162 ha) of raw land at Lat Krabang.
(2)  Land. fill and dike construction.
{3)  Construction of about 10 kms of- internal roads and a surface drain-
age system.
'4)  Installation of an internal power and street lighting distribution
system connecting with an external 25 MW substation.
(5)  Installation of a water supply and distribution system, including
fire hydrants.
(6)  Installation of sewage disposal and waste treatment facilities.
'7)  Installation of a radio telephone system connected to an automatic
branch exchange with a minimum of 200 lines.
(8)  Construction of an administration building and a maintenance work-
shop.
(9)  Construction of five standard factory buildings of 2,160 m2 each,
of which four will be located within the Export Processing Zone.
(10)  Construction of 2,500 m  of housing for IEAT staff.
(11) Engineering/Architectural Services and Technical Assistance.



5.02       The project will be carried out in two contract phases covering a
four-year period with approximately half of the development taking place
during 1977-79 and the other half during 1979-80.
B. Detailed Features
5.03       The essential features of the project are discussed below:
additional details are given in Annex 22.
1. Site Location, Characteristics and Acquisition
5.04       The 1,007 rai site (Map IBRD 11324R) has already been purchased for
Bht 25 million (US$1.25 million) 1/, a price that is reasonable and competi-
tive with other locations in the Greater Bangkok area. The site is served by
two main highways, providing easy access to the city and harbour of Bangkok
and is 38 kms northeast of Bangsue Railway Station connecting to the North
and Northeast of the country and 40 kms southeast of the international
airport. The size of the estate is to some extent arbitrary, but does re-
present a reasonable compromise between the forecasted demand, which could
justify a larger project, and financial and technical limitations of IEAT,
which dictate a cautious step-by-step approach toward larger and more complex
projects. The shortest route from the estate to Bangkok harbor (30 km) is
along the Pharakhanong-Lat Krabang road, of which about 10 km need resurfacing.
IEAT has requested the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority to accelerate the re-
surfacing and widening program (already under way) so that work will be com-
pleted by end-1978 and expects there will be no difficulty in meeting this
schedule.
5.05       As a direct result of the Bang Chan estate project, located 15 kms
north of Lat Krabang, where the 700 rai developed in 1968-1971 were fully
leased by late-1974, flinburi has become an industrial "growth pole" with
infrastructure (roads, power and telecommunications) available for a greatly
expanded industrial community. Labor will be drawn from both Bangkok, by bus
and canal transport, and the adjacent rural area including the town of Minburi
(estimated population - 20,000). Workers' housing and other social infra-
structure are planned for construction by the National Housing Authority (NHA)
on Huamak Housing Estate situated some 6 km from the estate site. Satis-
factory evidence has been submitted confirming that NHA is accelerating
planned housing development at Huamak as well as at Bang Chan.
2. Site Development
5.06       Land Fill and Dike Construction;  In the vicinity of Bangkok,
developing paddy land into industrial sites requires either raising the
average level of terrain by up to 1.5 meters (adding fill, compacting and
1/   Land was purchased from several land owners who made arrangements with
the tenant farmers occupying the land to vacate the premises by mid-March
1977. This was accomplished without difficulty and perimeter dike
construction was started shortly thereafter.



- 12 -
levelling) or the less costly alternative of building dikes (bunds) around the
boundary and installing pumps for removal of sewage and excess rainfall. IEAT
has opted for the second alternative. Pending completion of the topographic
study and engineering design of flood control measures it has been assumed for
purposes of financial analysis that bunding along the estate boundaries will
average 1.75 m in height after compaction. only a small amount of land fill
will be needed in a few selected areas.
5.07      Roads and Surface Drainage:  The preliminary plot plan of the
feasibility study (Map IBRD 16973) shows 10.2 kms of macadamized road aver-
aging 8.5 m wide laid out in a rectangular pattern providing access to every
factory plot. Detailed layout and specifications together with those for the
surface drainage system, which will consist of channels and culverts parallel-
ing the roads, are to be prepared as part of the detailed engineering design.
Meanwhile, for purposes of cost estimation, standard macadamized roads built
by the Department of Highways (DH) have been assumed.
5.08      Power:  The maximum power demand at full occupancy has been estima-
ted at 25 MW and will be drawn from a 22-kv high tension transmission line
running close to the estate. A 25 MW transformer substation has been installed
by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) about 5 km west of the project
which will connect with an internal overhead distribution network for power
and street lighting. The internal distribution network will also be built by
MEA but its cost will be advanced by IEAT and repaid by MEA in early eighties.
5.09      Water:  Water demand at full oc5upancy for all industrial and
sanitary3purposes is estimated at 6,000 m /day average with peak loads of
10,000 m /day and will be supplied by four deep wells tapping a known aquifer
at a depth of 150 to 200 meters. Based on the water flow realized from the
same iquifer at Bang Chan, the four wells are expected to yilld a minimum of
800 m /hr which, with two ground le3el reservoirs of 5,000 m capacity and
two overhead storage tanks of 300 m' capacity each are adequate to supply the
average and peak demands foreseen. The water storage system also ensures a
reserve at all times for fire fighting purposes.
5.10      Sewage Disposal and Other Environmental Considerations:  A central
liquid waste treatment plant is planned as part of the estate infrastructure
to handle all normal industrial and sanitary waste effluents. Aggressive
wastes such as acid, alkali, oils or solvents will be required to go through
pre-treatment at the factory point of origin before entering the collection
system. The investment in the central treatment plant will be self-liquidat-
ing as its capital cost will be recovered in the sale price/lease rent of
land, and a separate charge will be made for operating and maintenance ex-
penditures. Gaseous and liquid pollution of individual estate enterprises
will be controlled through the standard rules and regulations (still to be
prepared) governing factory operations on the estate; these will specify



- 13 -
allowable limits of contaminating matter in gases and liquids to be dis-
charged. It has been agreed that the waste treatment facilities will be
designed and operated in accordance with generally accepted standards and that
suitable estate rules and regulations, including guidelines on industry
suitability and factory building design standards, will be prepared by IEAT
and submitted to the Bank by June 30, 1978 for review and approval. This will
be the first Government attempt to control industrial pollution and should
serve as a model for the future.
5.11      Telephones:  At the full occupancy, the estate and its occupants
would need 500 telephone lines. The Government and the Telephone Organization
of Thailand (TOT) have agreed to IEAT utilizing of a 36 circuit radio tele-
phone system connected to an automatic branch exchange with a minimum of 200
lines. The cost of this system will be shared by both TOT and IEAT. TOT
expects no difficulty to have 120 telephone extensions by end 1978 and the
remaining extensions as and when they are required.
3. Building Construction
5.12      Administration Building and Workshop:  Two buildings are planned for
the administration and maintenance of the estate but detailed designs have not
yet been prepared. For financial anllysis purposes it has been assumed that
the administration building (1,000 m ) will be a reinforced concrete structure,
and the estate maintenance workshop and stores (500 m ) will be a less expensive
construction with cinder block walls and pilasters supporting trusses and a
corrugated asbestos roofing, both designed for easy expansion if required at a
later stage.
5.13      Standard Factory Buildings:  The project includes preconstructed
standard factory buildings to be rented to small and medium-scale enterprises.
There is no way of forecasting accurately the effective demand for such
industrlal space, but initially land has been allocated for five buildings of
2,160 m each to accommodate together from 20 to 30 enterprises. Even this
modest commitment will be carried out in phases in order to reduce the invest-
ment risk while testing the market. If the buildings are rapidly occupied and
there appears to be, in fact, higher demand for such facilities than presently
forecast, additional land can be allocated for further construction.
5.14      Housing:  Since most of IEAT's employees to be transferred to
Lat Krabang presently reside in Bangkok center, it has been deciled to
construct some twelve to fifteen housing units totalling 2,500 m to house
them on site in order to facilitate their transfer to the new estate.
4. Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
5.15      As noted in para. 3.06, some 20 ha will be delineated as an EPZ with
the necessary fencing and gates for customs control. Firms will have the
options of building their own factories, renting IEAT's standard factory
buildings or negotiating with IEAT to build factories to their specific needs
for long-term lease or hire-purchase.

5. Engineering/Architectural Services and Technical Assistance
5.16      This component of the project provides for: (a) engineering/
architectural services and (b) technical assistance and training fellow-
ships, to help IEAT in the implementation of the project and to enhance its
capabilities in planning, executing and operating industrial estates and
EPZs:
(a) Engineering/Architectural Services: Under an engineering/
architectural contract (para 6.04) responsibilities of the
firm will include: (i) detailed engineering design and
specifications for all civil works, (ii) preparation of
tenders and evaluation of bids and (iii) supervision of civil
works contractors.
(b) Technical Assistance and Training Fellowships: A cooperative
arrangement has been considered with UNIDO under which a 4-man
advisory staff of consultants will be attached to IEAT for a
period of about 2 years, funded by UNIDO. Selection of consult-
ants will be carried out in consultation with the Bank. The team
will consist of: (i) two Industrial Estate Advisors with
complementary experience in project analysis, design and
management of industrial estates and EPZ's; (ii) an Industrial
Economist with experience in analyzing the locational, sectoral
and marketing aspects of new estate project development; (iii)
an Environmental Control Expert. A small allocation of Bank
loan funds under the project (para. 6.05) is intended to supple-
ment the large UNIDO contribution and will cover foreign exchange
costs of specialized short term consultants, as needed, and training
fellowships for IEAT key personnel.
5.17      IEAT's professional staff will, in the normal course of negotiating
land sales and lease contracts and later monitoring factory operations, advise
firms on building design, pollution control and other aspects of industrial
operations. As a Government agency, it is entirely appropriate for IEAT
to concern itself also with one of the major objectives of the Third Plan,
i.e. employment growth. Whenever possible, in reviewing applications for
estate occupancy, IEAT will advise applicants to focus on the potential
benefits of labor intensive technology. It was confirmed during negotiations
that IEAT will in fact pursue this objective by giving priority for estate
occupancy to labor intensive industries.
6.   Project Management
5.18      IEAT will appoint by December 1977, in consultation with the Bank,
a Project Manager and an Advisor who will be responsible for project exe-
cution on a full-time basis. The Project Manager will be a senior staff
employee with executive-level experience and qualifications in public and/or
private sector construction projects. The Advisor will be a qualified
civil engineer who will function as a planning and development expert and
liaise directly with the Engineering/Architectural Contractor and civil

works contractors during project execution. It has been agreed that if
suitable Thai personnel are assigned to these positions, Bank funds will
be disbursible against that portion of expenditures which would have been
foreign exchange costs if expatriates had been hired.
7.   Land Use Pattern
5.19      According to the Consultants' preliminary study (Lay-out Plan, Map
IBRD 16973), some 142 ha will be allocated to the general estate area and 20
ha to the EPZ as detailed below:

Of the 693 rai (112 ha) allocated to industrial plots, about 46% are expected
to be sold and 54% leased to some 120 firms building their own factories on
sites averaging about 6 rai each or renting space in standard factory build-
ings. Some 24 rai have been reserved for lease for commercial uses which
might include stores, restaurants and banks.
C.   Project Execution Schedule
5.20      As noted in para. 5.02, construction will be carried out in two con-
tract phases, each phase planned so as to execute about half of the total civil
works program. Phased development of industrial estates is useful in main-
taining capital investment more or less in line with actual demand for sites
and services, which, given the uncertainties, could differ from the forecast.
The planned construction schedule is given in the bar chart Annex 23 and
is based on: (i) selection of the engineering/architectural contractor by the
second quarter of calender 1977, (contract was signed in second quarter);
(ii) starting of the engineering design by mid 1977; (iii) initiation of civil
works by the fourth quarter of calendar 1977, (actually, dike construction
began in the second quarter of 1977); (iv) completion of phase one construction
by mid-1979 and (v) completion of phase two construction by end-1980. To help
ensure realization of this timetable, it has been agreed that the Project
Manager and an Assistant, who will function as a Planning and Development
Advisor, will be appointed no later than December 31, 1977.

VI. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A.   Project Cost
6.01      Estimated capital cost of the project in current terms is summarized

a/   Excluding Technical Assistance financed by UNIDO.
b/   Of which it is estimated that 85% is the direct and 15% the indirect
foreign exchange components.
Costs were estimated during the November 1976 field mission but in the light
of the modified layout proposed by the consultants to whom the engineering/
architectural contract has been awarded, there have been some changes and a
cost reduction of US$4.6 million. A comparison between the mission's estimates
and those by the consultants is given in Annex 22, Addendum 1. The cost
reduction is due to a shorter execution period, one central waste treatment
plant instead of two, power and telephone costs being mainly met by the
utility companies, technical assistance primarily funded by UNIDO and, most
important, interest during construction being treated as an operating cost
instead of capitalized.



- 17 -
6.02      ?hysical contingency of 10% of base line cost, not including cost
cf raw lan., is considered a reasonable and safe assumption since cost esti-
mates are based on recent construction experience in Bangkok. Price escala-
tion composed of 9% p.a. for civil works and 7.5% p.a. for equipment has
been provided for during 1977-79, declining to 8 and 7% in 1980 respectively.
B.  ':?nancinR Plan
6.33      Financing of the project will consist of (i) Government funds
contributed to IEAT as equity, (ii) the project's internally generated funds
from the sale of industrial sites and services and (iii) a Bank loan, as
summarized below:
Financing Plan
(Millions)
Bht      US$       %
Equity
Treasury Contribution                77.4     3.87    39.1
Internal Cash Generation             25.7     1.29    12.9
Total Equity                 103.1     5.16    52.0
Long-Term Debt
Bank Loan                            95.0     4.75    48.0
Total Financing                198.1     9.91   100.0
The Government's equity investment of Bht 77.4 million will be made during
project implementation. Part of this equity has already been paid in
for land purchase (Bht 25 million) and part for land development expenditures.
Internal cash generation will derive from the sale of industrial sites as
projected in para 7.01. The Bank loan will be made directly to IEAT for 20
years including 5 years grace at an interest of 7.9% per annum. In keeping
with past practice in Thailand the usual guarantee fee of 1-1/2% will be
waived. Interest and commitment fee on the Bank loan during the grace period
will be met from internal cash generation or from the Government contribution.
C.   Procurement, Use of Bank Loan and Rate of Disbursement
6.04      All Bank financed procurement, i.e., all project components with
the exception of land acquisition, will be tendered internationally in ac-
cordance with Bank guidelines. For the engineering/architectural services
contract, IEAT has already awarded the contract to a consortium of consultants
consisting of four Thai consulting firms in association with a US firm. 1/
Qualified local bidders for equipment and materials will, for purposes of bid
evaluation, receive a preference margin of the lower of either the prevailing
duty on comparable imported products or 15% of the c.i.f. price of the im-
ported product.
1/   The Bank agreed to the selection based on a comparative evaluation
of 9 proposals by Thai-based engineering/architectual firms; no Bank
funds will be allocated to this project component.

for technical assistance and training. As noted in para 5.16, the bulk
of technical assistance and training (estimated at about US$400,000) will
be funded by UNIDO.
Annex 25 shows the estimated quarterly disbursement schedule. In order to
ensure that the project can be carried out without financial constraints,
assurances were obtained that: (i) Government equity of Bht 77.4 million
would be made available as needed for the project execution schedule (para.
6.03); (ii) internal cash generation of the project, primarily on account of
land sales, would be reserved for reinvestment as equity in the project as and
to the extent needed by the project execution schedule; and (iii) any additional
funds that may be needed to complete the project, to the extent not available
from IEAT's resources, would be provided promptly by the Government on terms
satisfactory to the Bank.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenue
7.01      Based on the expected demand for industrial plots on the estate,
land sales and lease are projected as shown in the following table:

Total                        225   163   166    155        8    717 a/
a/   Total land sold/leased of 717 rai is less than total area of 1,007 rai
by: 143 rai for rights of way, 71 rai for landscaping, 56 rai for util-
ities and 20 rai for maintenance units and others.
Although in Thailand deferred payments on land purchases are not customary,
IEAT plans to offer a four-year payment scheme besides cash sales. In this
way, it is hoped to expand the market for industrial sites by making them
available more easily to smaller firms whose operations, while sound and
profitable, may be subject to liquidity constraints. The best estimate
of the future split between cash and deferred payment sales 1/, therefore,
projects in the above table an 80:20 sales pattern. Should the ratio shift in
favor of more term sales, cash flow problems are still not anticipated since
land mortgages can be financed in Thailand and the interest paid by IEAT will
be offset by the interest charged to estate occupants. According to IEAT, many
entrepreneurs might prefer to lease land rather than to purchase and, as
indicated in the above table, some 360 rai are earmarked for disposal on a
20-year lease basis.
7.02      Two basic factors must be taken into account in setting land prices;
(i) they must be competitive with alternative sites in the area, and (ii) they
should provide a minimally suitable financial return on total funds invested.
1/   Judgment arrived at in consultation with IEAT, mortgage bankers and the
Association of Thai Industries in Bangkok.



- 20 -
The only comparable developed industrial land available in the Bangkok area is
the Nava Nakorn project where sites are more expensive than those proposed at
Lat Krabang, as shown in Annex 18. Apart from Nava Nakorn, an entrepreneur
may opt for setting up his factory on a plot purchased as raw rice-paddy land,
and then undertake all development costs for fill, grade, dike construction,
access roads, and water supply at his own expense, while negotiating power and
telephone connections with the public utilities. Analysis of these alterna-
tives led to a base price of Bht 250,000/rai 1/ in 1979 in current terms, when
land sales will be initiated, with an annual increment of 10% thereafter for
new purchasers. It is assumed that four-year land purchase contracts will be
offered at a flat price of Bht 313,000/rai in 1979 and increase by 10% each
year thereafter. The deferred payment plan assumes a down payment of 20%
and four equal annual installments of 20% each thereafter with an interest
charge of 12% on unpaid balances imputed in the contract price.
7.03      The projected prices for land will yield a financial return of 11.5%
in constant 1976 terms (para 7.12). As with all projects of this type, land
prices must be kept under constant review and revised in accordance with such
factors as realized rates of land sales, general trends in land values, com-
petition and financial considerations.
7.04      IEAT has agreed that land prices and terms will be based on the two
principles: (i) maintaining competitiveness with off-estate alternatives; and
(ii) insuring a minimum 10% financial return in real terms on the estate
investment. Prices will be reviewed annually and revised, if considered
necessary, in consultation with the Bank.
7.05      Annual rental for lease of industrial plots is assumed to average
10% of the respective sale price. For commercial plots (e.g. bank, restaurant
and stores), the established Thai practice for commercial leasing is an
initial payment as premium for the leased land, followed by an annual rental
for a period of 20 years. At the end of this period, a new premium and terms
of rental will be negotiated between IEAT and the commercial developers. For
purposes of financial analysis, it has been assumed that a premium equivalent
to about 80% of the selling price for an equivalent industrial plot will be
charged, with 5% of the premium charged as annual rental payments. The
commercial plots occupy the best locations in the estate and would command up
to twice the price of estate industrial plots of similar size if sold outright.
7.06      The first five standard factory buildings -- one general purpose
and four for the EPZ -- are scheduled for completion by end-1980 and initial
1/   This is estimated to be at least 10% below the cost for a company to
purchase and develop its own plot, without taking into account the time
factor which strongly favors estate sites.

occupancy by 1981.  Annual rental has been set at Bht 370/m  or Bht 285,000
per factory unit of 770 m on leases signed in 1980 for both general purpose
and EPZ buildings. As with the land lease pricing formula, the starting
rental is assumed to increase 10% per annum thereafter, for new tenants. As
yet, IEAT has no firm policy on the lease period which can range from 1, 2 or
3 years up to 5 or even 10 years, with provision for periodic rent adjustments.
For purposes of financial analysis, it has been assumed that all rental income
will reflect an annual 6X increment, paralleling the anticipated general
inflation trend. IEAT has agreed that: (i) the standard lease contracts
adopted for land (both industrial and commercial) and factory rental will be
formulated by June 30, 1978 in consultation with the Bank and will specify
inter alia the starting lease and rental rates, duration of contracts and
adjustment formulae and (ii) terms of new land lease and building rental
contracts will be reviewed at yearly intervals and revisions, if necessary,
will be adopted in consultation with the Bank. Maintenance and service
charges will be assessed against factory owners to cover the cost of water
supply, sewage treatment, grounds and road maintenance and security.
7.07      Revenues from all sources are forecast as summarized below from
Annex 26.

The revenue forecast assumes the 80/20 split between cash and deferred payment
terms on land sold as projected in para 7.01.  As is customary in land develop-
ment accounting practice, revenue from land sales is booked as income in the
year the sales contracts are signed even when deferred payments are made.
Thus, while revenue from land sales appears to end in 1983, on a cash flow
basis this revenue will continue, although at a declining rate, until 1986 as
mortgages are paid off.

/a   Occasional discrepancies in addition are caused by rounding of numbers.
/b   Cost of land sold is an estimated average for the whole project and
normally varies from the realized land development expenditures in
any given year. In the cash flow statement, it is treated as a source
of funds since the actual expenditures on land development for each
year are included in the uses of funds. If cost of land sold were
not added back in the sources of funds, there would be double debiting.



- 23 -
The operating costs shown above are detailed in Annex 27, and include a 10%
share of IEAT's central office staff and overhead costs. Salaries and over-
head are assumed to escalate by 6% per annum in line with the general infla-
tion rate assumed throughout this report. IEAT is exempted from payment of
income taxes, but certain business taxes on land and other assets as well as
land sale tax will be assessed and these are included in general administra-
tive costs of the project. Annual straight line depreciation rates prevailing
in Thailand have been applied - 2.5% for roads and drainage, 4.0% for buildings,
5.0% for capitalized engineering costs, 7.5% for water, power and sewage
disposal facilities and 10% for miscellaneous equipment.
7.09      As is seen from the cash flow projectinn, the project may have a
transitory cash flow difficulty especially if land disposal were to be slug-
gish in 1979 and 1980. Since the bulk of capital investment expenditures has
to be made in these years and these expenditures have to be financed in part
by internal cash generation, IEAT will have to activate its promotional
activities so that adequate internal resources are available. Should inter-
nal cash generation not be enough, additional Government contribution will be
required.
7.10      IEAT has agreed to undertake whatever action is necessary to main-
tain a liquity ratio of at least 1.25:1, a debt:equity ratio of no higher than
65:35 and minimum debt service coverage of 1.5:1 during the period 1983-1997.
The overall IEAT financial projections show not only no problem in meeting
these specified ratios, but assure the provision of substantial cash flow for
investments in other projects now under review. (Annex 20, Addendum 6).
C.   Balance Sheets and Audit
7.11      Proforma balance sheets to 1998 are given in Annex 30.  They in-
dicate that the current ratio is over 16 in 1983 (assuming no reinvestment of
earned surplus) and increases thereafter throughout the period of repayment of
debt. The debt:equity ratio starts at 28:72 in 1978, increases during the
ensuing years reaching 51:49 in 1981 but improves quickly thereafter. Both
the current ratio and debt:equity ratio projections do not take into account
the reinvestment of earned surplus in new projects which, to the extent
compatible with maintaining necessary liquid reserves (para. 7.10), is one of
IEAT's prime objectives. An interesting feature of the assets growth pattern
is the project's ability to carry mortgage receivables rather than having
recourse to bank finance. This means, in effect, that should the project
investment demands exceed available cash resources, substantial additional
cash could be generated by financing mortgage receivables. As a government
agency, IEAT's books will be audited annually by the National Audit Council
(under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister); this is satisfactory to the
Bank.
D.   Financial Return
7.12      The financial return over 25 years in constant 1976 terms, cal-
culated in Annex 31, is 11.5%. This is satisfactory and is close to the



- 24 -
assumed 11% opportunity cost of capital in Thailand and higher than the 10%
return which has been assumed in this project as the minimum acceptable limit.
The land remaining in the possession of IEAT (about 415 rai) has been assumed
to have a residual value of Bht 62.1 million (1976 prices); this is conserva-
tive since land values will certainly increase in real terms over the 25-year
period because of land scarcity in the Bangkok area. With suitable mainte-
nance, buildings and other assets (e.g., water supply system) will have
substantial value at the end of the period but no residual values were assumed
for these facilities in the calculation . In view of these assumptions, the
financial return calculation is considered conservative.
E.   Risk Analysis
7.13      If we assume an extended period of international uncertainty and
economic stagnation, more pessimistic assumptions may be made to test what
might be termed the "worst case".  A prolonged period of economic decline
could retard industrial investment to the point where demand for industrial
sites would actually be lower than the modest 30 ha a year to be made avail-
able at Lat Krabang between 1979 and 1982. We have therefore assumed a
"worst case" based on a slowdown in occupancy so that in 1979/80 IEAT would
decide to stretch out the construction to 1981 (1 year longer than originally
planned) with project costs increasing according to the assumed price escala-
tion and full occupancy being achieved only in 1984. On this basis, the
financial return of the project would be 7.7%. This would still be acceptable
in view of the economic benefits discussed below.
VIII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.01      The project's direct net benefit to the national economy is illus-
trated by deriving the economic rate of return. This is done by revaluing
the financial costs and benefits by valuing tradables at border prices and
using conversion factors to obtain the economic values of non-tradables.
The base case economic rate of return is 14% (Annex 32). The sensitivity of
the economic rate of return to changes in conversion factors and key variables
was examined. Even in the worst case of one year delay in construction and
two year delay in sales, the economic rate of return is still a satisfactory
8%.
B.   Acceleration of Industrial Investment
8.02      Prepared industrial sites and services ready for factory construction
can significantly reduce the time interval between project conception and
startup of operations. In Jakarta, for example, as part of the market survey
for the Bank-supported Pulo Gadung estate, firms actively planning new fac-
tories were interviewed. It was concluded that, on average, developed estate
land ready for construction would reduce the time between approval of a
factory investment by a firm and startup of operations by 1 to 1.5 years.
It was further concluded that perhaps one out of five potential projects would



- 25 -
elthey be ceborted or seriously delayed for years if no viable alternative
(an industr:7al estate) were available to the discouraging task of finding and
developing a suitable factory site independently.  The problem is equally
acute in Thailand. Inadequate or non-existent land ownership records, obscure
rules concerning land use, arbitrary time limits on tenure, lethargic bureau-
cratic processing of land purchase agreements and applications for power,
water and telephone services, problems generated by squatters and/or sub-
mar--Inal small farmers, all operate to retard industrial development.
Specifically, with respect to small- to medium-scale factories which are the
prime market for this estate, these deterrants are greatly magnified since
these firms do not normally have the resources - management, legal, capital -
to persist in their objectives as do large-scale operations. Under the
conditions noted above, without the Lat Krabang project all of the estimated
120 factories expected on the estate would be delayed and some of them might
never be built.
C.   Incremental Investment, Output and Employment
8.03      If we assume an average factory investment of US$1.25 million, or
US$150 million in toto, and 12,000 jobs, the Lat Krabang project over 5 years
of land sales and lease would foster annual investment of US$30 million and
creation of 2,400 jobs from 1 to 1.5 years sooner than otherwise; also, some
US$30 million of investment (20% of the total) and 3,000 jobs might never
appear if the project were not to be carried out. Based on available data for
factories of the types expected at Lat Krabang, capital investment of US$150
million should generate gross output of about US$200 million of which some
US$60 million would be added value. In addition to direct factory employment,
during the construction of the estate, an average of about 1,500 construction
workers will be continuously employed to 1980. These figures, while admittedly
judgmental and approximate, do lend further support to the proposed investment
of US$9.9 million.
D.   Internal and External Economies
8.04      The concentration of industries on the estate, as opposed to the
haphazard and dispersed pattern which would occur otherwise, greatly facili-
tates rational planning and installation of external infrastructure (power,
water, telephones, sewage, and roads). Costs will be lower since the external
network will be less dispersed and time schedules for both planning and
implementation can be compressed. Within the estate, there will be internal
economies resulting from lower capital cost per factory because of common
utilities and services. While no attempt has been made to quantify these
project-induced savings in both public and private resources, they are real
and significant.
E.   Social Benefits
8.05      The managed environment at Lat Krabang will result in a general
improvement in factory building standards and working conditions, waste
disposal control and greater attention to social infrastructure needs such
as housing, clinics, schools and recreation facilities. In keeping with



- 26 -
the Greater Bangkok Plan governing land use planning to 1990, this project
coupled with the earlier Bang Chan project has focused Government attention on
the possibilities of a future satellite "new-town" in the area of Minburi and
Lat Krabang which could serve as a model for similar developments in other
regions. To the extent industries are attracted to Lat Krabang and away from
Bangkok proper, the project will contribute directly to relieving the critical
congestion and overloading of utilities in the city core; more importantly, as
IEAT gains management and technical experience in executing this project,
additional needed projects will be implemented more rapidly and the beneficial
impact on the Greater Bangkok Area will become increasingly apparent over time.
F.   Development of Indigenous Entrepreneurship
8.06      The estate will assist Thai entrepreneurs in two ways:  (i) by
offering land for lease or on 4-year payment terms, medium-scale factories with
limited financial resources (usually 100% Thai ownership) will be enabled to
acquire factory sites more easily than otherwise, and (ii) space in standard
factory buildings will be rented to smaller factories and shops (usually
employing 10 to 50). IEAT also plans to cooperate closely with the Small
Industries Finance Office in assisting small-scale enterprises in other ways
since the environment of an industrial estate is a particularly effective
matrix in which to channel assistance to all types of industries, particularly
small-scale enterprise. By providing suitable factory space and utilities,
the estate makes it possible for expert advice on factory layout, machinery,
operations and maintenance to be rapidly implemented and effectively supervised.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      Agreements and assurances were obtained from the Government and
TEAT as listed below:
(a)  Government is undertaking appropriate measures to enforce
the Town and Country Planning Act of 1973 with respect to
industrial zoning (para. 2.12);

as needed to finance land development expenditures; internal
cash generation of the project will be reserved for reinvest-
ment as equity in the project as needed; any additional funds
required to complete the project will be provided by the Govern-
ment on terms satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.05);
(k) Land prices and terms will be based on maintaining competitive-
ness and insuring a minimum financial return of 10% and will be
reviewed annually; necessary price revisions will be undertaken
in consultation with the Bank (para. 7.04);
(1) Standard lease contracts for factory building and land (both
industrial and commercial) rentals will be prepared by IEAT no
later than June 30, 1978 in consultation with the Bank and re-
viewed annually; necessary revisions for new contracts will be
undertaken in consultation with the Bank (para. 7.06);
(m) IEAT has agreed that it will, during the debt service period,
1983-1998, maintain the following financial ratios for IEAT as a
whole: (i) a liquidity ratio of at least 1.25:1, (ii) a debt:equity
ratio of no higher than 65:35 and (iii) the minimum debt service
coverage of 1.5:1 (para. 7.10).
9.02      Based on the above agreements and assurances, the project is suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$4.75 million equivalent, with a 20 year maturity
and 5 years grace, at 7.9% interest.

ANNEX 10
THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
INVESTMENT POLICIES AND INCENTIVES
1.        The program of industrial investment promotion during the 1960s was
based on the 1962 Promotion of Industrial Investment Act which was amended in
1965 and 1968. In order, however, to achieve the more diversified objectives
of the Third Development Plan (1972-76), a revised Investment Promotion Act
(National Executive Council Announcement No. 227) was promulgated in October
1972. Investment guarantees and benefits were improved, and promotion was
made more flexible. The revised Act applies to both foreign and domestic
investors.
2.        The Board of Investment (BOI), the Government agency responsible
for implementing the Act, is now empowered to designate the investments
eligible for promotion (Addendum 1) for which Cabinet approval was previously
required. The Board also decides on the amount of investment of the individ-
ual projects to be promoted and on the length of corporate tax holidays to
be granted with the standard incentive package. In selecting investments for
promotion, BOI takes into account the country's general development objectives
including: regional development, stimulation of exports, employment creation,
skill upgrading, and encouragement of local participation in joint ventures
with foreign investors.  Investment in agro-industries and non-manufacturing
sectors is to receive greater encouragement than in the past. In order to
broaden the ownership of industries, promoted enterprises now have to be
organized in the form of a limited company or a cooperative. The new Act
also provides a basis for technical support to private investors by BOI. 1/
I. Investment Promotion Act (N.E.C. No. 227) - Main Features
A. Standard Investment Incentives
3.         Promotional entities are granted certain guarantees and privileges
briefly summarized as follows:
(i) The Government guarantees not to establish a new state
enterprise which would compete with a promoted firmj (Any
existing state enterprise engaged in the same line of
activity as the promoted firm would naturally continue to
operate.)
I/   BOI's capabilities for technical advice and assistance to investors
are limited. Insofar as industries entering the Lat Krabang estate
are concerned, IEAT plans to develop specialized staff to advise on
factory design, pollution control, worker training and other opera-
tional elements of industrial production.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(ii) The Government promises not to nationalize a promoted firm;
(iii) A promoted firm is allowed to own land needed to carry out
its industrial activity; 1/
(iv) A promoted firm is guaranteed that it will be free to
remit foreign currency from Thailand in order to recover
equity investment, repay foreign loans, remit profit and
interest and discharge any obligations contracted for the
use of rights and services related to its activity, unless
the economic situation requires temporary restrictions on
foreign exchange outflows. Even under such circumstances,
the Bank of Thailand must allow each year at least 20% of
the foreign capital to be repatriated (provided two years
have elapsed since its introduction) and may not restrict
annual remittance of profits to an amount less than 15% of
the foreign paid-in capital;
(v)  A promoted firm may export its products, unless deemed
contrary to the national security and economic interests
of Thailand;
(vi) The Board of Investment may authorize a promoted firm
to employ qualified foreign experts or skilled workers.
These foreign employees may enter Thailand with their
families, irrespective of the nationality quotas imposed
by the Immigration Law. The Board will actually assist
the firm in obtaining the necessary permits required by
the Immigration Law and Aliens Occupation Act.
It may be noted that the firm is also protected, given the existing tariff
structure, through the Board's policy of suspending promotional privileges
to avoid creating excess capacity in an industry where there are sufficient
firms to supply local needs.
4.        The basic fiscal incentive that is granted to a promoted firm is
the exemption from import duties and/or business tax on machinery and equip-
ment. The Board of Investment may, at its discretion, also grant full
exemption from corporate income tax for a period of three to eight years,
1/   Under the Land Code, aliens are prohibited from owning land in Thailand
except under permission from the Minister of Interior pursuant to
treaties between Thailand and their home countries. At the present
time, bilateral treaty provisions relating to land ownership have all
expired, and only aliens who acquired land before the expiration date
of the applicable treaty may continue to own land. This privilege is,
therefore, of particular interest to foreign investors as it allows a
fully alien owned firm to own land outright.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
beginning when income is first derived from the operations of the business.
(Generally, firms are given a five-year exemption.) In addition, as a
special incentive, the Board may recommend to the Ministries of Finance and
Commerce that imports competing with the products of a promoted firm be
prohibited or subjected to increased tariff duties. If such a recommendation
is approved, firms receiving these privileges may be submitted to special
compulsory price controls administered by BOI.
B. Additional Special Purpose Incentives
5.        To promote exports and induce new investment to locate outside the
Greater Bangkok area, special benefits are available for export industries
and firms locating in the designated development zones (see paras. 7 and 8
below).
(a) Incentives to Encourage Exports
6.        The Investment Promotion Act provides four special benefits to
eligible export oriented firms. The first two grant exemption from import
duties and business tax on imported raw materials and components used in the
processing and assembling of products to be exported. An exemption from
business tax on raw materials and other commodities supplied by a domestic
producer for further processing into an export product is also available. A
third incentive consists of exemption from export duty and business tax on
items produced for export. Given that export taxes are imposed mainly on
rice, teak, scrap iron, rubber, sugar and hides and leather, the exemption
from export tax has actually little effect on exporters of industrial prod-
ucts. The business tax exemption is more significant as business tax rates
on distribution and processing of goods range from 1.5% to 30.0%; as a
result, an export price may be lowered as much as 23% below its domestic
retail price. Finally, the law provides for a small export subsidy in the
form of an allowance against taxable income. This allowance is equal to 2%
of each year's increase in corporate income derived from export sales in
f.o.b. terms. In addition to these fiscal measures, the BOI renders tech-
nical assistance to manufacturers interested in export opportunities. A
few general studies identifying products suitable for export and analyzing
foreign markets are available to them. This aspect of BOI's export pro-
motion activities should be further enhanced in the near future by the
establishment of the Board's two first trade and investment centers abroad,
in Frankfurt and Nlew York, from which better market intelligence is expected
to derive.
(b) Investment Promotion Zones and Associated Incentives
7.        The Investment Promotion Act, when introduced in November 1972,
listed five "special privileges" available to investors locating their
projects in regional promoted investment zones to be designated by BOI. The
privileges, which BOI may grant in total or in part (depending on whichever
is deemed appropriate), include:



ANNEX 10
Page 4
(i) a maximum reduction of 50% of import duties and/or business
taxes on raw materials for a period up to five years from
the start of operations;
(ii)  a maximum reduction of 90% of business tax on the sale of
zroducts for a period not exceeding five years from the
date income is first derived from the investment;
(iii) permission to double expenditures for transportation, elec-
tricity and water supply to be charged against corporate
taxable income for a period and under conditions left to
BOIrs discretion;
(iv) permission, in addition to the normal rate of depreciation
of assets, to deduct from net profits (in a single year or
in several years over a maximum ten-year period) an amount
not exceeding 25% of the value of investment in the con-
struction costs of infrastructure; and,
(v) an additional reduction of 50% of corporate income taxes
for 5 years starting from the expiration date of the
approved standard income tax holiday.
8.        In December 1973, following the recommendation presented by BOI,
the Government selected ten areas to serve as "Investment Promotion Zones".
A distinction is made between areas designed for general industry, agro-in-
dustries and export oriented industries. The special promotional privileges
just described are available for general industry in any of the development
zones and to agro-industries anywhere outside the Bangkok area. In the case
of export oriented industries, all 10 zones are open for investment, in
addition to the Bangkok metropolis.
IT. General Export Incentives
9.        In addition to the special benefits offered under the Investment
Promotion Act to export oriented firms, the following general export incen-
tives are available to both promoted and non-promoted firms, though these are
mainly of interest to the latter category since they are similar to those
provided to promoted export firms. The two most important fiscal incentives
for exports are: (i) the tax rebate or "credit" scheme, and (ii) the
drawback or refund of import duties paid on raw materials used in export
production. In addition, an exporter may discount his letters of credit at
his commercial bank at a rate lower than the market rate of interest because
of the special rate at which the Bank of Thailand will rediscount these
notes.
A. The Export Tax Rebate System
10.       Under this scheme introduced in 1971, all indirect taxes on raw
materials, equipment, parts, machinery, fuel and energy used in manufacturing



ANNEX 10
Page 5
the export products are paid in full at the time the goods are brought into
the country. These indirect taxes include excise taxes, business taxes,
import duties, local municipal tax, and other levies and fees. When the
imported goods incorporated in the manufacturer's export products are re-
exported, the exporter applies for a refund of the corresponding taxes paid.
Upon Government approval of the amount of taxes, the refund is paid to the
exporter in the form of a tax credit which may be used to offset future tax
payments (such as excise taxes, corporate income taxes, export duties, and
business taxes excluding those levied on imports). The tax certificates
issued to the approved exporter are valid for a period of three years from
the date of issue. Under certain conditions, the validity period may,
however, be extended for one or two additional three-year periods.
11.       To obtain this tax credit, a manufacturer must submit production
cost data to the Ministry of Finance (Tax Rebate Committee), where it is
reviewed and the indirect tax content of the exported commodity is deter-
mined. A refund formula is established that sets forth the tax rebate
in terms of unit of output exported for all firms exporting this product.
Each year, the Ministry of Finance establishes a budgetary ceiling for the
amount of tax rebate that is to be made available to exporters. This tax
credit scheme applies only to manufactured exports. Exports of minerals,
agricultural and livestock products, gold, silver, precious and semi-precious
stones are specifically excluded.
B. The Drawback System
12.       According to customs regulations, goods which are imported with the
intention that they will be processed, mixed, or assembled into products for
export, are liable for customs assessment at only 10% of the rate specified
in the Customs Tariff Schedule, provided such raw materials are exported
within 12 months from the date of obtaining Customs clearance on entry. Upon
import of the raw materials, the importer has to provide securities covering
this reduced amount. These may be in the form of cash, Government bonds,
or a Bank guarantee. The securities are later refunded upon export of the
industrial goods that embody the equivalent of the imported raw materials.
Should the importer fail to export the raw materials within the stipulated
12 months period, he is required to pay the full tariff as laid down in the
Customs Tariff Schedule. The 90% unpaid duty has to be paid within one
month of the expiration of the time limit for export, and, if the security
was not in the form of cash, an additional payment of 1% of the full rate is
required for the 13th month after import, and 2% per month thereafter until
all oustanding duties are paid in full.
C. Discount Facilities
13.       The Bank of Thailand provides an incentive to exporters through
its special credit policy which lowers the cost of borrowing for exporters of
manufactured goods. Under the rediscount facility, commercial banks, which
lend to manufacturers of export goods, are able to rediscount the promissory



ANNEX 10
Page 6
notes with the Bank of Thailand at the rate of 5%. This enables commercial
banks to lend to exporting firms at 7% p.a. (180 days) which is considerably
below the prevailing market rate of interest (15% p.a. for 180 day notes in
June 1974).
14.       Commercial banks wishing to use the Bank of Thailand's export
credit rediscounting facility must apply for prior approval and assure the
Bank of Thailand that the issuers of each type of promissory note are credit-
worthy customers. Each bank is then assigned a line of credit based on its
liquidity position, while its customers are given credit lines based mainly
on their financial status and need for revolving export funds. Depending on
the type of promissory note that is discounted in export transactions, the
commercial banks do not accept requests for the total face value of the
letters of credit, sales contract, purchase orders, or warehouse receipts
but cover 70% - 90% of the promissory notes.
15.       The Bank of Thailand's export credit rediscount facility finances
the export of agricultural, industrial, mineral, and other goods. In the
past six years, Bank of Thailand export credits for the manufacturing sector
rose rapidly from Bht. 195.3 million (US$9.8 million) in 1970 to Bht. 7.3
billion (US$365 million) in 1975, so that they now account for about half
of the total export credits under the Bank's rediscounting facilities. 1/
Nevertheless, export credits rediscounted by the Bank of Thailand finance
only a small share of industrial exports and represents a very small fraction
of total commercial bank credits.

Source: Bank of Thailand.
1/   The big increase in rediscount in industrial bills is due to the revi-
sion of rediscount regulations in 1975 coupled with the efforts made by
various industries to reduce production expenses during this period
of increasing production cost and recession.



ANNEX 10
Page 7
16.       While the various incentives offered have no doubt contributed to
the development of exports, their actual effectiveness is difficult to
determine as the increase in world market prices for Thailand's major export
commodities was the main factor in the rapid growth of exports. A detailed
assessment of the incentive system and its revision are being considered by
the Thai authorities, including BOI and Ministry of Finance.
17.       As shown in Annex 9, the number of promoted industries by BOI has
shown a sharp decline in 1975. This is due mainly to the general slump in
the economy in that year. However, BOI is considering measures to restore
and Increase active foreign investments in the country. More liberal treat-
ment of foreign investments may, therefore, be expected.

PRINCIPAL INSTITUTIONS ASSISTING INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB)
1.        NESDB is the national planning agency responsible for macro-economic
planning and review of sector and project plans of ministries, departments
and state enterprises. NESDB also participates in the formulation of fiscal
policy, reviews the annual budget, gathers data on the economy and updates
the national accounts.
Ministry of Industry
2.        The Ministry of Industry is responsible for initiating and imple-
menting policy for the development of industry in general; it monitors
the performance of industry, issues licenses to industrial enterprises and
administers various programs of technical assistance. Within the Ministry,
the Department of Industrial Promotion renders assistance specifically to the
small-scale sector.
Industrial Service Institute (ISI)
3.        ISI's main function is to provide technical extension and advisory
services to small private industrialists, and to train managers and skilled
workers of small industries. As a secondary role, !SI performs economic
studies and market surveys, collects and disseminates economic information,
and carries out limited activity in industrial design and testing of technical
products.
Small Industries Finance Office (SIFO)
4.        The Small Industries Finance Office of the Department of Industrial
Promotion, Ministry of Industry, extends long and medium-term loans of less
than Baht I million (US$50,000) to small industries in the private sector.
SIFO may finance purchases of machinery and equipment, plant construction,
acquisition of industrial land and working capital. It receives its funds
from the Government through annual budget allocations and from the Krung Thai
Bank, a Government commercial bank, in the proportion of 1 to 3.
Office of the Board of Investment (BOI)
5.        The Board of Investment, under the Office of the Prime Minister, is
the government agency responsible for implementing the Investment Promotion



ANNEX 10
Addendum 2

Act (Annex 10). BOI is empowered to determine the list of investments
eligible for promotion and decides what incentives are granted to individual
projects. To promote investment, BOI also analyzes the potential for devel-
opment of particular industrial sub-sectors in Thailand, and conducts surveys
of foreign markets to identify products suitable for export.
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
6.        IFCT is the only institution in Thailand which specializes in
extending medium and long-term loans to private industrial enterprises. The
minimum size of IFCT's loans in Baht 1 milliion (US$50,000); since this is
SIFO's loan ceiling, IFCT refers loan applicants to SIFO if the size of the
required loan is less than this amount, and SIFO reciprocates.

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS
1.        One of the objectives of the Third Plan is to "raise the income
and living standard of the rural people in various regions." To help achieve
this goal, considerable efforts including administrative decentralization
have been devoted over the last several years to regional planning for the
Northeast, the North and the South. Some knowledge and experience has been
gained in the regional planning process, but to date, little has directly
resulted from the first two of these plans (para. 2 and 3 below).
Development Plan for the Northeast
2.        With the help of technical assistance from USAID, the National
Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) prepared a development plan for
the Northeast. This plan, however, was general in nature and did not trans-
late priorities into clearly identified and formulated projects. It also had
only limited support from the various ministries and departments that would
have had to implement it. Hence, although the plan was "incorporated" in the
Third Plan, it has had little effect on subsequent ministerial actions and
policy decisions.
Northern Regional Planning Study
3.        Only the first phase of the regional planning study for the north,
carried out by a team of consultants financed by UNDP, has been completed.
The remaining phases have been delayed by inadequate contractor performance
and inaction and then reorganization at NESDB. However, steps are now being
taken by NESDB to complete the planning study for the Fourth National Devel-
opment Plan in 1977-1981.
Southern Regional Planning Study
4.   In part because of what has been learned from the earlier regional
planning exercises, the Southern Regional Planning Study, which was carried
out for NESDB by consultants financed under a technical assistance project
of the U.K.'s Overseas Development Administration, is expected to be more
successful in implementation. The study has focused on sectoral reviews
leading to identification and preparation of specific projects. Steps have
also been taken to involve the operating departments, which must implement
proposed projects, in their formulation and preparation. Consequently, this
study is likely to lead to the implementation of a significant number of
projects many with external financing.

5.        With respect to industrial estate development, the study has iden-
tified the Hat Yai/Singkhla area as a possible site for the setting up of
an industrial estate and/or an export processing zone. The study team in-
tends to carry out a prefeasibility study following completion of its sectoral
reviews.

APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE
DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE GREATER BANGKOK AREA
1.        The Greater Bangkok area covers 3,157 square kilometers and com-
prises three Changwats (provinces): Phra Nakorn/Thonburi (the Metropoitan
Municipality), Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan. The roughly rectangular area
stretches about 65 kilometers east to west, and 50 kilometers north to
south. Slightly west of the center line, the Chao Phraya River winds through
the area until it reaches the Gulf of Thailand.
2.        While peripheral parts of the area are still thinly populated,
the urban center manifests all of the ills of over-congestion - traffic
paralysis, utility breakdowns, pollution, inadequate and unsanitary housing.
The population of 4.3 million (1976) is expected to expand to a minimum of 7
million, and may surpass 9 million with high migration from outlying regions,
by 1990. This will double the population density in the area, which is
already one of the highest in the world. What is more important, the labor
force is expected to increase from 1.5 million in 1971 to 4.1 million in
1990.
3.        To achieve efficient area development, the central and local
governments have been proposing various plans. The first of such plans, the
"Greater Bangkok Plan, 1990" was prepared with the assistance of American
consultants and published in 1960. However, this plan was not officially
approved and only served as a more or less informal working guide for Gov-
ernment ministries. The Government revised the Plan in 1971, taking into
account changes since 1960, and again revised it in 1973. This 1973 plan and
the 1975 Town and Country Planning Act have been approved by the Cabinet.
4.        While the 1973 plan covers the entire Greater Bangkok Area, it
foresees staged implementation starting with limited sections needing urgent
attention. The first stage plan was for the period from 1972 to 1976 and
covers about two-thirds of the area. It includes housing and infrastructure
programs with government subsidies for priority needs. Regarding industry,
the Plan's basic policy is to distribute it together with residential, com-
mercial and social facilities to satellite centers removed from the urban
core. One major component of this program is to establish an industrial
development pole in Samut Prakan to provide 300,000 job opportunities. Four
smaller industrial development poles are planned for Cholburi, Samuthsakorn,
Klong Dan and Nakorn Pathom which in total should eventually provide 132,000
jobs. The Lat Krabang estate and others being prepared are fully consistent
with the guidelines of the Plan. Both Bang Chan and Lat Krabang fall within
one of the designated industrial zones.

APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ESTATES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
1.        Thailand has been developing a detailed long-range national industrial
estates plan. The outline of such a plan is gradually taking shape as a
result of (i) the findings and recommendations of a Japanese study team which
conducted in late 1969 an extensive search for potential industrial estate
sites throughout the Kingdom; 1/ (ii) the regional planning exercises cur-
rently underway (Annex 13); and (iii) the tentative development program
drafted by the Industrial Estates Authority of Thailand (IEAT).
Japanese Study on Industrial Estates Development
2.        The principal recommendations of the study were that, while estates
should initially be introduced in the Central Region where most industrial
investment was choosing to locate, opportunities existed also to develop
industrial estates inland, in the northern and northeastern areas as well
as in coastal areas in the South.
3.        Using such criteria as topographic conditions, transportation
facilities, available labor force, energy, markets and telecommunications
the study team selected 17 sites throughout the country as suitable locations
for industrial development, and, therefore, the establishment of industrial
estates. The Changwat (province) of Phra Nakhon, which includes Bangkok, was
ranked in first position, with urban areas centering around the capital city
within a 100 km. radius (Ayutthaya and Saraburi to the north, Nakhon Pathom
and Samut Sakorn to the west) in second to fifth positions. Areas ranked
sixth to tenth are within the 300 km. zone; they include Kohn Kaen in the
northeast, Chol Buri in the southeast, and Phitsanuloke to the north. Among
the other sites selected, but located still further away from Bangkok were
Chieng Mai and Lampang in the north, Undon Thani and Ubon Ratchathani in the
northeast, and Surat Thani and Songkhla in the south.
4.        More precise attention was given by the study team to site selection
for industrial estates in the Greater Bangkok area and to the prospects for
industrial development along the southeastern coast (Leam Chabang, Sriracha).
For the Bangkok area, two types of location were selected:
(i) sites comparable to Minburi, wihin a 30 km. radius from
the city center, to serve as fixation points and growth
poles for the development of light industries, and
(ii) areas along the Chao Phraya river and on the seaside,
in Samutprakan changwat, such as the ones defined in the
Greater Bangkok Master Plan - 1990, to accommodate more

specifically export industries.  The southeastern coast-
line was considered suitable for locating heavy indus-
tries (steel, petrochemicals), should a second port be
developed in this area.
IEAT's Industrial Estate Development Program
5.        IEAT has proposed to NESDB a tentative  program for industrial
estates development to be included in the Fourth Plan (1977-1981). In
general terms, the pattern of estates development is similar: first priority
is given to the Greater Bangkok area in addition to the Lat Krabang project
and special attention is paid to the southern region where industrial
viability is considered to exist. The following is the list of projects
the IEAT wishes to carry out either alone or on joint venture basis during
the Fourth Plan (1977-1981).

6.        This list is very ambitious; IEAT is still a young organization
(Annex 20) and such a program would exceed present and near-term resource
availability. It is believed, therefore, that a maximum of six projects might
be started, market conditions and resource availability permitting, over the
period 1977-81. At least four of these estates would be located within a 50
km. radius from Bangkok (Lat Krabang, Nava Nakorn, Bang Poo and the Samut
Prakarn EPZ), and perhaps one each in Chol Buri Province and an outlying
region.

Price Comparison with Nava Nakorn Industrial Estate Project
1.        The Nava Nakorn Industrial Estate forms part of the "Nava Nakorn
New Town" which is being developed by a private company, including as share-
holder and executing agency, the Commonwealth Development Corporation of the
United Kingdom.
2.        The site is located about 50 km north of Bangkok covering some 800
ha, including 113 ha reserved for the estate. Both standard factory build-
ings and developed sites will be offered for sale or lease. In November
1976, building rental rates were not available, but prices for developed
plots were quoted at Bht 400,000 per rai (1976 prices). A comparison of
prices per rai, in current Bht, between Nava Nakorn and Lat Krabang estates,
is given below:

THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 339, DECEMBER 13, 1972
NEC Decree no. 339 authorized the creation of an autonomous govern-
ment agency to develop, own and manage industrial estates and export process-
ing zones in Thailand. The more important articles governing organization
and operations have been translated and are given below:
Preamble
The various problems connected with location of factory sites and
the free choice of private enterprises to set up industrial plants have caused
nuisances to the public and pollution of water with the emitted waste, noise,
dust, odors, and fumes. All these factors have contributed to a nonuniformity
in expansion of industries and the authorities concerned have thus been un-
able to render efficient services to them. As the suitability of establish-
ment of Export Processing Zones can also be justified by the need to promote
utilization of local labor, the Chairman of the National Executive Board
hereby decrees that:
Article 2. (Objectives of IEAT) An Industrial Estate Authority shall be
established under the name of "Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand",
abbreviated as IEAT, and shall be a juristic person, having the following
objectives:
(1) Procurement of lands suitable for establishing industrial
estates.
(2) Improvement of land under (1) including building roads,
factory waste water disposal facilities or other necessary
installations as well as providing other facilities and
services to enable the smooth working of industrial operations.
(3) Provision for hire, hire-pprchase, and sale of immovable
properties or movable properties in industrial estates.
(4) Entering into joint investments with private enterprises in
establishing industrial estates.
(5) Undertaking other related business connected with or for the
benefit of industrial estates.
Article 5. (Activities of IEAT) Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand is
empowered to undertake activities in accordance with the objectives laid down
in Article 2 including the following:



ANNEX 19

facilities in industrial estates.
(2) Designation of categories and sizes of industrial ac-
tivities to be permitted in industrial estates.
(3) Permitting and supervising construction of factories,
installation of machinery, and registration of factories
in the industrial estates.
(4) Inspection of the living condition of workers in the
industrial estates.
(5) Control of activities of industrial operators in the
industrial estate in accordance with established rules
and regulations.
(6) Inspection and certification of kinds and quantities of
raw materials or products in the case where issuance of
certificates is necessary, or in the case of bringing
them into or taking out of the industrial estates.
(7) Acquiring and giving out loans or investment.
(8) Issuing bonds or other instruments of investment.
(9) Prevention, inspection and control of tax evasions in
the industrial estates.
(10) Providing necessary services and facilities to industrial
operators in industrial estate.
Article 6. (Capital of IEAT) Capital fund of Industrial Estate Authority of
Thailand shall comprise:
(1) Assets as per Article 4. (Note - the properties of the
Bang Chan Estate).
(2) Money or other properties received from government or
from other persons.
Article 9. (Board) There shall be a Board called the Board of Industrial
Estate Authority of Thailand consisting of the Chairman and other members not
exceeding ten including the Director of Industrial Estate Authority
of Thailand who is ex-officio mmember of the Board. The cabinet
shall nominate the Chairman and other board members with the exception of the
ex-officio Board member.



ANNEX 19
Page 3
Article 10. (Power of Board) The Board is empowered to lay down policy and
supervise generally the activities of Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand.
Article 11. (Policy of rental fee) In fixing of rental fees for immovable
or movable properties and for service charges for other facilities, the indus-
trial estate shall base its fees on obtaining sufficient income for:
(1) Provision as necessary to cover its operating costs,
including interest, depreciation, bonuses, pensions,
welfare funds or others for the welfare of workers and
their families
(2) Repayment of loans
(3) Provision of reserve funds as necessary for expansion
of the activities and investment.
Article 13. (Disposition of profit) The annual income, after deducting all
the expenses, shall be remitted to the Government treasury. However, if the
income is not sufficient to cover the expenses, with the exception of reserve
fund as per Article 11 (3) and if IEAT cannot obtain income from other sources,
the Government will pay whatever amounts are necessary to cover the deficit.
Article 41. (Types of industrial estate) There are two types of industrial
estates, namely,
(1) General Industrial Estate,
(2) Export Processing Zone.
Establishment of General Industrial Estates shall be announced in
the Government Gazette.

company registered in Thailand, may be granted permission to hold the owner-
ship of land in the General Industrial Estate to enable him to operate the
industry in area of the size as may be considered appropriate by the Board,
even if this has exceeded the total permitted in other laws.
Article 48. (Activities in the Export Processing Zones) The industrial
activities permitted in the Export Processing Zones are production, mixing,
or assembling of products including packing, storage, transportation, loading
and unloading, sale or distribution of aforementioned products, as well as

of the types of which inspection and control can be made
easily.
(4) the business shall not be hazardous to physical or per-
sonal health of people.
The category of industrial activity which is permitted in an
Export Processing Zone shall be in accordance with the ministerial reg-
ulations.
Article 49. (Privileges on Export Processing Zone) License to operate a
business in the Export Processing Zone entitles one to the privilege of
exemption of import duty and/or business tax for the machinery, or raw
materials necessary for use in the licensed business, and the machinery as

Board, but the machinery or raw materials must not be of similar types which
can be produced in the country, whose price is near to that of imported
product inclusive of import duty with quality comparable to those produced
in foreign countries, and whose supply is adequately available locally. The
import of such machinery or raw materials into the Kingdom shall observe the
conditions laid down by the Board.

in the Export Processing Zone is unable to comply with the conditions laid
down by the Board governing the import of machinery or raw materials into the
Kingdom, cr exemption of import duty, and/or business tax on machinery or raw
materials, the Board is empowered to make amendment to those conditions if the
Board considers it appropriate. And, if the machinery has already been
brought iLL, conforming in every respect with the law on Customs, the Board may
make any change to those conditions to come retroactive to the date of its
import, regardless of whether the date of import being before or after
the date of enforcement of this Announcement.
Article 5i. (Sales to Local Markets) The industrial operator in the Export
Processing Zone is prohibited from bringing the products out of the

in accordance with the Customs Act and the law on Customs Tariff.
Article 52. (Permission of Foreign Workers) Under the provisions of the

dependents although they may exceed the immigration quota and period of stay
in the country under the provisions of the Immigration Act.
Article 53. (Remittance) The industrial operator in the Export Processing
Zone has the right to take or remit money out of the country in foreign

by the industrial operator, foreign loan, profit derived from such investment
capital, interest on foreign loan or obligations assumed by the industrial
operator under contract relating to the exercise of rights and services in
the Export Processing Zone; the exemption being that during any period when
the nation's balance of payments may be such as to require reservation of
foreign currencies in a reasonable amount, the industrial operator may be
restricted on a temporary basis to take or remit such money for the said
purpose, but he will not, however, be subjected to limiting foreign capital



ANNEX 19
Page 6
out of this country at lower rate ti-an 20/o of total annually if the remittance
is made after two years from date of bringing in such capital. On the other
hand, the industrial operator will not be restricted in the remittance of
profit out of the country at a lower rate than 15% of paid-up capital which
is brought in from a foreign country.
Proposed Amendments to the IEAT Establishing Decree 1/
IEAT has proposed amendments to the Establishing Decree (NEC
Announcement No. 339) for the purpose of achieving more efficient operations
in fulfilling its assigned objectives, as follows:
1. The IEAT is empowered to expropriate suitable industrial
estate land when purchasing negotiation cannot be reached.
2. Private sector can invest on establishing the general
industrial estate. In such cases, by the IEAT approval,
the IEAT is empowered to declare the aforesaid industrial
estate establishment in Government C-azette if the estab-
lishing process is properly carried out.
3. Limitations on types and categories of industries ad-
missible in EPZ (as indicated in Article 48 of the NEC
Announcement No. 339) is cancelled. The IEAT Board is
empowered to consider, case by case, on the types and
categories of industries as suitable.
4. The IEAT is empowered to be exempted from taxes, duties,
fees related to land, assets, buildings and any structures
in the industrial estate.
5. For the operation of the general industrial estates, all
taxes, duties and fees which entrepreneurs have to pay to
Bangkok Municipality, local muniicipality and Department
of Industrial Works including fees for license issuance
and industrial operation will be collectively paid to the
IEAT and become the IEAT revenue.
6. Although other laws and regulations have been effective,
the IEAT is empowered on construction control, license
issuance for industrial establishment, operation and
production to provide such facilities to entreprenurs
in the general industrial estate and EPZ including the
entreneurs who are granted promotion incentives from BOI.
1/   These proposed amendments were tentatively translated from Thai to
English by IEAT staff.



ANNEX 19
Page 7
7. The IEAT Board is authorized to use the enforcement of
regulations of Ministry of Industry in facilitating
procedures of granting tax exemption and cutting down
red tape in import and export, by means of all procedures
being carried out as "one-stop-service". Consequently,
the provision of these facilities shall induce foreign
investment in the general industrial estate and EPZ.
8. The IEAT Board is empowered to appoint, by approval of
the Minister of Industry, members of sub-committees
attached to the general industrial estates and EPZ.
What these proposed amendments imply is, aside from the benefits
which may accrue to the IEAT, a realignment of administrative responsibilities
in such a manner that the IEAT would be able to provide more services and
incentives than at present for entreprenurs within the estate. If these
amendments are approved by the relevant Government agencies, the IEAT would
provide a "one-stop service" to entrepreneurs entering the estate, instead of
their having to contact numerous agencies individually.

ANNEX 20
THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AUTHORITY OF THAILAND - ORGANIZATION
MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS
Historical Background
1.         The Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) was created by
the National Executive Council Decree No. 339, dated December 13, 1972. 1/
Since the early 1960s, the Government has stressed industrial estate devel-
opment as a means of accelerating the rate of industrialization and to help
solve the problem of urban congestion. To this end, the Department of In-
dustrial Works, Ministry of Industry, was assigned program responsibility;
but progress was disappointing. After years of planning and preparation,
the first estate was started at Bang Chan in 1968 and substantially com-
pleted in 1972. Despite very attractive land prices, occupancy of the
estate was slow; by the end of 1972, only 11 factory plots (of 35) had been
leased. It became apparent that the Department of Industrial Works, while
technically competent, had been unable to provide the promotional stimulus
needed. It was decided that an autonomous business-oriented agency to man-
age the Bang Chan project as well as to plan and execute additional projects
was needed and this decision led to the creation of IEAT.
Functions
2.         IEAT's area of responsibility encompasses the development of in-
dustrial estates and Export Processing Zones (EPZs) throughout the nation.
It is empowered to undertake feasibiity studies, acquire and develop land,
invest in infrastructure, sell or lease the developed land, and provide
various services to the occupant industries (see Annex 19). Thus, for
estate occupants IEAT has been authorized to issue industrial licenses
based on the Factory Act and can also grant exemptions of import duties
and business taxes for companies admitted into EPZs. IEAT can participate
in joint ventures with public and private sector groups and two such par-
ticipations are being prepared at Bangpoo and Nava Nakorn. As the respon-
sible central industrial estate authority, IEAT is also preparing a long
range master plan to submit to NESDB, i.e. a national plan for industrial
estate and EPZ development.
1/   Selected excerpts are given in Annex 19.



ANNEX 20
Page 2
Management and Organization
3.        The Cabinet appoints the Chairman and other members of the gov-
erning Board of the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, a body whose
functions are to establish policy and generally supervise operations similar
to the powers and responsibilities of a Western corporate Board of Directors.
Members of the current Board are listed in Addendum 1.
4.        The Board in turn appoints the Director General who is the top ex-
ecutive in charge of day-to-day operations. On August 1, 1973, Mr. Prakaipet
Indhusophon, a well-known Thai businessmen, became IEAT's first Director
General. In June 1974, however, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Indus-
tries and Mr. Soonthorn Nivasnanda, Director of Administration Department,
carried the title of Acting Director General until February 21, 1976, when
the Board appointed Mr. Chamroon Vajrabhaya, former Director General of the
Telephone Organization of Thailand, as Director General.
5.        The IEAT Organization has been revised by the new Director General
and effective July 1, 1976, four functional departments headed by directors
and the Office of the Director General have been organized and staffed. (See
Addendum 2 - Organization Chart) with functions as listed below:
Office of the Director - General - Policy planning and
expediting, inspection, evaluation and public relations.
Technical and Projects - Programming and planning; feasi-
bility studies; engineering design; economic evaluations.
Operations - supervision of estate construction, operations
and maintenance. (Most of the staff in this department
are located on site at Bang Chan. As more estates are
built, the number of field operating staffs will increase
and only a few liaison people will be at IEAT Headquarters).
Financial - maintenance of books and accounts; financial
planning and budgets. (Future liaison with the Bank on
loan disbursements will be through this department).
Administration - general office administration; liaison
with other government agencies; factory licensing and
inspections; sales contract supervision; legal.
6.        The important function missing is "Sales and Marketing".  Up to
now, sales promotion has been handled (apparently quite successfully, since
th4e available land at Bang Chan has been fully committed) by IEAT's top man-
agement on an ad hoc basis. Future sales of the larger parcel of land at Lat
Krabang and other estates, however, will require a better organized program
of national and international promotion. According to the current organi-
zation chart, IEAT has a marketing section in its Technical and Projects
Department. Promotional activity has to be more intensive; in the future,
a separate department may be justified.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
7.        Staff now total 95 and IEAT had intended to increase this up to
165 during 1977; but after consultation with the appraisal mission, it has
been agreed that IEAT will keep its staff to the minimum required and will
transfer some of the present staff to operation of the Lat Krabang estate.
As IEAT pays about 40% more than civil service standards for professionals and
25% more for other staff, it has been able to attract relatively high caliber
people.
Operations
8.        Since taking over Bang Chan on October 1, 1973, IEAT has achieved
full occupancy of the estate. The table below shows the rate of land leasing
since 1970:

9.        Besides operating Bang Chan, IEAT has moved ahead in preparing
new projects as shown by the work done to date listed below:
(a)  Completion of the Lat Krabang feasibility study;
(b)  Completion of a prefeasibility study covering a proposed
8,000 rai joint venture with private interests at Bang Poo
(fee paid by the private interests);
(c)  Negotiation of a minority stock interest in a privately
financed new town project at Nava Nakorn; technical assist-
ance will be provided by IEAT for the industrial estate
component of the project;
(d)  Technical assistance to the linistry of Industry in
carrying out a prefeasibility study of an agro-industrial
estate proposed at Cholburi;



ANNEX 20
Page 4
(e) Preparation of a prefeasibility study on the Industrial
Estate in the South with proposed funding from ADB.
Studies, engineering drawings and cost estimates related to the work listed
above and examined by the mission were found to be of adequate quality
generally and it was concluded that IEAT has already achieved a substantial
capability to plan and carry out pre-investment studies. With appropriate
technical support during the next 2 to 3 years, the staff should achieve a
level of competence such that only occasional outside assistance would be
needed thereafter, limited in all likelihood, to design of power systems,
sewerage and other specialized items of infrastructure. In other words,
all planning and pre-investment studies including full feasibility analyses
would in the future be carried out entirely by IEAT staff while detailed
engineering design would require additional outside technical help.
10.       IEAT's project execution capabilities, on the other hand, are still
untested. It can be assumed that the experience gained in building Bang Chan
between 1968 and 1972 has been carried over to some extent from the Department
of Industrial Works to IEAT. This accumulated know-how (files and personnel)
will be useful in executing the current project since, even though Lat Krabang
is a larger project, the differences are quantitative rather than qualitative,
i.e., no new project implementation problems are involved. The qualifications
and experience of the Directors and the work already performed by them and the
staff technicians encourage the judgment that, with the technical assistance
recommended under terms of the project, IEAT will be able to execute the
project in a suitable manner.
Finance
11.       Government budget support which is obligatory under Decree No. 339
will be needed for some years to come to cover: (i) operating deficits, and
(ii) equity investments in new projects. Eventually, it is hoped that cash
flow from financially profitable estate operations and EPZs will provide
an operating surplus and this in turn will permit IEAT to raise additional
capital directly through bond issues and other debt instruments. At present,
Government policy envisages treating treasury funds advanced to IEAT as sunk
costs with no payback obligation, and additionally, allowing IEAT to retain
all profits for purposes of reinvestment in further development.
12.       The Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash flow for FY 1974, 1975
and 1976 are given in Addendum 3. FY 1974 corresponds to the IEAT's first
operating year starting with the takeover of Bang Chan from the Department
of Industrial Works. With this transfer, IEAT acquired Bht 28.5 million in
fixed assets (mainly) and 11.9 million in liabilities (of which the major
part is a long-term loan from the Alcohol Department with payback still to
be negotiated) plus Bht 16.6 million in equity. The Office of the National
Audit Council had certified in September 1974 that IEAT had Bht 12.5 million
in liabilities plus Bht 18.4 million in equity.



ANNEX 20
t)age 5
13.       An operating loss of Bht 1.7 million was recorded in FY 1974,
Bht 2.8 million in 1975 and another Bht. 3.7 million in FY 1976. The pri-
mary reason is the low revenue derived from Bang Chan leases (see Annex 21).
IEAT is examining the possiblities of putting Bang Chan on a sounder finan-
cial basis through increases in rental rates and service charges, applicable
to the new contracts, and negotiation of revised rentals and service charges
on existing contracts. Offering to sell land to occupants (who are all leas-
ing) at the current market price less some reasonable discount to make the
transaction attractive should be tested because it would, by converting IEAT's
major asset (developed land) into cash, provide a substantial cash flow for
investment in other projects.

Addendum 4
TATIJL A
APPRAISE, OF THE LAT CKABANG INDUSTRIA ESTATE PROJECT
IMPLICATIONS OF IEAT CENTRAL OFFICE OFERLATING COSTS
1.        Since IEAT's inception in 1973, its capital and most of operating
expenses have been provided by budgetary appropriaticn from the Government.
Presently, IEAT central office expenses exceed its revenue, as discussed in
paras, 11 to 13 of Annex 20. The total expenses of Bht. 4.7 million in 1976
were covered by (1) budgetary appropriation of Bht. 3.8 million, (2) revenues
of Bht. 0.6 million from rendering architectural and engineering services for
other Governmental agencies and private enterprises, and (3) appropriation of
Bht. 0.3 million from the Bang Chan estate, xwhich is the balance between its
revenue of Bht. 2.1 million and operating expenses of Bht. 1.8 million. The
contribution of the Bang Chan estate to the central office overheads is, thus,
6.5%.
2.        For the Lat Krabang project, it is estimated that approximately 10%
of the central office costs could reasonably be charged to the estate opera-
tion. An optimal share of contribution by each estate to the overhead of
central office, which is mostly engaged in planning future estates, will
have to be studied and decided later. For financial projections, however,
a 10% share contribution by the project after full occupancy is considered
reasonable. This is the percentage which the project can afford without
causing itself financial difficulty.

APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
BANG CHAN ESTATE
1.        In 1968, the Government decided to establish the first industrial
estate in Thailand in Bang Chan, some 30 kilometers east of Bangkok. Depart-
ment of Industrial Works, Ministry of Industry, developed the estate at a
total cost of Bht. 76.8 million (US$4.8 million), which was broken down to
Bht. 46.2 million for land and Bht. 30.6 million for infrastructure cost.
The estate has 687 rais (110 hectares) of land, of which 50% have been
developed for net industrial plots, 14% was reserved for residential area,
and 36% is absorbed by the administration complex, roads, and service
facilities.
2.        Uncoordinated development of infrastructure caused problems in
the early stages of development. While power and water supply were made
available from the beginning, upgrading of a local dirt road to a provin-
cial highway connecting the estate to Bangkok was not completed until
recently. The telephone exchange was completed only in mid-1974. Within
the estate, raising the level of paddy field for industrial sites was left
to individual lessees, and this delayed land utilization as well as raised
costs unnecessarily.
3.        Land title has been transferred to the IEAT in 1975, and the
lease contract has been revised. Formerly, rental was set at a very
low level: Bht 3,600/rai/year for the first five years of the contract,
regardless of when the contract was signed; Bht 7,200 for the following
five years; Bht 9,000 for the following ten years; and Bht 12,000 for the
last 10 years. The companies entering into lease contracts after 1975 are
charged at the following rates: Bht 7,200/rai/year during January, 1975
to December, 1979; Bht 9,000 during January 1980 to December 1989; and
Bht 12,000 during January, 1990 to December 1999.
4.        By July 1976, 39 companies had entered into lease contracts with
the list and details in Addendum 1. Of these, 26 companies have already
started production, 7 are under construction, 5 are in preparation and one
is temporarily closed but soon will resume operations. Total employment
is 1,799 and the total registered capital amounts to Bht 171.2 million
(US$8.5 million). Actual amounts of investments are much larger than this
registered capital (see Addendum 1 for details).

MHAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General
1.        In March 1977 IEAT evaluated proposals submitted by nine
Engineering/Architectural Consulting Firms for the design and super-
vision of the Lat Krabang Industrial Estate Project. The successful
firm 1/ has since prepared a capital cost estimate based on their pro-
posed estate design and layout. A comparison between Bank's estimate
and the updated consultant's one is given in Addendum 1.
Land Fill and Bunding
2.        In the vicinity of Bangkok, developing paddy land into indus-
trial sites requires either raising the average level of terrain by up
to 1.5 meters (adding, fill, compacting and levelling) or the less costly
alternative of building dikes (bunds) around the boundary and installing
pumps for removal of sewage and excess rainfall. IEAT and the consultants
have opted for the second alternative, and it is proposed to have bunds
all around the estate with the exception of an area of about 10 rai along
the estate entrance road that will be filled and compacted to the required
level. The total cost of land fill, bunding, fencing and pumping stations
has been estimated at Bht 8.89 million.
Roads and Drainage
3.        From the proposed layout the total cost of roads including
parking areas has been estimated by the consultants at Bht 38.8 million
(Bht 28.0 m for roads and Bht 10.78 m for the drainage system). The
asphalt surface roads (some 10 km long and about 8.5 m wide) will be
built according to the Department of Highways specifications and will
include sidewalks.
Water Supply
4.        The consultants' estimate for this project component is the
sama as IEAT's since it differs only in scale from the installations
at Ban7 Chan which were completed in 1973. The same aquifer supplying
1/   Consisting of a -roup of engineering and architectural consultants,
namely: (i) Dr. lachet Ranjanavanit and Associates (ii) Metric Company
Ltd. (iii) Thai D~CI Company Ltd. (iv) Santhaja and Associates Company
Ltd. in association with (v) De Leuw, Cather International Inc. of USA.

Bang Chan is known to exist at Lat Krabang at about the same depth
(150-200 meter). Daily consumption is projected to be;at full occupancy,
6,000 m3 average and 10,000 m3 peak load (overtime shifts, summer conditions)
or 2e6 million gallons maximum. This is reasonable and is composed of: (i)
sanitary demand of 400,000 gallons/day (40 gallons/day x 10,000 workers in
full scheme), (ii) the balance of 2.2 million gallons/day for industrial
use of some 200 primarily clean, light mechanical industries and the demand
of various commercial activities. Two phases of development are planned:
Phase I                        Estimated Cost
(Bht. mill.)

Power
5.        From the estate layout, MEA has estimated that total distribution
lines required will be approximately 6 kilometers and maximum demand 25 MW.
The required transformer has already been installed by MEA some 5 km west of
the project site; it will be connected to the estate internal overhead distri-
bution network for power and street lighting, the cost of which is estimated
at Bht 4.8 million. IEAT will advance funds to MEA for the installation and
MEA has agreed to refund this amount to IEAT in the early eighties. IEAT's
view is that this expenditure be treated as operating cost and not as capital
cost.
Sewage and Garbage Disposal
6.        From the consultants' estate layout (Map 17963 ) there will be only
one central sewage treatment plant that will handle the combined sanitary and
industrial wastes. The plant will consist of an aerated lagoon, evaporation
ponds and pumping stations. A more sophisticated plant, (activated sludge
principle) estimated at Bht 15.0 million has nevertheless been included in the
cost estimate. The real need for the more sophisticated installation will be
evaluated by the consultants during the course of final design. Until the
design has been completed, only a rough global estimate is possible. Even
then, since the final mix of factories - light mechanical, chemical, clean,
semi-pollutive, pollutive, and so forth - will be unknown for some years, the
design will have to be based on judgment to some extent. At this stage of the
project, it was assumed that 90% of the water demand would reach the treatment
plant or 9,000 m /day during peak load periods. Pretreatment at the points
of origin will be required under estate operating rules for aggressive wastes
containing acids, alkalis, solvents, oils and greases, and dissolved and
suspended inorganic or organic material to ensure that the waste entering
the central treatment plant meets the design standards of the facility.
The discharge from the treatment plant will also be controlled. It is too
early to fix these acceptable limits, but generally recognized standards
do exist. (For example, BOD - biological oxygen demand - is usually held
to a limit of 2,000 ppm.).
7.        Given a maximum flow of 9,000 m /day and assuming averge types of
industrial and sanitary waste (aggressive wastes having been neutralized or
eliminated within plant limits), subject to final design, the consultants
have the following global estimate in current (1977) prices.
Estimated Cost
(Bht. million)
-    Aerated lagoon, polishing ponds, pumping station ... 5.0
-    Treatment plant unit ..............................  0S.O
-    Piping, installed ........     .........................  3.0
-    Incinerator      .......................................  2.0

APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
1.        The financial rate of return (FRR) was calculated by using the
phased capital costs, operating costs and revenue projections. The project
life is assumed to be 25 years and the residual value was obtained by assuming
zero value for buildings and 41.4% of land remaining to IEAT at 1976 prices.
A 41.4% remaining ratio was obtained by deducting from the original 1,007 rai
of the land sold, land for utilities and landscaping. The rate of inflation
taking place through the project life was assumed to be 6% p.a. Operating
costs and revenues after 1985, when the project operations will be stabilized,
are assumed to be increasing at a constant rate of 6% p.a. Thus, the obtained
FRR is 11.5% in constant terms and 18.1% in current terms (Addendum 1).
2.        A sensitivity test was also made to check the project's financial
resilience. The FRR is quite sensitive both to the increase in capital costs
a -f.'.the decrease in revenues. The magnitude of changes in FRR caused by
changes in costs and revenues is tabulated in Addendum 1.
3.        Other variations which the project might face are also considered as
listed below:
(i) Construction of project is completed as scheduled but operating
costs increase by 10% due to higher real salaries and additional
repair and maintenance; the FRR in constant terms is still
10.9%.
(ii) Project completed as scheduled but sale/lease is sluggish and
delayed by 1 year and 2 years; FRR is 9.6% and 8.2% respectively.
(iii) Construction is delayed by 1 year and capital costs increase
by 10% thus causing delays in sales/leases by 2 years; FRR
is 7.7% which is considered as the worst case conceivable
under current circumstances.
4.        In current terms, the FRR drops to about 5% when revenues
decrease by as much as 50%. Translating a 50% decrease in revenues into a
50% s _l of occupancy and assuming 50:50 equity and loan financing, this
is t&e  xrea&-even point after servicing long-term debt.

ANNEX 32
THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE LAT KRABANG INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
1.        The economic rate of return (ERR) is calculated by revalueing
the financial values of capital costs, operating costs and revenues to
economic values by applying various conversion factors so that each of the
benefit/cost streams may reflect the true economic worth to the economy.
Th numeraire used is the public income in the hands of the government.
2.        The project's inputs are land, engineering services, equipment
and construction materials and civil works; its outputs are sale/lease
of land, lease of factory buildings and services rendered to entrepreneurs
locating in the industrial estate. Internatinally traded goods and services
('tradables') are valued at their border prices. Non-traded goods and
services are divided into: (1) tradable equipment and materials which are
then valued at border prices; and (2) labor which is valued at shadow
wage rates.
3.        The capital costs are converted into economic values as shown in
Annex 32, Addendum 1. The land was previously used as paddy field and
purchased by IEAT for estate site at an economic value which reflects the
net foregone output of the land. The net foregone output of the land is
calculated as follows:
(a) The annual rice production of rice as about 1.20 ton/rai
(.56 ton/rai in wet season and .64 in dry season).
(b) The average sale price of rice in the vicinity of Bangkok
was about Bht 3,500/ton.
,he gross foregone output is approximately Bht 4.2M, of which costs of rice
production excluding land rent, and normal profit are assumed to be Bht 2.8M.
Therefore, net foregone output of land is Bht 1.4M. Assuming time preference
being 6%, the net present value (NPV) of the net foregone output over an
infinite time is given below:
NPV = 1.4 + 1.4 *   1   + 1.4 *    1    +
I+.06          (1+.06)'
= 1.4   1+   1       +    1           +
1.4   1+.06 = 24.963
.06



ANNEX 32
Page 2
This NPV is comparable to Bht 25M which is the acquired price of 1,007 rai.
Thus, application of various conversion factors for each corresponding
project cost component gave the economic project cost of Bht 177 million
which is .89 of the financial value.
4.        The operating costs, which include salaries and wages, adminis-
trative expenses and repair and maintenance costs, were also adjusted by
applying corresponding conversion factors. The economic cost of repair and
maintenance was calculated by applying the conversion factor of .87, which is
the ratio of economic/financial value for land development and buildings.
The economic value of operating costs thus obtained is .85 of the financial
value (Addendum 2).
5.        Revenues are economic rents charged to land, factories, warehouses
and services.  The-¢ prices and charges are financially competitive with those
of privately developed similar projects and the market for industrial estates
are considered fairly perfect. Furthermore, the revenues in the hands of IEAT
can be regarded as public income, the numeraire.
6.        On these economic values for the project's inputs and outputs, the
economic rate of return is 14.1%. Sensitivity test of ERR is made, first, in
terms of changes in the conversion factors. If civil works, skilled labor and
sem'skilled labor is converted in a more conservative manner, with correspond-
ing figures being 0.85, 1.00 and 0.65 respectively, the ratios of economic
value/financial value in capital and operating costs increase from .89 to .94
and from .85 to .91 respectively. In this case, the ERR in constant terms
will be reduced to 12.9%.
7.        Then, as in the case of FRR, the sensitivity of ERR to changes in
key variables was examined as follows:
(a) The project is completed as scheduled but the sales/lease
is delayed by one year; ERR is 11.7% in constant terms.
(b) The project is completed as scheduled but the sales/lease
is further delayed by two years; ERR is 10.0%.
(c) The worst case: the construction is delayed by one year,
thus entailing a 10% increase in capital costs and a two-
year delay in sales/lease of the project; ERR is 8.0%.
