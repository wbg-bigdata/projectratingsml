STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
BORROWER:         Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria
BENEFICIARIES:   Port enterprises of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba; Ministries
of Transport and Public Works
AMOUNT:           US$63 million
TERMS:            Repayable in 15 years including five years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
RELENDING TERMS: Equipment  and  cereals  facilities  repayable  in 10 years
including 3 years of grace at an interest rate of 10X.
PROJECT
OBJECTIVES:       The project would broaden Bank lending in the transport
sector by extending our involvement beyond the highway and
railway subsectors.   The main objectives of  the project
are to improve investment planning and programming,
operational efficiency, and financial viability in the
ports subsector.   During project preparation, particular
attention was paid to setting priorities for essential
rehabilitation and to establishing a phased program of
port   modernization   based   on   the   introduction   of
container-handling  technology.   High  priority  is  also
given to improving the financial viability of the port
enterprises.
PROJECT
DESCRIPTION:      The  project  constitutes  a first phase  in a program of
modernization of key Algerian ports and will provide
support in four areas:  (a) remodelling of existing berth
facilities in the ports of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba, and
the   provision   of   specialized   handling   equipment;
(b) provision of a bulk grain handling facility  in  the
port of Annaba; (c) assistance for studies on cost
accounting assets valuation and tariffs and on subsequent
phases   of   port  modernization;  and  (d) provision  of
training   to   support   the   introduction   of   modern
container-handling technology, including facilitation of
documentation,    operating    methods    and    equipment
maintenance.   The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$127.S million. The Bank loan of US$63 million will
cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs.  Local costs in
the amount of US$64.8 million will be financed by the
Government and the EPs.

BENEFITS:         Support in improving investment planning and programming,
improving   operational   efficiency,   and   strengthening
financial viability, constitutes adequate justification
for  the  proposed  project.   Through  its  support,  Bank
involvement  will  help  lower  the  burden  of  the  port
subsector on the Government's budget by rationalizing
investments, increasing efficiency, and improving pricing
and  tariff  policies.   Because  of  the  low  level  of
containerized cargo, considerable scope exists for growth
in container traffic and for reducing freight rates on a
large part of Algeria's foreign trade.   Economic benefits
from the container port development program would be
largely in the form of savings in foreign exchange, partly
through reductions in ships' service time and consequent
savings in freight rates, and partly through savings in
handling costs. The development of container traffic will
also encourage development of Algerian exports in the
longer term by increasing the competitive position of
Algerian goods in world markets.   Substantial savings  in
sea freight rates will also accrue to the proposed cereals
handling  facility  in  the  port  of  Annaba,  the  first
facility of its kind in Algeria t.o receive 609000-ton bulk
cereals  carriers.   Finally,  Bank  involvement  will  also
help lower infrastructure costs and help stimulate the
construction industry through international competitive
bidding.
RISKS:            The main risk lies in the pace at which port users will
shift to container technology.   However,  t;he assumptions
made are relatively conservative and traffic developments
will  be  closely  monitored  to  provide  for  adjustments
during a secor-d phase program.  A secondary risk relates
to the impact of a change in value of the dinar on the
financial viability of the proposed facilities.   In view
of the high share of foreign exchange in project costs,
overall  coets could  increase  in line with exchange rate
adjustments.   However,  the  proposed  container-handling
tariffs are set as a relatively high level and the
corresponding   revenue  would   be   able   to   absorb   a
substantial   increase   in  costs.    Moreover,   increased
overall price flexibility is being introduced in the
economy through a new law on prices prepared by the
Government,   which   will   facilitate   further   tariff
adjustments if required by the evolution of the cost
structure. The financial viability of the new facilities
would therefore remain acceptable.  Financial targets for
the port enterprises and for the contair r and cereals
handling facilities are included in the loan documents.

Another risk relates to implementation delays, especially
those arising from project agencies' inexperience in
following Bank procurement  guidelines.   Steps were taken
during project preparation to minimize this risk by
fostering   coordinat in  among  concerned   agencies,   by
preparing bidding documents in advance to allow for early
prequalification,      and    by    strengthening    project
implementation capability through provision of technical
assistance   for   construction   supervision.    The   key
activities under the project will be monitored during
implementation within the framework of a time-bound
Project Action Plan,

1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR -'
A. Transport and the Economy
1.01     Since  1985,  Algeria  has  experienced  a  substantial  slowdown  in
economic growth due to a combination of falling demand for hydrocarbon
exports and a sharp decline in oil revenues.  GDP growth fell from about 5%
per year during 1980-85 to about 1 to 2% per year during 1986 and 1987.  The
Government is now entering a period of readjustment characterized by major
structural reforms.  Although the growth of the economy will remain modest
through the early 1990s, there are good prospects for renewed growth in the
medium term provided the proposed reforms are successful.
1.02     The  transport  network  is  extensive   nd  includes  44,000 km  of
primary (national) and secondary (regional) roads, of which about 80% are
paved, 33,000 km of local (community) roads, 3,700 km of railways, 5,000 km
of oil and gas pipelines, six main ports, and an extensive domestic air
network. Road transport carries by far the largest share of total domestic
traffic excluding crude oil.  Over 25 billion ton-km per year or about 90%
of total freight traffic and about 13 billion passenger-km or 90% of total
passenger  traffic are carried by road transport.  While road traffic has
increased at about 10% per year over the past decade, the growth of rail
traffic has been more modest.   Port traffic consists mainly of hydrocarbon
exports amounting to some 56 million tons in 1987 as well as major import
volumes of general cargo and bulk traffic (mainly cereals and cement)
estimated in 1987 at about 12  million tons.  However,  import traffic has
declined by over 25% since 1984 as a result of the Government's efforts to
stabilize external  debt.   On the other hand,  export  traffic,  other than
hydrocarbons, amounted to just over 2 million tons in 1987 and has recently
shown  substantial  increases  in  Line  with  increased  emphasis  on  the
development  of  export  commodities.   Whereas overall  port  traffic  is not
expected to increase substantially in the next few years, the ports will
continue to play a major role in the transport system and there is scope for
considerable improvement in their operational efficiency.
1.03     Although  the  Algerian  port  system  includes  ten  separate  port
enterprises, six major ports - Algiers, Oran, Annaba, Skikda, Bejaia, and
Mostaganem - account for 90% of total traffic (Map IBRD 20910).   Given the
difficult topography of the coastal areas and the importance of import
traffic, the main transport flows have historically been organized within
well-defined  hinterlands  around  the  country's  principal  ports.   However,
with the development of the Algerian economy over the years and the gradual
improvement of the transport system, there is now inoreasing complementarity
among the eastern, central, and western regions of the country.  These three
regions will continue to he served by three main ports, namely Oran in the
west, Algiers in the cent ., and Annaba in the east, whi-h together account

which was issued in Green Cover in October 1987 (Report No. 6727-AL).

for  about  70%  of  general  cargo  traffic.   A  new  port  is  also  being
constructed in the eastern part of the country at Djen Djen, which was
designed to relieve severe port congestion in the eastern ports during the
early  1980s.   Because of  the recent decline in traffic, additional port
capacity  is  no  longer  a major  concern;  however,  existing  ports  need
modernization to increase efficiency with resultant reductions in import
costs and more competitive prices for commodity and general cergo exports.
B. Transport Organization
1.04     The transport sector  is administered by  the Ministry of Public
Works (MPW) for matters related to infrastructure, apart from the railways,
and by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) for matters related to transport
operations.   Transport  tariff  regulations  require  the  agreement  of  the
Ministry of Commerce (MOC) jointly with that of MOT, while fiscal policy
and the provision of recurrent budgets involve the Ministry of Finance
(MOF).   Because  increased   responsibilities  have been given recently  to
local  government  authorities  through  the  Government's  decentralization
policy (Wilaya, communes), the Ministry of Interior (MOI), which supervises
local authorities, is also invo'lved in the administration of the transport
sector.   In addition  to its responsibility  in pricing policy,  MOC also
plays a role in the distribution of various basic commodities and in
related storage facilities and means of transport.  Substantial changes in
the present organization have been recently announced by Government.
Although there are some uncertainties at this time, the main trend is to
lessen  Government   control  and  grant  more  autonomy  to  the  public
enterprises, which would then be more accountable for their financial
performance (paras. 1.06 and 2.08).
1.05     Some of  the main issues in the transport sector stem -"un poor
coordination among the various agencies concerned with planning Lransport
facilities  (para. 1.13).   Regional  planning considerations and industrial
development strategy have had major implications for the construction of
new railway and port  infrastructure.   In many  instances, investments  in
transport have gone ahead without a clear decision as to whether related
developments  in  other  sectors  would  proceed.   Streamlining  of  overall
transport sector planning and strengthening of modal agencies' planning
capabilities  should have a high  priority.   The current preparation of a
National  Transport  Study  and  the  creation  of  a  transport  planning
coordination unit under MOT are a logical starting point for improving the
planning process (para. 1.15).
1.06     MPW and MOT are responsible for the overall supervision of various
public agencieb and enterprises  in the  transport  sector.   MPW currently
supervises (a) 13 enterprises involved in road and airfield construction,
(b) three enterprises specialized in civil works in the maritime and port
sectors, (c) six enterprises specialized in structures, (d) five public
agencies (laboratories) devoted to geotechnical studies and one to maritime
studies, and (e) four public firms responsible for preparing engineering
studies.  MOT is responsible for the public road carriers (five regional
companies for passenger traffic created from former SNTV, and SNTR for
freight) operating on intercity routes; for SNTF, the national railway; Air
Algerie, the national airline; ENESA, the aeronautical agen(y; tenl port
enterprises;   four  shipping  companies   (SNTM/CNAN,  SNTM/HYPROC,  FNTM-J,
CALTRAM); and ERENAV, a newly created shipyard enterprise.   Tht shippin.g

agent function has recently been separated from SNTM/CNAN and is now
entrusted to an independent agency, ENCATM, while SONATMAG is the main
forwarding  agent.   All  the  agencies  or  firms  are  publicly  owned,  the
private sector accounting for only a small Thare of ttie road transport and
the road construction industries as well as a number of freight forwarding
agents.   Under new policies, more autonomy is expected to be granted to
public enterprises (paras. 1.04 and 2.08).
1.07     Both MPW and MOT are organized  into  functional  and  subsectoral
departments.   In addition to their central organizations in Algiers, both
Ministries  act  at  the  regional  le'rel  through  decentralized  Government
services  in the Wilayas.   Specific technical services dealing with basic
infrastructure and transport are located within the same regional
directorates (DIEs) under the authority of the Wali.
C. Transport Investments
Recent Investments
1.08     Until the mid-1970s, little had been done to improve the transport
system in Algeria.  However,  rapidly increasing traffic during the 1970s,
combined with progressively aging facilities, led to major investments in
the  sector  under  the  1975-79  and  1980-84  Development  Plans.   Total
investments   in   the   transport   sector   during   1980-84  amounted   to
DA 30 billion   (US$6.5 billion)   compared   with   a   planned   amount  of
DA 39 billion  (US$8.5 billion).   However,  during  implementation  of  the
1980-84 Plan, there was a major shift in emphasis to road infrastructure,
which accounted for over 50% of the investments, almost twice the level
initiallv planned.  In contrast, investment in railwviys was only one-third
of that originally planned, much of it going into tLe construction of new
lines connected with the Government's industrial and regional development
schemes.
1.09     Despite increased efforts,  there has been a lag in meeting needs
to   rehabilitate   and   modernize   existing   infrastructure.    Pavement
rehabilitation of about 6,000 km of roads accounted for about 40% of total
highway investment during 1980-85.  This represents annually only 3% of the
total paved road network compared with the 7% to 10% corresponding to a
normal design life of 10 to 15 years for pavement structures.   A similar
critical backlog has accumulated on the railways where only one-fourth of
the track renewal requirements have been met during the last 30 years.  A
stepped-up program of track renewal was initiated under the 1975-79 Plan
period with Bank assistance  under  the  First  Railway  Project.   However,
instead of pursuing this program, the Government embarked on extending the
railway   network   without   any   demonstrated   economic   justification.
Similarly, in the port subsector, the rehabilitation and modernization of
existing facilities were neglected while priority was given mainly to
secondary ports or to the development of new sites.
Investments under the 1985-89 Plan
1.10     Total  public  investment  originally  planned  for  the  transport
sector (Table 1.1) during the current plan period 1985-89, was expected to
reach DA 54 billion (US$11.7 billion) of which 76% would be allocated to



- 4 -
land transport, 15% to the maritime subsector, and 9% to civil aviation.
This overall distribution would have been fairly close to actual
expenditures during the previous plan period, although within land
transport, the railways were to absorb 55% of total investment as compared
with only 31% under the previous plan.   This planned increase in railway
investments was related to a major extension of the rail network, a
proposal inconsistent with the relative role of the railway subsector.   In
fact, actual investments during the first three years of the plan period
show   railway  investments  substantially  below  the  objectives,   while
expenditures on road infrastructure have far exceeded expectations.
Moreover, in 1986 there was a need to adjust public investment levels as a
result of the major fall in oil revenues.

1.11     To assist  the  Government,  a mid-1986  Bank  Plan  Review  Mission
identified a five-year core investment program for the transport sector.
Under   the   program,   overall    investment   at   about    DA 44 billion
(US$6.5 billion) has been reduced by about 20% and funds have been
reallocated  between  various  transport  subsectors.   Road  infrastructure
accounts  for about  40% of  the  total and  railways  about  30%.   The major
emphasis   of  this   core   programn  is  on   rehabilitation   of   existing
infrastructure, particularly for the railways, and on a modernization
program for the existing ports.  The main cuts in the program are in new
rail  infrastructure,  including  the Algiers metro,  in the construction of
local roads, and in renewal of trucking capacity.   The construction of new
railway  lines  has been  limited  to ongoing projects,  but  these would be
implemented  at  a  slower  rate  than  originally  planned.   Similarly,  the
construction schedule for the new Djen Djen port in the eastern part of the
country, which began in 1985, has been revised in line with lower port
traffic  prospects over  the next  five years  (paras. 2.03 and  2.13).   The
Five-Year Plan for the period 1990-94 has not been issued yet.  The National
Transport Study should help to prepare the plan for the sector (para. 1.15).
D. Sector Issues
1.12     There are a number of issues which the Government must address in
the transport sector. These can be grouped into four main areas:
(a)  institutional coordination and overall planning;
(b)  sector management and operational efficiency;
(c)  transport investment planning; and
(d)  pricing and fiscal policy.
1.13     Better coordination  among  the various  agencies  dealing with  the
sector is needed.   For roads, coordination is required between MPW and the
regional Wilayas under MOI, to ensure a more balanced investment allocation
among various classes of roads.  For ports, coordination is required between
MPW and MOT to promote modernization, rehabilitation, and maintenance rather
than new construction.  This problem, one of the most serious affecting the
transport sector in recent years, has diverted attention from the critical
need   to   rehabilitate   the   existing   transport   infrastructure.    The
coordination issue is already being addressed by the Fifth Highway Project,
which is improving coordination in road rehabilitation and maintenance
planning.  The present project will help improve coordination in port sector
planning.
1. 14    Improved  management   is  needed   to  increase   the  operatiotnal
efficiency and financial viability of major transport enterprises in all
modes.  In the road subsector, the issues are: the utilization of the large
own-account truck fleet, the high accident rate, truck overloading, and the
need to improve the information system particularly with regard to vehicle
registration.   In  the  rail  subsector,  the  main  issues  are:  the  loing
turnaround time of wagons (12 days for an average distance of 235 km), thle
provision  of  excess  long-distance  passenger  capacity,  and  the  lack  .,
capacity to carry out more substantial rail renewal programs.  In the port
subsector, the development of container traffic and the provision .f



- 6 -
improved cereals handling facilities should speed up throughputs and reduce
transport  costs  provided  technical  and  institutional  constraints  can be
eliminated.
1.15     Sharper resource constraints will enforce sound economic  criteria
in the selection of transport investments.  As mentioned above, these should
be  focussed  on  modernization  and  rehabilitation  rather  than  on  new
construction.  This is particularly true for the railways where the existing
east-west trunk line should play a more important role in the distribution
of local  production in gradual substitution for imports.   The Government,
with financial assistance under the Fifth Highway Project, has now embarked
on a National Transport Study, which should help to establish investment
priorities in the sector and define the future role of the various modes.
The study also provides an opportunity to strengthen MOT's capability to
undertake such planning tasks and train its staff.  It is being managed by a
Transport Planning Coordination Unit under MOT whose role is to upgrade
overall transport sector planning.
1.16     Fiscal  revenues  from road users exceed  required  expenditures  on
construction and maintenance but heavy vehicles do not cover their share of
infrastructure costs.  Ports and railways achieve less than full recovery of
their  operating  and  infrastructure  costs.   Railways  deficits  have  been
mounting without any attempt to recover infrastructure costs.  If allowance
were made for infrastructure depreciation, the 1987 operating deficit could
be estimated at about DA 1 billion (US$150 million).  As part of the recent
Second Railway Project, a major financial restructuring combined with a new
railway convention was implemented early in 1988.   The railway convention
establishes a clear relationship between the Government and the railway in
relation to level of service, pricing, compensation, responsibilities for
investment, and depreciation.
1.17     The recent decline in hydrocarbon revenues has brought a sense of
urgency in dealing with many of the problems in the transport sector.   The
issues mentioned above have been discussed with the Government as part of an
ongoing program of economic and sector work, which includes an economy-wide
review of the 1985-89 Development Plan and a Green Cover Transport Sector
Strategy Paper issued in October 1987.  This ports project will be part of
this overall effort to improve the institutional framework and will support
an urgent first phase in the modernization of the country's three main ports.
E. Previous Bank Projects
1.18     In the transport sector, Algeria has received nine loans from the
Bank, for a total amount of US$750 million, to finance five projects for
roads, two for ports, and two for railways.  Annex 9 provides a summary of
the content and implementation experiences of these projects.   During the
mid-1970s, the Bank participated in financing a major port at Bethioua (Loan
995-AL), in the western part of the country, designed for the export of
liquified natural gas.  The Project Completion Report indicates  that this
project was completed successfully and no major problems were encountered
during  implementation.   The  implementation  of  an  envisaged  Second  Port
Project  at  Jijel  (Loan  1427-AL)  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  country,
evaluated in 1976, did not materialize because of the postponement of an
associated new steel  complex.   The  loan was  then cancelled in 1980.  in
1984, the Bank subsequently appraised a project for a new port at Djen Djen



- 7 -
which  was  essentially  a  revised  design  of  the  original  Jiijl  project
(paras. 2.03  and  2.13).   However,  Bank  involvement  in  this  project was
suspended after disagreement over procurement procedures and over project
design.
1.19     The First, Second and Third Highway Projects (Loans 912-AL, 1407-AL
and 1683-AL) have been completed and fully disbursed.  The implementation of
the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1892-AL), approved in 1980, is completed.
Completion has been three years behind schedule because of delays in bidding
and evaluating alternative bids for construction of a major component.  The
Fifth Highway Project (Loan 2808-AL) is currently providing support for a
program of road rehabilitation and maintenance through technical assistance
and training in road rehabilitation and maintenance planning and in
transport operations, as well as through studies in the transport sector,
including preparation work and design studies for railway and port
projects.   The highway projects were all characterized by delays due  in
large part to lengthy civil works contracting and approval procedures and
late startup of studies.   The Project Completion Reports (and the Project
Performance Audit-Report No. 2552, on Loan 912-AL) all concluded, however,
that project objectives in each case were met, although project comporents
had to be revised several times to keep pace with administrative and
organizational changes taking place in Algeria.
1.20     The  First  Railway  Project  (Loan 996-AL),  which was designed  to
support the railway's modernization program within the 1974-77 Development
Plan, was mainly completed on schedule, but the closing date was extended to
permit  completion of  several  important  studies.   The  eroject  Completion
Report indicated that, although the project largely met its objectives, the
disagreement between the Bank and the Government on track doubling between
Constantine and Randame Jamel led to a deterioration in the Bank's dialogue
with the railway.  In addition, a cost accounting study included under the
project was never completed and a cost accounting system has yet to be
implemented in the railway.  A Second Railway  Project  (Loan 2976-AL)  has
recently been approved.  This project provides for the urgent rehabilitation
and renewal of 370 km of main line tracks, a high priority program of
improved signalling and telecommunications and an improved mechanized track
maintenance capability as well as associated training and institutional
studies.  The project also includes measures related to a major financial
restructuring of the railway and the implementation of a new railway
convention.
II. THE PORT AND MARITIME SUBSECTORS
A. Port Facilities
2.01     Algeria has a total of 13 commercial ports along its coastline of
1,200 km.  These ports form three main groups: al eastern group comprising
Annaba, Skikda, Jijel, and Bejaia; a central group including Algiers and
several minor ports, and a western group comprising Oran, Arzew, Mostaganem,
Ghazaouet, Bethioua, and Beni Saf.  Some ports are specialized for export of
liquefied natural gas, ammonia, and crude oil, while others have specialized
berths for iron ore, phosphates, and grain.   Bethioua is used exclusively
for hydrocarbon exports (crude oil, refined oil, and gas) while crude oil is
also handled at Bejaia and both crude oil and gas at Arzew and Skikda.



- 8 -
Refineries are located at Skikda, Arzew, and Algiers, and liquefied gas
plants at the gas pipe terminals in Skikda and Arzew.
2.02     The 13 commercial ports have a total of 221 berths with an overall
length of about 34,000 meters and an average length per berth of 150 meters
(Table 1).  Most ports use either mobile or fixed cranes (about 100 units)
for vertical lifting of general cargo.   Specialized equipment is available
for  solid  bulk  commodities,  such  as  minerals  and  cereals.   Horizontal
handling  equipment  for  the  entire  port  system  consists  of  800  to  900
fork-lift trucks ranging in capacity from 3 to 36 tons.
2.03     Except in the more recently constructed oil ports, most berths and
storage facilities require rehabilitation and modernization.   However,  the
rapid growth of traffic during the late 1970s and early 1980s made
rehabilitation difficult and, as a result, more emphasis was placed during
that period on the development of new facilities, particularly in the
eastern part of the country.  This program included recently completed new
berths at Bejaia, financed in part by the European Investment Bank, and an
ongoing program for the construction of a new port at Djen Djen designed to
serve a planned steel mill at El Milia as well as provide facilities for
general cargo and cereals (para. 2.13).  Recent port congestion also placed
a considerable strain on handling equipment, leaving little time for routine
maintenance.    Similarly,  port  congestion  hampered  the  maintenance  of
pavement,  storage areas, sheds, and public utilities.  Moreover, during the
past decade, Algerian ports have had only limited success in the development
of unitized -argo, particularly container traffic, mainly through the
absence of appropriate facilities and through protection of the national
shipping line and cargo reservation practices (paras. 2.05, 2.06, and
2.10). In addition, despite an ever increasing volume of cereals imports,
Algerian ports are currently unable to handle large bulk cereals carriers.
These limitations have served tc increase the cost of foreign trade and
there is considerable scope for substantial savings in foreign exchange
through appropriate investments in specialized port facilities.
2.04     The decline in port traffic since 1984 now presents  considerable
scope for rehabilitating and modernizing existing port infrastructure.  An
ongoing port modernization study financed under the Fifth Highway Project is
currently defining the longer-term needs for the port subsector as a whole
and will provide a key input to the preparation of the 1990-94 Five-Year
Development  Plan.   In the short to medium term, the present project will
address  some  more  immediate  problems  through  an  initial  phase  of  port
modernization based on the development of specialized container-handling
facilities and the provision of a new cereals terminal at Annaba.
B. Pert Traffic and Operations
2.05     Total port traffic  in 1987 was  75 million  tons,  including about
59 million tons of oil products, 8 million tons of bulk cargo and 8 million
tons of general cargo (Annex 2, Table 1).  Apart from exports of crude oil
and petroleum products amounting to 56 million tons in 1987, imports have
historically dominated port traffic.   Imports in 1987 included 3.9 million
tons of cereals, 2 million tons of cement and building materials, and
5.8 million  tons  of  general  cargo.   Exports  of  general  cargo  in  1987
amounted  to 2.2 million  tons.   Port  traffic has declined  from a peak of
78 million tons in 1984 of which 57 million tons were oil products.   The



- 9 -
decline has been felt mainly in imports of cement and intermediate and
capital  goods.   It  reflects  the  restrictions  on  imports  following  the
slowdown of hydrocarbon exports in 1985 and the fall in hydrocarbon prices
in  1986.   To  stabilize  external  debt,  the Government  intends  to reduce
imports to about 65% of previous levels.   This reduction has already been
exceeded  for  cement  and  building  materials  imports,  which  fell  from
4.1 million tons in 1984 to only 1.5 million tons in 1987, a reduction of
over  60%.   In addition,  imports  of  intermediate and capital  goods  have
fallen  from  5.3 million  tons  in  1984  to  2.9 million  tons  in  1987,  a
reduction  of  about  45%.   On  the  other  hand,  imports  of  cereals  and
foodstuffs have continued to increase, reacaing 3.9 million tons and
2.8 million tons respectively in 1987 compared with 3.7 million tons and
2.6 million in 1984.  Due to an exceptionally poor harvest, cereals traffic
is estimated to have exceeded 5.5 million tons.  Of the current level of
about 8 million tons of general cargo traffic, it is estimated that about
4.3 million  tons can be containerized.   However, containerization affects
only 8% or about 340,000 tons of the cargo that can be containerized, a low
level compared with about 50% in Morocco and over 30% in Turkey
(para. 4.08). Further details of traffic patterns are given in Annex 2.
2.06     In 1985, Algerian ports handled about 10,600 vessels, only 20% more
than in 1965.   However, the average size of vessels has more than doubled,
and freight tonnages have increased threefold. About 25% of the vessels are
empty on arrival (tankers), compared with 60% on departure (bulk, general
cargo).   Except  for  oil,  the  average  shipment  on  arrival  is  about
12,000 tons for bulk and 1,500 tons for general cargo.  Small shipments are
the result of port-related technical constraints and the geographic
structure of foreign trade, of which about 30% involves short routes to
Europe and other Mediterranean countries.  This results in a relatively low
level of berth productivity ranging from 500 to 800 tons per meter of berth
per year for general cargo traffic.   However, as traffic increased during
the early 1980s, throughputs rose mainly through reducing direct unloading
onto trucks in the ports and making greater use of storage areas both within
and outside the port areas.   A training program for dockworkers and crane
operators is to be provided through Belgian bilateral aid (para. 2.14) and
is expected to result in further gains in productivity.  Efficiency has also
increased through the use of roll-on, roll-off (Ro-Ro) technology, which now
accounts for about 20% of total general cargo traffic and is expected to
increase to about one-third of general cargo traffic in the longer term.
Productivity could be increased further by encouraging the development of
containerized cargo, particularly on the longer haul routes where Ro-Ro
technology   is  not   competitive.    However,   the  growth  prospects   for
containerized cargo will remain relatively modest in view of current
regulatory   measures   affecting  maritime   shipping,   particularly   cargo
reservation (para. 2.10).
C. Organization and Management
2.07     In 1982, as part of  its decentralization policy,  the Government
abolished the public enterprises operating the port sector on a national
basis   (ONP,   SONAMA,   CNAN-REMORQUAGE);   instead,   eight   "Entreprises
Portuaires" (EPs) were created in August 1982 in Ghazaouet, Oran, Arzew,
Mostaganem, Alger, Bejaia, Skikda, and Annaba; the EP of Jijel came into
being  in  August  1984,  and  that  of  Tenes  in  July  1985.   Some  EPs are



- 10 -
"multi-unit6s" in that they operate more than one commercial port; other EPs
operate one or more fishing ports located within the boundaries of their
jurisdiction.  The ten port enterprises employ a total staff of about 13,000
including 750 higher-level personnel.   The higher-level  personnel  have an
aca.emic education or are technicians with additional training in port
operations  and  administration,   usually  acquired   through   courses   or
fellowships abroad.  The caliber of technical and financial management staff
is generally high.  The middle-level personnel have, in general, relatively
poor   educational   backgrounds   while   many   laborers   are   functionally
illiterate.  Some 1,700 workers over 55 retired in 1988.  They will be only
partly replaced since overall productivity per employee is increasing
(para. 3.27).
2.08     Although MOT, through its Directorate of Ports, still coordinates
all aspects of port investments and operations, recent developments towards
giving more autonomy to port enterprises will substantially affect the
subsector.   Port  investment planning and coordination are currently being
done on the basis of "Plans Annuels Definitifs," approved by the Minister of
Transport, which state the expected operational and financial performance of
each EP and decide on, among others, investments to be made and training to
be performed.  At the Wilaya level, coordination among the "institutional"
port  users   (EPs,   customs,   and  police)   is   the   responsibility   of
"Administrateurs  de  Port."   MPW   is  the  executing  agency  for  all
Government-financed port construction works and remains custodian of these
investments, which are neither transferred to the EPs, nor carried in their
accounts.  This is a major weakness in that the EPs have no part  in the
financing and maintaining of their infrastructure investments, and hence
little incentive to engage  in infrastructure planning and upkeep.   As a
result, whereas the planning of port infrastructure is, in theory, the joint
responsibility of MPW and MOT, in practice MPW's views tend to dominate in
port strategy development.   In recent years, this has resulted in emphasis
on new construction rather than on modernization and rehabilitation.
However, MOT and the EPs are now taking more of a lead in defining the needs
of the sector.  In addition, new policies presently being implemented by the
Government will result in granting larger autonomy to public enterprises and
making them more accountable for their performance.   In February 1989, the
EP of Annaba was created as an autonomous stock corporation. Other EPs will
soon follow.
D. Maritime Transport
2.09     Maritime shipping is under the control of MOT acting through the
Merchant Marine Directorate.   Traffic is handled mainly by two state-owned
companies that were formed from CNAN in 1982, namely SNTM/HYPROC for oil and
chemicals,  and  SNTM/CNAN  for  the  remainder.   Another  smaller  company,
CALTRAM, with five vessels is a joint venture between Algeria and Libya.  A
fourth enterprise, ENTMV, operates five car ferries handling mainly
passenger traffic.  In 1989, the SNTM/CNAN vessel fleet included 49 units:
35 liners, including two container ships (presently used as conventional
units), and 14 tramps with an average age of ten years.   Total capacity is
about 500,000 tons.  SNTM/CNAN has recently ordered 2,000 containers and has
an option on a further 2,000, while CALTRAM already owns 3,000 containers.
SNTM/CNAN intends  to charter additional container ships as traffic demand
develops.  SNTM/HYPROC operates six oil tankers with a total capacity of
172,000 metric tons, six liquefied natural gas tankers with a total capacity



- 11 -
of 676,000 cubic meters, and one ammonia tanker.  Two liquefied natural gas
tankers are currently in storage because of low demand.   The tanker fleet
averages 12 years.  SNTM/CNAN has a staff of about 6,000 and about half of
its employees are shore-based.   About 70% of the deck officers and nearly
100% of the seamen are Algerian citizens.   All SNTM/HYPROC officers are
expatriates.
2.10     With its own liners,  and through chartering,  SNTM/CNAN  operates
48 routes  providing  a broad  range  of  services  worldwide.   For tramping
services, SNTM/CNAN uses its own vessels and about 50 chartered vessels.  In
1981, Algeria adopted the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) Code of Conduct, which provides for a 40-40-20 cargo sharing.
Algeria has also negotiated traffic shares bilaterally (50-50) with twelve
trading partners.   Such bilateral,  non-conference agreements apply unless
there is a conflict, in which case the UNCTAD Code takes precedence.
SNTM/CNAN controls 35% to 40% of total Algerian freight with about 15%
carried  on  its  own  ships  and  the  remainder  on  chartered  vessels.   On
international car ferry lines between Algeria and southern France, ENTMV
faces stiff competition from modernized French liners.  Its own car ferries
are 12 years old on average, and it is seeking to renew its ferry fleet to
become  more  competitive.   The  Bank  is  currently  preparing  a  study  on
maritime transport regulation and its impact on shipping costs and foreign
exchange expenditures.   Algeria has agreed to be a case study along with
Turkey, Chile, and Indonesia.
2.11     Besides its foreign and domestic trade operations, SNTM/CNAN, with
a fleet of about 30 tugs, was previously engaged in towing.  In 1982, towing
was transferred to the newly created EPs.  Ship repairs and maintenance are
mainly  carried  out  in  foreign  countries.   However,  a  repair  unit  is
currently being established in the Port of Algiers through a merger of the
former  CNAN maintenance  unit with a Wilaya enterprise  (ERENAV).   ERENAV
already operates two small drydocks in Algiers and intends to acquire two
second-hand floating dry docks of about 7,000-ton and 11,000-ton capacity.
The project includes a feasibility study for the establishment of a maritime
repair industry (para. 3.11).
E. Port Investment Program
2.12     Although investments in port infrastructure during the 1985-89 Plan
have increased sharply over the previous Plan period to about DA 3.9 billion
(US$570 million), they are expected to be about 10% below the original Plan
projections.  For port equipment, emphasis is being placed on renewal and
modernization   including   the   provision  of   specialized  equipment  for
containers and cereals handling.   Total investments in port equipment and
maritime safety will probably not exceed DA 650 million (US$95 million)
during *he period 1985-89 compared with an initial Plan forecast of about
DA 1.7 billion  (US$250 million).   These  programs  are consistent with  the
recommendations made by a Bank Plan Review mission in July 1986.
2.13     The  recent  increase  in  port  infrastructure  investments  is  due
mainly to the completion of port extensions in Bejaia, repairs to the
Bethioua breakwater, and ongoing construction work at the new port of Djen
Djen. However, implementation of the Djen Djen project has been slowed down
because of restrictions on resources and expected lower traffic growth



- 12 -
during the next few years.  Investments at Djen Djen are expected to account
for  over   one-third   of   the   total  high  priority  program  for  port
infrastructure for the next three or four years.  Other major works include
the completion of repairs to the Bethioua breakwater.  The port development
program also includes provision for modernization of existing berths in
Algiers, Oran, and Annaba, and for cereals facilities in Annaba, together
with appropriate equipment.   These items will  constitute  the bulk of new
investments in the program through 1992. Some savings have been possible in
the port program since 1987 by deferring certain proposed new investments on
secondary and fishing ports.  During project implementation, the Government
will provide che Bank with details of the annual port investment budgets,
beginning in 1989.  Table 2.1 below giv-  a breakdown of actual and planned
port investments from 1985 to 1991, wh±.L- are expected to average between
DA 700 and 800 million (US$100-120 million) per year in port infrastructure
and about DA 150 million (US$22 million) in equipment.

F.  Training
2.14     Skills  are  normally  acquired  through  on-the-job  training,  but
formal training courses have also been organized in the past.  Since the
reorganization of the ports subsector, training of personnel has been at a



- 13 -
low ebb.  MOT and six of the ten EPs have training departments,  usually
comprising only one or two professionals who devote most of their time to
arranging  for  short-term  training  programs  and  individual  fellowships.
Personnel inventory and evaluation, and multi-annual training programs are
unavailable.  Recently, three regional training centers at Oran, Algiers,
and  Annaba   have  been  established  with  ILO  assistance.    Over  200
higher-level  staff have already been trained.   Assistance  with  a  first
phase of a training program in these centers for cargo-handling personnel
will be provided through Belgian bilateral financing.
2.15     The  introduction  of  modern  container-handling  technology  will
create  a  need  for  additional  specialized  training.   The  project  will
provide technical assistance to address these specific needs (para. 3.08).
G. Tariffs and Costs
2.16     The EPs continue to apply the port dues and cargo handling and
stevedoring charges inherited from ONP and SONAMA.   Identical tariffs are,
therefore, applied in each port regardless of individual investment and
operating costs.  Handling and stevedoring charges remain unchanged since
1976; tariffs for storage, quay occupancy, and various services date back
to 1979; some increases in port and toll dues occurred in 1981, 1987, and
again on January 1, 1988.  Details of the present structure and level of
port dues and charges are in Annex 4; the main particulars are:
(a)  the tariff  provides  for substantial reduction of port dues
for shipping companies making repeated calls, which will
benefit the two national shipping companies;
(b)  likewise companies with Algerian home ports pay only a small
part of wharfage charges;
(c)  coastal shipping is exempt from port and toll dues;
(d)  dues are heavier for imports than for exports; and
(e)  the  transit  tax  is  substantially  lower  for  goods  loaded
directly on trucks or freight cars rather than stored, a
factor that has had an adverse impact on productivity in
recent years.
2.17     While  the  general  level  of  dues  and  charges,  as  well  as
cargo-handling and stevedoring charges, is satisfactory, the structure of
tariffs needs some revision to reflect the actual cost of services
provided.   Proposals are presently being discussed within  the Government
and within a "Comite National des Usagers Maritimes";  their main features
are:
(a)  handling and  stevedoring  charges  are  to be  based  on  the
packing and handling method of goods rather than on the
nature thereof, as is presently the case;
(b)  the new tariffs are to be applied uniformly to all ports, as
is presently the case;



- 14 -
(c)  EPs would be authorized, however, to grant tariff discounts;
this would introduce some inter-port competition, expected to
be of limited effect because hinterland areas served by
Algerian ports do not overlap to a significant degree;
(d)  an  increase  in  handling  and stevedoring  charges averaging
20%; it would mainly concern bulk and general cargo with
practically no impact on oil and gas products;
(e)  an increase in port and wharfage dues averaging 10X; payment,
in foreign exchange, of dues charged to ships is also being
considered; and
(f)  charges  to  be  levied  on  containers  are  to be  decreased
partially for exports; a more detailed analysis of these
charges is discussed in Chapter V.
2.18     The  Government  is  well aware  that  the above  tariff  proposals,
which are expected to become effective in 1989, are to be dealt with as an
interim adjustment and that they will have to be reconsidered soon, within
the larger framework of new pricing policies.  At negotiations, agreement
was reached that the Government would carry out a study on cost accounting,
tariffs, and fixed assets valuation with  the assistance  of consultants.
Meanwhile, the 1988 "Loi de Finances" provided for some increases in port
dues and storage charges, the proceeds of which would be returned to
Government as a rent for use of port facilities.
2.19     To  assist  in formulating  pricing and financial  policies,  draft
terms of reference have been prepared (Annex 5), which, in line with the
larger autonomy and accountability of public enterprises, are based on the
following policies and objectives:
(a)  ports'  infrastructure  investments  would  remain  initially
fully financed by the Government (concours d6finitifs), as is
presently the case; a progressive transfer of such financing
to the EPs would, however, be considered; superstructure and
equipment would remain, as presently, financed by the EPs;
(b)  all  ports'  infrastructure  assets  would  progressively  be
transferred to the EPs, which would be responsible for
financing  their  maintenance  and  depreciation  based   on
replacement cost;
(c)  tariffs would be differentiated for each EP and related to
its infrastructure and operating costs;
(d)  EPs where the main project components are to be located would
set tariffs and charges to produce revenues sufficient to
achieve:
(i) beginning in FY 1992, a working ratio of .90 or lower
for Algiers and .75 or lower for Oran and Annaba;



- 15 -
(ii)  starting in 1993, a debt service coverage ratio of at
least 2.0 on the debt incurred in the financing of each
of  the  container  and  grain  handling  and   storing
facilities; and
(iii)  in addition, each of the above facilities should achieve
a financial rate of return on net fixed assets of at
least 8% in 1992 and 10% at the end of their first full
year of operation.
2.20     The above policies and objectives are in line with the recently
enacted "Loi No. 88-01 portant loi d'orientation sur les entreprises
publiques   6conomiques,"   dated   January   12,   1988.    However,   formal
implementation of these policies cannot start until legislative action is
taken.  These policies are summarized  in a comprehensive Project Action
Plan, which is attached as Annex 1.  Details of the financial analysis are
given in Chapter V.
H. Accounts and Audit
2.21     Double-entry accounts are kept by each EP in accordance with the
1975 Plan Comptable National,  which  is compulsory.   Income accounts and
balance sheets are submitted to the Government (MOT and MOF) and to the
"Cour des Comptes," which is customary for all public enterprises.
2.22     Cost accounting is still in the developmental stage, particularly
in the larger EPs (Algiers and Oran).  The consultants will investigate the
adequacy of the cost centers established by the EPs (cargo handling, port
services,  rentals,  storage).   Currently,  the  Government  is  preparing  a
chart of accounts for cost accounting (Plan Comptable Analytique National),
which would serve to guide the consultants' work.
2.23     There is no external audit except for sporadic investigations by
the "Inspection Generale des Finances" or the "Cour des Comptes." Although
the 1985 "Loi de Finance" provides for the appointment of "Commissaires aux
Comptes" for each public enterprise, no such appointment has yet been made
in the ports subsector. As a corollary to the increased autonomy of public
enterprises and the ensuing accountability of their performance, the
Government is now preparing a "Statut des Commissaires aux Comptes," which
will provide for specific audit procedures and stringent professionnal
qualifications  for  the  "Commissaires."   At  negotiations,  agreement  was
reached on a satisfactory scope of external audit, which will be carried
out by:
(a) independent auditors for the EPs of Algiers, Oran, and
Annaba, with particular attention to the results of the
container terminals and cereal storage facilities; and
(b) "Controleurs des Finances" for the Borrower with particular
attention to project-related expenditures, including the
Special Account, and to internal control procedures for
statements of expenditures (SOEs) related to disbursement
applications.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01     The rapid growth in port traffic in Algeria during the late 1970s
and early 1980s resulted in considerable emphasis being given to the
development  of  new  port  infrastructure.   With  the  stagnation  in  port
traffic, which began in 1985 due to a sharp decline in hydrocarbon
revenues, Algerian authorities began to revise their program for the port
subsector, giving greater emphasis to the rehabilitation and modernization
of existing  infrastructure.   However,  the  definition  of  an  appropriate
strategy for container port investment took time because of the division of
responsibility between MOT, responsible for port operations, and MPW,
responsible for construction and maintenance of port infrastructure.  This
problem was particularly relevant to the investment program proposed for
the port of Algiers because of a lack of consensus on the location, size,
and phasing of berth construction related to container traffic.   In 1986,
the Bank held continuous discussions with Algerian authorities on the port
investment program, a dialogue that culminated at the end of the year in a
request for Bank assistance in establishing an initial phase of port
modernization.   This  request  coincided  not  only  with  a  decision  to
rehabilitate and modernize existing berths, rather than to construct new
infrastructure, but also with a clear commitment by the Government to
increase operational efficiency in the transport sector and to scrive for
cost recovery for its transport enterprises.
B. Project Objectives
3.02     The  project  forms  part  of  a  broadening  of  the  Bank  lending
strategy  to the Algerian  transport  sector.   The main objectives  of  the
project are to strengthen investment planning and coordination in the ports
subsector and assist the EPs in achieving financial viability and improving
operational efficiency.   The  project  follows  the preparation of a Fifth
Highway Project in FY87, which extended Bank assistance into improving
highway maintenance planning and the efficiency of maintenance operations.
A Second Railway Project, which was finalized in FY88, has objectives
similar to those of the present project.
3.03     Particular  attention  was  paid,  during  project  preparation,  to
streamlining the port investment program and to focussing priorities on
essential rehabilitation, modernization, and maintenance of exisLing
facilities.   In addition,  improvements  in the operational  and financial
performance of the EPs are given high priority.  One of the main objectives
is to strengthen the financial position of the ports aid to help them
develop a cost-based tariff system.  The project will provide assistance in
the introduction of new technology for port cargo handling and in raising
the operational efficiency of the ports in general through a comprehensive
training program.   This will bring substantial  benefits  in the form of
savings in foreign exc1ange, particularly through lowering transport and
handling  costs  on  a  large  part  of  the  country's  foreign  trade.   In
addition, international cempetitive bidding (ICB) for the infrastructure
works under the project will encourage competition in port construction
activities and should result in lower prices on construction contracts.

C. Project Description
3.04     The  project  will  cover  a  four-year  program  (1989-92)  of high
priority investments in the ports aubsector which constitute a first phase
in a longer-term program of port modernization and rehabilitation.   The
project   includes   the  development   of   specialized   container-handling
facilities in the three main ports of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba, the
provision of a bulk cereals-handling facility in Annaba, and a supporting
program of technical assistance and t-aining.  The specific items included,
which were confirmed during negotiations, are as follows:
(a) Civil Works:
(i)    remodelling of existing berths in the port of Algiers by
relocating seawards the quay wall of an existing mole to
provide 320 meters of berth length for container vessels
with a water depth of 11 meters, backfilling an adjacent
basin to provide paved storage areas and improving road
access to and from the port area;
(ii)    paving of an existing berth and strengthening of a quay
wall in the port of Oran to provide a storage area for
containers and Ro-Ro trailers;
(iii)    relocation seawards of an existing quay to provide a
container berth with a water depth of 10 meters as well
as paving of a storage area in the port of Annaba to
provide facilities for container and Ro-Ro traffic;
(iv)    construction  of  an  80,000-ton  storage  facility  for
cereals in the port of Annaba; and
(v)    preparatory dredging works in the port of Algiers;
(b) Equipment:
(i)    provision  of  specialized  container-handling  equipment
for a first phase of modernized container operations in
the ports of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba;
(ii)    provision of a large-capacity unloader for bulk cereals
traffic in the port of Annaba; and
(iii)    provision  of  miscellaneous  equipment  for  navigational
aids and equipment maintenance, including computers for
port management and operation in the port of Algiers;
(c) Institutional Strengthening:
(i)    a comprehensive  training  program covering conventional
cargo handling, operation of modern container-handling
equipment, and equipment maintenance;
(ii)    assistance for construction supervision  in Algiers  and
Annaba; and



- 18 -
(iii)    a program of assistance for the preparation of studies
for subsequent phases of port modernization, including
the handling of cereals imports and the need for a
marine repair facility and for cost accounting and port
tariffs.
Container Port Development
3.05     The container port development program to be  implemented during
the period 1989-1992 provides a least-cost solution for meeting anticipated
traffic demands  up  to the mid-1990s.   The  proposed  program  takes  into
account overall traffic patterns, hinterland linkages, and a small
potential for traffic diversion from secondary ports.  A list of required
equipment is shown in Table 2.  A list of miscellaneous equipment for port
maintenance and management is shown in Table 3.  These lists were discussed
and confirmed at negotiations.  The planned improvements for each port are
summarized below:
(a)  Algiers.  The first phase program for Algiers calls for the
creation of 320 meters of berth length for container vessels
with a water depth of 11 meters, the filling and paving of a
storage area, the demolition of sheds to convert an adjacent
general cargo berth into a container berth with a water depth
of 10 meters, and the provision of equipment to handle
100,000 TEU,   the   forecasted   traffic   for   1994.    Three
technical alternatives were analyzed based on remodelling the
existing berth infrastructure, all of which involve filling
in basin No. 7 in the eastern part of the port (Map IBRD
20911). All alternatives would involve relocation of a water
intake for the SONELGAZ power plant, located in the port
area.   The  alternatives  ranged  from  the  creation  of  one
container berth with the existing water depth of 10 meters to
the construction of three new berths with a water depth of
11 meters.  An intermediate solution provided for 320 meters
of berth length with a water depth of 11 meters and
175 meters of existing berth length with a water depth of
10 meters.   This  proved  to be  the best  alternative  taking
into account expected traffic development and ship sizes.  To
obtain an li-meter water depth, the existing El Hadjar mole
needs to be extended forwards to create a new quay wall that
would  extend  across  the  mouth  of  basin  No.  7.   Such  a
solution will provide berthage for vessels of 1,500 TEU
capacity as well as permit the installation of gantry cranes
during  a  later  phase  of  development.   The  filled-in area
behind the new quay wall will provide about 17 hectares of
storage   for   containers,   a  container   freight   station,
miscellaneous buildings, and services.   To facilitate access
to this area of the port, a two-lane, one-way bridge linking
the container area with the eastbound lanes of the coastal
expressway  will  be  provided  (Map  IBRD  20911).   Handling
equipment requirements (Table 2) are based on the forecast
traffic on the assumption that ships' gear will be used for
loading and unloading of containers up to a total traffic
volume of about 200,000 TEU per year.   Storage will be low
density in the initial phase using towing units or trailers



- 19 -
and forklift trucks equipped with spreaders able to stack up
to three containers in height.  This approach will facilitate
the introduction of improved handling techniques and allow
use of the same equipment for roll-on, roll-off traffic and
general  cargo.   As  traffic  develops,  a  later  stage  of
development may involve a more intensive use of the port area
based on gantry cranes  and  transtainers.   Total  equipment
requirements in the first phase include eight 35-ton forklift
trucks with automatic spreaders, four 10-ton forklifts with
spreaders, and 10 towing units and trailers.
(b)  Oran.    There  is  already  suitable  infrastructure  for  a
container berth in the eastern section of the port of Oran
(Map IBRD 20912).   In view of the relatively modest traffic
forecasts of just over 28,000 TEU in 1994, the first phase of
infrastructure development will be limited to paving the
existing  berth  over  an  area  of  about  six hectares  and
strengthening an existing quay with tie rods.   Should there
be a need for additional storage area in the early years of
operation, containers could be stored about 300 meters to the
rear in an area of the port which has recently been cleared
of old buildings.   Equipment needs for the first phase will
include four 35-ton forklifts with spreaders and one 10-ton
forklift with spreader.
(c)  Annaba.   Infrastructure works at the port of Annaba involve
the modification of an existing 240-meter Ro-Ro berth by
constructing a quay wall about 50 meters in front of the
existing berth to gain sufficient area behind the berth to
handle container traffic forecast to be just over 20,000 TEU
in 1994. The project includes the paving of 3.5 hectares for
the storage of both containers and Ro-Ro trailers, including
one hectare immediately behind the berth and the demolition
of  buildings  (Map IBRD 20913).   Equipment  requirements  are
estimated  at  four  35-ton  forklifts  with  spreaders,  three
10-ton forklifts with spreaders, and six towing units and
trailers.
Annaba Cereals Facility
3.06     The project will provide for conversion of part of an  iron ore
berth in the port o  Annaba, from which exports have now ceased, to allow
for  :.mports of cereals  in 60,000-ton bulk carriers.   This  involves  the
construction of an 80,000-ton modular storage facility and the provision of
a high-capacity unloader.   The forecast throughput  is estimated at about
600,000 tons per year.  Although the capacity of the facility can easily be
increased by adding a second unloader, the capacity has been limited given
the proposed development of a bulk cereals facility at the new port of Djen
Djen, which is expected to be operational by the mid-1990s.   In addition,
the existing silo in the port of Annaba will continue to operate in the
intervening  period  with  an  annual  throughput  of  about  500,000 tons.
Ultimately, the new Annaba facility will work alongside the proposed
development at Djen Djen and will essentially serve the Annaba urban area
and its immediate hinterland.  In developing an appropriate design for the



- 20 -
cereals facility, several technical alternatives were examined before a
satisfactory scheme was found.   It provided for minimum handling costs,
particularly for the evacuation of cereals out of the storage area.  The
possible use of a ship silo was also examined but this proved to be more
costly in both capital and especially in operating costs because of double
handling.   The retained solution involves  the provision  of  four  simple
storage units with a capacity of 20,000 tons each, feeding a fixed-tunnel
claim conveyor at the rate of 400 tons p(  hour.  The unloader will be a
continuous type rated at about 750 tons per hour connected to a conveyor
system using belts that will be interchangeable with those of the existing
silo.
Training
3.07     The  project  will  provide  a  comprehensive  training  program  to
improve port operations, both for container and conventional traffic.
Details of the overall training program are shown in Table 4. In addition,
training in finance, accounting, and auditing will be provided through the
proposed tariff and cost accounting study (para. 3.11).
3.08     Assistance for training in container operations will cover three
principal areas: (a) container systems control and management; (b) physical
container-handling on ship and shore; and (c) establishment of procedures
for   engineering   operations,   maintenance   and   repairs,   and   stock
inventories.   Port  personnel  from  the  EPs,  customs  officials,  and
forwarding agents will be trained in these areas through a series of pilot
schemes.  The program will start in early 1990 with a seminar describing
the advantages and procedural and documentation requirements of container
traffic.  This will be followed by a two-year pilot scheme for control and
documentation to be established in the port of Algiers.  This scheme will
operate in the existing container-handling area before the arrival of
specialized equipment and will enable the various institutional aspects
related to container traffic to be tackled before the new terminal comes
into operation.   Staff from Oran and Annaba will be assigned  to  these
schemes, which will require a specialist in control and documentation for
about 24 months.  An operational pilot scheme will be set up initially at
Oran in early 1991 where the new equipment will be commissioned first. The
scheme will then move to Algiers in early 1992 for another year of
operation.  It is estimated that one container-handling specialist will be
required for two years.  An additional 24 man-months of support staff will
be  required  for  the  facilitation  and  control  schemes.   Finally,  a
specialist in repair and maintenance of container-handling equipment will
establish a training scheme for maintenance procedures, which will be
operated  in Algiers  for about  18 months beginning  in early  1991.   The
project will also finance some 20 man-months of foreign technical visits
for port staff, customs officials, and MPW personnel to provide training in
container  operations  and  in  terminal  layout.   A  preliminary  series of
visits will be made in 1990 prior to implementation of the training schemes
in  Algeria.   Terms  of  reference  for  training  in  container-handling
technology are included as Annex 6.  The terms of reference for training
were discussed and confirmed at negotiations.
3.09     Assistance  will  also  be  provided  through  bilateral  aid  for
training in cargo handling in the three port training schools recently
estaLlished in Algiers, Annaba, and Oran.  The scheme has been prepared by
the International Labor Organization and details are available in the
Project File.

Construction Supervision
3.10     Assistance will be provided under the project for the EP of Annaba
to supervise construction of the modular grain storage facility and for the
DIEs of Algiers and Annaba to supervise construction of the new container
berths,  including  relocation of  the water  intake of the SONELGAZ power
plant at Algiers. About 100 man-months will be provided for these purposes.
Studies
3.11.    Additional technical assistance will be provided under the project
for improvements to cost accounting and port tariffs (paras. 2.18 and
'.05).  About 100 man-months of consultants' services will be required for
this purpose.  The project will also finance studies related to the future
development of Algerian ports.  This includes a cereals distribution study
which will define an optimum program for cereals handling through the
ports, taking into account existing inland silos and the pattern of local
production.   A further study will examine  the need  for  establishing  a
marine  repair  facility.   About 60 man-months will be required for these
studies.  Terms of reference for the cost accounting and port tariffs study
are in Annex 5, the cereals study in Annex 7, and the marine repair
facility in Annex 8.  The terms of reference for all three studies were
discussed and confirmed at negotiations.
D. Cost Estimates and Financing
3.12     The  total  cost of  the project  is estimated at DA 1,088 million
equivalent   to  US$127.8 million,   with  a  foreign  exchange   cost   of
US$63 million  (Table 3.1 below).   As such,  the project will account for
about 30% of the total port development program during the period through
1992 (paras. 2.12 and 2.13).  Cost estimates for civil works are based on
detailed engineering and unit prices for similar ongoing marine works in
Algeria.  The unit prices tend to be high when compared with international
price levels as is the case for most  construction work  in Algeria.   As
there has been no competitive bidding for port construction work in recent
years, the introduction of ICB for civil works is expected to result in
somewhat lower prices for the infrastructure components under the project.
Equipment costs are based on recent price experience for similar types of
equipment provided by foreign manufacturers and 10% has been allowed for
spare parts.  Technical assistance costs are based on man-month rates and
include salaries,  fees, international travel and subsistence.   Duties and
taxes are estimated  to amount  to  about  15%  of  total  costs.   Physical
contingencies   of   5%  on  civil   works   have  been  estimated.    Price
contingencies are based on foreign cost increases of 7.0% in 1989, 8.0% in
1990, and 1.5% thereafter until 1993, and on local cost increases of 15%
each year through 1993.  The cost estimates were discussed and confirmed at
negotiations.
3.13     The loan of US$63 million will meet the foreign exchange costs of
civil works and equipment as well as the total cost of training and
studies.  Local costs will be met by the MPW budget for civil works and by
the  EPs  for  equipment.   Because  of  the  numerous  agencies  involved  in
project  implementation  (para.  3.14)  and  the  coordinating  role  of  MOT
therein, the proposed loan will be maue to Government.  However, the latter
will recoup, beginning in 1993, the dinar equivalent of its equipment

investment (total investment in the case of cereals facilities for Annaba)
plus the related actual interest during construction paid by the Government
to the Bank.  Reimbursement will tale place over seven years after three
years of grace; interest will be assessed at the fixed rate of 10%.  The
signing of the Reimbursement Agreements would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.  The financing plan was reviewed during negotiations and the
Government and EPs confirmed their contribution; also, the Government
agreed to provide all funds that may be needed to complete the project.
E. Project Implementation
Implementation
3.14     Eight  different   agencies   will   be   responsible   for   project
implementation - three EPs, under the oversight of MOT and three D!Es at
the Wilaya level, under the oversight of MPW.  Given this relatively large
number of agencies, close coordination will be essential during project
implementation.  Although coordination in port development in recent years
has been inadequate, MOT has now, rightly, taken a stronger lead in
defining the needs for port development and organizes regular meetings to
ensure smooth implementation of the port investment program (para. 1.13).
MOT will continue to take this lead in project matters and will establish
coordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms.    In  particular,  MOT  will  be
responsible for overall coordination of project activities, monitoring of
traffic developments, assisting the EPs in implementing the training
programs, resolving institutional issues, as well as contracting studies
for future phases of port development and for cost accounting and tariff
matters.  As such, MOT will have a prime role in implementing the project
according  to  a  comprehensive  Project  Action  Plan  (para. 3.17).   At
negotiations, agreement was reached on the appointment, by the Government,
of a project coordinator whose qualifications and experience would be
satisfactory to the Bank.  The Government  will  also  provide  the project
coordinator with appropriate resources and staff.
3.15     The  DIEs,  with  support  from  MPW,  will  be  responsible  for
implementing  the  civil  works  components.    Detailed  engineering  work
prepared  by  local  consultants,  Laboratoire  d'Etudes  Maritimes,  under
contract to MPW, has already been substantially completed for the berth
remodelling work in Algiers.  Final engineering and most bidding documents
are substantially complete.  Prequalification is in progress.   Bidding for
civil  works  will  take  place  in  mid-1989,   immediately  after  Board
presentation.   Detailed engineering  for  the Annaba  cereals  facility  is
being completed with bilateral financing provided by the Canadian
International Development Association  (CIDA).   Bidding documents will be
available  by  mid-1989.   The  EP  of  Annaba  will  be  responsible  for
supervising   construction  of   the   cereals   storage   units.    Complete
specifications and bidding documents for equipment have been prepared by
the EPs under the guidance of MOT.  MOT will be responsible for procuring
equipment on a consolidated basis with the assistance of the EPs.  Bidding
will take place in mid-1990. Based on an estimated manufacturing period of
about eight months and on a commissionirg and testing period of thler
months, the first tranche of equipment should be operational by mid-1991 in
Oran and also for use on the existing container terminal  in Algiers.   A



- 24 -
second tranche will be piocured in 1991 for delivery in Algiers and Annaba
in 1992 after completion of the infrastructure works in these two ports.
Technical assistance must be provided for supervising construction of civil
works in Algiers and the cereals handling facility in Annaba.
3.16     MOT will engage a consulting firm to handle  training activities
for container-handling (para. 3.08).
Action Plan
3.17     The Action Plan shown in Annex 1 provides a summary of the main
project objectives and activities, including actions recently taken as well
as timing and responsibilities for various steps to be taken during project
implementation. In particular, the Action Plan provides for:
(a)  the  overall  scope  and  priorities  of  the  port  investment
program  for  the period  1989-92 and presentation of annual
programs to the Bank;
(b)  implementation of a number of studies aimed at defining port
development needs during the next decade;
(c)  institutional  measures  to be  taken to facilitate container
traffic, such as improvements in customs clearance, return of
empty containers, and establishment of appropriate procedures
and documentation;
(d)  a framework for improving the financial viability of the port
enterpuises;
(e)  arrangements  for supporting modern container operations and
for   improving   conventional   port  handling,   particularly
through   the   implementation   of   comprehensive   training
programs; and
(f) a comprehensive program for limiting the environmental impact
of the project.
3.18     During project preparation, agreement was reached on the overall
size and scope of the port investment program through 1991, including the
allocation   of  sufficient  resources  to  undertake  the  modernization,
rehabilitation, and maintenance of existing port facilities.  During loan
negotiations, assurances were obtained that priority would be given to the
rehabilitation, modernization, and maintenance of ports from 1989-92.
Assurances were also obtained that the Government would furnish the draft
annual port investment budget to the Bank, beginning with the 1990 budget.
The content of the Action Plan and the schedule of project implementation
were also discussed and confirmed at negotiations.

F. Procurement
3.19     Four civil works  contracts,  totalling US$73.5 million (including
contingencies) will be of sufficient size to attract foreign contractors.
These will, therefore, be awarded to prequalified contractors in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines for ICB.  They consist of berth construction,
paving work, and road access in Algiers, and berth construction in Annaba.
Paving work in Oran and Annaba, and the cereals storage facilities in
Annaba, totalling about US$21.3 million (including contingencies), will be
let in seven packages under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, in which foreign contractors would be allowed to
bid.   LCB  is  warranted  because  of  the  relatively  simple  nature  and
geographic spread of these works.  Cargo-handling equipment, totalling US$
21.0 million (including contingencies), would be grouped into four contract
packages and procured through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines.  For
procurement of goods through ICB, local suppliers will be allowed a margin
of preference equal to the existing rate of customs duty applicable on
non-exempt  items  or  15%  of  the  cost-insurance-freight  (c.i.f.)  price,
whichever is lower. Specialized maintenance equipment and navigational
aids, totalling US$3.9 million (including contingencies), will be procured
through limited international bidding, on the basis of evaluation and
comparison  of  bids  from  qualified  suppliers  (at  least  six  will  be
invited).    For  contracts   estimated   to  cost  less  than  US$100,000,
procurement will be through international shopping in which written price
quotations will be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers. About
375 man-months   of   consulting   services   for   training,   construction
supervision, and studies will be selected and engaged in accordance with
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. The procurement categories and
respective amounts, including physical and price contingencies, are shown
in Table 3.2.

3.20     All contracts for civil works and those for equipment in excess of
US$500,000 each will be subject to Bank prior review.   These will cover
more  than  90% of estimated  total contract  values.   Other  Bank-financed
contracts  will be subject  to Bank post-award  review.   Although Algerian
competitive bidding procedures are generally acceptable to the Bank, some
procedures are inconsistent with Bank procurement policy and others could
be improved to ensure better competition.   At negotiations, agreement was
reached regarding clarifications and exceptions needed to make the
procedures compatible with the Bank's objectives of ensuring economy,
efficiency, and overall project soundness.
G. Disbursements
3.21     Disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(a) civil works: 48% of total expenditures;
(b)  preparatory works: 100% of foreign expenditures;
(c) equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
equipment and 80% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally; and
(d) training, studies, and construction supervision: 100% of
total expenditures.
3.22     Disbursements will be made against SOEs for eligible expenditures
under  contracts  valued  at  US$250,000  equivalent  or  less.   Supporting
documentation for these will be retained by the Borrower and made available
for  review by  the  Bank  during  supervision.   The annual audits of  the
project accounts will include a separate opinion on the disbursements made
under  the SOE procedure  (para. 2.23).   All other disbursements would be
made against normal documentation submitted  to the Bank.   Agreement  was
reached during negotiations, on satisfactory procedures for disbursements
under SOE.
3.23     To expedite project execution, a Special Account will be opened at
the Central Bank with an authorized allocation of US$7 million (four-month
average of eligible  expenditures).   The  documentation  for  replenishment
requests will follow the same procedures as in para. 3.24.  In addition,
monthly bank statements of the Special Account will accompany replenishment
requests.   Agreement was reached during negotiations on the establishment
and operation of the Special Account, which will also be audited annually
(para. 2.23).
3.24     The closing date of the Bank loan will be December 31, 1995.  The
disbursement schedule shown in Table 5 has been developed from the
implementation schedule shown in Chart 1 and assumes that the loan will be
effective by December 1989 and that the project will be completed by
December 31, 1994.   Disbursements  under  the  First  Port  Project,  which
involved complex civil works components, took six years, alvhough 85% of
the loan was disbursed after four years.  Disbursements under three highway
projects in Algeria have averaged about six years but two of them included
complex new construction components which ran into delays and required
design changes. As most of the civil works included in Lhe proje It ar*



- 27 -
relatively straightforward, they are expected to be completed within four
years.   However,  disbursements  will  be  extended  over  six  years  as  in
previous projects with civil works components supervised by MPW.
H. Project Reporting and Monitoring
3.25     To  facilitate  monitoring  of  project  execution,  agreement  was
reached at negotiations that MOT will: (a) submit quarterly reports to the
Bank  on  project  implementation  and  c,:,enditures   together  with  key
indicators  for  monitoring  progress  of  the  project;  (b) report  on  a
semiannual basis on financial and operational results of port operations
and on selected port performance data; and (c) prepare a project completion
report within six months of the closing date of the loan.
I. Environmental Impact
3.26     The  project   involves   the   rehabilitation   and   upgrading   of
long-established ports and will not have any significant adverse impact
upon the environment.  Specific measures have been included in the Project
Action Plan to minimize the effect of dredging and to reduce pollution from
visiting ships.  About 150,000 m3 of materials are to be dredged from the
port  of  Algiers.   The  disposal  of  dredging  materials will  be done  in
accordance with the relevant MEDPOL convention, which requires  a permit.
Some 400,000 m3 of  sand and gravel  may be dredged  from the mouth of a
river and pumped ashore for further transport to the work site by trucks.
Investigation and analyses were done during project preparation to define
specific measures to avoid significant disturbance to marine ecology in the
port  of  Algiers.   In  addition,  a  limited  amount of rock dredging and
blasting may be expected.   Special provisions, such as  limiting blasting
charges and using micro-delays, will be taken to minimize adverse effects.
During the post-appraisal mission, the Bank was informed that mercury
canisters had been dumped in the port area some ten years ago.  The EP of
Algiers has been given the responsibility to remove these canisters prior
to civil works construction, provision is made in the project for this
preparatory work. Although the project involves no activity related to oil
and gas, the Project Action Plan identifies actions directed to improving
water quality in the ports such as extension of sewerage systems and
rehabilitation of collecting stations for water ballast.  Moreover, through
increased containerization, movements of both vessels and vehicles within
the port are expected to be reduced in relative terms, which in turn will
reduce water and air pollution as well as urban  traffic  congestion.   In
addition,  the  provision  of  a new  road  access  to  the  port  area  will
significantly reduce traffic congestion at the western end of the coastal
expressway  and  on  urban  streets  in  the  immediate  vicinity.   Increased
containerization will also reduce the risk of spillage, spoilage, and
fire.  A modern container terminal will improve the general appearance of
the  port  area.   The  grain  facility  at  Annaba  will  include  necessary
equipment to limit the effects of pollution from dust and explosion risks.
J. Impact on Employment
3.27     The project will reduce the need for labor in the project ports.
The EPs are already anticipating the reductions in force and do not foresee
any major problems with the introduction of modern container-handling
methods, including multiple-shift operations.  Most of the sav5.ngs will be



- 28 -
achieved through attrition, the remainder through redeployment in other
port activities or in other sectors of the economy.   The overall program
will require a reduction of fewer than 400 workers in 1994 (Project File
Document  No. CIO).  This figure is well within a net reduction of about
1,500 workers, which was achieved during 1988, through attrition and early
retirement.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01     The project constitutes a first phase of modernization of Algerian
ports involving the development of specialized facilities in three of the
country's main ports.   This  first  phase,  to  be  implemented  during  the
period 1990-92, will provide an opportunity for traffic developments to be
moiiitored and, if necessary, for appropriate adjustments to be made to
container-handling  methods  and  facilities  under  a  second  phase  of
development during the period 1992-95 (para. 3.04).  Berth facilities and
equipment needs have been established to meet forecast traffic requirements
up to the mid-1990s, taking into account minimum operational requirements
in each of the project ports.
4.02     As  the project  is concerned  primarily with  the introduction of
modern container-handling technology in Algerian ports, the focus of the
traffic  analysis  is  on  general  cargo  traffic  and  the  impact  of
containerization on this traffic.  Although the three project ports handle
about 70% of total general cargo traffic, the.r share of container traffic
is likely to increase to over 75% due to a s.nall amount of diversion from
other  ports  within  the  traffic  shadow of  the project ports.   However,
forecasts for the port of Annaba take into account the effects of the new
port of Djen Djen which is expected to begin operations by the mid-1990s
and which would become the primary container port for the eastern part of
the  country.   For  determining  the requirements of  the proposed  cereals
handling facility in Annaba, prospects for the development of cereals
traffic have been considered only for the eastern part of the country.
B. Traffic Forecasts
Recent Trends
4.03     Following a period of rapid economic growth during the late 1970s
and early 1980s, a falling demand for hydrocarbons in 1985 and the sharp
decline in oil prices in 1986 have had a major impact on the economy. The
growth of GDP fell from about 5% per year during 1980-85 to about 1% or 2%
per year during 1986 and 1987. The real GDP growth rate is now expected to
remain below 2% per year through 1990, a difficult period of readjustment
during which the Government is expected to undertake major structural
reforms. However, the latter should result in increasingly higher growth
rates in the longer term (para. 1.01).
4.04     In  line  with  the  period  of  strong  economic  growth,  imports
increased sharply during 1979-84 at over 11% per year (Table 4.1).  General
cargo traffic imports, comprising mainly manufactured goods and foodstuffs,



- 29 -
increased at about 9% per year while imports of cereals and cement
increased, respectively, at 16% and 27% per year.  During the same period,
exports of oil products remained flat, mineral traffic declined by about
19% per year, and manufactured goods increased slightly at just over 1% per
year.  FLom 1984, imports declined substantially falling by over 25% during
the  three-year  period through 1987.   The decline was particularly marked
for cement and building materials and for manufactured goods, these
commodities  falling by about  60% and 45%,  respectively.   Export traffic
increased for manufactured goods during 1984-87 at a rate of about 13% per
year while bulk exports declined substantially due to the cessation of iron
ore exports from Annaba.

General Cargo
4.05      To stabilize external debt, one of the Government's objectives  is
to reduce imports of intermediate and capital goods to 65% of their peak
1984  levels.    Given  the  recent   substantial   decline   in  imports   of
intermediate and capital goods of about 45%, this traffic is unlikely to
decline further in the future and may even pick up in the next few years.
The recent fall in intermediate and capital goods imports would also be
offset by modest increases in imports of foodstuffs and more substantial
increases in exports, particularly fertilizers and agricultural products.
As such, general cargo traffic as a whole is expected to remain at a level
of about 8 million tons during 1988 and 1989.   However,  in line with an
expected improvement in the economy during the 1990s, overall increases for
both imports and exports of general cargo of about 4% per year are assumed
through 1994 followed by 5% per year in the longer term.
Cereals
4.06      Although imports of cereals increased at about 16% per year from
1979 to 1984, this traffic stabilized in recent years at between 3.7 and
3.9 million tons.   However,  cereals traffic exceeded 5.5 million tons  in
1988 as a result of a poor harvest, most of the increase in traffic being



- 30 -
handled by  the ports of Annaba and Bejaia  (Annex 2, Table 3).  With an
expected population growth rate in excess of 3% per year, imports of
cereals  are  likely to continue  to increase  in the medium term.   About
800,000  tons are normally handled  by  the  eastern  ports  of  Annaba  and
Skikda.  Although Annaba handled 500,000 tons of cereals in 1987, traffic
reached an exceptional level of 900,000 tons in 1988.  With the provision
of better handling facilities allowing larger 60,000-ton bulk cereals
carriers to use the port, this traffic would be handled at a considerable
saving in freight rates.  Although it is expected that the new port of Djen
Djen would handle the bulk of the cereals traffic in the eastern part of
the country from the mid-1990s, improved facilities at Annaba will continue
to provide a supporting role for the distribution of cereals to the Annaba
area and to its immediate hinterland, equivalent to at least 600,000 tons
annually.   However,  sho ld  the  need  arise,  a  part  of  the  unloading
equipment provided at An aba could be transferred to Djen Djen when this
port comes into operation.
Other Traffic
4.07     Forecasts of other traffic have only been considered  in general
terms   for  obtaining  a  complete  picture  of  possible  port  traffic
developments in the medium term.  Exports of oil products have generally
remained  flat  over  the  past  decade  at  around  55 million tons  and  are
expected  to  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.   Similarly,  exports  of
phosphates other than fertilizers are expected to remain at about
300,000 tons.  Imports of bulk commodities, such as coal and wood, are not
expected to show substantial increases, remaining at around 1.2 million
tons and 550,000 tons, respectively.  As a whole, commodities other than
general cargo and cereals are assumed to remain at their 1986 levels
through 1994.
Container Utilization
4.08     Details  of  the  methodology  used  to  establish  forecasts  of
container traffic are given in Annex 2.  Based on a detailed analysis of
the physical characteristics of the major cargo categories, it is estimated
that just over 50% of general cargo handled by Algerian ports is suitable
for containerization. As such, cargo that can be containerized amounted to
about 4.3 million tons  in 1986 (Table 4.2).  At present only 8% of this
traffic is containerized compared with levels of about 50% in Morocco and
over 30% in Turkey.  It is assumed that without the development of modern
facilities, container utilization would increase only slowly in the future
in line with recent trends, reaching a threshold level of about 12% or 13%
during the 1990s.  However, with the provision of specialized facilities,
port users are expected to shift to container technology rapidly, reaching
21% of cargo that can be containerized in 1991, 27% in 1994, and 35% in
2000  (Table 4.2).   These  forecasts are based on previous experience  in
container port development and take into account the nature of the main
shipping  routes  serving  Algerian  ports.   In  particular,  the  rate  of
containerization has been analyzed separately for the three main groups of
shipping routes, namely the routes serving Mediterranean ports, those
serving the Atlantic ports of Western Europe, and those serving other areas
of the world.  For each of these routes, the competition from other forms
of handling has been considered, particularly from roll-on, roll-of;
traffic on the short Mediterranean routes connecting Algeria with souther:
France, Italy, and Spain.

4.09     The  traffic  forecasts  show  that total containerized cargo would
increase for the three main ports from a current level of 300,000 tons to
just over 800,000 tons in 1991, 1.1 million tons in 1994, and 2 million
tons  in  2000.   Based  on  initial  average  loads  of  10  tons  per  full
container, increasing to 11 tons in 1994 and 12 tons in 2000, and
considering the direction of the main flows, total container movements
would increase from 60,000 TEU in 1986 to about 150,000 TEU in 1991,
180,000 TEU in 1994, and 300,000 TEU in 2000 (Table 4.3).  This represents
an average growth rate of about 15% per year through 1994 followed by a
rate of about  8% in  the  longer  term.   Finally,  forecasts  of  container

traffic that would use the new terminals as opposed to continued use of the
existing conventional berths, take into account the expected mix of ship
types over each of the three main groups of shipping routes.  In this way,
it is expected that on average about 65% of the total forecast container
traffic in 1991/92 would be handled by the proposed new facilities,
increasing to about 75% in 1994 and about 80% in 2000.  Details are given

C. Project Benefits
General
4.10     The  main  benefits  accruing  to  port  users  resulting  from  the
introduction of container-handling facilities are savings in ships' service
time and reductions  in overall  cargo handling  costs.   These  savings  are
ultimately passed on to producers and consumers in the form of lower freight
rates. The project will have a marked effect on rates for cargoes otherwise
handled as general cargo with major reductions in the time ships spend at
the berth.   The provision  of a specialized  cereals  handling  facility at



- 33 -
Annaba will allow access to large 60,000-ton bulk carriers, bringing
substantial  savings on freight rates for cereals traffic.   Other benefits
such as reductions in ships' *iaiting time, net reductions in cargo losses,
savings in packaging costs, and the value of increased security, have not
been  assessed.   Recent  port  operating  statistics  indicate  that  ships'
waiting time is now negligible.  Moreover, with recent improvements in port
productivity and the construction of new berth facilities at Bejaia and the
ongoing program at Djen Djen, ships' waiting time is expected to remain at
reasonable levels during the next decade.  By limiting the quantification of
benefits to ships' service time and handling cost savings, the evaluation
has understated total benefits and, therefore, the rate of return.
Main Assumptions
4.11     The following describes the main pararneters and assumptions used in
the economic evaluation: further information on each of the parameters used
in the analysis is shown in Annex 3 and additional details are in Project
File Documents Nos. C4 to C9.
(a)  Ship Costs.  Four  typical  ship types have been selected as
representative of those employed or expected to be employed on
traffic  to and  from Algeria.   Estimated  costs  per day have
been  derived  using  the  Bank  Ship  Cost  Model.   Currently,
general cargo traffic is handled by conventional vessels in
the range of 8,000 DWT for Algerian vessels and up to
16,000 DWT  for  foreign  shipping  lines.   Ro-Ro  traffic  is
handled by vessels in the range of 2,000-3,500 DWT for
Algerian vessels and up to 6,000 DWT for multipurpose ships
operated by foreign lines.  On balance, a 12,000 DWT ship has
been taken as representative for general cargo traffic with an
estimated  daily  cost  of  DA 47,600  (US$7,000).   For  Ro-Ro
vessels, a typical daily cost has been estimated at DA 41,500
(US$6,100).   Given  the  forecast  container  traffic  and  a
reasonable frequency of sailings on each route, most container
ships will handle some 300 to 400 TEU per trip.  This implies
an average capa'ity per ship in the range of about 400-500
TEU.    However,  foreign  lines  are  likely  to  group  their
traffic and will tend to operate ships up to a capacity of
about 1,000 TEU.  On this basis, an average cost per day for
container   ships  is  estimated  at  DA  59,800   (US$8,800).
Finally, multipurpose general cargo and container vessels of
up to 16,000 DWT are expected to operate many of the longer
haul  routes;   their   estimated   daily   cost   is  DA 59,800
(US$8,800).   A detailed analysis  according to ship types is
given in Project File Document Nos. C2 and C7.
(b)  Cargo Handling  Rates  - Ships'  Service  Time.   Based  on  the
forecast distribution of traffic by type of vessel and by type
of berth and given the corresponding berth throughputs, the
total time taken to load and unload cargoes can be estimated
in the "with project" and  "without  project"  scenarios.   The
difference between the two scenarios provides the estimated
savings in ships' time that constitute the main basis for the
economic  justification.   Calculations  of ships'  service time
are based on an analysis of conventional cargo handling rates



- 34 -
in Algerian ports.  These rates are currently in the range of
210-350 tons per day for break bulk cargo in the three project
ports but they are expected to improve somewhat in the future
with the implementation of cargo handling training programs.
Moreover, even if container facilities were not developed, an
increasing  share  of  conventional  general  cargo  would  be
handled in the future as Ro-Ro traffic at much higher levels
of  productivity.   These  higher  levels  of productivity have
been taken into account in the "without project" scenario.
Ro-Ro rates are currently in the rarge of 1,200 tons per day
while container rates range from 1,200 tons per day on
conventional berths up to an expected 2,150 tons per day using
specialized facilities.   These rates are assumed to increase
overall by 10% in 1994 and by 20% in 2000. Details of various
throughputs are given in Annex 3.
(c)  Cargo Handling Costs - Algerian ports.   Cargo handling costs
have been estimated based on actual labor costs provided by
the EPs, taking into account typical gang sizes and the number
of gangs required for various operations.  Smaller gangs have
been assumed for container operations than for conventional
general cargo.   Based on forecast hourly throughputs and the
estimated hourly costs of labor, the net savings in handling
costs for container traffic are estimated at about DA 33
(US$4.80) per ton compared with conventional break bulk
cargo.  Similar savings of about DA 30 per ton can be achieved
with roll-on, roll-off traffic compared with conventional
general cargo.  On the other hand, operating and maintenance
costs for container-handling equipment are estimated to be
about three times the corresponding costs for conventional
equipment, equivalent annually to about 15% of the initial
capital costs.   The net incremental operating and maintenance
cosLs are estimated at about 10% of the initial capital costs
and they have been included in the project cost streams
(para. 4.13).
(d)  Cargo Handling Costs - Foreign Ports.  By increasing the rate
of containerization, the project will lead to reductions in
cargo  handling  costs  in  foreign  ports.   Savings  in  port
tariffs have been used to estimate the corresponding benefits
to producers, consumers, and shipping agents.  These estimates
are based on information available for Mediterranean and
Western  European  ports.    Typical  rates  for  conventional
general cargo and for container traffic in European ports are
about DA 150 (US$22) per ton and DA 109 (US$16) per ton,
respectively.
(e)  Cargo  Handling  Costs  -  Return  of  Empty  Containers.   The
handling of empty containers is an additional cost that must
be taken into account and otherwise would not be necessary for
conventional traffic.  These costs have been deducted from the
handling costs savings for container operations.   Based on a
throughput of 15 rEU per hour and hourly labor costs of
DA 730,   the  cost   per  empty  container  is  about  DA 50
(US$7.35).  The corresponding tariffs in typical foreign ports
are in the order of DA 250 (US$37) per container.



- 35 -
Distribution of Benefits
4.12     Algerian  shipping  lines  currently  handle  about  40%  to  50%  of
containerized cargo.  On this basis, it is expected that initially at least
half  of  the  savings  in  ships'  service  time  would  accrue  directly  to
Algeria.   Vessels currently being chartered for general cargo traffic would
gradually be replaced by chartered container ships.  A part of the savings
to foreign shipping lines would accrue to Algeria as a result of slower
increases  in sea freight  rates.   For  this  reason,  it  is  conservatively
assumed that the share of savings in ships' service time accruing to Algeria
would increase to 60% by 1994.  These  savings would be  reflected  in the
lower cost of  imports and  in increased competitiveness  of exports.   For
handling cost savings, only 75% are assumed to accrue to the project in view
of the uncertainties as to whether labor cost savings would be achievred in
full. Again this is considered to be a conservative assumption as future
savings  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through  attrition  as  well  as
redeployment to other port activities (para. 3.27).  Similarly, only 50% of
savings in handling costs in foreign ports are expected to accrue to
Algeria, the remainder being retained by foreign shippers and suppliers.
Finally, the savings on charters for cereals traffic expected to accrue to
Algeria are estimated in the range of US$8 to US$12 per ton equivalent.
D. Project Costs
4.13     The project  costs used  in the economic  evaluation  include  port
infrastructure costs, equipment costs, and incremental operating and
maintenance costs.  As the proposed road access to the port of Algiers would
serve other traffic in the port as well as relieve traffic congestion in
general in the port area, only one-third of the estimated cost has been
allocated to evaluation of the container port development.  Infrastructure
costs are based on detailed engineering and unit prices currently applied to
negotiated contracts in Algeria.  With competitive bidding for these works,
infrastructure costs are expected to be lower than those retained for the
economic evaluation and the rate of return is probably understated.
Equipment costs are based on recent cost experience for similar  types of
equipment.  The specific costs of technical assistance and training have not
been included in the evaluation, as the benefits of this would extend far
beyond the first phase of container port development.  All costs used in the
evaluation are expressed net of taxes and duties.
E. Results of Evaluation
4.14     Costs associated with ships' service time and cargo handling costs
have been estimated for the "with project" and "without project" scenarios
for each of the three project ports and the appropriate cost-benefit streams
have been developed (Annex 2).  Costs and benefits have been estimated over
a 20-year period, taking into account the need to renew equipment, with 1992
assumed to represent the first year of operation.   Replacement costs have
been included for container-handling equipment and residual values have been
allowed for infrastructure investments and equipment at the end of the
evaluation period.  For the ports of Algiers and Oran, estimates of benefits
have been limited to those accruing to container traffic. However, the port
of Annaba will be able to handle an additional 100,000 tons per year of



- 36 -
Ro-Ro traffic for which specific benefits have been estimated (see Project
File Document No. C.9).  Overall, savings in ships' service time represent
about 65% of total benefits, with handling cost savings in Algerian ports
accounting for a further 25% to 30%. Benefits have been held constant after
traffic has reached the estimated capacity of the proposed facilities,
generally from the year 2000 onwards.   However, a provision has been made
for procurement of some additional equipment in 1995 to handle the expected
increases in traffic up to 2000.  The rate of return on the Annava cereals
facility has been estimated for a ten-year period only, with operations
beginning in 1992.  This would allow a poss.ible transfer of the facility to
Djen Djen thereafter.
4.15     The propused container port development program shows an overall ER
of about 17%, with individual ERs ranging from 14% to 18%. All the schemes
continue to show ERs in excess of 10% under assumptions of a 20% increase in
costs, or a 20% decrease in benefits. Tthe ER on the Annaba cereals facility
is estimated  to exceed 30%.   The  estimated  savings  in  foreign  exchange
generated by the container port program would reach about US$7 million per
year by 1994, while the Annaba cereals facility would generate savings of at
least US$5 million per year.

4.16     The relatively modest ERs obtained for the container port program
reflect the fact that in all cases the proposed civil works represent a
minimum program which will also serve for future phases of development.  The
ERs must also be considered as conservative estimates in view of the high
infrastructure cost estimates used in the evaluation.  However, actual costs
are likely to come in lower with competitive bidding under the project
(paras. 3.12 and 4.13).
F. Project Risk
4.17     The estimated pace at which port users will  shift  to container
technology  represents  the  main  risk  in  the  viability  of  the  proposed
container port development program.   However,  the assumptions made  in the
traffic analysis, which involve rates of containerization for the three
project ports as a whole of about 29% in 1994 and 38% in 2000, are
conservative   when   compared   with   experience   in  other  Mediterranean
countries. This assumes that general cargo traffic not in containers would
continue to increase slightly over the next 15 years, although this traffic
would be increasingly handled using Ro-Ro technology.   The rate of growth



- 37 -
for container traffic of about 15% per year through 1994 followed by a rate
of 8% in the longer term, represents a reasonable pattern of development.
Even if this growth were reduced to an overall rate of only 10% per year,
all project ports would continue to show ERs in excess of 10%.
4.18     For the Annaba cereals facility, the proposed investment will still
yield an ER above 10% even if the facility only operated for a period of
four years.   In addition, the high speed cereals unloader could ultimately
be transferred to the new port of Djen Djen and the modular storage units
converted for the use of other commodities.   There is, therefore, little
risk in this operation.
4.19     Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted  to  test  the
effects on the viability of project components of a substantial change in
the dinar exchange rate.   The share of foreign exchange expenditures  in
project costs and benefits has been estimated and then converted into border
prices assuming a variation in the value of the dinar of 50%.  Although this
change  affects  costs and benefits  in a similar manner,  the much higher
foreign exchange component in project benefits, largely ship costs, gives
substantially higher ERs ranging from 20% to 28%.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Past Financial Performance
Income Accounts
5.01     The  individual  and  consolidated  Income  Statements  of  the  ten
existing Port Enterprises (EPs) for the period 1983-87 appear in Annex 4.
5.02     About   90%  of  the  revenues,  consisting  of  cargo  handling,
stevedoring,  and service charges are set by  interministerial  decree  and
collected by the EPs, while the remainder, port and wharfage dues, are set
under the "Loi de Finances" and collected by Customs for the account of the
EPs.  Reflecting a decline in port traffic in recent years, revenues have
declined from DA 1.6 billion in 1983 to about DA 1.2 billion in 1987.
Overall in the period under review, revenues dropped by about 24%, while the
revenues of the three EPs included in the project - Oran, Algiers and
Annaba - decreased by about 18%, 26%, and 17% respectively.
5.03     Salaries and wages represent the EPs' major expense.  in the period
1983 to 1987,  they  increased  from  about  52%  to  62%  of  revenues.   The
reduction of personnel - about 10% in the last two years - was more than
offset by an even more rapid drop in traffic and the effect of the 1985
salary  adjustment,  which averaged about  13%.   Other expenditures,  except
depreciation, were in line with the volume of activity.  Depreciation has
been understated mainly because some assets have not been totally accounted
for or have not been properly valued.  This stems from the fact that some
EPs have been created or spun off from the former central organization only
recently.  Comprehensive actions to improve the accounting and valuation of
the EPs' fixed assets is included in the Action Plan.



- 38 -
5.04      Reflecting the above-mentioned drop in revenues, the working ratio
for all EPs combined (expenses other than depreciation divided by revenues)
went from about .72 in 1983 to .81 in 1987.  In this respect, not all EPs
fared equally.  The three EPs included  in the project - Oran, Algiers and
Annaba - ended the period with working ratios of .84, 1.08 and .79
respectively, which also roughly reflected the drop in their revenues.
Balance Sheets
5.05      The  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  the  period  1983-1987  are
presented in Annex 4.  As mentioned earlier in the discussion of the income
accounts, the current data are incomplete, and the EPs need to improve their
accounting  for fixed assets.   In particular, cost accounting  systems will
have to be installed or upgraded.  Implementation of the measures included
in the Action Plan will help the EPs to institute appropriate accounting and
control systems.  Consolidated figures show that the bulk of the EPs' fixed
assets were either constructed or acquired in the past few years, the
amounts on the books having reached about DA 604 million at the end of the
period  under  review.   The  period  ended  with  normal  inventory  levels,
somewhat high  combined  receivables  and prepaid expenses, and satisfactory
cash on hand.  The current ratio went from 1.4 in 1983 to 1.8 in 1987, while
the debt to debt and equity ratio went from 36% to 31%.
B.  Future Financial Performance
5.06      Financial  projections  are  presented  in  Annex 4.   The  EPs  are
expected to be granted a much greater measure of financial autor.omy in the
short term, including the ability to adjust their tariffs more freely than
in the past. Furthermore, at negotiations it was agreed that the Government
would carry out d tariff study not later than December 31, 1991 and furnish
the Bank for review and comments the findings and recommendations of such
study with a view to meeting the financial objectives agreed upon for the
three  project EPs.  These  objectives  foresee  the  setting  of tariffs  and
charges to produce revenues sufficient to maintain:  (a) starting in 1992,
working ratios of at least 0.75 for Oran, 0.90 for Algiers and 0.75 for
Annaba; and (b) starting in 1993, a debt service coverage ratio of at least
2.0 on the debt incurred in the financing of each of the container and grain
handling and storing facilities.
5.07     Projeccions  were  made  in  constant  terms,  reflecting  only  the
expected  changes  in  the  volume  of  activity.   On  this  basis  alone,  the
working ratio of the sector as a whole should go from .81 in 1987 to .82 in
1991.  In the same period, the working ratios for Oran, Algiers, and Annaba
would improve from .84 to .76, 1.08 to .94 and .79 to .75 respectively.  The
trend indicates that the working ratio objective is attainable but sensitive
to revenue changes.  On the same basis, the projections also indicate that
the debt service coverage ratio would remain well over 2.0 with the
exception noted below.  A sensitivity analysis (Annex 4) shows that it would
take revenue decreases of about 20% for Oran and Annaba and more than 40%
for Algiers to obtain debt service coverage ratios below 2.0.  In the case
of the Annaba cereals handling facility, a ratio slightly below 1.0 would be
achieved.  Gradual rate  increases  (with respect to current rates) reaching
70% in the first year of full operation would allow Annaba to reach the 2.0
target (see para. 5.08).



- 39 -
5.08     The rate of return on net fixed assets was calculated for the major
project components using revenues and expenses expressed in constant terms.
This calculation shows that returns would reach 13% and 18% by 1995 in Oran
and Algiers, respectively, which is satisfactory; and 12% for Annaba's
container traffic, and about 10% for the first full year of operation of the
cereals facility, taking account of gradual rate increases that would reach
an overall 100% increase (with respect to current rates) in the first year
of full operation of the facility.   This overall increase would represent
only about half of the estimated ocean freight savings resulting from the
use of larger vessels, which have been estimated in the range of US$8 to
US$12 per ton (para. 4.12). The resulting margin represents benefits of the
proposed facility which would be passed on to cereals importers and the
final consumer.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During loan negotiations, the Bank and the Borrower agreed on the
project objectives and description (para. 3.04) and the project monitoring
and reporting requirements  (para. 3.25).  Agreement was also obtained from
the Borrower on the following points of particular significance:
(a) a study on cost accounting, fixed assets valuation, and
tariffs will be carried out by December 31, 1991, with the
assistance of consultants, and the results of the study
furnished to the Bank for review and comments (para. 2.18);
(b)  satisfactory   external   audits   of   EP   accounts,   project
expenditures  and  the  Special  Account  will  be  carried  out
(para. 2.23);
(c)  priority will be given to the rehabilitation,  modernization,
and   maintenance   of   ports   during   the   period   1989-92
(para. 3.18);
(d) the draft annual port investment budgets will be furnished to
the Bank, beginning with the FY 1990 Budget (para. 3.18); and
(e)  appropriate   measures   will   be   taken,   including   tariff
increases, to reach the financial objectives specified in the
Project Agreements;  to wit, working ratios of  .90,  .75, and
.75, respectively for the EPs of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba,
from FY 1992 onwards and debt service coverage ratios of at
least 2.0 on the debt incurred in the financing of each
container, grain-handling, and storage facility (para. 5.06).
6.02     During negotiations,  the content of  the Project Action Plan was
discussed and confirmed (Annex 1).  The Plan outlines the port  investment
program during the period 1989-1991, policies regarding revaluation,
depreciation,   and  transfer  of  fixed  assets  to  the  EPs,   including
responsibility for maintenance, and a comprehensive program to minimize the
environmental impact of the project.



- 40 -
6.03     Signing of Reimbursement Agreements between the Government and the
EPs, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of effectiveness
(para. 3.13).
6.04     With the agreements reached on the above, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$63 million to the Government of Algeria.

Traffic Forecasts /1
Recent Developments
1.      In 1987, Algerian ports handled a  total  of  75 million  tons  of
traffic, including about 59 million tons of oil products, 8 million tons of
bulk cargo and 8 million tons of general cargo (Table 1 of this Annex).
Apart from exports of crude oil and petroleum products amounting to about
56 million tons in 1987, imports dominate port traffic.   Imports in 1987
included 3.9 million tons of cereals, 2 million tons of cement and building
materials, and 5.8 million tons of general cargo. Exports of general cargo
in  the  same  year  amounted  to  only  2.2 million tons.   Six major ports
--Algiers, Oran, Annaba, Skikda, Bejaia and Mostaganem-- account for over
90% of total port traffic, excluding oil products.  Moreover, only three
ports --Algiers, Oran and Annaba-- handle about 70% of general cargo
traffic (Table 2 of this Annex).
2.      Port traffic has declined from a peak of 78 million tons in 1984 of
which 57 million tons were oil products. This decline has been felt mainly
in imports of cement, metal products, and manufactured goods. It reflects
the restrictions on imports which followed the slowdown in hydrocarbon
exports in 1985 and the subsequent decline in hydrocarbon prices in 1986.
While imports of intermediate and capital goods had increased at over 6%
per year during the decade up to 1984, this traffic fell from 5.3 million
tons in 1984 to 2.9 million tons in 1987, a reduction of 45X.  During the
same period imports of cement and building materials fell from 4.1 million
tons to 1.5 million tons, a reduction of over 602.   On the other hand,
imports of bulk cereals and other food products have been unaffected by the
slowdown in the economy.  In 1987, cereals imports reached 3.9 million tons
and foodstuffs about 2.8 million tons, both representing a slight increase
over imports in 1984. However, cereals imports exceeded 5.5 million ton in
1988 because of a poor harvest, most of the increase being handled by the
ports  of  Annaba  and  Bejaia  (Table  3  of  this  Annex).   Exports  of
agricultural products are insignificant and have remained stagnant in
recent years at around 260,000 tons.  On the other hand, there has been a
regular increase in export of manufactured goods which amounted to about
2.2 million tons in 1987. Overall, general cargo exports have increased at
over '2 per year from 1979 to 1984 followed by a higher growth rate of 13%
per year since 1984.

3.       Of the current general cargo traffic of about 8 million tons, only
340,000 tons or about 4% are containerized.   This represents a very low
figure compared with other Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and
Morocco where 15 to 20% of general cargo is containerized (para. 4).
Nevertheless, containerized cargo in Algerian ports has shown a regular
increase during the last decade of about 14% per year up to 1984. Moreover,
container traffic has not shown a significant decline in the past two
years.   Actually,  despite  the recent decline  in general  cargo  imports,
containerization has continued to penetrate this traffic, particularly in
the ports of Algiers and Oran.

4.       Estimates  of  containerizable  cargo  have  been  derived  from  an
assessment of the physical characteristics of the major cargo categories
and  their  suitability  for  containerization.   The  estimates  have  been
derived from 1986 traffic levels which, following the recent substantial
decline in import traffic, reflect reasonable base line figures (para. 5).
The main categories of goods suitable for containerization include most
foodstuffs, manufactured goods, and certain bagged goods including refined
sugar, coffee, as well as some fertilizers and chemical products.   Other
cargoes such as cement, coal, minerals, grain, bulk liquids, wood, crude
sugar, flour and large metallic goods have been held to be unsuitable for
containerization.  Containerizable cargo in 1986 is estimated at about 4.3
million tons or just over 50% of total general cargo.  At present, only 8%
of this containerizable traffic is containerized compared to about 50% in
Morocco and about 30% in Turkey.
Traffic Forecasts
5.       Traffic forecasts have been derived based on underlying trends and
recent macro-economic  projections  for the Algerian economy.   Medium-term
forecasts assume that the impact of the decrease in oil prices will be
absorbed through reductions in consumption, investment, and government
expenditures.  To stabilize external debt, imports would need to be reduced
to about 65% of previous peak levels,  at  least until  1990.   GDP growth
rates through 1990 would not exceed 2% per year but would increase to 5 or
6% per year in the longer term. Given the recent decline of about 45% in
imports of intermediate and capital goods, this traffic is unlikely to fall
any further and should  pick  up  in  the next  few years.   In  addition,



- 52 -
Annex 2
Page 3 of 5
this decrease in intermediate and capital goods imports would be offset
partly by modest increases in imports of foodstuffs and more substantial
increases in exports of manufactured goods.   On this basis,  the overall
volume of containerizable cargo is expected to remain fairly constant
through 1989 at about 4.3 million tons.  However, traffic is expected to
increase again during the 1990s and overall increases of 4% per year have
been retained through 1994 followed by 5% per year in the longer term.
These  rates  are in line with the expected developments  in the economy
following a period of structural reform.  Table 3 of this Annex summarizes
the forecasts for the main categories of containerizable cargo.
Container Penetration
6.       The  extent  to  which  suitable  cargoes  will  containerize  is
difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy. This depends on a number
of factors such as competition from other forms of handling, competition
among shipping lines for container services and the availability of back
loads. While the lack of back loads is a constraint, the current low level
of containerization in Algeria is indicative of a major potential for
future growth.   In establishing  forecasts,  the above aspects have been
considered for each major port hinterland.
7.       In the "without project" scenario, it is assumed there would be
some increases in the efficiency of handling Algerian foreign trade.  In
addition to the development of Ro-Ro traffic, there will be increasing
pressure by foreign exporters and shippers on Algerian consignees to use
containers in the future.  Similarly, Algerian exporters will face similar
pressure from foreign consignees who will only accept shipments in
containers.    As   such,   it   is   expected   that   the   penetration   of
containerizable cargo would continue in line with recent trends but would
reach a threshold level of about 12-l4% of total containerizable cargo
during the 1990s.   Beyond this there would be no further penetration of
containerizable cargo. Total containerized cargo would therefore increase
from about 340,000 tons at present to about 690,000 tons in 1994, an
average annual increase of about 9% which is in line with past trends
(Table 5 of this Annex).
8.       With the provision of specialized container handling facilities
and concomitant improvements in freight forwarding, documentation, customs
clearance, and payment of demurrage charges on containers, penetration of
containerizable cargo will increase rapidly in the next few years.   The
rate of penetration has been examined for each major port based on an
analysis of the origin and destination of containerizable cargo and the
related availability of competing forms of handling.  For this reason, it
has been necessary to analyze traffic developments over three main types of
route, namely Mediterranean traffic including France and Spain, Atlantic
coast ports of Western Europe, and traffic to other parts of the world.
Trade is expected to develop primarily in favor of other areas of the world
with the share of Mediterranean and Western European traffic declining
slightly.

9.       Atlantic Coast Traffic - Western Europe.  These routes offer the
greatest scope for container traffic and are expected to reach a level of
containerization of about 40% for containerizable manufactured goods and
25% for foodstuffs by 1994. Such rates have been exceeded in Morocco, only
a short time after introducing dedicated container handling facilities.
10.      Mediterranean  Traffic.    These  short  routes  offer  the  least
possibilities for rapid development of container traffic because of
competition  from  roll-on,  roll-off  (Ro-Ro)  traffic.    The  level  of
containerization in 1994 for manufactured goods is unlikely to exceed 30%
and foodstuffs 20%.
11.      Other Traffic.  Containerization on other routes is likely to make
a  slow   start   as   traffic   volumes   will   remain   small.    However,
containerization could develop in the longer term particularly as many
American and Japanese shipping lines operate large numbers of multipurpose
vessels.  Rates of 35% for manufactured goods and 20% for foodstuffs have
been adopted for 1994.
12.      In  view  of  the  dominance  of  import  traffic,  there  will  be
considerable pressure to use return containers for export traffic. Despite
the low volumes, relatively high rates of containerization are expected
therefore for export traffic.
13.      Assumptions on the expected penetration of containerizable cargo
in the with project scenario are summarized in Table 6 of this Annex.
Based on these assumptions, container traffic forecasts in the with project
scenario are shown in Table 7 of this Annex.  The level of containerization
would   increase   overall   from  the  current   level  of   about   8%  of
containerizable cargo to about 21% in 1991, 27% in 1994, and 35% in 2000.
Containerized cargo would increase at about 15% per year through 1994
followed by a rate of 8% per year up to 2000.

14.      Part of the forecast container traffic will continue to be handled
on conventional berths as some containers will continue to be shipped on
conventional vessels. To assess the share of container traffic likely to
be handled by the proposed facilities, it is necessary to analyze the mix
and likely evolution of ship types on each of the three major groups of
shipping  routes  and for each of  the thi-; main ports.   In particular,
modern container ships will dominate container traffic with the Atlantic
coast ports of Western Europe.  However, on the Mediterranean routes, Ro-Ro
vessels will handle the bulk of the container traffic although some of
these vessels will carry containers on deck and would be handled by the
proposed terminals. Multipurpose vessels are likely to dominate container
traffic with other areas of the world and these would be handled directly
at the proposed new terminals.   Table 8 of this Annex   summarizes  the
overall assumptions on the mix of ship types for each of the main routes
and the distribution of containerized tonnage. Detailed estimates for each
of the ports are given in Project File Document No. C3.
Initially, it is assumed that all container ships, half of Ro-Ro vessels
and 80b of the multipurpose vessels would be handled by the new terminals.
However, the share of Ro-Ro vessels and multipurpose vessels handled by
these terminals would increase gradually in the future. Conventional ships
would not be handled by the new facilities.  These assumptions have been
used in estimating the distribution of forecast container traffic between
the specialized terminals and existing conventional berths for each of the
three main ports. These forecasts are summarized in Table 9 of this Annex.

THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Introduction
1.       This annex describes the main steps and assumptions used in the
economic evaluation of the proposed container port program in the ports of
Algiers, Oran, and Annaba.   Further details  are  given  in  Project  File
Documents  Nos.  C4  to C10.   The economic  evaluation is limited to the
effects of the first phase of container port development during the period
1989-92.   Equipment requirements have therefore been established to meet
the forecast container throughput for the mid-1990s.   A second phase of
development is expected to be required during the period 1993-95.   All
costs and benefits have been estimated using early 1989 prices.
Economic Benefits
2.       Benefits will accrue to port users primarily through the impact of
the project on cargo handling rates, with consequent reductions in the time
ships spend at berth and hence in sea freight rates.  Savings will also
accrue through some reductions in cargo handling costs both in Algerian
ports  and  in  foreign  ports  handling  Algerian  trade.   These  benefits
translate into major savings in foreign exchange on a large part of
Algerian foreign trade, particularly though reductions in the cost of
imports and through increased incentives and competition for exports. The
provision of a phased program of container port development will also defer
the possible need for investments in new infrastructure in the longer term
that might otherwise be needed for conventional general cargo traffic.
Similarly,  the  development  of  container  facilities  will  also  reduce
potential congestion in the ports in the future.  However, such benefits
have not been included in the analysis, nor have other effects such as
reduced losses on cargoes, the premium attached to increased security and
the possible impact on export markets of containerization.
Cost of Ships' Time
3.       The main basis of the analysis is to estimate the time taken by
ships to load and unload their cargoes in the "with project" and "without
project" scenarios.  Ships' service time has been estimated using typical
cargo  handling  rates  in  Algerian  ports.   Total  ship  costs  are  then
estimated taking into account the operating costs of typical vessels
currently handling or expected to be handling Algerian traffic.
4.       Currently about 30% of Algerian general cargo traffic is handled
by Ro-Ro vessels which are particularly adapted to short-haul Mediterranean
traffic. The share of this traffic will continue to increase in parallel



- 65 -
Annex 3
Page 2 of 6
with  the  development  of  container  traffic.   Moreover,  a  part  of  the
container traffic will in fact be carried on Ro-Ro vessels.  These vessels
are typically about 100 to 150 meters in length and range from 2,000 DWT to
6,000 DWT, the latter generally being multipurpose vessels handling both
Ro-Ro trailers and containers.   As Ro-Ro  traffic  increases,  conventional
general cargo vessels will handle a decreasing share of traffic in the
future.  This traffic will be handled mainly by vessels in the range of
8,000 up to 16,000 DWT, the larger vessels being operated mainly by
European shipping  lines.   Most  container traffic  in the future will be
carried by specialized container ships, particularly on routes to and from
the Atlantic ports of Western Europe. Given the expected volume of traffic
and tthe need to maintain a reasonable frequency of sailings, these vessels
will carry 300 to 350 TEU per trip to and from at least two Algerian ports
(Algiers and Annaba or Algiers and Oran). The capacity of these vessels is
therefore likely to be in the range of 400-500 TEU.  European carriers will
tend to group their traffic to North Africa and operate larger vessels in
the rarge of 1,000 to 1,200 TEU.   Finally, long haul routes will see the
use of multipurpose general cargo/container vessels of about 16,000 DWT.
Typical costs for these vessels have been derived from the Bank's Ship Cost
Model as follows:

6.       Current  levels  of  productivity  for  conventional  general  cargo
traffic are fairly low, although they have improved somewhat with the
elimination of  part  of direct  delivery  handling.   These  rates  average
between 210 and 300 tons per day (12 hours). However, Ro-Ro rates are much
higher, ranging from 1,980 tons per day in Annaba, to over 3,000 tons per
day  in  Algiers  for  traffic  handled  on  trailers.   In  contrast,  Ro-Ro
handling rates for general cargo not on trailers are about 540 tons per
day.  For the purpose of estimating ships' time a typical rate of 240 tons
per day has been adopted for conventional general cargo traffic and 1,800
tons per day for Ro-Ro traffic.  These correspond respectively to rates of
20 tons per hour and 150 tons per hour, each with one gang per shift.
7.       Typical handling rates for container  traffic  for various vessel
and berth categories, assuming average loads of 10 tons, are shown below:
Container Handling Rates
Conventional Berth         Ro-Ro Berth          Container Berth
Ship Type      TEU/  Gangs/  tons/   TEU/  Gangs/  tons/   TEU/  Gangs/  tons/

Ro-Ro            -      -              10     1.0    1,200    7.5   1.5   1,350
Container Ship  -       -        -      -      -       -       10    1.8   29150
Multipurpose    6.7   1.5    1,200    -        -       -       7.5   1.5   1,350
8.       With a gradual increase in average container loads from 10 tons to
12 tons together with increases in productivity, these rates are assumed to
increase by 10% in 1994 and by 202 in 2000.  Typical rates for handling empty
containers are around 15 TEU per hour.
Cargo Handling Costs - Algerian Forts
9.       Somewhat  smaller  gangs  will  be  possible  with  modern  container
operations than with conventional cargo traffic. Taking into account typical
cargo handling rates and the costs per gang hour, the following costs per ton
of cargo have been established:
Typical Cargo Handling Labor Costs: DA/hour
Labor        Throughput          Cost per
Cost       Tons/gang hour           ton
General Cargo
Conventional Berth            730             20                 36.5
Ro-Ro Berth                   336            150                  2.2

10.      Equipment operating and maintenance costs are estimated annually
to be about 15% of the initial capital costs for the container handling
equipment and are about three times the costs for conventional equipment.
The net incremental operating and maintenance costs of the new equipment
have been included in the cost streams.
Cargo Handling Costs - Foreign Ports
11.      Through increasing the share of traffic handled in containers, the
project will also result in savings in port handling charges in foreign
ports handling Algeria's foreign trade.  Typical cargo handling tariffs for
conventional general cargo and for container traffic have been established
for the three main sea routes based on a survey of published tariffs.
Typical Cargo Handling Tariffs: DA/ton
Containers        Conventional
Mediterranean                      143               170
Atlantic in Western Europe          74               130
Average                            109               150
Return of Empty Containers
12.      The handling of empty containers constitutes an additional cost
that would not be necessary with conventional general cargo traffic. This
cost has been deducted from the handling cost savings for container
operations. The estimated costs in Algerian ports is based on an average
cost per gang hour of about DA 730. With a throughput of 15 TEU per hour,
the cost of handling each container is about DA 50.  For European ports,
tariffs for handling empty containers range from DA 210 per container in
Marseilles to DA 320 in Antwerp. An average rate of DA 250 has been used
in the analysis.
Project Costs
13.      The  following  table  summarizes  the  project  costs  used  in the
economic evaluation:

14.      Berth requirements have been established based on estimated ships'
service time such that the ratio of waiting time to ships' service time
does not exceed 15%. This gives a requirement for two berths in each of
the project ports.  The areas required for storage in each of the ports are
based on typical dwell times of 18 days for imports, nine days for exports
and seven days for empty containers.  Containers would be stacked up to
three in height in rows of two with 14 meter service lanes.  Equipment is
expected to provide a useful life of eight years and renewal of equipment
is provided for in the cost streams. Additional equipment is provided for
in 1995 to handle the expected increases in traffic.  Benefits have been
held constant from the year 2000 when the capacity of the facilities are
reached.   Incremental  operating  and  maintenance  costs  have  also  been
included in the cost streams.   Residual values have been estimated for
infrastructure investments and equipment.
Results
15.      Tables 1 to 3 of this annex show the streams of costs and benefits
over the period 1989-2010.   Benefits have been estimated over a 20-year
period, with 1992 as the first year of operation. Benefits have been held
constant after traffic has reached the estimated capacity of the facilities
under the first phase.  The distributional aspects of project benefits are
discussed in Chapter 4. The results of the evaluation are shown below:

16.      The proposed developments show acceptable ERs ranging from 14% to
18% with an overall  ER of  about  17%.   All  projects  continue  to  show
acceptable ERs under assumptions of a 20% increase in costs or a 20%
decrease  in  benefits.   These  ERs  are  considered  to  be  conservative
estimates as they relate only to a first phase of development involving
substantial infrastructure costs.  This infrastructure will also serve for
a second phase of development for which the incremental costs will be
limited essentially to the provision of additional equipment.

II. Historical Financial Statements 1983-87
Income Accounts
1.       Income accounts for 1983-87 consolidated at the sector level, are
shown in Table 4.2.1 and at the company level in the Project File
No. C.11. More detailed income accounts are shown for the project
companies for the period 1985-87 in Tables 4.2.2 to 4.2.4.  The
following explanations apply:
2.       Revenue comprises:
(a) cargo handling, stevedoring, and service charges collected
directly by the EPs, represent some 90% of total revenue.
They can be adjusted by interministerial decree but the
approval   procedures   are  cumbersome  and   time-consuming;
provision is made in the Action Plan for review of the
present procedures to accelerate the decision-making process;
and
(b) port and wharfaga dues, known as "taxes parafiscales"
collected by customs and repaid to the EPs represent about
10% of total operating revenue.  They can be adjusted only
through the "Loi de Finances".
3.       Wages and salaries represent by far the major item of working
expenses, with an average of about 75% for the port subsector.
Overstaffing is evident particularly considering that traffic has
been declining since 1984.  However, the Government is acting by
attrition and through early retirement schemes to reduce staff to
10,000 by the end of 1991.  By the end of 1985, staff numbered
about 14,400 as compared with 12,900 by the end of 1987, a 10%
decrease.   On  the other hand,  the revised "Statut Geniral des
Travailleurs" (SGT), implemented in mid-1986, provided for an
overall salary increase of 13% with average annual pay per
employee rising from about DA 55,000 to DA 61,000.  This reduced
to :, large extent the favorable effects of staff reduction.
Sector staff numbers and costs for 1985-87, detailed by EP, are in
the following table:

Annex 4
Balance Sheets
4.       Balance Sheets,  consolidated at the sector level  are  shown  in
Table 4.2.5 for 1983-87 and at the company level in the Project
File No. C.ll. The following explanations apply:
5.       Fixed assets and depreciation.  Most assets (infrastructure)  are
financed by non-reimbursable contributions from the Government
(concours  definitifs).   The  Balance  Sheets  show  the  following
inadequacies in EPs' accounting practices:
(a)  fixed  assets  do  not  include  infrastructure  investments
(breakwaters,  jetties,  dredging,  quay  walls,  aprons,  and
related  civil  works)  and  are  only  a  small  part  of  the
investment   base;   no   depreciation   allowance   is   made,
therefore, for this investment;
(b)  assets  are recorded at historical cost.   An evaluation at
replacement cost of all port infrastructure investments was
carried out in 1978 by the Belgian consulting firm Courtois.
The  study  will  be  updated  as  part  of  th_  consultants'
assignment referred to in para. 2.18 of the text;
(c) equipment inherited by the EPs from ONP and SONAMA have been
identified  and  valued;  they  are  now  officially  being
transferred to the EPs. However, some EPs have already made
allowance 'or depreciation of these assets - which are
actually in use - while others have not provided for any
depreciation thereon.  As a result, some balance sheets show
negative net fixed assets in operation; and
(d) the depreciation on equipment, among others, purchased by the
EPs is based on historical cost, and averages about 102 p.a.,
which  is  inadequate.   Therefore,  accumulated  depreciation
bears little relevance to the actual obsolescence, and wear
and tear of the equipment.  The depreciation policy needs to
be reformulated by the Government as part of its acknowledged
objective  to  relate  tariffs  to  costs.   In  particular,
depreciation should be based on replacement cost, although
corporate tax would remain assessed, as presently, on
depreciation based on historical cost.
6.       Current assets and liabilities.   Current  assets  include,  inter
alia, prepayments to contractors and suppliers and provisions paid
quarterly  in advance  to  Social  Security.   Current  liabilities
comprise commitments to contractors and suppliers that are not yet
due. This presentation makes it difficult to assess the working
capital, which seems, however, safe.

Annex 4
7.       Because  of  the  above  deficiencies,  Balance  Sheets have  little
significance. With this warning in mind, the following statements
can still be made about historical information:
(a)  the sector's cash position is strong; by the end of 1987, it
stood at DA 414 million, about one-third of that year's gross
revenue; current ratios went from 1.4 in 1983 to 1.8 in
1987.  The current ratios for the project companies mostly
improved as follows: Oran: 0.9 to 3.6, Algiers: 1.4 to 1.1,
and Annaba: 1.3 to 2.1 for 1983 and 1987, respectively; and
(b)  the sector's long-term debt, at DA 532 million by the end of
1987, is acceptable; the debt/equity ratio improved from
36/64 in  1983  to  31/69  in  1987.   The  project  companies'
debt/equity ratios changed as follows:
Debt/Equity Ratios
1983      1987
Oran      26/74      31/69
Algiers    n,a.      57/43

Annex 4
III. Sector and EP Forecast Income Accounts 1988-91
A. Assumptions
Income accounts
1.       Income accounts have been prepared in constant terms;  adjustments
such as internal transfers and non-operating results have been
excluded so as to assess more clearly the earnings position of the
sector.
2.       Traffic.  Overall traffic would remain basically stagnant at its
1987 level until the early 1990s.
3.       Revenue
(a) Handling, stevedoring, and other service charges on cargo
other than oil-related products would be increased on the
average by 20% as from January 1, 1989, as provided for in the
tariff proposals presently being considered by Government; the
cost per ton of handling containerized goods in the port would
increase to about US$20 equivalent, which is higher than the
present handling cost by conventional methods. A major reason
for such high cost is the grosa imbalance of container
traffic, nearly half of which consists of empty boxes.
Nevertheless, the total round-trip transport cost between
Europe and Algeria would be substantiall: i.-r*er by containers
than by conventional packing and handling methods; and
(b)  "taxes parafiscales" would be increased by 10%, as provided
for in the above proposed tarif increase.
4.       Wages and salaries are assumed to continue to decline together with
staff numbers; these would be reduced by 500 per year to reach
10,000 by end-1991  from estimated  11,500 at end-1988.   The DA
61,000 average annual cost per staff has been kept constant.
5.       Materials   and   others   would   be   increased   to   incorporate
infrastructure maintenance costs.
6.       Taxes (TUGPS, TAIC, etc..) are expected to remain at its present
cumulative level of 13% of gross operating revenue.
Balance Sheets
7.       Given the lack of data, as explained in Part II, paras. 5 and 6
above,  the  balance  sheets  have  little  significance.   For  this
reason, they are not forecast.

Annex 4
B. Income Account Projections
8.       An  assessment  of  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector,  the
enterprises, and the facilities concerned was undertaken, as follows:
(a) Global sectoral assessment
9.       Consolidated income accounts for 1988-91 are shown in Table 4.3;
Table 4.3.1  provides  some additional  information.   The forecast does not
attempt to assess annual depreciation allowances due to the lack of
information on fixed assets.  Table 4.3 shows that, even with a substantial
increase in materials, to co"rer progressively the maintenance cost of
infrastructure, the port subsf tor, as a whole, would achieve, partly
through additional staff cost reductions, a generally acceptable working
ratio of .82 by 1991.  The working ratio at the sectoral level has not been
pursued as an objective because the imminent financial autonomy to be
granted to the EPs and their ensuing responsibility in adjusting more freely
their tariffs make it impractical for Government to commit itself to the
achievement of a consolidated or sectoral objective that may conflict with
the commercial interests of some EPs.  Instead, financial objectives have
been limited to the three EPs benefitting from the project.
(b) The EPs of Oran, Algiers and Annaba.
10.      Financial forecasts of  the three EPs in which the Bank-financed
facilities are to be located are shown in Tables 4.3.2 to 4.3.4 for
1988-91.   As is the case for the global approach  in (a) above, lack of
information  imposed use of working ratios  as  financial  targets.   Tables
4.3.2 to 4.3.4 show the following forecast working ratios:
Oran     Algiers       Annaba
1987 (actual)           .84       1.08           .79
1988                    .84       1.06           .79
1989                    .78        .95           .77
1990                    .77        .94           .76
1991                    .76        .94           .75

IV. Facilities Forecast Income Accounts 1988-95
Container Terminals
1.       The  financial  viability  of  the  container  terminals  in  Oran,
Algiers, and Annaba has been assessed on a series of assumptious listed in
Table 4.4 for their first (1993) and third (1995) years of operation.
Income accounts for the three EPs are in Tables 4.4.1 to 4.4.3.  They lead
to the following comments:
(a)  Rate of return on net fixed assets
(i)    Oran.   The initial traffic for 1993 (25,400 containers)
could be accommodated by relatively modest investments
(DA 65 million) and the rate of return, at about 12X, is
satisfactory.     The    traffic    forecast    for    1995
(32,000 containers)   requires   only   small   additional
investments  in  equipment,  and  the  rate  of  return
increases to 13X.
(ii)    Algiers.   The  net  operating  revenue  generated by  the
modest 1993 level of traffic (86,000 containers) can
match the important investment required (DA 295 million)
and the initial rate of return, at about 11%5 is
satisfactory.   Traffic is expected to increase by about
50% in 1995 while requiring only minor additional
investments for equipment and none for infrastructure.
The rate of return rises to 18%.
(iii)    Annaba.  Low traffic expectations (24,000 containers) and
the    relatively    important    investments    required
(DA 99 million) have to be adjusted as about 40X of the
tonnage using the container terminal facilities is
roll-on,  roll-off  traffic.   The  investment  cost  has,
therefore, been apportioned on a tonnage basis to
container  traffic.   The rates  of  return  for  container
traffic alone would be 10% in 1993 and 12% in 1995.
(iv)    Whereas these favorable rates may leave room for possible
tariff reductions, unfavorable outcomes may result from
higher than expected investment cost, higher container
utilization  and  container-use  productivity  increases
(Part V below).   The tariff consultants referred to in
para. 2.18 of the text will further investigate these
points.

Annex 4
(b) Debt service coverage ratios
Cash generated by each container terminal in 1993 and 1995 has
been compared with the service of the debt amounting to the
foreign exchange cost of the new investment in equipment to be
financed by the proposed Bank loan and reimbursed by the EPs
to the Government.  The debt service coverage ratios vary from
2.40 to 7.18, a satisfactory situation that illustrates the
self-financing   capability   of   the   container   terminals.
However, the above results do not take into account: (a) a
proportionate contribution of the container terminals to the
corporate tax due by the EPs concerned; and (b) the eventual
distribution of part of the terminals' net operating revenue
as  a  bonus   to  the  workers.    Because   of   the   above
uncertainties, the financial objective to be achieved by the
container terminals calls for a rather conservative debt
service coverage ratio of two on the debt incurred to finance
the foreign exchange cost of the new equipment.
Annaba Cereals Facility
2.       The income accounts for the first full year of operation of  the
Annaba cereals facility have been prepared as indicated in Table 4.4.4.
This table shows that, on the basis of the tariffs currently under
Government consideration (DA 24 per ton), the facilities would achieve a
negative rate of return.  If the tariff was  increased by 100%, the rate
would increase to a safe 9.8% and the cash generated exceed twofold the
service of the debt incurred to finance the foreign exchange cost of the
equipment component of the investment in the cereals handling facility.
3.       The above  100%  tariff  increase  is only half the 'ocean freight
savings resulting from the use of larger vessels, which have been estimated
at about US$8 to 12 per ton (para. 4.12 of the text).

7.  Investment financing to be secured (i) I}ifrastructure: By Government (concours dcfinttifs),
(ii) equipment: foreign exchange cost (86%) by borrowing at 10%. p.a. interest over 7 years;
and (iii) equipment: local currency cost (14%) by EPs self finar.cing.
8.  Productivity in handling containers is based on realistic expected performance of local labor.
9.  Productivity of container handling equipment is based on generally accepted operating
standards.
,L   Cost of miscellaneous equipment has been allocated equally (1/3) to each port.  The cost of
road access will benefit other port facilities; it is estimated that 1/3 of this cost will
benefit directly the container terminals.

Annex 4
V. Sensitivity Analysis
1.       An analysis has been made to test the sensitivity of the financial
objectives described in Part IV of this Annex to changes ir. investment costs
and revenue, as follows:
(a)  The three EPs concerned:
Variations in investment costs would not affect the targeted
levels  of  working  ratio  for  1993.   On  the  ither  hand,
decreases in revenue would substantially deteriorate the
working ratios as follows:
Base Case    - 102      - 20%
Algiers             94         104        117
Oran                76          85         95
Annaba              75          83         94
(b) Container terminals:
(i)    Rate of return on net fixed assets in operation.  When
varying each of revenue and investment costs by 10% and
20%, the rate of return (%) changes as follows:
Base         Revenue          Investment
Case      -10%    -20%       +102   +20%
Algiers   1993    10.8         9.0      6.0     10.0    9.0
1995    17.8       15.0    11.0      15.0   14.0
Oran      1993    11.8         9.0     6.0      11.0   10.0
1995    12.9        9.0      6.0     12.0   11.0
Annaba 1/ 1993      5.5        4.0      2.0      5.0    5.0
1995     7.1        5.0      3.0      6.0    5.0
Annaba 2/ 1993      9.8        6.0      3.0      8.4    7.7
1995    11.8        8.1      4.4     10.8    9.9
I/  Without apportioning part of the investment to Ro-Ro
traffic.
2/ When apportioning part of the investment (40X) to
Ro-Ro traffic.
The table shows highly sensitive rates of return,
particularly with respect to revenue, hence to the extent
of container utilization.  The selected indicative target
of   10%   seems  attainable.    However,   under  adverse
circumstances, it may not be achieved during the period
1993-1995.



- 103 -
Annex 4
(ii)    Debt Service Coverage.  The above revenue and investment
variations  affect  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  as
follows:
Base    Revenue    Investment
Case      -20%          +20%
Algiers      1993     6.2        4.4           5.2
1995     7.2        5.2           5.9
Oran         1993     3.1        2.1           2.6
1995     2.8        1.9           2.4
Annaba       1993     2.4        1.6           2.0
1995     2.8        1.8           2.3
Again, the debt service coverage ratio is more sensitive
to revenue decreases than to investment cost increases.
If revenue were to drop by 20X, the target debt coverage
ratio of 2 would not be met by Oran in 1995 nor by
Annaba  in  1993  and  1995,  although  the  respective
shortfalls would be relatively small.
(c)  Cereals-handling facilities:
The tariff of DA 24 per ton, which the Government may
increase by 1001, could be further doubled before offsetting
the substantial benefits to users resulting from shorter port
calls (paras. 2 and 3 of Part IV of this Annex).
2.       A  sensitivity  analysis  has  also  been  conducted  to  test  the
financial objectives in case of a 50% change in value of the dinar and the
resulting change in the foreign exchange cost of the proposed project. The
results for the container terminals are as follows:
Rates of Return (2)
Base Case       501 variation
Algiers        1993         10.8             7.0
1995        17.8            12.0
Oran           1993         11.8             8.0
1995        12.9              9.0
Annaba         1993          5.5             4.0
1995          7.1            5.0
Annaba         1993          9.8             5.3
(apportioned) 1995         11.8             6.6
Except for Algiers in 1995, the rates of return would drop below 10%.

DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Tariff, Cost Accounting and Assets Valuation Consultants Services
Draft Terms of Reference
I. Background
1.       Port operations are carried out by ten "Entreprises Portuaires"
(EPs), which were established between 1982 and 1985 in Algiers, Annaba,
Arzew, Bejaia, Ghazaouet, Jijel, Mostaganem, Oran, Skikda, and Tenes. The
EPs are organized as semi-autonomous public enterprises reporting to the
Directorate of Ports of the Ministry-at-Charge (Transport). Identical port
dues and charges are levied by each EP regardless of its investment and
operating costs, so that some EPs (mostly the oil exporting ports) are
making a profit, while some other EPs are showing a deficit.
2.       Until now port infrastructure investments have been fully financed
by the State; they remain in the custody of the Ministry of Public Works
which is responsible for their planning, construction, and maintenance.  No
return on infrastructure investments has so far been requested by
Government, as sole shareholder of the ports.   Other investments  (e.g.,
buildings, equipment) are financed, maintained, and depreciated by the EPs.
3.       New policies recently formulated by the Government aim at larger
autonomy for rablic enterprises that are to become fully accountable for
their operational and financial performance. A more complete assessment of
these policies and their implementation are expected soon, particularly
with respect to pricing and investment financing policies and the extent to
which the public enterprises will be authorized to act on these matters.
Although such assessment may require adjustment of the terms of reference
of this assignment, the following policies and objectives have been made
for working purposes:
(a)  the   investment   financing   policy  will  initially  remain
unchanged with infrastructure paid for by the State, and
other investments financed by the EPs out of own funds or
through borrowing;
(b)  ports'   infrastructure  assets  and  their  financing  will
progressively be transferred to the EPs, which will be
responsible for their maintenance and depreciation based on
replacement cost;



- 105 -
Annex 5
Page 2 of 5
(c) tariffs will be differentiated for each EP and related to
their respective investment and operating costs; and
(6)  the  minimum  financial  objectives  have  been  set  (i)  for
Algiers, Oran, and Annaba EPs; and (ii) for particular
services such as containers and cereals handling and storage
in para. 12 below.
The consulting services described below are to provide, through
adequate tariff structure and level, the pricing tools needed to achieve
given financial objectives.   The consultant will explore the effects of
alternative objectives and make recommendations thereon.
II. Obiectives
4.       The purpose of the consulting services is to assist the Ministry
of Transport in:
(a) setting up a comprehensive cost accounting system applicable
to the EPs, including an updating mechanism;
(b) updating and completing the valuation of ports fixed assets
at historical and replacement costs, and defining the
depreciation policy in accordance with an agreed methodology;
and
(c) designing a tariff structure and level to achieve, at various
traffic levels, given financial objectives.
5.       The proposals resulting from this assignment will ultimately have
to be reviewed in conjunction with the findings and recommendations of the
National Transport Study presently undertaken as part of the Bank-financed
Fifth Highway Project.
III. Scope of Services
6.       The consultants shall perform all investigations, above analyses,
and other services herein described, as required to attain the objectives.
In the conduct of their work, the consultants shall collaborate closely
with the Directorate of Ports of the Ministry of Transport and the EPs; the
former shall assign counterpart staff to work with the consultants and
shall provide necessary support, services, and facilities. The consultants
shall be solely responsible, however, for the analysis and interpretation
of all data and services received, and for the findings and recommendations
contained in their reports.  The consultants shall also coordinate  their
work and collaborate closely with other consultants, if any, retained by
the Ministry of Transport for the improvement uf planning, management and
operations of the port sector.
7.       The consultants shall assist the Ministry of Transport in defining
the pricing policies best suited to the particulars of the present and
foreseeable port operations; to that end, alternative proposals should be
presented  (average  cost,  average  variable  cost,  mnarginal  cost,  or
congestion cost pricing).



- 106 -
Annex 5
Page 3 of 5
8.       The  cost  accounting  system  to  be  developed  shall  identify
cost/revenue centers as appropriate and institute allocation procedures;
the system shall take into account the requirements of the Plan Comptable
National and of the forthcoming Plan Comptable Analytique National.
9.       Charges shall be designed to recapture, to the extent practicable,
economic benefits accruing to shipping lines, particularly foreign flags,
through savings in time and/or operating costs; in this respect, particular
attention will be given to the respective contribution of ships and cargo
to the EPs' revenue.
10.      The  consultants  shall  update  and  complete  the  inventory  and
valuation of ports' fixed assets as of December 31, 1976, undertaken by the
consulting firm Courtois (Belgium) in 1978, and determine, for each item
or, if appropriate, groups of items:
(a) the historical cost;
(b) the replacement cost;
(c) the remaining economic life; and
(d) the annual linear depreciation allowance based on replacement
cost; other depreciation methods may, however, be recommended.
The inventory of fixed assets will list separately:
(a) assets in use, which will have to be replaced at the end of
their economic life;
(b) unused assets, or those of little use; and
(c) assets in use but which will not be replaced.
An adequate depreciation policy will be recommended, taking into
account the actual use of fixed assets, to allow for replacement of the
needed investments.
11.      However,  the  Government  may eventually not  expect  that  total
capital costs be recovered from revenue (through depreciation), and may
consider that part of the investments serves general development purposes
for which no immediate and direct return is due;  the Government may indeed
expect in the longer run to recoup the investments indirectly through
taxation and other fiscal returns.   In this respect, it shall be assumed
that construction and maintenance dredging of che entry channels shall
remain the responsibility of the State while dredging in the basins and
alongside the quays will be charged to the EPs.
12.      The financial objectives have been set as follows:



- 107 -
Annex 5
Page 4 of 5
(a) As from FY 1992, the Algiers EP is to achieve a working ratio
of no more than .90.  The objective for the Oran and Annaba
EPs is .75.  For purposes of calculation,  the working ratio
is assessed by dividing the working expenses (excluding
depreciation and interest charges) by the operating revenue.
(b) As from FY 1993, the containers terminal and cereals storage
facilities at Algiers, Oran and Annaba, as provided for in
the proposed project, are to achieve a rate of return of net
fixed assets in operation of no less than 10% (no less than
8% in FY 1992).  For purposes of calculation,  the financial
rate of return is assessed by dividing the net operating
revenue; meaning operating revenue minus operating expenses
(including depreciation but excluding interest charges) by
the net fixed assets in operation.
(c) In addition, the container terminal facilities and the
cereals storage facilities are to generate sufficient cash to
service 200% of a debt in principal and interest, amounting
to the equipment component cost of the investment.
13.      In assessing  working  expenses  the  consultants  shall take  into
account the implications of the recently revised "Statut General des
Travailleurs" - S.G.T.; also, the effects of the Government policy with
regard to attritioa and early retirement of ports staff shall be considered.
14.      The  consultants  shall  review  the  adequacy  of  the  existing
concession agreements between EPs and users for the exclusive utilization
of specialized facilities; particular attention shall be given to the
appropriateness of concessions granted for the use of specialized
facilities built and financed by the users themselves.
15.      The consultants shall examine the scope and extent of existing
internal auditing practices and review the competence of staff performing
these functions. The consultants shall also assist in designing periodic
consolidated statements summarizing the financial performance of the three
EPs concerned (and of their containers terminal and cereals storage
facilities) for monitoring of their financial objectives.
16.      The   consultants   shall   assess,   as   a   corollary   of   each
recommendation made, the staffing implications and the ensuing training
requirements;   suggestions shall also be made as to the most appropriate
means to meet these requirements.
IV. Time Schedule and Reporting Requirements
17.      The consultants will mobilize their staff in Algiers within 30
calendar days of the starting date.  In the conduct of their services, the
consultants shall prepare the following reports:

(a) An inception report, three months after the starting date,
covering inter alia:
(i)    the traffic levels selected for working purposes;
(ii)    the pricing policy recommer.led as best suited for the
present and foreseeable port operations;
(iii)    the cost/revenue centers to be developed in each EP for
cost accounting purposes;
(iv)    the methodology  to be applied for valuation of  fixed
assets and depreciation thereon; and
(v)    the   proposed   allocation   of   dredging   costs   and
identification of other general development expenditure
not to be recouped by operating revenue.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Technical Assistance for Container Operations
Outline Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.       Specialist   technical   assistance   is   required   to   establish
satisfactory operations at the new container terminals proposed under the
project. Personnel will be trained on the job provided under three pilot
schemes.  These pilot schemes will include: (a) container documentation and
control;   (b) physical   container   handling   on   ship   and   shore;   and
(c) establishment of procedures for engineering operations, maintenance and
repairs, and stores  inventories.   Prior to establishing these schemes, a
container port seminar would be organized to introduce port operators,
shippers, agents, and customs officials to the advantages of container
traffic.  It is expected that the technical assistance will be provided by
one firm specialized in the area of container port operations. All schemes
will be established in close collaboration with the Ministry of Transport.
Container Control and Documentation
2.       The pilot scheme for container control and documentation should be
set up by a documentation specialist in the port of Algiers where there is a
substantial volume of traffic and a suitable area similar to that of the
stacking areas that will exist in the new terminals. The selected area will
be marked, laid out, and operated, from the point of view of container
control,  as  a  modern  terminal.   Container  movements  control  will  be
established on the basis of proven procedures and associated documentation.
These will lend themselves to eventual computerization in future years. The
container control specialist should have three coutnterparts, one from each
EP who will take an active part in the setting up of the scheme, and remain
with it until the necessary personnel are trained.
3.       The scheme at Algiers should commence at least two years prior to
the beginning of specialized operations at that port, which is expected to
be in mid-1992. About two months will be needed to set up the scheme and a
further ten months  for personnel  training.   At  the  end  of  the  period,
trained staff would be available for operational pilot schemes to be
established at Oran and later at Algiers (para. 5).
4.       The pilot scheme for the training of personnel will  include all
aspects  of container control  including procedures and documentation.   It
will be necessary in particular to:



- 110 -
Annex 6
Page 2 of 5
(i)    agree with the respective EPs on the numbers and categories of
ports personnel to participate in the scheme;
(ii)    consult  subsequently  on  implementation  of  the  scheme  with
Customs, shipping lines, and agents;
(iii)    select, in conjunction with the Algiers EP, an area within the
port suitable for handling conte-`ers in a manner similar to
that of a modern container termin. i
(iv)    plan and mark the area selected (numbered rows and bays);
(v)    install procedures to ensure early advice of vessels' arrival
and timely receipt of documents, e.g., manifests, container
lists, stowage plans, hazardous cargo lists, for effective
pre-planning;
(vi)    design  and  implement  working  documents  necessary  for  the
efficient handling and movement of containers, e.g., loading
and discharging sequence sheets, order documents for ports
personnel,   vessel  working  records,   and   procedures   and
documents;
(vii)    install  an  efficient manual  container control and location
system;
(viii)    organize  and  establish  a  rota  for  the  introduction  of
personnel from other ports involved, for training in the pilot
scheme;
(ix)    design and implement a standard interchange document;
(x)    make recommendation for manning levels and gradings  for all
control staff;
(xi)    operate  the pilot scheme until all necessary personnel have
been trained in *ne system;
(xii)    make recommendations for any further staff training considered
necessary; and
(xiii)    install documentary procedures for break-bulk cargoes at CFS
stations.
Operational Assistance
5.       The port of Oran will  be  the  first  to begin modern  container
operations in mid-1991. Technical assistance will be 'rovided in Oran by an
operations  specialist,  assisted  by  a  documentation  specialist,  and  a
container superintendent experienced in ship and shore container handling.
The scheme would operate for about one year in Oran before transferring to
the port of Algiers in early 1992.



- 1.11 -
Annex 6
Page 3 of 5
6.       The container operations specialist would be required at each port
about three months prior to the startup of operations to set up the
necessary  system  and  procedures.   These  will  include  marking  of  the
container area, plant requirements, container traffic flows, manning levels
including staff disposition, shift patterns and establishing regular liaison
and coordination with agents for the early receipt of pre-vessel advice and
documentation information required to enable efficient pre-planning of
receipt and  storage  of  import  and  export  containers.   After  operations
commence the operations specialist will remain for a further nine months to
supervise actual operations.  He will be assisted by a superintendent who
will be immediately responsible for ensuring the efficient movement of
containers on ship and shore, including the pre-planning of the loading and
discharging operations.  The superintendent will only be required to be on
site just before the start of  actual  operations.   When operations  have
commenced, staff from the other ports will be trained on site in container
operations.
7.       The  operations  pilot  scheme  shall   include  all- aspects  of
containerization but particular attention must be given to the following
requirements:
xi)    pre-booking and subsequent berthing arrangements for container
vessels to ensure prompt starts and uninterrupted working;
(ii)    park   layouts   and   operating   procedures   for   loading.
discharging, receiving, and delivering containers;
(iii)    ship's   stowage,   planning,   stability   calculations,   and
shipboard container operations safety;
(iv)    procedures  and  documentation  necessary  for  checking  and
recording the discharge and load, the receipt and delivery and
the on-hand containers;
(v)    the preparation of stowage plans and out-turn reports;
(vi)    the design and implementation of standard "interchange";
(vii)    examination of customs' procedures to ensure that bottlenecks
do not occur in operations and recommendation on any changes
necessary;
(viii)    documentary  procedures  for  break-bulk  cargoes  at  C.F.S.
stations;
(ix)    recommendations  for  manning  levels  and  gradings  for  all
documentary staff;
(x)    recommendations for staff training;



- 112 -
Annex 6
Page 4 of 5
(xi)    liaison with shipping agents; and
(xii)    assistance and advice  to management of the agencies  in any
other aspect of containerization.
Engineering Maintenance
8.       Specialists  in  repair  and  maintenance  of  container  handling
equipment will be appointed to ensure that the requisite maintenance and
spares systems are available and fully operational by the time the new
container handling equipment is commissioned in each of the projects ports.
It is vital that such maintenance systems and facilities be capable of
ensuring that all equipment is available to meet all traffic demands
including extended periods of three-shift working.   In this respect, the
ready availability of spare parts within a few hours is of paramount
importance.
9.       A  container equipment maintenance engineer will visit  the three
project ports for a total of about one month to review the arrangements made
and facilities available, for maintenance of container handling and
associated equipment, and the ready availability of spare parts and
components and their inventory control.  He will discuss with the EPs any
apparent deficiencies in the system, his recommendations to rectify them and
the time by which they must be rectified and report thereafter on them in
writing.
10.      The main pilot scheme for the setting-up and smooth implementation
of the requisite maintenance procedures will be undertaken at Algiers. The
scheme will commence about three months before the first equipment becomes
operational. The maintenance specialist will assist and advise the local
counterparts, engineers, and technicians from the project ports in the
implementation of the necessary preventive maintenance programs for the new
and existing equipment to ensure their optimum required availability, and
for the prompt and expeditious rectification of any faults which may arise
during actual operations.
Overseas Technical Visits
11.      The consultants would be required to organize a program of overseas
technical visits for port staff to provide training in container operations
and  in container  control.   A  total  of  some  20 man-months  of  overseas
technical visits are planned for staff of the EPs, MOT, MPW, and Customs.
The visits would be organized to specialized container ports. A preliminary
series of visits would be organized for key port staff prior to the pilot
schemes with further visits for management staff during the operational
phase.



- 113 -
Annex 6
Page 5 of 5
Personnel
12.      The container control and documentation specialist should have at
least five years' experience at senior management level in a modern
container terminal and must have detailed knowledge of, and practical
experience in, documentation systems and administration in container
operations. The documentation specialist will work with three counterparts,
one from each of the port enterprises, who will assist him in establishing
the pilot scheme and in the training of personnel.  The documentation team
will develop procedures which can be standardized and installed in all of
the modern container terminals in Algeria.
13.      The container operation specialist  to be assigned  to  the  pilot
schemes at Oran and Algiers will also be required to have at least five
years' experience at senior management level in a modern container terminal
as  well  as  practical  experience  in  modern  container  operations.   The
specialist will be assisted as needed by a container superintendent, having
at least three years' recent experience in operations in a modern container
terminal. The operations will be organized around stacking in rows of two
by three containers in height.   Key counterpart staff from each EP will be
assigned to the operations pilot scheme.
14.      The engineering specialist should also have at least five years'
experience at a senior management level as well as considerable practical
experience in his field.  Re will be assisted as necessary by technicians
who have had at least three years' recent experience on modern container
handling equipment.

THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Outline of Terms of Reference
for a Feasibility Study for the Establishment of a
Dry-dock Facility in Algeria
Introdt'ction
1.       The  continuing  crisis  in  shipping  is  giving  rise  to  fierce
competition among ship repair yards, and the more so in that present-day
techniques mean  that ships need to be dry-docked  less often.   Algeria's
investment must therefore be very precisely targeted and aimed at a type of
market and a type of work that will justify this investment:  good rate of
utilization,  adequate productivity,  high degree of integration, etc.  The
national fleet that forms the core of this market is probably going to
evolve rapidly and change in size and nature: modernization of handling,
technological developments regarding ships (utilization, changes in ship
size and form) but also developments in management, operating, and
maintenance methods are going to be inevitable under the twin constraints of
competition and the need to make more efficient use of the country's port
infrastructure.  This modernization will also extend to the car ferry fleet
and fishing boats. The purpose of this study is to provide the Ministry of
Transport with the information that will enable it to arrive at a decision
regarding the establishment of dry-dock facilities.
2.       The  object  of  the  study to be made by consultants will be to
clearly determine market conditions, to define the needs to be satisfied, to
arrive at some possible options, and to assess the advantages, drawbacks,
and feasibility of these options in order to clarify the choice and help in
making a decision.  To accomplish this, a certain amount o0  data will have
to be assembled and analyses made, as follows:
Data Analysis
3.       An estimate would be made of the number of ships required by the
national shipping concerns in 1990, 1995 and 2000, based on the fcl'owing:
(a) review of the available traffic forecasts and preparation of
additional forecasts as needed:  construction of high, medium
and low forecasts;
(b) review of the conclusions of the study on the modernization of
Algerian ports and critical examination of the options
adopted, the choices made regarding the direction of traffic
and the port equipment offered; and

Annex 7
Page 2 of 3
(c) definition of possible strategies for commissioning ships for
the national shipping concerns and evaluation of the fleet
under national control, taking into account existing or
envisaged flag agreements and freight-sharing agreements.
4.       Based  on  the  financial  capabilities  of  the  national  shipping
concerns, an estimate will be made of the probable proportions of the fleet
that will be owned or chartered according to the main categories of ships.
For each category, consideration will be given to the probable distribution
of ownership as follows:
(a) fully owned;
(b) partly owned or under multinational management;
(c) chartered, with repair the responsibility of the charterer; and
(d) under short-term charter or chartered by the run, with repair
the owner's responsibility.
Assessment of Needs
5.       An assessment will be made of total repair requirements, both in
dry dock and afloat, for the national shipping concerns for each time
horizon  and for each type of work (careening only, full overhaul, etc.).
Consideration could be given to:
(a) the type of maintenance work;
(b) the introduction of new technologies such as self-finishing
paints, underwater inspection, and other techniques now being
developed and likely to be put into practice in the short or
medium term;
(c) the type of operation such as lines terminating in Algeria,
lines terminating elsewhere; and
(d)  the needs  related  to other shipping  companies  calling  at
Algerian ports and requiring periodic maintenance (company
with line terminating in Algeria) or damage repair.
6.       An assessment will be made of competition from nearby yards as
follows:
(a) assessment of the strong and weak points of competing yards
(time taken, cost, quality of service) according to type of
repair and type of ship, with special reference to Lisbon,
Marseilles, Genoa, Malta, Palermo and Skaramanga; and
(b) definition of market windows for the Algerian yard and ranking
of the main segments according to various criteria (apparent
feasibility,   foreseeable   degree   of   integration,   likely
productivity).



- 116 -
Annex 7
Page 3 of 3
Analysis of Options
7.       On the basis of the detailed assessment of the total needs and what
is known about the competition and the market windows as ranked according to
para. 5, several options will be defined:
(a) a target market around a permanent facility geared to the
national fully owned fleet, excluding "exceptional" vessels
(in terms of size, technology, etc.); and
(b) a medium market, with an assessment of the probable degree of
penetration in each target segment making up this market.
For each option the consultant will be required to specify:
(a) the scale of the work envisaged;
(b) the implications as regards industrial equipment;
(c)  the  implications   in  terms  of  dry-docking  needs   (size
category); and
(d) the skilled personnel required.
8.       For each option, the additional dry-docking needs will be defined
taking into consideration the existence of the Algiers graving dock and the
possible availability in the short-term of a 180-m floating dock.
9.       For each option, the consultant will evaluate the procurement and
operating costs of:
(i) a new or second-hand floating dock of appropriate size; or
(ii) of a graving dock of appropriate size,
10.      Consideration would be given to the appropriate location for each
option taking into account related factors such as the industrial
environment, human resource availability, and other industrial objectives.
11.      An economic and financial evaluation would be undertaken  taking
into account:
(a)  summary estimated operating account (receipts, expenditures,
cover for amortization, foreign exchange balance, etc.);
(b) economic and financial appraisal; and
(c) sensitivity of results to hypotheses.

Draft Terms of Reference
Grain Transport and Storage Optimization Study
OBJECTIVES
1.       The main objectives of the study are to:
(a) arrive at the maximum capacity and optimal utilization of the
Algerian grain import ports, inland grain transport and
storage systems,  utilizing  the existing ports,   coastal and
inland  transport  and  storage  systems,  but  taking  into
consideration any additions or improvements to these that are
likely to be operational within the next 15 years; and
(b)  identify  such  other  additions  or  improvements  to  ports,
coastal and inland transport systems, storages which could
cost-effectively increase the capacity (if required) and/or
further optimize the utilization of grain import ports,
coastal/inland grain transport and storage systems.
TASKS
A. Algerian Grain Production, Consumption, Imports, Distribution
2.       Collect  and  process  data  on  Algerian  grain  production  _n  a
regional   basis  at present and make projections  for the next 15 years.
Projections shall take into account present and future development plans,
including those relating to agricultural land availability, yields per
hectare, irrigation, fertilizers, new techniques and any other significant
factors.  Consider both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios and indicate
the effect of seasonal variations and possible extreme variations from year
to year.
3.       With reference to the results of the above, determine the seasonal
availability of grain production in various regions, considering "on-farm"
consumption, to determine the regional quantities and seasonal distribution
of locally produced grain entering the local markets, at present and
projected for 15 years.
4.       Collect  and  process  data  on  Algerian  grain  consumption  on  a
regional basis and make projections  for the next  15 years.  Projections
shall take into account population growth and distribution, variations in
per capita consumption, possible changes in food preferences, and any other
relevant factors. Consider both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.



- 118 -
Annex 8
Page 2 of 3
5.       Based  on  the  foregoing,  determine  present  and  projected  grain
import requirements for the next 15 years considering five years intervals
and  both  optimistic   and   pessimistic   scenarios.    Determine  seasonal
variations of imports between years and the  ffect of emergency conditions
such as major crop failures in one or more regions, and possible extreme
swings in local production from year to year.
6.       Based on the local marketed production,  consumption and  imports
determine the regional requirements for grain flows (positive or negative
considering surplus, and deficit regions) on a monthly basis in a year, at
present and projected for five years from now, 10 years from now, and 15
years  from now.   Determine  the  effect  of  emergency  conditions  on  the
normally expected range of grain flow requirements.
B. Grain Storage and Transport Systems
7.       Identify,  and  evaluate  the  capacity  of  the  existing  transport
systems available for grain transport between the import ports and the main
producing and consuming regions identified under A.  Obtain the costs per
ton of port handling, rail transport, road transport, and coastal transport
for the various grain flows.
8.       Locate the major port-based and regional grain storage depots, and
obtain their storage and handling capacity (loading and unloading rates).
9.       Estimate  the availability,  capacity,  and  handling  rates  of  the
grain storage and transport systems five years, 10 years, and 15 years from
now, taking into consideration any additions or improvements that are likely
to be operational with the 15 years period.
C. Simulation Studies
10.      Develop or apply computer programs to permit the simulation of the
required grain flows, and the storage and transport systems based upon the
present and projected data obtained under A and B. The model(s) shall be
tested for sensitivity to the anticipated seasonal and annual variations,
and verified  to the extent possible using historical data.  The programs
should be modular so that specific scenarios can be used on a specific
module independently and the results sent to files (which may be used as
inputs to other modules subsequently if desired), without necessarily having
to run all of the programs.
11.      The  simulation  model(s)  shall be used to determine the maximum
capacity of the existing Algerian ports, transfort and storage systems to
handle the required grain flows at present, and at five years intervals over
the  next  15  years.    Scenarios  based  on  optimistic  and  pessimistic
projections9 seasonal variations, and emergency conditions shall be examined.
12.      The  effect  of  import  timings,  quantities  and  distribution  of
imports between ports shall be studied on the model(s) in arriving at both
the maximum capacity and optimal utilizations of the storage and transport
systems.



- 119 -
Annex 8
Page 3 of 3
13.      The simulation models shall be used  to assess both storage and
transport requirements and to determine the effect of additional storage (in
the ports and/cr inland) and/or transport capacity, in optimizing transport
and storage utilization and minimizing costs.
14.      With respect to the import ports, the effect of the use of larger
ships (expected as the ports are developed over the next 15 years), both on
':he port and inland storage and transport systems shall be examined.
15.      The model(s) shall be used to examine such other scenarios which
may be required to achieve the objectives of these terms of reference.
D. Evaluation and Report
16.      The results of simulation studies shall be used to evaluate and
recommend measures which may be adopted to optimize the utilization of
existing ports, coastal and inland transport and storage over the next 15
years. The result shall be further used to evaluate and recommend such cost
effective additions or improvements to the ports, inland transport systems
and storages in a phased manner, which would be required to meet the
projected capacity requirements, or which would serve to further optimize
utilization of the systems, over the next 15 years.
17.      The result of the above work shall be presented in the form of
three interim reports (Part A, Part B, Part C) and a final report.

THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Transport Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
1.       In the transport sector, Algeria has received nine loans from the
Bank, for a total amount of US$750 million, to finance five projects for
roads, two for ports and two for railways.  The First, Second and Third
Highway Projects (Loans 912-AL, 1407-AL, and 1683-AL) have been completed
and fully disbursed. The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1892-AL), approved
in 1980, has been completed about three years behind schedule because of
delays in bidding and evaluating alternative bids for construction of a
major component.  The Fifth Highway Project was made effective in early
1988 and contracts have been awarded for the first tranche of the pavement
strengthening and road maintenance programs.
2.       The First Highway Project (Loan 912-AL), comprising improvements
to 84 km of high priority road sections and a substantial program of
highway pre-investment and maintenance studies, resulted in: (a) a highway
development plan based on an inventory of about 7,000 km of principal
roads; (b) detailed engineering for about 400 km of road rehabilitation;
and   (c) a   comprehensive   study   of   road   maintenance   requirements
(operational,  management, and institutional).  The project on the whole
went well and served as the basis for the Second Highway Project
(Loan 1407-AL),
under which organizational change, separating housing and urbanization
activity from highway infrastructure at the regional level, and reforms of
the  maintenance  organization  were  implemented.   In  support  of  this
institutional change, the training of operators and mechanics was started
while engineers and equipment managers were sent abroad for maintenance
related  training.   The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  also  gained
experience in International Competitive Bidding and in contract supervision
and management  of  a major  road  project.   However,  delays  in bidding,
rebidding, awarding contracts and obtaining approvals delayed project
completion three years.
3.       The Third Highway Project (Loan 1683-AL) supported (a) a two-year
tranche (1980-81) of a five-year maintenance program, with purchase of
equipment and continued training;  (b) a two-year tranche of a paved road
strengthening program,  which  had been  prepared by  technical  assistance
under the Second Highway Project; (c) technical assistance to MPW in the
preparation of feasibility studies for the development program; and
(d) another major north-south road improvement project. Progress was made
in developing and equipping a force account mair-tenance work force (which
continued under the next highway project) against a background of
increasing decentralization and proliferation of regional authorities.
Both pavement strengthening and major road improvemert were delayed in



- 121 -
Annex 9
Page 2 of 3
starting by lengthy contract bidding and approval procedures as well as by
a major earthquake, which diverted resources from project contracts to
reconstruction.   In the end, inadequate management of one local contractor
also contributed to the delay in completion which totalled three years.
4.       The  Fourth  Highway  Project  (Loan 1892-AL)  is  completed.   It
comprised: (a) continued support for the next two-year tranche of
maintenance   (1982-83);   (b) a  second   two-year   tranche   of   pavement
strengthening;  (c) improvement  of  a  critical  section of another  major
north-south   road;   and   (d) technical   assistance   for   construction
supervision, maintenance training, assistance to the road construction
industry and rural road studies.   Delays have again stemmed from lengthy
bidding and contract award procedures and substantial construction quantity
increases.   In addition,  recent  developments  have  markedly  changed  the
nature of the maintenance organization, the force account equipment pools
having been reorganized into autonomous enterprises responsible for road
maintenance.  The project civil works have been completed in 1989, about
three years late.
5.       The Fifth Highway Project (Loan 2808-AL) is designed to address a
number  of  high  priority  matters  in the highway sector.   The principal
objectives of the project are to: (a) reduce the backlog of pavement
strengthening works; (b) rationalize planning and control of this work;
(c) improve planning and operational efficiency in road maintenance; and
(d) strengthen personnel management and training functions in MPW, MOT and
various transport enterprises. The project will support (a) a program of
road rehabilitation and contracted maintenance; (b) technical assistance
and training to improve the collection and use of road network data,
planning and optimization of pavement strengthening and road maintenance
programs, as well as training programs for transport enterprises; and (c)
technical assistance and training to improve policy formulation and project
preparation in the transport sector.
6.       The Railway Project (Loan 996-AL), designed to support the rail-
way's modernization program within the 1974-77 Development Plan, consisted
mainly of renewal of motive power, rolling stock, rehabilitation of track,
and technical assistance.   Execution of the physical project components,
including  procurement  was  completed  on  schedule.   Several  important
studies, however, were not completed at the scheduled closing date which
was,  in  consequence,  extended.   Disagreement  between  the  Bank  and  the
railways   concerning   the   upgrading   to   double   track  standard   the
Ramdane-Jamal Constantine line, with doubtful justification, led to
cessation of Bank lending to the railway.
7.       A  Second  Railway  Project  (Loan  2976-AL)  has  recently  been
approved.   The project is designed to  support  a high priority  program
during 1989-92 for the rehabilitation and renewal of about 370 km of main
line track, the modernization of signalling and telecommunications and the
provision of equipment for mechanized track maintenance. The project would



- 122 -
Annex 9
Page 3 of 3
cover about 60% of the total track rehabilitation and renewal effort during
the period 1989-92.  Among the major policy objectives to be pursued under
the proposed project is the need to rationalize the railway investment
program and to give adequate priority to rehabilitation of the network.  In
addition, high priority is being given to the implementation of the
financial  restructuring  of  the  railway  as  well  as  the  new  railway
convention which sets out the objectives and actions agreed between the
Government  and  the  railway,  particularly  in  relation  to  pricing,
compensation, responsibilities for investment, and depreciation charges for
railway  infrastructure.   Finally,  the  project  would  help  in  achieving
improvements   in  managerial,   organizational,   and   operational   staff
capabilities.
8.       The  Bank participated  in  financing a  major  port  at  Bethouia
(Loan 995-AL),  designed  for  the  export  of  liquified natural  gas.   The
implementation of an envisaged Second Port Project at Jijel (Loan 1427-AL)
evaluated in 1976 did not materialize because of the postponement of an
associated new steel complex. The loan was then cancelled in 1980.
