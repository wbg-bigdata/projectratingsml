THIRD PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 3105-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for Algeria's Third Ports Project,
funded by Loan 3105-AL in the amount of US$63 million. The project was appraised in
March 1989. The loan was approved by the Board on June 29, 1989, signed 15 months
later, on September 17, 1990, because of delays in finalizing the bidding documents for
major civil works, and reluctance of the govenmment to incur unnecessary commitment
charges. The loan became effective on June 27, 1991, nine months after signature because
of delays in providing reimbursement agreements, legal opinions and publication of related
decrees. This loan required three extensions and closed on June 30, 1998.
The loan was amended on December 4, 1997 to reflect cancellation of the silo component in
Annaba totaling US$11.9 million. The new loan amount of US$51.1 million was converted
into single currency (USD) in December 1997. The last disbursement of an amount of
US$0.22 million was made on October 28, 1998. The total amount disbursed was US$50.8
million, the balance of US$0.3 million was cancelled on October 31, 1998.
This ICR was prepared by Fathi Ben Slimane, Senior Financial Analyst, and Ahmed El-
Hamri of the Infrastructure Development Group, Middle East and North Africa Region
(MNSID). Patrick Fourgeaud (TWUTD) and Han-Kang Yen (EASTR) provided assistance
for the economic analysis. It was reviewed by George Tharakan, Sector leader and Michel
Loir, Team Leader (MNSID).
Preparation of the ICR started with a mission carried out in July-August, 1998 by Mr.
Mohammed Tahar, consultant This report is also based on material in the project files and
on completion reports provided by the Borrowers. The report has been sent for comment to
the Government and to the port enterprises.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 3105-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1)     The Third Ports Project (Loan 3105-AL), designed to support the country's port
modernization program, was approved by the Board on June 29, 1989, and closed on June
30, 1998. The project was in line with structural reforms engaged by the Government, and
the recommendations made by a Bank's review mission of Algeria's Development Plan in
July 1986, particularly as they applied to transport sector, public enterprise reform, and
increased efficiency in public investment. Whereas the transport strategy during the
preceding twenty years had given excessive priority to infrastructure construction over
rehabilitation and modernization and, in the port sector to developing new sites and
improving secondary ports, the new strategy supported under the project focused on
modernizing major ports. Prior to the Third Ports Project, Algeria has received nine Bank
loans in the transport sector totaling US$750 million, to finance five road projects, two
ports, and two railways.
Project objectives and design
2.     The objectives of the project at appraisal were to: (a) assist the Government in
strengthening the economic viability of its investments in the port sub-sector generally, and
increasing the recovery of infrastructure costs through, inter alia, appropriate changes in
port tariffs; (b) encourage policies and institutional measures aimed at improving the
planning and coordination of port activities; and (c) assist the public port enterprises in
achieving financial viability and improving operational efficiency.
3.     The project involved a four-year program  (1989-1993) of high-priority
investments in the port sub-sector and constituted the first phase in a long-term program of
port modernization and rehabilitation. It included the development of specialized container
handling facilities in the three main ports of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran; the construction of
a grain silo and related handling facilities in Annaba; and a supporting program of technical
assistance and training.
Implementation experience and results.
4.     Evaluation of objectives and risks. The objectives stated at appraisal formed
part of a broadening Bank lending strategy for the Algerian transport sector. They were
deemed realistic and appropriate, since they aimed to: (a) strengthen investment planning
and coordination in the port sector; (b) made better use of existing facilities by introducing
new technology for cargo handling which would create substantial benefits in foreign
exchange savings by lowering transport and handling costs on a large part of the foreign
trade; and (c) improved the management of public enterprises.
5.     The most important risk foreseen at appraisal was the pace at which port users
would be able to shift to container technology. The other risks were the negative impact that
a devaluation of the Algerian dinar could have on the financial viability of the new
investrnents, and delays that might come from the Port Enterprises (PE) being unfamiliar
with Bank procedures and procurement guidelines.



ii
6.     These risks were mitigated by using conservative assumptions on traffic
developments, and by planning an investment program and project scope that were
consistent with the absorptive capacity of the beneficiaries (PEs and the MPW). The
creation of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to coordinate among beneficiaries and
follow up on project implementation was a key factor to the implementation success. The
authority given to the port enterprises to adjust tariffs, and the introduction of a foreign
exchange portion of the tariff, helped to ensure the financial viability of the new
investments.
Key factors affecting the project.
7.      The main prerequisite for smooth implementation of the project by the
Beneficiaries was their capacity to conduct complex processes including international
tendering, managing international contracts, and adhering to a predefined schedule, as well
as the capacity to commit adequate funding on time. While procurement carried out by the
PEs met with some problems, which delayed the delivery of equipment, the MPW showed
an unexpected inadequate ability to handle and manage complex contracts for the
construction of facilities, which resulted in poor results. The Borrower's reluctance to hire
foreign consultants to carry out supervision of work was also a limiting factor.
8.      Security issues and sociopolitical turmoil in late 1992 through 1998 caused
several foreign contractors to cancel their contracts, and others, mainly consultants, were
reluctant to submit proposals, limiting competition. In addition, bidding contractors were
charging a premium to cover the risk associated with the uncertain sociopolitical
environment. These factors caused extensive delays in the completion of the container
terminal in Algiers and, because of cost inflation, led to cancellation of the of the
construction of the grain terminal and silo at Annaba.
9.      Moreover, the lack of coordination between the MPW  own agencies made it
difficult to identify the exact location of the pipeline as well as the water and sewerage
networks, which further delayed the construction of the container terminal and access road
in Algiers. Last but not least, the inappropriate evaluation of resettlement issues in Annaba
and Algiers, and identification of dumping sites for dredging materials also added to project
implementation delays.
Project sustainability
10.    The  project's  components  were  designed  appropriately  and  completed
successfully, and the new facilities are now fully operational despite the lengthy delays. The
performance of the container terrninals is above target except for Annaba, where more
aggressive marketing is warranted if the port is to recoup the container traffic currently
diverted by other ports in the north east of Algeria. In general, unitization has become a
tool for promotion of foreign trade that all concerned parties, including Government
officials and private ship and terminal operators, have leamed to value.
11.    The institutional and financial achievement of the project should ensure significant
and continuous improvements in the efficiency and performance of port operations. A major
achievement is the higher level of autonomy gained by the Entreprise Portuaire d'Alger
(EPAL), the Entreprise Portuaire d'Annaba (EPAN), and the Entreprise Portuaire
d 'Oran (EPOR), partly owing to the improvement of their staff skills. The financial targets
have been met, and the overall financial performance of the project is satisfactory. The
project's sustainability would further be helped by implementation of the new Government
strategy to establish regional port authorities and concession the ports to PEs and private
sector operators as well.



iii
12.    The targeted modernization of port facilities has been fulfilled; most needed
equipment and tenninals have been commissioned. The study on port development funded
by Japan, and the cereals traffic study carried out under the project, will assist the Algerians
in planning future investment and maintenance operations.
13.    Assessment of outcome. The project is rated satisfactory. It has substantially
achieved its implementation and development objectives. The Beneficiaries performed
marginally well and completed most civil works and equipment components. The training
component, however, was not successfully implemented at first because of the Borrowers'
reluctance to spend loan funds on that activity, then because foreign companies stopped
submitting service proposals as the local security problems worsened. The only training
carried out was related to the maneuvering of handling equipment, provided by the
equipment suppliers. The Directorate of Ports and the Project implementation unit
performed very well, especially in the areas of monitoring and reporting.
14.    Bank and Borrower performance. The project was completed three years behind
schedule. The performance of both the Bank and the Borrowers improved over time.
However, the performance of the Borrower, especially MPW and Banque Algerienne de
D&veloppement (BAD) was inadequate at the beginning due to the lack of knowledge of
Bank's procedures, cumbersome administrative structure and organization of both
institutions, and their reluctance to use consultant services for work supervision.
Furthermore, the Bank and the Borrower underestimated the impact of the land reclamation
and resettlement issue at Annaba and Algiers.
15.    Key lessons learned. The following lessons can be drawn from the experience of
this project:
- The detailed engineering should rely on proven records for location of existing
underground networks within the development area;
- More emphasis should be put on training and on the use of consultants;
- The creation of a PIU can help to smooth project implementation;
* Delays can be anticipated prior to the project implementation phase if a thorough
analysis of the implementing and absorptive capacities of the Borrowers is carried out.
Land reclamation and resettlement issues must be properly assessed prior to project
implementation.
* Close collaboration between the PE and the overseeing ministry (in this case the MPW)
helps to better define the scope and design of the infrastructure.
* The implementation cycle should take into account the implementing capacity of the
Borrower, and therefore, lengthened to an average of seven years.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 3105-AL)
Introduction
1.    The Third Ports Project (Loan 3105-AL), was designed to support Algeria's port
modernization program, and remove operational bottlenecks to maritime traffic in and out the
of the country's main ports, Algiers, Oran and Annaba. The project was approved by the
Board on June 29, 1989 and closed on June 30, 1998. The project was in line with structural
reforms carried out by the Government and with recommendations made by a Bank review
mission in July 1986, particularly as they applied to the transport sector, public enterprise
reform, and increased efficiency in public investment. During the two previous decades, the
Government gave priority to constructing new roads and railways infrastructure, while not
addressing the need for rehabilitation and modernization of the existing networks. Similarly, in
the port sector, the rehabilitation and modernization of existing facilities were neglected, while
priority was given to modernization of secondary ports or to the development of new sites. In
the transport sector, Algeria has received nine loans from the Bank, for a total amount of
US$750 million, to finance five road projects, two ports, and two railways. Although
investment in port infrastructure during the Government's 1985-1989 Five-Year Plan
increased sharply over the previous Plan, the emphasis for the next period, 1990-1993, which
included the Third Port Project, was on modernization of existing berths in Algiers, Annaba
and Oran, and on constructing a cereals facility in Annaba, together with acquiring
appropriate equipment. All components have been completed except for the cereal silo at
Annaba, which was cancelled due to excessive costs. Overall, this project has greatly
benefited the development of container traffic in the three ports.
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Objectives and project design at the appraisal stage
2.    The rationale of this project was in line with strategic choices made by the Algerian
Government to increase operational efficiency in the transport sector and to strive for cost
recovery for its transport enterprises. The rapid growth in port traffic in Algeria during the
late 1970s and early 1980s had resulted in considerable emphasis being given to the
development of new port infrastructure. However, with the decline in port traffic beginning in
1985 because of a sharp decline in oil revenues and imports, the Algerian Government revised
its program for the port sub-sector, giving priority to the rehabilitation and modernization of
existing infrastructure. Moreover, the definition of an appropriate strategy for container
port investment took time because of the division of responsibility between the Ministry of
Transport (MOT), which was responsible for port operations, and the MPW responsible for
construction and maintenance of port infrastructure. This posed a problem especially for the
port of Algiers because of the a lack of consensus about the location, size, and phasing of
berth construction for container traffic. Therefore, the Ports III project coincided, not only
with a decision to rehabilitate and modernize existing infrastructure rather than to construct
new infrastructure, but also with the Government's clear commitment to increase the financial
and operational efficiency of the public enterprises of the transport sector.
3.    This project was conceived at a time when it was essential to address important sector
issues, including: (a) constraints and physical limitations to the existing infrastructure; (b)



2
sector management and operational efficiency; (c) transport investment planning; (d)
pricing/tariffs and fiscal policy; and (e) institutional coordination and overall planning. In this
conteat, the main objectives of the project were to strengthen investment planning and
coordination in the port sub-sector, and assist the public enterprises in achieving financial
viability and improving operational efficiency. The investment program priorities were to
rehabilitate, modernize, and maintain existing facilities.   PE  were also targeted for
improvement in operational and financial performance. One of the main objectives was to
strengthen the financial position of the ports and to help them develop a cost-based tariff
system. Technical assistance was provided to help introduce new technology for port cargo
handling and increase operational efficiency through a comprehensive training program.
4.     Specifically, the project covered a four-year program of high priority investment in
the ports sub-sector. This constituted a first phase of a longer-term program of port
modernization and rehabilitation. It included the development of specialized container-
handling facilities in the three main ports of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba, the provision of a
bulk cereals handling facility in Annaba (later cancelled); and a supporting program of
technical assistance and training. The investments included:
(a) Civil Works:
(i) Remodeling of existing berths in the port of Algiers by relocating seawards of an
existing mole to provide 320 meters of berth length for container vessels with a water
depth of 11 meters, back-filling an adjacent basin to provide paved storage area of
about 17 hectares and improving road access to and from the port area; this option
intended to provide for an installation of gantry cranes during a later phase of
development. Civil works also included construction of a container freight station and
miscellaneous buildings, and operation and maintenance services;
(ii) Paving of an existing berth and strengthening an existing quay with tie rods in the
port of Oran to provide a storage area of about six hectares for containers and Roll
on-roll off (Ro-RO) trailers;
(iii) Infrastructure works at the port of Annaba involving modification of an existing
240-meter Ro-Ro berth by constructing a quay wall about 50 meters in front of the
existing berth to gain sufficient area behind the berth to handle container traffic and to
provide a container berth with a water depth of 10 meters as well as paving of a
storage area of 3.5 hectares in the port of Annaba to provide facilities for container
and Ro-Ro traffic;
(iv) Construction of an 80,000-ton storage facility for cereals in the port of Annaba
which was cancelled; and
(v) Preparatory dredging works in the port of Algiers;
(b) Equipment:
(i) provision of specialized container handling equipment for the first phase of
.modernized container operations in the ports of Algiers, Oran, and Annaba. Total
equipment requirements for the first phase for Algiers included eight 35-ton forklift
trucks with automatic spreaders, four 10-ton forklifts with spreaders, and 10 towing
units and trailers; for Oran required equipment for the first phase included four 35-ton
forklifts with spreaders and a one-ton forklift with spreader; for Annaba required
equipment required was four 35-ton forklifts with spreaders, and six towing units and
trailers.
(ii) provision of a large-capacity unloader for bulk cereals traffic in the port of
Annaba; and



3
(iii) provision of miscellaneous equipment for navigational aids and equipment
maintenance, including computers for port management and operation in the port of
Algiers;
(c) Institutional Strengthening:
(i) A comprehensive training program covering conventional cargo handling,
operation of modem container handling equipment, and equipment maintenance; In
addition, training in finance, accounting, and auditing was to provided through the
proposed tariff and cost accounting study. Assistance for training in container
operations was supposed to cover three principal areas: (a) container system control
and management; (b) physical container handling on ship and shore; and (c)
establishment of procedures for engineering operations, maintenance and repair, and
stock inventories;
(ii) Assistance for construction supervision in Algiers and Annaba; and
(iii) A program of assistance for the preparation of studies for subsequent phases of
port modernization, including the handling of cereals imports and the need for a
marine repair facility and for cost accounting and port tariffs. This component
focused on improving cost accounting and port tariff management. The project also
financed studies related to the future of Algerian ports, including a cereals distribution
study in order to define an optimum prograrn for cereals handling through the ports,
taking into account existing inland silos and the pattern of local production. Another
study examined the need for establishing a marine repair facility.
5.     At appraisal, the total cost for the ports III project, during the 1990-1995 period was
estimated at about US$127.8 million with local currency representing 50.7 percent; and a
foreign exchange cost of 49.3 percent, or US$63 million. The project accounted for about 30
percent of the total port development program during the period 1990-92. Loan 3105-AL was
intended to meet the foreign exchange cost of the project (at the time wvhen the US dollar was
equivalent to 6.80 Algerian dinars)
Evaluation of objectives and risks
6.     The objectives stated at appraisal were deemed realistic and appropriate since they
formed part of a broadening Bank lending strategy for the Algerian transport sector. The
project aimed, in particular, to strengthen investment, planning, and coordination in the port
sector; improve management of the public port enterprises; and make better use of existing
facilities by introducing new technology for cargo handling; thus bringing substantial foreign
exchange savings through the lowering of transport and handling costs on a large part of the
foreign trade.
7.     The most important risk foreseen at appraisal was the pace at which port users would
be able to shift to container technology. The other risks were related to the impact of local
currency devaluation on the financial viability of the facilities, and the Borrowers' lack of
experience with Bank procedures and procurement guidelines.



4
B.     These risks were mitigated by using conservative assumptions on traffic
developments, and adopting an investment program and project scope that were consistent with
the absorptive capacity of the beneficiaries. The creation of the PIU to coordinate among
beneficiaries and follow up on project implementation was a key factor in implementation
success. The authority given to the port enterprises to adjust their tariffs, and the introduction
of a foreign exchange portion in the tariff helped to ensure the financial viability of the new
investments.



S
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Sector policy and financial objectives
9.     The project, which coincided with economic liberalization, has had a positive impact
on the development of container traffic along with private sector development. The initial
results in terms of unitized traffic have encouraged companies to plan for the acquisition of
more sophisticated equipment. From a financial perspective, the earnings of port enterprises
already show promise with respect to development capabilities. Moreover, the port sector has,
for the first time done a modem planning study of ports. The successful completion of the
Third Port Project has served as a catalyst for lifting the administrative constraints on
container traffic, and will permit more ambitious planning for port modernization by the
concerned authorities. In global terms, this project's objectives were achieved. Improving the
operational and financial performance of sector enterprises was given high priority, and as the
port enterprises became autonomous during the life of the project, their activities improved. In
effect , the process of becoming autonomous has had a positive impact on the enterprises'
financial performance and operations, as demonstrated in their financial statements (see annex
2).
10.    All financial performnance indicators show (see table 1 to 6 in annex 2) that the
assigned objectives have been reached in the case of Algiers, Annaba, and Oran. The rate of
return on investments at historical costs, and the working and operating ratios at these three
ports, reflect improved financial performance at all three port enterprises (EPA, EPAN, and
EPO). Their financial statements show a healthy financial structure, good cash situation, and
satisfactory technical and financial performance. The current ratio varies from 1.0 in 1990 to
2.0 in 1997 for EPAL, from 3.0 down to 2.0 for EPAN, and from 1.0 to 2.7 for EPOR. The
debt ratios are constantly kept well below a threshold of 50 percent, at about 16 percent for
EPAL, 19 percent for EPAN and 13 percent for EPOR in 1997. The positive internal cash
generation covers more than twice the project target in terms of debt service requirement and
investment financing. The working and operating ratios in 1997 averaged, respectively, 45
percent and 51 percent for EPAL, down from 77 percent and 90 percent in 1990; 55 percent
and 79 percent for EPAN down from 70 percent and 80 percent in 1990; and 62 percent and
70 percent for EPOR down from 200 percent and 236 percent in 1990. All indicators were
above the project targets of 90 percent for EPAL, and 75 percent for Annaba and Oran.
Physical objectives:
11.    Project implementation was undermined by numerous delays. A number of factors,
that had been present at appraisal time, have affected the implementing capacity of the
Government Agencies and notably MPW despite their commitment to settle them at the early
stage of implementation. These are as follows: (a) resettlement difficulties in Algiers and
Annaba; (b) lack of agreement on appropriate location for dumping the dredging materials; and
(c) low absorptive capacity of local enterprises to carry out complex contracts.
12.    Port of Algiers: Given the difficulties related to economic conditions that were not
appropriately foreseen at appraisal and were beyond the control of the beneficiary enterprises,
planning for the works at the Algiers port was significantly delayed. However, all civil works,
consisting of the remodeling of existing berths and backfilling of an adjacent basin, have been
completed and required equipment has been installed. Resettlement problems (for business
population and households units), and dispute among the Algerian authorities regarding the
dumping site for dredging materials that occurred during implementation, however, did slow
the construction of the container terminal.  It took three years to resettle the on-site



6
warehousing facilities (such as the vinegar making factory) to other areas of the city. All other
related civil works such as the water, electrical, sewerage, and fuel oil networks, as well as
railways and access road, were also completed.
13.     Port of Annaba: All civil works, for the container terminal, have been completed, and
the required equipment has been installed. The construction of the 80,000-ton storage facility
for cereals was cancelled due to its excessive cost. The potential contractors were charging a
premium to cover the risk associated with the prevailing sociopolitical environment.
14.     Port of Oran: At loan closing, all major civil works, consisting of the paving of an
existing berth, have been completed and the required equipment installed. The strengthening of
a related quay, to provide adequate space and support for future heavy equipment and heavy
traffic, is behind schedule, however, with no impact on port operation. The delay was caused
by conflicting interests and objectives among engineering and services providers. The port of
Oran has called on another firm to finish the work, which should be completed by December
1998.
Institutional development
15.     Two important actions were taken during project implementation: (a) the inventory,
and revaluation of all fixed assets of port enterprises, was completed in 1995; (a) the cost
accounting study was also completed and its recommendations are expected to be implemented
in late 1998. This project helped the Government define a port development strategy based on
the port development studies financed by Japanese funds, and the cereal transport study
financed under this project.  Furthermore, the new administrative organization of port
authorities, as well as the strategy for private sector participation in port operations are an
outcome of the studies undertaken in this project.
Environmental impact
16.     The completion of water and sewerage networks (including the construction a main
sewer) along the Algiers Container terminal has greatly contributed to improved water quality
in the port. Furthermore, in conjunction with the MARPOL convention and under GEF-I
project for the control of oil pollution in the Southwest Mediterranean, actions were taken for
the rehabilitation of four ballast cleaning stations. Moreover, construction of appropriate sites
in Annaba to dump dredging materials (bassin de depot des produiits de dragage) and the
identification of a site in the open sea to dump dredging materials in Algiers port area were
undertaken under the Project.
Economic evaluation
17.     The SHIPCOST model was used for the economic reevaluation of the project.
Assumptions on certain parameters had to be made because of the lack of recent data. The
main assumptions are that: (i) foreign cargo and/or cargo handled by large vessels (over 10,000
dwt) would occupy half of total berth length in ports, which constitutes 70 percent of total
traffic; (ii) foreign vessels represent 70 percent of total vessels calling Algerian ports; (iii)
foreign cargo and/or cargo handled by large vessels (over 10,000 dwt) are given priority for
use of port facilities. All other assumptions and data are included in table 9 of the statistical
annex. The recalculated ERR is 18.8 percent for the port of Algiers, 59.4 percent for the port
of Oran (this is due to the low cost of investment incurred by this port during the project). Due
to the lack of data, the ERR for the port of Annaba was not calculated'. This result confirms
the economic viability of the investment. Furtherrnore, as trade facilitation and other project
components mature, container terminals Algiers, Oran and Annaba should generate more
revenues and savings for the Algerian economy.
'The Ministry of Transports and port directorate have not provided data on port activity which had been requested by the Bank.

Financial Performance
18.    The financial impact of the project has been important for the port enterprises (as
demonstrated by the financial analysis in annex 2). The net income after taxes, as shown in
financial statements, was satisfactory, representing in 1997 about 40 percent of total revenues
for EPAL, 23 percent for EPAN, and 10 percent for EPOR.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not subject to Government control
19.   The following unforeseen socioeconomic events occurred during the project: (a) the
security situation in the country curtailed the participation of foreign service suppliers, which
resulted in more burdensome requirements for those who wanted to participate; (b) the very
rapid devaluation of the local currency weakened the capital base of local enterprises and also
caused delays in construction; and (c) local contractors were used as a last resort, after the
defection of foreign companies. Although local enterprises have a relative expertise in the
necessary techniques, they did not have the technical resources or the managerial capacity to
meet construction deadlines. These factors generated significant cost overruns in local
currency. However, in general terms, and taking into account the situation described above,
the project objectives were, for the most part, achieved.
Factors subject to Government control
20.    The following factors were largely within Government control: (a) delays in
procurement; (b) lack of experience in the procurement procedures recommended for the
project (the lack of knowledge of Bank procedures was, from the outset, a source of delay);
and (c) poor coordination between the Ban que algerienne de developpement and the
beneficiaries, which resulted in inadequate financial management of the project, and, more
specifically, delays in disbursing the loan funds.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.     The project's components were designed appropriately and completed successfully,
and the new facilities are fully operational despite the lengthy delays. The performance of the
container terminals is above target except for Annaba, where it is recommended that port
managers be more aggressive in capturing container traffic that is diverted by other ports in the
north east sub-region in Algeria. In addition, unitized traffic is becoming more appreciated as a
tool to promote foreign trade by all concerned parties, including Government officials and
private ship and terminal operators.
22.    The project's sustainability is linked to that of port's institutional development policy
for the port sector. It is important that strong and sustainable mechanisms for trade and transit
facilitation be put in place so that the sustainability of the project is assured. Based on the
statistics from Algerian ports, container traffic has increased steadily, rising from 77,663 in
1991 to 158,697 containers in 1997. The port of Algiers, which is the largest of the three ports
under the project, is considering how best to organize for anticipated levels of container traffic
10 year hence. Its total container traffic has grown from 46,148 TEU in 1993 to 120, 836
TEU in 1997, which represents an increase of 261 percent. Container traffic of 250,000 TEU
is projected for 2001, with annual increments thereafter of 10,000 TEU per year. Algiers
expects to be handling 14 million tons by the year 2010, which gives some indication of the
likely level of container throughput at that time.
23.      Taking the short-term view, this project has fulfilled its role; however, the terminals
in the three ports that have just been completed requires other actions on the institutional front
to make the project truly sustainable in the long term. An action plan is needed in order to
develop a user-friendly customs service and to optimize container stay within the ports. One
option would be to develop customs-controlled areas outside the ports to absorb the anticipated
increase in traffic, as well as a dry ports in the vicinity. Another option would be to improve



9
the productivity of the existing tenninal by investing in special container equipment and
removing obsolete quay trailers.
24.    The institutional, and financial achievement of the project will ensure significant and
continuous improvements in the efficiency and performance of port operations. The study on
port development carried out under Japanese financing, and the cereals traffic study carried out
under the project, will assist the Algerians in planning future investment and maintenance
operations. Other major achievements are the shift toward autonomy of the Entreprise
Portuaire dAlger (EPAL), the Entreprise Portuaire d'Annaba (EPAN), and the Entreprise
Portuaire d 'Oran (EPOR) and the improvement of their staff skills. The financial targets have
been met, and the overall financial performance of the project is satisfactory. The project's
sustainability is further insured by the Government's strategy, which aims at transforming all
port enterprises into autonomous entities acting under regional port authorities; and allowing
private sector participation in port operations.
E. BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE
25.    In regard to implementation of the components, the performance of the Bank and the
Borrowers improved over time. Collaboration between the Bank and its partners has been very
good.  The institutional arrangement, which consisted of establishing a PIU, wvas very
beneficial in terms of project coordination and monitoring among the beneficiaries, and in the
preparation of progress reports. The Borrower submitted with delays the audit reports,
however, all recommendations made by the Bank regarding the auditors' comments were
implemented. The only shortcoming noted were the lack of information available to the ports
on the use of financing, on the progress in infrastructure work.
26.    It seems that the estimates of the appraisal report were appropriate for the terminal
and the silo at Annaba. However, in the case of the silo, the decision to abandon it and revise
the loan was dictated by economic conditions (successive local currency devaluations). In the
case of the container terminal, which does not seem to be achieving its objectives in terms of
traffic development, the downward trend in container traffic was not detected and assessed in
time by the MOT, MPW, and the port enterprise.
27.    The performance of the Borrower, especially the MPW and BAD was inadequate at
the beginning because of lack of knowledge of Bank's procurement procedures, cumbersome
administrative structure of both institutions, and their reluctance to use consultant services for
work supervision. In addition, the sociopolitical situation in the country slowed the pace of
implementation and caused an almost three-years delay in completing the project. The role of
BAD, according to all parties involved, was limited to liaison activities between the Bank and
local operators. Although It was supposed to be responsible for the financial management of
the contracts financed and for preparing payment requests addressed to the Bank. BAD's
cumbersome procedures were the main reason for the delay in the use of loan funds.



10
28.    The port enterprises fulfilled all their obligations.  Monitoring of the civil work
implementation in the areas for which they were responsible was satisfactory. In the case of
MPW works directorates, the method of project management limited their involvement to use
of loan funds allocated under their annual budget. Judging from the use of these loan funds,
MPW works directorates used up and exceeded the funds allocated to them. However, their
on-site performance did not meet expectations regarding the supervision of work and
monitoring of the project. They acted without consulting the port enterprises, which led to
certain distortions in options, the correction of which delayed execution of the project.
Examples include modifications in road access and removal of pipes and buildings from the
project area.
F. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
29.    Overall, the project is assessed satisfactory. The project was completed on time
(taking into account agreed upon extensions) except for the container stacking area for Algiers
port, which was commissioned in November 1998. Delays occurred because of inclement
weather during May and June 1998 and problems in procuring paving materials. The project
has achieved its implementation and development objectives. The Borrowers performed
marginally well and completed most civil works and equipment components identified in the
project. The training component, however, wvas not as successful because of the borrowers'
reluctance to spend loan funds on that activity. The only training carried out was related to the
maneuvering of handling equipment, provided by the equipment suppliers. The DP and the PIU
performed very well in the areas of coordination, monitoring and reporting.
G. FUTURE OPERATIONS
30.    Trends in container traffic in Algeria demonstrate that container use has indeed taken
hold and that this activity will continue in the future. Prior to the project, container traffic was
treated in a haphazard fashion, without any plans or specific studies. As a result of the project,
there is now a specific framework in place to develop container handling capability.
Maintenance resources specific to container activity have also begun to emerge, along with
specific means of transportation. Repair facilities are being put in place, and areas for transit
and outlying transfer are being organized. In a number of cases, requests for customs-bonded
warehousing have been granted. Furthernore, the willingness expressed by the ports of
Mostaganem, Bejaia, Skikda, and Djendjen to become involved in container activity bodes well
for the future. The beneficiary ports, in particular Algiers, already expect greater returns to be
generated from the acquisition of new equipment. Algiers plans to install gantry cranes and
straddle-carriers, with a view to more efficient use of time and space.
31.    To ensure continuity in container traffic development, container terminals must be
completely disassociated from current port business. The sustained development of container
handling capability requires that steps be taken to ensure that the terminals become port users
in their own right, and are no longer part of an entity in which they constitute merely one of a
number of activities. The container terminals will have to be managed by institutions governed
by commercial and competitive rules.

H. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
32.   Key lessons learned during project implementation. Implementation of the Third
Port Project has enabled the various beneficiaries to familiarize themselves with the complex
operations of construction management and procurement. The following are the key lessons
learned from the implementation of the project.
*  The quality of implementation depended very much on the level of precision and
rigor in preparing and appraising the components of the project.
*  More emphasis should be put on the use of consultants and on training;
*  Creation of PIU was deemed to be an appropriate decision to smooth project
implementation;
*  Delays must be anticipated prior to the project implementation phase. This
depends greatly on a thorough analysis of the implementing and absorptive
capacities of the Borrower.
*  Land reclamation and resettlement issues must be properly assessed prior to
project implementation.
*  Close collaboration between the PEs and the MPW would help better define the
scope and design of the infrastructure.
*  Comparisons of implementation experiences in the different ports brought to light
the fact that the many delays wvere caused also by the lack of information
concerning available land, environmental impact, and the relocation of occupants.
In Oran, where these problems did not exist, there was no delay in the execution
of the project. In Algiers and Annaba, problems related to expropriation and the
dumping of dredged materials caused delays and cost overruns, which port
enterprises found themselves forced to absorb.

TROISIEME PROJET PORTUAIRE
PRET 3105-AL
A -HISTORIQUE DU PROJET
L'importante congestion des ports au debut des annees 1980 a amend les
autorites a concevoir un plan de developpement d'envergure pour les ports algriens
qui a neanmoins e  revu a la baisse tant donne le debut de regression du trafic. La
croissance economique s'etant considerablement ralentie a partir de l'annee 1985, du
fait a la fois de la diminution des exportations d'hydrocarbures et de la reduction des
prix du petrole a incite I'Etat Algerien a proceder a un reajustement economique. La
capacite portuaire additionnelle n'etant plus devenue une preoccupation majeure, les
efforts seront plutOt acces  sur la modemisation des ports pour accroitre leur
1'efficacite.
En decembre 1986 le Ministere des Transports a saisi le Ministere des finances
sur les perspectives de financement de projet de transports par la BIRD. L'idbe d'un
projet de developpement pour les ports d'Alger, d'Oran et de Annaba a ete avance-
conjointement par les Ministeres des Transports et des Travaux Publics.
C'est ainsi, qu'au cours de la phase de preparation de ce Troisieme Projet
Portuaire, qu'un effort particulier a ete fait pour definir les priorites en matiere de
r6habilitation indispensable et pour etablir un programme par dtapes de modernisation
des ports en introduisant la technologie de manutention des conteneurs.
Il faut rappeller que le premier projet a ete la realisation du port de B6thioua, et
le second, l'etude pour le financement du projet de construction du port de Djen-
Djen, qui n'a pas abouti a la signature d'un accord de pr8t, du fait du refus i
1'6poque par la partie algerienne de certaines demandes de la Banque.
L'accord relatif a ce pret dans le cadre du troisieme projet portuaire d'un
montant de 63 millions de dollars US a ete approuve par le conseil des Ministres lors
de sa reunion du 26 juillet 1989. Il a ete signe a Washington le 17 Septembre 1990
et approuve par Decret Presidentiel n 91 - 123 du 05 Mai 1991. Sa mise en
vigueur est intervenue le 17 Juin 1991. Le couit initial du projet a et 6valu6 A 127,8
Millions de dollars US.

.- .LES REALISATIONS
C.1- TERMINAL A CONTENEURS DU PORT D'ALGER
Cette composante du projet s'integre dans le cadre du developpement des
capacites portuaires de la region centre du pays. Les etudes realises en 1982 avaient
examinees plusieurs scenarios de developpement des capacites portuairess d'Alger.
Le scenario optimal preconise, compte tenu de la croissance du trafic prevu a
l'horizon 1995, consistait en:
* I'amenagement d'un tenminal a conteneurs a l'interieur du port actuel
* l'extension du port d'Alger A l'Est pour un trafic conteneurise de 1,5
million de tonnes comprenant un lineaire de quai de 800 ml, un tirant d'eau de - 11 m
et une surface de terre-pleins d'environ 40 hectares, necessitant un prolongement de
lajetee Mustapha de 1.350m et la realisation d'un nouveau brise lames Est de 740 m.
Compte tenu de la baisse importante du trafic enregistre a partir de 1986, la
creation de nouvelles capacites (conteneurs) A l'interieur du port d'Alger allait
apparaitre conune une solution plus adaptee aux nouvelles previsions de trafic et aux
restrictions du budget d'investissement de l'Etat. Lors de la mission d'identification
de projets effectuee par la Banque Mondiale en janvier 1987, elle sera retenue pour
une evaluation economique qui estime son taux de rentabilite a 19 %. Elle sera alors
inscrite comme principale composante du troisieme projet portuaire financ6 par la
Banque Mondiale.
C.1.1 -Consistance des travaux:
* Constructions d'un quai de 320 ml par remblai d'une darse de 4,5 ha et
un tirant d'eau de 12 m ( Entreprises de realisation Groupement Sonatro - Sonatram-
Sotramest ),
* Acces routier d'une portee de 505 ml, ( Entreprises de r6alisation
Groupement Eneroa / Sotramo, sous-traitant italien SCI),
* Rev8tement et electricit6 du terminal d'une surface de 17 hectares,

Travaux rLagises
Ouvrage d'accostage: Acheve, il ne reste que des travaux de finition.
Terrassements et demolitions  Pour la realisation du terminal, des travauxde
terrassement et de demolition ont ete necessaires. Plusieurs contraintes ont et6
recontrees, notamment la liberation par etape des surfaces du fait de l'occupation du
site par plusieurs hangars et des habitations.
La liberation des hangars et des autres batisses ne fut pas facile. En effet, huit
familles dont les logements se trouvaient a l'interieur de l'enceinte du terminal ont ete
relogees et ce apres plusieurs demarches et l'intervention des autorit6s. Cette
operation a abouti au bout de plus de trois annees d'effort.
L'evacuation du site par la vinaigrerie (SIAD) a dure plus de trois (03) annees
apres avoir obtenu un hangar de remplacement qui a te ralise par la DTP/GGA
( qui I'a confi a l' EBA) en z6ne industrielle de Oued-smar. L'evacuation des futts
(120m3 chacun) ne fiut pas une tache facile a cause de leur dimension et au voeu de
l'entreprise (SIAD) de les recuperer, la aussi l'intervention des autorites a ete
necessaire afin de regler ce probleme.
La derniere batisse a etre demolie fut celle de la douane qui a continue a etre
utilis6e jusqu'en 1997, alors qu'elle a e  saisie a maintes reprises par I'EPAL, pour
evacuer les lieux. Elle n'a obtempere que bien plus tard, sous pr6texte qu'aucun lieu
n'est disponible pour heberger son personnel.
Le decapage et l'excavation des terre-pleins ont aussi presente certaines
difficult6s a cause de la circulation intense des engins, de 1'existence de marchandises
diverses et de l'exploitation de certaines voies et zones.
Clfture du terminal : La cloture du terminal a et6 achev6e avec la realisation des
differents portails d'acces, exception faite pour 20 ml qui ont ete laisses expres pour
la circulation des engins de chantier.
MRtalisation des diffdrents reseaux:
REseau de bitume: Ce r6seau a ete realise en substitution de I'ancien qui debouchait
au quai 27. L'ancienne bouche a quai a ete remplacee par deux bouches au niveau

des quai 31 et 32. Le reseau qui prend son depart a partir de I'unit6 de bitume au
niveau du port, a ete acheve et mis en service.
Reseau de produits noir (fuel, gasoil et huiles usagees): Realise par 1'entreprise
ENGOA, en substitution de l'ancien reseau aboutissant au quai 27 et remplace par un
reseau debouchant aux quais 31 et 32. Ce reseau qui prend son depart a partir de
l'unit6 de NAFTAL au niveau du port, est ternine et mis en service.
Reseau d'assainissement : Les reseaux d'assainissement qui se deversaient dans la
darse N7 ont ete devies vers la darse N8. La darse N7 ayant e  comblee par un
remblai hydraulique, qui a necessite I'apport de 400.000 m3 de sable.
Le GTC a donc procede A la deviation de ces reseaux par la realisation d'un
monolithe pour chacun des deux conduites de diametre (1450 et 1150).
La partie de l'ancien reseau qui a ete utilisee pour le raccordement avec ces
monolithes a ete renforcee au moyen de murs de soutenement prefabriques en beton

Remarques importantes:
Cette operation a connu d'important retard du fait des contraintes de r6seaux
enterres non signales auparavant qui ont ete decouverts ( conduites SPIK ) a l'endroit
de ia rampe I de l'ouvrage entrainant I'arr8t de la realisation des pieux de fondation.
L'Administration compte tenu de cet etat de fait a ordonn6 des fouilles de
reconnaissance systematiques au niveau de 1'ensemble des appuis de l'ouvrage ainsi
que la rampe n 02 et ce en vue d'evaluer l'ensemble des contraintes une fois pour
toutes et pennettre de reprendre les travaux sur la base de donnees claires dans les
delais les plus courts.
Ces fouilles ordonnees par l'Administration ont permnit de decouvrir la
presence de reseaux divers essentiellement au niveau de la rampe 1 de ltouvrage
( AEP SPIK et BONNA DN 500, conduites de gaz DN 200, cables de haute et
moyenne tension et PTT, voies ferrees du faisceau TAMZALI ). La majorite de ces
contraintes n'a pu etre mises en evidence qu'au deuxi6me semestre 1995.
Compte tenu de cette nouvelle situation, une solution variante parmi les cinq
ftudi6s a et6 arrfete avec les concessionnaires des reseaux en question pour la levee
de ces contraintes et permettre la poursuite de la realisation de cet important
ouvrage.

Les travaux de cet acces routier sont composes essentiellement:
- D'un pont de 330 m de long et de 9m de large avec deux rampes de 175m,
soit une longueur totale de 505m.
- D'un amenagement routier ( e1argissement de I'autoroute sur le terre-plein
central et des amenagements de carrefours a la sortie du terminal etc...).
Ces travaux ont ete confies au groupement (ENEROA-SONATRO) qui ont
connu un taux d'avancement global de 98%.
Travaux realiss:     - 125 pieux sur 125
- 10 Semelles pour fondation sur 10 unites
- 07 piles sur 07
- 09 travees sur 09
- 02 cul6es sur 02
- D6capage et reglage de la plate-fonne du lot route.
II reste les finitions du lot ouvrage d'art et le revetement d'une petite partie du
lot route.
Lors de sa mise en service qui est prevue pour la fin du mois de Novembre
1998, cet acces routier permettra la sortie rapide et directe des camions du terminal a
conteneurs vers l'autoroute de l'Est (ex avenue de l'ALN).
CONTRAINTES RENCONTREES
La premiere contrainte a ete l'interdiction de l'immersion des produits de
dragage du port d'Alger qui a retardee l'avancement des travaux d'une annee et demi.
L'autorisation d'immersion des Autorites de I'Environnement a ete delivree le 20 Juin
1993 ), le dragage a ete effectue un mois apres.
La seconde contrainte a ete l'occupation du site pendant une annee pour des
pr6occupations de preservation d'emploi par certains syndicalistes et dockers du port
d'Alger.
La troisitme contrainte a ete rencontr6e par l'occupation du site des terminaux
a conteneurs par un ensemble d'installations ( logements, unit6s industrielles et
hangars de transit).

CONCLUSION
Malgre tous les problbmes et contraintes objectives rencontrees lors de la
realisation de cet important ouvrage qu'il a fallu solutionner au prix d'un retard
consequent ( trois annees ), l'interet de ce projet demeure intact et perrnettra
d'augmenter la capacite de transit et l'adaptation du port d'Alger au trafic des
conteneurs avec les moyens les plus appropriees. Les installations realisees
permettront de faire transiter 900.000 tonnes et a cours terme 1.200.000 tonnes
moyennant l'utilisation de portiques pour le chargement et le dechargement des
conteneurs et les chariots cavaliers pour la manipulation au sol des conteneurs
(transfert et gerbage). II est a noter que les postes a divers qui existaient a la darse 7
avant son comblement ont fait transiter un trafic maximum de 333.000 tonnes qui a
te atteint en 1989.
A moyen termne, compte tenu de l'evolution du trafic conteneurise qui a atteint
en 1997 un taux de conteneurisation de 16,1 % ( 8 % en 1989)et moyennant
l'amelioration du systeme de manutention (investissements complementaires sur les
portiques et chariots cavaliers ) une augmentation substantielle de la capacite
d'entreposage des conteneurs est attendu et des economies importantes peuvent etre
realisees.

redimensionnement de cette composante a e  opere, et il a e  retenu une extension
de 30.000 tonnes adjacente au silo a cereales existant de 16.000 tonnes.
Le passage du port en entreprise publique economique (EPE) a fait revoir
l'ensemble de sa strategie de developpement . En effet, le Conseil d'Adrninistration
de cette entreprise a gele momentanement le lancement de l'etude d'extension du silo
pour des considerations financibres insuffisantes de l'entreprise. Un projet de
partenariat avec l'OAIC, propose par l'EP Annaba a e  refuse par la Banque. Apres
des tergiversations de plus d'une annre, le CA a autorise le Port a lancer cette etude.
qui a ete elaboree par un consultant canadien et qui a e  achevee en Mai 1996.
Malheureusement, la situation securitaire du pays a fait que au moment du lancement
de l'appel d'offres, seule quatre socites trangeres prequalifies ont retire le cahier
des charges. Sur les quatre soumissionnaires prequalifies, deux se sont retires de la
competition avant l'echeance de remise des offres. Ces desisitement ont fait qu' une
seule entreprise pour chaque lot a repondu, mais en proposant pour la partie genie-
civil des couits trois fois superieurs A 1'enveloppe retenu. Cette composante a due etre
annulie du projet.
Etude rJaIis6e
Le contrat portant sur les etudes d'extension du silo A cereales du port de
Annaba, a ete signe par l'EP Annaba et le consultant Howe Monenco - Canada le 13
Janvier 1995 a Paris. Les dlais de realisation sont de 12 mois pour un montant de
602 000 dollars Canadiens ( $CAN ) dont 590 000 transferables.
Un avenant concemant la prise en charge des prestations relatives A un mandat
complementaire portant < Preselection des Entrepreneurs I Fournisseurs,
depouillement et analyse des offres o a ete signe entre l'EP Annaba et Howe
Monenco portant le montant du contrat de base A 677.000 Dollars Canadiens dont
18.000 Dollars Canadiens non transferables.
Le projet est constitue principalement par deux operations portant
respectivement sur:
- Genie-civil ( construction des ouvrages civils, m6caniques et electriques)
- Equipements ( fourniture, installation et mise en service d'un dechargeur de
navires de 400 T/H )
L'etude a ete finalisee A la fin mai 1996, et la realisation des travaux du silo A
c6reales a e  estimee A 19 mois.

Rapport dc cl6ture    21
L'importance  de l'ecart  sur le plan coat de l'offre recue par rapport a
l'estimation initiale du projet a remit en cause la faisabilite de l'op6ration et dont la
consequence a e  son annulation.
[CONTRAINTES RENCONTREES
La  premiere contrainte a e   l'interdiction de l'immnersion des produits de
dragage au meme titre que le port d'Alger et qui anecessite la construction d'un
dep6t c6tier devant recevoir ces produits. La construction de ce dep6t a duree deux
annees et a ete achevee au cours du ler trimestre 1994. Le dragage a et6 effectu6
immediatement apres.
La seconde contrainte a et rencontree par l'occupation du site du terminal a
conteneurs par un ensemble d'installations ( logements, unites industrielles et hangars
de transit ).
CONCLUSION
Au vu du trafic qui a ete realise au cours de l'exercice 1997 ( 2661
conteneurs), un effort particulier devra etre engage par les prncipaux responsables du
port de Annaba pour faire rentabiliser les installations qui ont e  acquises dans le
cadre de ce projet.
Une concertation avec les principaux intervenants et op6rateurs portuaires
aiderait a faire le point et cerner les problemes rencontres par ce type de trafic. En
effet, avec ces installations modernes et des equipements performants, les r6sultats
auraient du 8tre meilleurs. Le port de Skikda, qui est a proximite, a enregistre un
trafic trois fois superieur a celui de Annaba, malgre I'absence d'installations
spdcialis6es.
Pour palier a cette faiblesse de frequentation du port, des efforts particuliers
devront 8tre engages en direction des operateurs portuaires:
- pour les sensibiliser et mieux faire connaftre le produit (publicite),
- engager des concertations avec le comite local de facilitation du trafic
maritime et portuaire en vue d'alleger les formalites administratives des documents,
- proposer des reductions de tarif pour le transit des conteneurs,
Toutes ces actions, sont a notre sens indispensables pour redynamiser ce type
de trafic qui est en fait irreversible et attirer une clientee de plus en plus exigentes.

Rapport dc c6ture    25
Afin de lever toutes ambiguites concernant la diminution du nombre de tirants
d'ancrage qu'il fallait installer pour le renforcement du quai de hambourg, et qui est
passe de 169 A 76 tirants, un retour en arriere est necessaire. En effet, en 1978 et
dans la perspective de l'epoque d'affecter ce quai (actuellement terrain d'assiette du
terminal) au passage du trafic des billettes d'acier, la societe SGTE de nationalite
fran,aise avait preconise la mise en place de 169 tirants d'ancrage pour perrnettre le
passage de ce trafic dans de bonnes conditions. La conjugaison de deux elements
importants a savoir la perte de ce trafic et les contraintes financieres ont eu pour effet
l'ajournement de la mise en place de ces tirants, d'autant plus que les trafics qui
transitaient par le quai en question ne necessitaient pas son renforcement.
La realisation du projet de terminal a remis d'actualite la necessite de mise en
place de ces tirants d'autant plus que le projet prevoyait dans une deuxieme phase,
l'installation d'un portique de dechargement dont le chemin de roulement et les
differentes reservations pour son accueil sont prevus dans le projet.
C'est ainsi que la societe SEROR s'est vu confier cette realisation,
malheureusement une s6rie d'exigence de la part de la societe allemande et de sa
Banque domiciliatrice jugee inacceptable par la societe SEROR et par la Banque
Algerienne, ont abouti A la resiliation de ce marche.
Cette resiliation a eu pour consequence directe des retards importants auquel
est venu se greffer la depr6ciation de la monnaie locale avec comme resultat final
pour SEROR l'incapacite d'acquerir les 169 tirants prevus. Seul 76 tirants seront
importes. Cette nouvelle situation a eu trois consequences, d'abord limiter le contrat
de SEROR a la simple fourniture des 6quipements ensuite faire reprendre l'tude de
la SGTE de 1978 par le Laboratoire dEtudes Maritimes (LEM) et confier la mise en
place de ces tirants A l'UFSI. Le LEM apres avoir repris l'etude et e1abore les
differents calculs, a preconise une implantation modulee en fonction de lutilisation du
quai et qui permettrai d'utiliser les 76 tirants disponibles de maniere optimum et dans
les meilleurs condition de securite.
Le taux d'avancement des travaux de mise en place de ces tirants est evalue a
20%.
L'achevement des travaux est prevu pour la fin du mois de decembre 1998, et
necessitera une augmentation previsionnelle d'environ 13.200.000,00 DA.
C.3.5 - Lot 1 revetement et cl8ture confie A 1'entreprise ECO (Oran).

penalisation du port d' Oran, d'autant que son terminal etait operationnel depuis
1994. La reception definitive n'a eu lieu qu'a la fin du ler trimestre 1998.
CONCLUSION
L'avenement de la construction du terminal a conteneurs a e  benefique pour
tout l'hinterland desservit par le port d'Oran et a donne un coup de fouet a
l'utilisation du conteneur par les operateurs du commerce international.
En effet, depuis sa mise en exploitation, le trafic des conteneurs n'a cesse de
cro^itre de maniere reguliere, pour depasser actuellement la capacite meme du
terminal. Au cours de l'exercice 1997, il a et enregistre un trafic de 38.347 TEU,
pour un tonnage de 195.588 tonnes de marchandises.
Compte tenu de 1'evolution rapide du trafic conteneurise ( 7 % avant la mise en
exploitation du terminal, 14,8% en 1995, 17 % en 1996 ), une extension additionnelle
de 4 ha a e  realisee en 1996 et une seconde extension de 3 ha a et6 int6gree au
terminal a conteneurs en 1997.
Les resultats ainsi obtenus permettent d'envisager d'ores et deja I'acquisition
d'equipements plus evolues ( portique a conteneurs) pour un developpement rapide
de l'utilisation du conteneur.
Pour une meilleure exploitation du tenrinal a conteneurs et en vue d'obtenir
une rentabilite optimale dans le traitement des navires Ro/Ro, 1'EP Oran a pris en
charge 1'etude de deux rampes Ro/Ro, et la realisation physique de cette
infrastructure est prevue pour l'annee 1999.

Un certain nombre de realisations induites par le projet sans avoir et prevues
initialement dans le rapport d'evaluation ont ete realisees par des financements locaux
( construction de hangars et de logements pour delocaliser les occupants des
difftrents sites devant servir d'assiette pour les terminaux a conteneurs d'Alger et de
Annaba).
Des contraintes objectives sont intervenues au cours de la realisation de ce
projet ayant amene a eliminer la composante Silo a cereales du port de Annaba et son
equipement du projet pour des raisons de couit trop eleve, depassant de tres loin
l'enveloppe allouee au depart. Le montant dbduit du pret s'eleve ainsi a 11, 9
millions de dollars US.
Les constantes mutations techniques et technologiques intervenant dans le
monde du transports maritimes et les exigences d'exploitation rendaient nbcessaires
ces nouvelles installations.
Malgre toutes les difficultes et les retards enregistres dans sa realisation,
I'apport de cet important investissement est certain, puisqu'il a permis d'insufler une
dynaniique nouvelle a ce trafic des conteneurs que subissaient les ports. 11 demeure
ainsi le plus important investissement r6alise dans les ports depuis la construction du
port de Djen-Djen en 1987.
A l'exception de l'operation de formation qui n'a pu 8tre r6alisee et qui sera
pnse en charge par chacun des ports concemes, l'ensemble des composantes de ce
projet ont ete menees a terme.
Globalement les objectifs assignes par le projet aux entreprises d'Alger et
d'Oran ont ete atteint, puisque tous les ratios pr6vus ont 6te respect6s. Neanmoins le
port de Annaba n'ayant pu realiser les objectifs prevus, n6cessite des solutions a
trouver pour la rentabilite des installations acquises.
Au plan physique de gros retard ont e  accumul6s et le planning de realisation
n'a pas e  respecte pour des raisons objectives et qui ne pouvait etre pr6vus au
moment du lancement du projet.
1 - Passage des entreprises du statut d'entreprises publiques soutenues
par I'etat a celui d'entreprises autonomes regit par la commercialit&. Ce degagement
de 1'6tat des entreprises nationales a eu pour consequence de les fragiliser. Le retard
dans le lancement des etudes d'extension puis de la r6alisation du silo a c6r6ales du
port de Annaba et de son elimination du projet en est la preuve accablante.

2 - La situation securitaire du pays a d'une part limite la participation
des intervenants etrangers et d'autre part augnent6 leurs exigences financieres,
notamment en prenant des assurances speciales.
3 - La devaluation tres rapide de la monnaie locale a aggravd la situation
financiere des intervenants locaux et par la meme engendre des retards de realisation.
4 - L'obligation de recourir aux entreprises locales ( en dernier ressort
du fait de la defection des societes etrangeres ), qui tout en maitrisant les techniques
necessaires n'avaient pas les moyens les plus performants pour respecter les delais.
5 - Pour des raisons de protection de l'environnement, le periis
d'inmmersion pour le rejet en mer des produits de dragage a ete obtenu apres une
ann6e et demie ( Analyse d'une option intermediaire, puis des prelevements et etude
d'impact ).
6 - Pour des raisons de protection d'emploi, les dockers du port d'Alger
ont bloque le chantier du terminal a conteneurs du port d'Alger pendant une ann6e.
En conclusion, il est a retenir qu'hormis les blements imprevisibles et externes
au projet les objectifs qui lui ont e  assignes ont et atteint.
RELATION ETAT /BIRD
Le Ministere des Transports ayant ete chargb de la coordination du projet
conformrment a l'accord de pret a informe tous les trimestres, la Banque Mondiale
de l'tat d'exbcution du projet.
Pour cela, un comite de coordination et de suivi du projet s'est reunit
regulierement tous les trois mois, et en cas de besoin chaque fois qu'il a et6
necessaire et notamment au debut du lancement de chaque composante. Ce comite
est compose de representants de l'ensemble des administrations concemrs ( Finances
et Equipements ), des Directions de Travaux Publics des uilayate d'Oran et de
Annaba et ceux du gouvemorat du grand Alger, des Entreprises Portuaires d'Alger,
d'Oran et de Annaba et des entreprises de rbalisation.
Des reunions hebdomadaires sur chantier 0ont effectuees localement pour un
suivi rigoureux du projet. Des rapports trimestriels sont blabores localement et
transmis pour la partie infrastructure au Ministere de l'Equipement et pour la partie

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 3105-AL)
Annex 2: Financial Analysis
Algeria: Third Ports Project (3105-AL)
1.        Financial statements for 1997 and related audit reports carried out by local
auditors were submitted by the 'three port enterprises between July 1998 and October
1998. The auditors have technical reservations about port enterprises' financial statements
because of the enterprises weak internal audit and accounting procedures. Although the
audits were carried out by the local auditors with limited experience in this field, the 1994,
1995, 1996 and 1997 reports have been of better quality than that those of 1993. The
Bank has sent telexes and letters to the three port enterprises with copies to the Port
Directorate reflecting its comments on the audit reports, and recommending actions to be
taken by the port managers. In particular, the auditors and port managers in Oran and
Annaba have been invited to investigate and identify discrepancies and accuracy of data
recorded, and send to the Bank updated audit reports for EPOR as well as action plans to
overcome accounting discrepancies.
2.        General comments on the issues raised by the auditors, and on the financial
statements submitted by the port enterprises, are summarized in the following paragraphs.
3.        The three port enterprises are using the Algerian national accounting system,
which is out of date by international standards. However, based on the auditors' remarks,
the enterprises are abiding by local regulations and are invited to implement sound
accounting and internal audit procedures to eliminate discrepancies in their accounts and
improve the efficiency of their structure.
4.        Operating expenses do not reflect the real figures. Non-operating expenses, and
revenues, which include expenses and revenues related to previous exercises, are still high.
Fixed assets and depreciation reevaluation need to be carefully recorded. However,
provisions for bad debts, fair evaluation of risk, and depreciation are much better identified
than in past reports. Procedures related to identification of assets, recording of investments,
and inventories are also more adequate but related procedures steel need to be fixed; long-
term debt is recorded at historical value; and provision is made for adjustment for exchange
risks. The current situation will further improve in 1998 and thereafter once the ongoing
cost accounting, asset valuation, and inventory study recommendations will be
imnplemented.
5.        Financial statements as presented by the three enterprises, and the auditors for
1990 to 1997 show a healthy financial structure, good cash situation, and satisfactory
technical and financial performance. The current ratio varied from 1.0 in 1990 to 2.0 in
1997 for EPAL, from 3.0 down to 2.0 for EPAN, and from 1.0 to 2.7 for EPOR. The debt
ratios are constantly kept below a threshold of 50 percent, they are about 16 percent for
EPAL, 19 percent for EPAN and 13 percent for EPOR in 1997. The positive internal cash
generation covers their debt service requirement and finances their investment programs.
The working and operating ratios, average in 1997 respectively, 45 percent and 51 percent
for EPAL down from 77 percent and 90 percent in 1990; 55 percent and 79 percent for



32
EPAN down from 70 percent and 80 percent in 1990; and 62 percent and 70 percent for
EPOR 200 per cent and 236 percent in 1990.
6.                   income statements of EPAL, EPAN  and EPOR, show, that revenues in
general increased faster than operating expenses. The main reasons for this increase were the
adjustment of tariffs and the rapid development of traffic. Operating expenses increased at a
lower pace than revenues. The main reasons for the increases in operating expenses were the
devaluation of the dinar, adjustment for salaries to compensate losses incurred by staff, and
reevaluation of fixed assets. The net income after taxes, as shown in financial statements,
was satisfactory, representing in 1997 about 40 percent for EPAI, 23 percent for EPAN, and
10 percent for EPOR of total revenues. Once the adjustment proposed by the auditors is
taken into account the above figures will change slightly, but the net income will remain
positive.
7.                Two areas of concern should be closely monitored with the three port
enterprises. First, wage expenses reflected an important yearly increase between 1990 and
1997 and represented 31 percent, 53 percent and 44 percent, respectively, of the added value
generated by each enterprise in 1997 compared to a generally admitted average of 25 per
cent. It reflects the low efficiency of the port enterprises' staff in carrying out their duties.
Second, depreciation and provisioning for exchange risks and bad debts, and valuation of
fixed assets and inventories should reflect the adjustment for devaluation.
