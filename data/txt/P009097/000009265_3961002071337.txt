NENOEANDWI AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EMECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURREY
FOR A TREASURY DATA SYSTE1S PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Turkey in the amount of US$9.2 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The loan would assist the Government in its efforts to improve
information, systems, and processes related to macroeconomic management, and
would have a term of 17 years including 5 years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interegt rate.
2.          Backoround.  Macroeconomic management in Turkey is the
responsibility of four main institutions: Ministry of Finance amd Customs
(tax policy and administration); State Planning Organization (public sector
investment program); Central Bank; and Treasury (Undersecretariat of Treasury
and Foreign Trade). The main tasks of Treasury are defined as policy
formulation and implementation in the fields oft (a) treasury management;
(b) foreign trade policy; (c) state economic enterprise portfolio management;
(d) financial sector regulation; (e) international capital flows; and
(f) incentive policy. In addition, Treasury has a broad responsibility for
supporting economic policy design and implementation, in general.
3.          Since its establishment in 1983 as a separate undersecretariat,
Treasury has sought to fulfill its role mainly by helping to coordinate the
Government's stabilization-cum-adjustment programs of that decade. In the
19908, it is expected that Treasury will play a critical role in assisting the
Government to manage the economy in a complex and rapidly changing
international environment. According to the new Government's Economic
Program, the first task will be to reduce the public sector deficit through a
program that minimizes short-run output losses and creates the basis for
sustainable long-term growth. Even with a stabilization program in place, the
Government is likely to be faced with a set of challenges in international
economic relations, emanating from institutional changes in the European
Community (EC), guropean Free Trade Association (EFTA), Central and Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Republics. For both tasks, the capability of
Treasury to provide accurate and timely information, and quantitative economic
analysis will be essential for efficient policy design.
4.          Today, Treasury faces a number of constraints on its institutional
performance. First, Treasury's data management and information technology is
obsolete and inadequate to support the information-intensive nature of its
work. Second, policy formulation is weakened by sianificant data problems
related to timeliness, definitional consistency, time-series availability,
accounting practices and formatting. These data problems impose a high tax on
staff time, and divert scarce resources from economic analysis. Third,
changes in information technology and in Treasury's role create a need for
continuous investment in human capital, particularly in: (a) database design;
(b) computer systems management; (c) analytic and modelling techniques;
(d) international accounting and auditing practices; (a) financial management;
and (f) international trade.



-2-
5.          proieCt OhiegtLIe. The proposed Project seeks to upgrade the
technology, informat lon, and analytic resources essential to Treasury's future
role in macroeconomic management. Specifically, the Project aims to:
(a) improve Treasury's monitoring and policy design functions; (b) provide
timely and efficient access for Treasury staff to a consistent, centralized
data source; (c) enable Treasury both to contribute to and draw upon the
databanks of multilateral Lnstitutions and other agencies; (d) ensure that
organizational procedures support efficient data processing and analysis; and
(e) support the development of a comple_entary institutional framework for
investment in human capital. An additional Project objective is to improve
the availability and reliability of economic data that Treasury provides to
other agencies, the private sector, and multilateral organizations.
6.          Proiect Descrintion.  The Project will support Treasury investment
in:
*    A Data Xanaoement System that:  (a) provides an appropriate
technology environment for macroeconomic data analysis; and
(b) contains centralized databases to support this work (para. 7);
and
*     Institution - Building initiatives that include:  (a) training in
selected economic, financial and technical subjects (para. 9);
(b) consultant assistance for special studies and economic model
building (para. 10); (c) management and training consultancy
support (para. 11)1 and (d) establishment of Treasury's library
and of an Economic Information Center (BIC) open to the public
(para. 12).
Funding for these activities will not be available from UNDP. A small
complementary grant may be provided by official German channels (GTZ).
7.         The Data Maaaoemeat System will create an advanced analytic
environment for Treasury, based on the central collection of and decentralized
access to economic data, managed on a mainframe computer where data integrity,
consistency and security can be effectively controlled. System development is
based on physical lnvestments in, and consultant assistance for:
*     a mainframe computer facility where the economic databases will be
stored and managed;
*    the design, creation and maintenance of economic databases to
support analytic work essential to Treasury"s role in economic
management (paras. 2-4)1
*    personal workstations that will serve as the primary data analysis
facility;
*     local area networks and remote communications capabilities that
wills (a) facilitate data sharing and communication, thereby
enabling coordinated analysis of data by Treasury teams and



-3-
between Treasury and other public agencies; a d (b) provide
additional network services including electronic mail and software
sharing, and
*     technical training for the Data Processing Center staff in
operating the new system, and in providing end-user support to
Treasury professional staff.
The proposed system will overcome many of the existing technology and data
constraints on Treasury and thereby provide an improved basis for the design,
implementation and monitoring of macroeconomic policies and programs.
8.          Successful implementation of the Data Management System depends
ons (a) the availability of professional staff with advanced analytic skills;
(b) the introduction of modelling tools and carrying out of studies that
support Treasury's role in economic management; and (c) organizational
processes that facilitate efficient data-sharing and data management. The
Institution-l Develoyment Component of the proposed Project has been designed
to enable complementary investments in these three areas, and also to support
public sector information dissemination objectives by establishing a library
and the RIC within Treasury.
9.          To strengthen the analytic capability of Treasury, a Professional
trainina proaram will support skills development in: (a) macroeconomic
modelling; (b) international trade; (c) liability management; (d) accounting
and auditing; and (e) selected topics in finance, statistics and related
areas. For selected staff, the program will include certification for
chartered financial analysts and public accountants. The program will provide
local and international training opportunities; and, in addition, Treasury
intends to negotiate in-house training assignments with related international
institutions (public and private). In the selection of suitable candidates,
attention would be paid to the career development of Treasury's most promising
staff, with special attention to the development of promising female staff,
currently under-represented in the professional streams. The Project would
also provide consultancy services within Treasury which would build upon
training provided under the project and strengthen the longer-term framework
for human resource development.
10.         To support the introduction of analytical frameworks that would
permit Treasury to quantify the impact of policy on key economic variables,
the Project will finance the development of modellino tools and studies for:
*     consolidating financial accounts of the public sector to support
more effective design of fiscal policies and programs, as well as
monitoring of fiscal developments;
*     analyzing state economic enterprise performance to support design
of financial and reform programs (including privatization);



4 -
*     analysing financial sector flow-of-funds to monitor impact of
public sector deficit financing on financial markets and key
macroeconomic variables;
*     strengthening consistency of macroeconomic programming; and
*     analyzing the impact on the government budget of trade tax
consolidation and reduction (in line with planned harmonization
with EC and EFTA by 1996).
These tools will ultimately provide the analytic base essintial for Treasury'e
role in economic policy design ane implementation.
11.         The Project would also support Treasury efforts to ensure that
organizaticonal structures and procedures maxim.Lze efficient use of the new
technology and information flows. The General Directorate for Economic
Research and Assessment (GDEmA), which will have the main responsibility for
Project administration, has already reorganized and staffed in line with its
future work-program. other changes have been made within other directorates
as well. However, further adjustments may be required to ensure coherence and
take full advantage of the now data system and modelling tools. The Project
would therefore provide management consultancy support to Treasury on these
issues.
12.         Finally, having improved the reliability of Treasury data and
strengthened its institutional capacity, the Project encourages the
dissemination and sharing of data and research activities by financing
equipment for the establishment in Treasury of a library and an Economic
Information Center open to the public. Under the proposed project, the
legislative arrangements necessary for the establishment of the RIC have been
submitted to Parliament, and principles governing its operations would be
agreed with the Bank.
13.         Proiect Costs and Financing. Total Project costs are estimated to be
equivalent to $28.1 million, of which foreign exchange costs are estimated at
$18.4 million. The Bank loan will finance $9.2 million, or about 50% of foreign
exchange and 38% of total project costs, net of taxes ($3.5 million). The
Government would finance the balance. Retroactive financing for early project
start-up to a maximum of $0.9 million equivalent (since March 1, 1992), would be
provided by the Bank loan. Treasury is the main beneficiary. The breakdown of
Costs and Financing Plan is shown in Schedule A. Details on Procurement,
Disbursements, and the Disbursement Schedule are given in Schedule B. A
timetable of Key Processing Events and the Status of Bank operations in Turkey
are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Details of the project and its
administration are given in the attached Technical Annex.



14.         Past Bak  inperince. Past Dank support of technical assistance
(TA) of the type provided under this project, in Turkey, has been limited.l/
The SAL program of the 1980's foresaw the provision of TA targeted att
(i) developing a debt monitorlng system for Turkey; and (iiL) supportlng
specLfic state-owned enterprlsos (SON's) ln theLr move towards autonomy.
ImplmentatLon of the debt monitoring system was successful. A review of the
posLtive implementation experlence of the SAL program, however, indicated that
lt would have benefltted further from greatert (i) focus on debt-management,
in addition to monitoring; (Li) accessibility, to policy makers and to the
Bank, of data relevant to the design of the program; and (LLL) rellability and
consistency of national account statistics. Implementation of the TA support
to 80t's was less satisfactory due tos (i) regulatory changes in the SOE
sector; and (ii) dispersed project implementation responsibilities. These
lessons have been incorporated in the deslgn of the proposed project,
specifically in the project's Data Management System (para. 7) and
Institutional Development (paras. 8-12) components. In addition, project
ownership by the main beneficiarie is strong, as evidenced by the
contribution of the various directorates withln Treasury to project
preparation and design, and by the appointment of ODERA as project
administrator, wLth a centralized coordination function.
lS.        Rationale for 8ank Involvement.  The Bank has recently begun to
work with the Government on developing an Informatice Sector Strategy, which,
inter alla, addresses public sector database requirements and related
institutional issues. The Project is an early product of that dialogue, and
would serve as a model on which to build public sector informatLcs activities.
The data-processing center at Treasury already possesses a critical mass of
technical expertise, and can play an important role in the public sector
Information system. In addition, the Bank has an obvious strong interest in
supporting Government efforts to improve macroeconomic management capabillty,
given its Lnvolvement in structural and sectoral adjustment, and its
macroeconomic dialogue with the Government. Treasury's data represent a
significant share of macroeconomic data essential for effective macroeconomlc
management. Pinally, the Bank can transfer its experience in economiz
database design and management, thereby accolerating the realization of
Project beneflts.
16.        Aoreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on:
(a) review of annual work programs with Treasury (para. 19 below);
(b) implementation of training program (para. 9); (c) terms of reference
(including composition and responsibilities of study groups) and timetable for
the development of analytic studies and modelling tools (para. 10); (d) terms
of reference and timing of the appointment of the management consultants
(para. 11) and training consultants (para. 9), and terms of reference of the
consultants for data specification and database deslgn (para. 7);
J/ TA provided (tn. 2400-TU) was complementary to SAL IV-V. A full review of
the SAL program of the 1980's (SAL I-V) is contained in: Turkey Structural
Adjustment Loans IV and V (Loans 2321-TU. and 2441-TU) and Overview of SAL.
1-V (PPAR, Report No. 7205, April 1988).



-6-
(a) timetable for development of action plans based on the work of the
management and training consultants; (f) framework for the establishment and
operation of the EIC (para. 12)t and (g) all goods and services required under
the project would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
17.         Appointment of the technical consultants required for the data
management system (para. 7), in accordance with Bank guidelines, is a special
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
18.         Benefits.  First, Treasury will have the technology, information
and analytic resources necessary to support its role in macroeconomic policy
design, monitoring and implementation. Second, by encouraging information
sharing, the Project will help to improve policy formulation and
implementation and reduce the scope for uneconomic investment in both the
public and private sectors. Third, successful project implementation could
have a broader positive impact within Treasury through eventual extension of
the system to management information uses, and institutionalization of a human
resource development program. Finally, within the context of continuing
public sector Lnvestments in information technology, the Project is expected
to have a significant impact on other institutions in Turkey through its
demonstration effect.
19.         Risks.  The major risk is that the critical institution-building
components might lag behind investment in the computer hardware and software.
Measures to minimize this risk include: (a) selection by Treasury mant-ement
of the Directorate of Research and Economic Assessment as the project
administrator; (b) quarterly meetings of all Treasury General Directorates to
review progress, and to assess institution-wide needs for project support, and
contributions to project implementation; and (c) formulation of annual work-
programs by Treasury to be agreed with the Bank, and revised on a semi-annual
basis. such work program reviews, combined with technical design elements of
the data management system, would also serve to minimize risks related to
changes in technology.
20.         Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, aid recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.

BEPUDIC OF TURREY
TREASURY DATA Y8T1M  PROJECT
TECMNICAL AME3
SECTION A: DZTAILED PROJZCT DESCRIPTION
1.        QBackaround. Macroeconomic management in Turkey is the
responsibility of four maln institutions. Monetary pollcy falls within the
jurisdiction of Central Bank and Treasury. The responsibllty for fiscal
policy is jointly managed bys (a) the Ministry of Customs and Finance, which
prepares the budget and is in charge of tax policy and administration; (b) the
State Planning organization, which supervise preparation of the public setor
investment programt and (c) Treasury, whose main task ie to ensure
availability of financial resources for budget implementation. Coordinatlon
ie carrled out by the Hlgh Planning Councll, and, in the case of monetary
policy, by a more specialized Committee for Money and Credit.
2.         The role of Treasury in macroeconomic management has undergone
significant change during the 1980.. Prior to 1980 and within a more
controlled economy, Treasury used direct lnstruments (i.e. credit ceilings,
controlled interest rates, forelgn exchange controls) to fulflll its
responsibility with regard to public sector financing. At that time, Treasury
was still contained wlthin the Minlstry of Finance. As the market
liberalization program gathered speed, Treasury moved towards price-based
instruments consistent with efficient flnancial market development. By 1983,
the Government decLded that an independent Treasury was essential to sustain
the policy reform program in both financial and foreign trade sectors. Under
Law Decree #188 (1983) and subsequent amendments, the main functions of
Treasury have been defined as policy formulation and implementation in the
fields ofs (a) treasury management; (b) foreign trade policy; (e) state
economic enterprise portfolio management; (d) financial sector regulation;
(e) lnternatlonal capital flows; and (f) incentlve policy. In addltion, the
Law provides Treasury with a general responsibility to support and coordinate
economic policy design and impl emntation, a role which was especially
important during the reforms of the 1980's.
3.          In the 1990., lt is expected that Treasury will play a critical
role in assisting the Government to target and achieve a more favorable mix of
output growth and prLce stabillty in a complex and rapidly changing
international economic enviroment. The first task in this effort will be to
reduce the public sector deficit through a program that minimizes short-run

output losses and creates the basis for sustainable long-term growth.
Treasury must therefore have the research skills and capacity, macro-modelling
capability and economic data-systems to support the design and implementation
of a conaistent macroeconomic program. Even with such a program in place, the
Government is likely to be faced with a set of complex problems in
international economic relations, especially with respect to institutional
changes in the European Community, EFTA, Eastern Burope and the former Soviet
Republics. As the pace of international change accelerates, it is important
that Turkey be in a position to anticipate and respond effectively to
developments with her principal trading and financial partners. Treasury's
access to international databases, and its institutional capability to model
and analyze evolving international trade and financial patterns will be a
crucial input for effective decision-making.
5.          Inhtitutional FXamrk". Treasury is organixed into four deputy
under-secretariats fort
*     Foreign Economic Relations, Ban)dng and Foreign Exchange, and
Public Finance;
*     Foreign Trade;
*     Incentives, Foreign capital and Free Trade Zones; and
*    Economic Research, European Community, and Administration.
Within the latter deputy under-secretariat, the role of the General
Directorate of Economic Research and Assesment (the administrator of the
proposed Project) has been to support Treasury's policy development function
primarily through: (a) its research agenda in collaboration with other
directorates and agencies; and (b) its responsibility for Treasury's economic
database.
6.          To met the expected increased need for sophisticated economic policy
analysis, Treasury has recently reorganized, inter alia, the ODERA (para. 28) to
strengthen analytic and data support functions. Departments/divisions within
GDERA have been streamlined in certain areas (e.g. administration and support);
while in others they have been reoriented to: (a) mirror the structure of the
other Directorates to which they provide support; and (b) reflect a more
international perspective on economic analysis. ODERA's new divisions of
macroeconomic modelling; national income, accounting and prices; and developing
countries are now fully staffed. With the staffing of these divisions complete,
and assuming that issues relating to data, processes and skills building are
addressed, the reorientation of GDERA will enable it to provide significant
support for Treasury's future responsibilities.
7.          Existin  Constrainta. Main factors which today limit Treasury's
institutional performance include: (a) inadequacies of the existing computer
architecture; (b) variable data quality and difficult accessibility; and
(c) skills limitations in advanced analytic and modelling techniques, as well
as in specialized areas related to accounting, auditing, finance, statietics
and trade.

8.          GguWer Architecgtm   .  The mainframe system used by Treasury
(until December 1991) suffered from a number of limitations. First, the
system had run out of on-line storage capability, which was filled by less
than S years of historical data. Analysts would obtain longer time series
only via special batch runs, which would search archive tapes and run only
when enough time was available. Second, the system could support less than
half the prsonal workstations that needed to be connected on-line to the
mainframe. Analysts have typically been forced to delay projects while data
was obtained on floppy disks. Third, all data analysis had to be carried out
on the mainframe itself. analytic projects were therefore severely delayed by
scarcities oft (a) mainframe computer time; and (b) mainframe computer
programers. Despite several upgrades, the system still presented an
intolerable support deficit and impediments to the collection, cleaning, and
management of data required by Treasury.
9.          Data Xs.ues.  in carrying out its responsibilities, Treasury is
both a provider and user of economic and financial data. As a provider,
Treasury must produce foreign trade data, specific financial sector
indicators, and public finance information, including the national
consolidated budget domestic and external debt. In so doing, Treasury also
relies on other agencies and the State Institute of Statistics (SIB) for
sectoral, GNP, and monetary data. The main data problems that Treasury faces
can be summarised as follows:
inconsistencies and freauent chanaes in data definitions that
result in, e.g., the existence of at least two different GNP
sries, multiple definitions of the PSBR, differing values of
monetary aggregates, and incompatibility of stock and flow data
related to foreign and domestic debt;
-     unavailability of time-series data for key macroeconomic
indicators. For example, frequent re-basing and re-composition of
wholesale and consumer price indices make it difficult to create
time-series data essential to macroeconomic modelling, and to
price dynamics analysis. similar problems exist with regard to
times series for balance of payments and monetary aggregates;
*     limited inter-aoencv suvolv of data in machine-readable foxmat
makes information processing and analysis extremely costly,
reqwiring significant additional time for data reentry and the
diversion of scarce human capital from analytic workprogramsg
*     inadeauate access to on-line databass containing international
data on trade, monetary developments, etc;
*     specific data problems internal to Treasury as a result of
accounting pra¢tice for the state economic enterprises, and for
domestic public sector debt 



- 16 -
These poblam  involve a number of costs for Treasury.  lirst, valuable
managent nd profesetonal time is often spent on solving data problem,
rather than on the analysis of the issues facing the Turkish economy. second,
time lags in data procesing and analysis gwenrat. delays in macro-policy
corrections, magnifying the probability of policy errors and reducing the
effectiveness of response. Third, data problem accompanied by the lack of
modelling and other analytic tools, make it hard for Treasury to estimate the
impact of public sector financial activities on key economic variables.
10.        BhmW CanItal Constraints. Treasury professional and technical
staff are among the elite of the civil service. Nevertheless, changes in the
role of Treaury and in the technology, theory, and practice of economic
management create a need for continuous investment in human capital. In
particular, Treasury recognizes skills deficits ins (a) database design;
(b) computer system _anagement; (c) analytic and modelling techniques;
(d) liabillty managementt (e) international accounting and auditing practicesp
and (f) specialized areas of finance, statistics and related subjects.
Notwithstanding the proposed invostment in a database  nagement system, the
human capital constraint could become the limiting factor of institutional
performance, if not concurrently addressed.
11.        As part of Project preparation, Treasury carried out a sample
survey to identify the main information/data related constraints (as perceived
by staff) on productivity. The sample survey involved 123 respondents of whom
23 were senior manages, and 100 were professionals including Division Chiefs,
Uxperts and Assistant uxperts. About 80% of the staff surveyed are university
graduates, and 16% hold post-graduate degrees. The main findings ares
-    data reentry is the most frequent activity across all staff,
occupying between one and five hours per day. Data collection
also places a high tax on staff time, and is mainly from
publications. only 26% of the rcspondent access mainframe files
because of difficulties in writing computer programs, delays in
batch processing, etc;
*     staff are most often discouraged by difficulties in information
access, followed closely by data inconsistencies and technical
Lnefficiencies;
*    the main local data sources are ranked ass  (i) Treasury itself;
(L1) 8PO; (iii) 818t and (iv) the Central Bank. significant gains
in data quality can therefore be achieved within Treaury, with
limited inter-agency coordination;
*    the main international data sources are ranked ass  (i) ORCD;
(ii) DWI; and (iii) IBRD. Over 80% of respondents are satisfied
with international data availability; and



- 17 -
nearly 45% of respondents indicated that additional training in
macr-modelling and econometrics would enhance productivity.
About 30% indicated the need for additional traSinwg in
statistical analysis and spreadsheet techniques. Management
training requirements are more concentrated in spreadsheet and
word-processing tools, as opposed to the greater econometric
modelling, and statistical analysis training needs of staff.
In sum, the survey confirms that ianstitutional performance would be
strengthened by initiatives tos (a) reduce time costs of data collection and
reentry; (b) improve data consistency; and (c) upgrade existing human capital.
The Prolect
12.        Proisat gbiectie. and DescrLtion. To address these
institutional needs, the proposed Project aims to provide Treasury with the
information, technology and analytic resources essential to its future role in
macrooconoaic management. Specifically, the Project woulds (a) improve
Treasury's monitoring and policy design functions through introduction of data
analysis productivity tools; (b) provide timely and efficient access for
Treasury staff to a consistent, centralized data source; (c) enable Treasury
to contribute to and draw on databanks of multilateral Lnstitutions and other
agencies; (d) ensure that organizational structures and procedures support and
drive efficient data processing and analysis; and (s) support the development
of a complementary institutional framework for investment in human capital.
An additional Project objective is to improve the availability and reliability
of economic data that Treasury provides to other agencies, the private sector,
and multilateral organizations.
13.         In support of these objectives, the Project will therefore provide
investments ins
*     .A data managM2"t sstem  that:  (a) establishes an approprLate
technology environment for macroeconomic data analysis; and
(b) contains centralized databases to support this workprogram
(paras. 14-22); and
*    InqtutlonLg-kuJAldin5 initiatives that includes  (a) traliLng in
selected economic, financial, statistical, and technical subjects,
(b) consultant assistance for special studies and economic model
building; (c) management and training consultancy wpport to
GDNRA; and (d) information dissemination support to re-establish
Treasury's library facilities, and to establish an Nconomli
Information Center (RIC) in Treasury open to the public
(paras. 23-28).
runding for these activities would not be available from UNDP. A small
complementary grant may be provided through official German channels (GTZ).

14.        Technioal SmeMifications of System. The system to be financed
under the Project will create an advanced analytic environment for Treasury,
GDPZa and (at lower levels of support) for the entire Government. This
environment is based upon central collection of and decentralized access to
economic data, managed on a mainframe computer where data integrity,
consistency and security can be effectively controlled. Since the system
required would cover information related to the entire Turkish economy, use of
a standardized, or pre-deflned database would not be possible.
15.        The architecture proposed (Figure 1) is an extension of the one
used by Treasury for many years, liltially to collect, store, and report
foreign trade data. The changes proposed under the Project are nat however,
slmply lntended to enlarge the current system. Basic changes are to be made
in the archltecture and in the role of the personal worketation with respect
to the mainframe. Key elements of the proposed system architecture are:
*    A Mainframe Facility;
*    Personal Workstations; and
*    Local Area Networks (LANe).
16.        The mainframe facllity would act as a centralized repository for
data collectlon and management, and would guarantee data consistency and
integrity. Irrespective of source, the data would have to be processed
through the database software of the malnframe, which would apply consistent
quality, redundancy, and lntegrity standards as data were input and stored.
The mainframe is an IBM 3090 250J, whlch provides the unique functionality
required by Treasury. It was purchased by Treasury in 1991 from HalkBank, a
public sector commercial bank (which never used the system), from which
Treasury also procured the building that houses the computer facility. Under
the proposed Project, the Bank would finance certain minor modifications to
the computer building, the mainframe database software (DB2), and peripherals
for data communication and high-volume report printing.
17.        Petsonal workstations would serve as the primary data analysis
facility (replacing mainframe-based analysis of the former Treasury system).
Data that are stored on the mainframe could be retrieved by Treasury staff on
the personal workstations, which would also host the software necessary for
modelling, forecasting and other economic/financial analysia. Under the
proposed Project, the Dank would finances (a) about 55 personal workstations,
(b) analytic software; and (c) wiring for the mainframe-personal workstation
connections.
18.        The local area network (LANs) woulds  (a) facilitate data
communication and sharing; (b) enable coordinated analysis of data by Treasury
team;s and (c) provide additional network services, including electronic mail,
and software sharing. The Dank would finance the hardware (wiring and
servers) and the network software necessary to implement the LANs. Finally,



- 19 -
the system would use the most common data storage and interchange formats
(IBM D82 databases and LOTUS 1-2-3 spreadsheets'. hence minimizing the
likelihood that techaical change would render it obsolete, in the medium-term.
19.         NAd- oer Sungort 8ystem. As important as the technology
componnts is $the provision of technical training, consulting assistance (help
desk and troubleshooting), maintenance and systems integration. The Treasury
Data Processing Center has already developed plans to provide these services,
thereby permitting economic and finan$ial staff to concentrate on the
substantive workprogram of data analysis. To implement these plans, the
proposed Project would finance training for selected Data Processing Staff in
end-user support practices as well as in operation of the new system.
20.         TeZ.chnal InLmuMentation.  The Data Management System component
would be implemented in 6 phases (Appendix 1,A and Appendix 2,A):
*     Preoarina the Basic Technoloav.  Implementation of the new
mainframe, wiring of the LAWs and mainframe connections,
installation of new mainframe systems, and completion of minor
modifications to the new facility.
*     Convertina the Data.  Data which resided on the former system's
disk storage would be transferred to the new system and made
available for on-line access by terminals and personal
workstations.
*    Deigoning New Databases.  First, economic consultants would work
with 4GDRA professional staff to define Treasury's data
requirements. When the data have been identified, consultant
database experts would work with the Data Processing Center staff
to define the database specifications (schema) that allow creation
of D02 databases.
Imlementina New Databases. Once schema are defined for each data
set, the Data Processing Center would create new empty databases
to house the new data as it is collected and entered. This
activity would include the creation of data entry screens,
standard data access routines and standard printed reports. All
these activities are within the capabilities of the Center and no
consulting support is proposed for this effort.
Technical Trainina.  Training the staff in the use of the new
systems software and personal workstation/LAN data access
software. Courses will be provided off-site, in many cases by
vendors, and where possible in Turkey. This phase also includes
completion of a multi-media training facility, containing PCs,
required software and mainframe access, and the presentation media
necessary to train staff in complex technical topics.



- 20 -
21.         Technical training would be required by almost all Treasury staff
with direct responsibility for system operation. This is due to the now
technology environment to be implemented in the Project and the implications
of this environment for Treasury procedures for data collection, storage,
analysis, preosntation, dissemination and sharing. If possible, training
would be conducted locally, but for most topics inacluding data specification,
database design, and development of standardised reports, International
training would be required.
22.         Total base costs of the Data Management System Component are
estimated at US$23.9 million (Attachment 2). US$6.3 million equivalent would
be financed by the Bank, and would support extension of Treasury's exLsting
mainframe, wiring, personal workstations, LABs, software, limited building
modification, and technical training.

InatDttttional Drelooment L osng
23.         Successful implementation of the Data Managanent System depends
ons (a) the availability of professional staff with advanced analytic skills;
(b) introduction of modelling tools that support Treasury'. role in economic
managment; and (c) organization structures and processes that support
efficient data-sharing and data amagement. The Institutional Development
Component of the proposed Project has therefore been designed to support
Treasury's objectives in these areas, and provides:
*    2Traniua to address both short-term requirements and build longer-
term capacity for personnel developmentt
*    Analvtyi Tools and Studies to support introduction of advanced
modelling macroeconomic and foreign trade analytical tools and
carrying out of specialized studies; and
*    Fs2Organizato  SyuMot to ensure that organizational structures and
procedures allow for the effective use of new system.
The institutional component would also support Treasury and GOT objectives
with regard to information dissemination and sharing by supporting the
establishment, within Treasury, of a library for Treasury staff, and of an
'conomic Information Center, open to the public. The Institutional
Development Component would be amplemented a set out in Appendix 18 and
Appendix 28, attached.
24.        Traialna Sub-ogmfonent. Training, both technLcal and
professlonal, is a key element of the proposed Project. Technlcal training to
be provided for under the proposed project is included in the project's Data
anagement System component (para. 21). ProfessLonal training under the
proposed Project would be made avallable to a broad spectrum of Treasury
staff. The objectlve of the professional training program would be to ensure
that staff are famillar with state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and in a
position to conduct and participate fully in sophisticated research/
analytLcal activities, such as those to be carried out under the project's
special studies sub-component (para. 27). To thLi end, the professlonal
training program would comprLse long and short-term courses, both in Turkey
and abroad, and is expected to cater to approximately 70 of Treasury's most
promLsLng and key staff. Training would be provLded (inter alia) ins
(a) econometric modelling and forecastLng; (b) trade analysis; (c) liability
managemnt techniques; and (d) a variety of short-term specialized courses in
accounting, finance, auditing, and statistics.  For very select staff,
involved mostly with fLnancial analysis of financial institutlons and state
eonomle enterprises, opportunitles would be avaLlable to partielpate in
certlfied, internationally recognlzed longer-term programs abroad (L.e.
C$A/CPA programs). Another specLal feature of the program is that Treasury
intends to launch a concerted effort to formulate and negotiate traLning
opportunities for certain staff wlth key multLnatLonal public and private
organizatLons (e.g. IMP, IMF, OECD, BIS, as well as private international
accounting/auditing firms, and banks).



- 22 -
25.         The training  : . stments to be financed under the proposd Project
are expected to meet the shorter-term needs of Treasury, as well as specific
training requirements generated by the Project itself. In addition, Treasury
recognizes the need to strengthen its longer-term approach to personnel
development in order to institutionalize strong analytical capacity. To
address the short and longer-term needs of Treasury in this regard, the
Project would provide a training consultant who would assist the GDBRA to
identlfy specialized tralning opportunities, abroad and locally, eligible to
be financed by the Bank loan and defLne a longer-term, LnstitutLonalized
training program for the Directorate's staff. The results of this consultancy
would be shared with all Directorates, and can therefore be expected to
generate benefits Treasury-wide.
26.         To ensure that trainLng provided under the Project directly
supports project objectives, criteria for the selection of candidates for
training abroad would be subject to prior agreement with the Bank. In the
selection of suitable candidates, attention would be paid to the career
development of Treasury's most promising staff, with specLal attention to the
development of promising female staff. Candidates for CFA/CPA programs would
be required to confirm their intent to return to Treasury to work for 4 years.
Appropriate similar commitments from staff participatLng in courses of shorter
durations would be sought to ensure that the benefits of their training accrue
to Treasury. Descriptions of speclalized training to be offered locally to
Treasury staff would be reviewed and discussed with the Bank in the course of
annual workprogram discussions for the project (para. 31). Consultant
assistance for the training sub-component (US$80,000 equivalent) would be
selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants
(para. 25). Total costs of the professional training sub-component are
estimated to be equivalent to $0.8 milLion. Of this amount, $0.6 million,
representing all training except that to be sought from multinational public
organizations, would be financed by the Bank.
27.         Analvtic Tools and Stecial StudLes Sub-component.  The data
management system will provide the information resources for policy analysis,
design and monitoring. Building upon this resource, Treasury plans to develop
economic models that would support the Undersecretariat's role in
macroeconomic management and in trade policy formulation. Under the proposed
Project, Treasury would therefore establish "study groups" comprising staff
from ODRA, the General Directorate for External Economic Relations (DDEER),
other concerned General Directorates (i.e. GODP, GDBE) and Agencies, and local
and international consultants to develop analytic frameworks and quantitative
models fore
*     consolidating financial accounts of the public sector to support
more effective design of fiscal policles and monitoring of fiscal
developments;
*     analyzing state economic enterprise performance to support design
of financial and reform programs (including privatization);



- 23 -
*    analyzing financial sector flow-of-funds to monitor impact of
public sector deficit financing on financial markets and key
macroeconomic variables;
*    preparing foundations of a macroeconomic model that would
strengthen consistency of macroeconomic programming; and
*    analyzing the impact on the government budget of trade tax
consolidation and reduction (in line with planned harmonization
with RC and IPTA by 1996).
These frameworks would ultimately provide the analytic base esential for
Treasury's role in economic policy design and implementation. Draft terms of
reference for these studies (including staffing, expected outputs, and
timetables) have been prepared and would be agreed with the Bank. Total
consulting costs for the special studies sub-component are estimated at
US$0.8 million, most of which (US$775,000) is proposed for Bank financing.
28.        o                                      Gxational DgMrt Sub-cgm22n2a. OVERA has already
reorganized in line with its future worpram (para. 6). Recent staffing of
its macroeconomic modelling, national income accounting and prices, and
developing country divisions would support efficient Project implementation.
certain changes have also already been made in other Treasury Directorates
(Attachment 1); however, further adjustments may be required to take full
advantage of the new Data Management System and modelling tools. The proposed
Project would therefore provide management consultancy support to:
*    identify in close collaboration with Treasury officials,
procedural or organizational constraints on effective system use;
*    develop options to overcome these constraints, based on best
international practice, coordinating closely with the training
consultant (para. 26); and
*    propose a detailed action plan to address constraints identified.
Managee nt consultancy costs for this sub-component are estimated at
US$80,000.
29.         Pinally, to foster a culture of information-sharing within
Treasury and in line with the GOT's public sector information dissemination
objectives, the proposed project would financ equipment and furnishings
necessary to establish a Treasury library and the gEonomic Information Center.
Equipment for both would be compatible with the Beconomic Data System to ensure
linkages which would allow for library/SIC users to access most recent
information available. Efforts would also be made to allow for linkages
between the library and zIC databases, and those of other public agencies with
automated systems. Private sector access to SIC information would initially
be through direct contact, publibhed documents, and diskettes. To ensure that
the Center responds to private sector informational needs, Treasury intends to
survey these during the first year of the project. In the longer-term, access



- 24 -
to the NIC database would be provided by subscription and electronic hook-up.
The legal framswork establishing the BtC has been agreed, and operating
prLaciples of the RIC would be agreed under the proposed project. Exeept for
start-up costs, whlch would be funded under the project, the RIC's main
sources of revenues would be from publicatlon sales, subscription/user fees,
and ald and grants. Revenues from sales and user fees would be applied to
ineremental costs, lncluding publishing and royalties for articles published.
Budgetary costs of operating the BIC would be minsmal, since the space for the
center already exists ln Treasury (but is currently not being used), and slnce
staffLng the center would be accomplished within exLsting staff resources.
8quipping and furnishing the library and the BIC is expected to cost about
US$0.4 million, of which about US$0.3 would be financed by the Bank. Total
base costs of the overall Institutional Development Component are estimated at
about US$2.2 million. Proposed Bank financing of these activities stands at
US$1.8 million equivalent.
30.         Proleot Costs and rinancing.  Total project costs are estimated at
US$28.1 million equivalent, including about US$3.5 m$illon equLvalent in taxes
and duties. The foreign exchange component of the project stands at about
US$18.4 mllion. The proposed Dank loan (US$9.2 million equivalent) would
flnance about 50% of foreign exchange, and 38% of total project costs, net of
taxes, including a maximum of US$900,000 in retroactive financing for early
project start-up (para. 31). Details of the project costs and financing plan
are shown in Attachment 2 of this Annex. The schedules attached to the MOP
summarize this informatlon and provide LaformatLon on procurement and
disbursements.
SEC§IN B: PROJECT ADMIMISTRATION AND IMPYIJZiCATION
31.         Proiest U.m em_nta.tLon. Treasury would be responsible for overall
project implementatlon. A Schedule of mey Project ActLvlties and a Program of
Professional and Technical Training are contalined in Appendix 1 and 2,
respectlvely. Oiven the institutLonal nature of thls Project, it is essentLal
to maintain the momentum achleved during the preparatLon phase. A high level
of external technical support, together with intensive Bank supervision, is
therefore considered to be especially important during the early phase of
project implementation. In light of this, annual workprograms would be agreed
with the Dank nd reviewed bl-annually to assess the need for fine-tuning.
32.         Prosect CoordLnation/AdmJnLstration. ODERA iL responsible for
data management and research within Treasury, and, as such, would be the focal
point for many of the Project components. This Directorate is therefore,
well-positioned to coordinate project implementatlon and serve as
AdminLstrator of the Project, including communlcation with the Bank on
project-specific matters. As Administrator, 6DERA would host quarterly
meetings with the other relevant Directorates tot (a) coordinate their input
to implementatLon efforts and to annual workprograms (para. 27)t (b) reach



- 25 -
agreement on training opportunities for their staff financed under the Project
(para. 24)1 and (c) take stock of project progress. Nominations for
professional training abroad would be channeled through GDERa and would be
approved on the basis of selection criteria agreed with the Bank. GDERA would
also seek the advice of other Dlrectorateo on training programs to be provided
locally and/or in-house. Outlines of customized courses to be provided
locally (and the qualifications of the provider) would be prepared with
consultant assistance, and would be part of a training plan to be reviewed by
the Dank.
33.        Dsburement. Disbursements from the loan would be made on the
following basise (a) 100% of total expenditures for technical assistance,
studies and advisory services; (b) 100% of total expenditures on training
(excluding training provided by multinational public institutions); (c) 100%
of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory), and 90% of
items procured locally, on equipment (excluding mainframe); (d) 100% of
foreign expenditures on software; and (e) 100% of foreign and 90% of local
costs of wiring and building modification work required for the system.
Assuming little or no delay in early Project implementation (para. 31), full
project implementation would take place over a period of 5 years. Based on
regional profiles for similar projects, adjusted slightly to account for early
project start-up, it is expected that the Bank loan would be fully disbursd
in 6 years. To avoid interruption of early project start-up, retroactive
financing, up to a maximum amount of US$900,000 for expenditures incurred
prior to loan signing and since March 1, 1992 (excluding the costs of the
mainframe), would be provided. Disbursements would be made against fully
dioumented Withdrawal Applications for contracts greater than $50,000
qupivalent, and against certified Statements of Bxpenditures for contracts
less than $50,000 equivalent. A Special Account in the amount of USS00,000
equivalent, would be established in a currency and institution acceptable to
the Bank. Applications for withdrawal to the Bank will be subject to a
minimum threshold of $100,000.
34.                    .  (a) kerrLoshs Specialists for technical assistance,
analytic, organizational and training advisory services, and for the
preparation of professional training courses would be recruited by the Project
Administrator, under texms of reference agreed with the Bank and in accordance
with the Dank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Draft contracts for
these services would be subject to reviLw by the Bank prior to signature. t
is expected that the technical training would be procured along with related
technical equipment. (b) W$rina & LLNs Wiring, LAN installation and some
minor building modifications will be procured through direct contract to meet
the requirements of designs etc. of the contractor who built the Treasury
building for Balkbank (para. 16). Major building modifications financed by
the GOT under the project would be procured under it. own procedures.
(c) Goods: (i) Personal computers, a LAN server, computer-related equipment
(except those in item (ii)) and office and printing equipment would be
procured through ZCe procedures. A small share of the equipment (for the hIC,
the library, and LUA hardware) would be procured through prudent shopping*
based on price quotations from at least three suppliers. The value of each
contract would not exceed US$50,000, and the aggregate value of items procured



- 26 -
through shopping would not exceed US$lOO,OOOg (ii) Mainframe extension
equipment, software, and technical training would be procured through direct
contracting to ensure compatibility and coherence with Treasury's existing
mainframe. Bid packages estimated to cost US$500,000 equivalent and above,
proposal invitation packages for technical assistance, and all items procured
through IC0 and direct contracting would be subject to the Dank's prior review
of procurement documentation. The balance of contracts would be subject to
random ex-poat review after contract award.
35.         Accounts and Auditlnq. Separate accounts would be maintained for
all expenditures made under the Project. The Project Administrator would be
responsible for maintaining records and accounts on all project activities.
The accounts and statements of expenditures would be audited annually, by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submitted to the
Bank by no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.
36.         flenorts. MonLtorina and Accontability.  ¢DERA would prepare
annual project implementation reports, which would serve as the basis for the
preparation of annual workprogram discussions to be held with the Bank and
with other Directorates/agencies involved in project implementation. The
final annual project implementation reports would be submitted to the Bank by
no later than three months following the close of each fiscal year. However,
a draft report would be submitted to the Bank by November 30 of each year,
along with the draft workprogram for the following year which would be agreed
with the Bank.
