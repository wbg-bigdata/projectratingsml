Treasury's monitoring and policy design functions through the
introduction of data analysis productivity tools; (b) providing
timely and efficient access for Treasury staff to a consistent,
centralized data source; (c) enabling Treasury to access databanks
of multilateral institutions and other agencies and vice versa;
(d) ensuring that organizational procedures support efficient data

reliability of economic data that Treasury provides to other
agencies of the Borrower, private sector institutions and
multilateral organizations.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:

            databases are stored and managed;
      (b)   the design, creation and maintenance of economic
            databases to support analytic work by Treasury in
            economic management;
      (c)   personal workstations to serve as the primary data
            analysis facility; and
      (d)   local area networks to: (i) facilitate data sharing

      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the

Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify
by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made
only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in

furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the
Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the

deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.

for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with
the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
