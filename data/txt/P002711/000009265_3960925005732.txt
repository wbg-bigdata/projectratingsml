PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZAN A
URBAN WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 1354-TA/CREDIT 1271-TA)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Urban Water Supply
Project, for which Loan 1354-TA (US $15 million) was approved and declared
effective on December 23, 1977 and March 2, 1978 respectively. A supplemental
IDA Credit (1271-TA) in the amount of SDR 3.6 million and a grant from the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for US $ 3.2 million (Can $ 3.8
million) administered by the Bank, were approved to help complete the project.
The IDA credit was approved on June 24, 1982 and became effective on June 14,
1983, and the CIDA grant became effective on June 14, 1984. Both the Bank loan
and IDA credit were fully disbursed on December 30, 1984. The CIDA grant was
fully disbursed on February 28, 1985. The Closing Date of the project was
extended several times from June 30, 1981 to February 28, 1985.
2.    This PCR was prepared by tLe Infrastructure Operations Division of the
Southern Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, P-rts I and III). On
August 20, 1991 the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and II1 with the request to
prepare Part II by November 20, 1991, but after two reminders no reply was
received. Comments from the co-financier, the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), have been incorporated into the report.
3.    Preparation of this PCR was based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Lo,9n and Development Credit Agreemerts; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

URBAN WATPR SUPPLY PROJECT
'LOAN 1354-TA/CREDIT 1271-TA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    This Urban Water Supply Project marked the Bank's first major contribution
towards achieving the Government's goals in the urban water sub-sector.  The
project was to be implemented over 5 years and sought to develop the production
and distribution capacity of the water supply system for the town of Morogoro to
make up for deficits in demand and to meet future demand up to 1986.
2.    It also aimed to improve management and technical capabilities of the
executing agency and the ministry responsible for the sector - the Ministry of
Water, Energy and Minerals (MWEM).
3.    Major project components included: the construction of the Hindu Dim, a
1650 m long, 12 m high dam with a 10 million m8 capacity; construction of
production facilities; and provision of management advisory services to MWEM in
technical, financial and training areas.
Implementation Experience
4.    Project implementation was problematic with some components - engineering
of the dam and civil works on production facilities - experiencing delays and
cost overruns.   There was a need for supplemental financing to complete the
construction of the main civil works component - the Mindu Dam. An IDA Credit
(US $4.0 million) and a CIDA Grant (US $3.2 million) were approved for this
purpose.



- iii -
5.     The initial contractor on the 9onstruction of the dam experienced problems
n th delays in the procurement of essential equipment and maintaining the
nccessary level of techzvical staff on the site which led to an overall
unsatisfactory performance. MWEM terminatud this contract in August 1981 and re-
Rwarded it to the bidder evaluateo second lowest at the time of original
tendering. In the interim, a contingency pumping system was set up providing raw
water from the Ngerengere River, while dam completion was underway.
6.    The replacement contractor faced different problems due mainly to the
economic situation in the country at the time.   As a result, the dam was
completed 49 months behind schedule and at 238Z above the cost estimated at
appraisal.
7.    The contract for civil works and training for the Water Resources Institute
(WRI), the organizatior responsible for the training of water system technicians
was awarded in November 1980 but canceled a month later and its funds diverted
towards completion of the Mindu Dam.
8.    Attempts under the project to develop a commercially viable organization
to oversee the activities of the urban water sub-Lector were not successful. The
plan to establish an Urban Water Supply Fund was, after protracted discussior.s
among various government agencies, set aside in favor of the creation of the
National Urban Water Authority (NUWA) parastatal with initial responsibility for
the Dar-es-Salaam system and with the ultimate aim of controlling all urban water
supply systems.
9.    The Borrower also did not comply with the covenant in the Loan Agreement
covering the examination and review of water tariffs. Expected tariff increases
did not take place and upon re-examuination of the issue in 1980, the Government
decided that rates s.._'ld be based on a nationwide study determining actual
production and distribution costs of treated water in urban areas. The final
report of this study was submitted to MWEM in February 1985 who, based on the
findings, recommended that Government implement an immediate 10O increase in
tariffs. This recommendation was not implemented.
10.   The Closing Date of the project was extended several times from June 30,
1981 to February 28, 1985 to covdr the completion of dam construction.
Results
11.   The project was partially successful in meeting its objective of expanding
the water supply in Morogoro. Br mid-June 1985, all the components of the new
system (except the Mindu Dam)  tere in place and water production was on the
increase.
12.   The financial progress of the project could not be successfully monitored
as audited accounts for the project were not submitted to the Bank despite
repeated requests. A review of preliminary financial statements showed them to
be incomplete in the area of foreign exchange expenditure.



- iv -
13.   The impact of the project on the institutional organization of the sub-
sectGc was minimal as at completion, a functioning, viable organization with
complete control over sector activities did not exist.
Sustainabilitv
14.   The sustainability of the project depends on the urban water supply sub-
sector becoming self- _.nancing and well-managed in a timely fashion.  Both these
conditions cannot be achieved without a realistic tariff system that will ensure
cost recov- 7 and proper maintenance. Thus, it is doubtful that the results of
this project will be sustainable over the long term.
15.   Also, with the physical components of the project in place and the system
functional, an effective institutional framework for their utilization is
essential  for any benefits  of this project  to be  sustained.   Thus,  the
strengthening of NUWA in terms of re-examining the exisJing management system
with a view to setting clear goals, achieving autonomy of action on commercial
lines, retaining competent technical staff and managing its financial resources
efficiently is imperative.
Findings and Lessons Learned
16.   The main lessons from implementation of the Urban Water Supply Project are:
- the importance of accurate cost estimates and projections made at
appraisal;
-the importance of an autonomous institution, well organized and
competently staffed in the areas of management, technical and financial
operations to the smooth operation of water supply systems;
-the need for a comprehensive and realistic tariff structure reflecting
the full costs of provision of water to consumers in order to generate
the necessary for th:e operation and maintenance of water supply systems;
and
-the need to adhere to strict pre-qualification procedures and to
establish systems that allow close monitoring of contractors and provide
timely warning of potential problems; and
-the need for the Bank to exercise its sanctions under the Agreements if
Borrower'l commitment is lacking.

Sector                   Infrastructure
Sub-sector         :    Water and Sanitation
2.    Background
2.1         Tanzania's long-term policies in the water supply sub-sector aim at
having all urban water supplies eventually operating on a self-financing basis.
The intention is that urban consumers with private connections should pay the
full economic cost of water with tariffs being sufficient to cover capital,
operating and maintenance costs. In keeping with national policy water supplies
in rural areas - ranging from dug wells with no pipes to piped systems with
public standpipes - are provided free of charge by the Government.
2.2         Presently, funds for capital and recurrent expenditures are obtained
from Treasury through budgetary appropriations and are channelled to the regions
via the Prime Minister's Office and the Regional Development Director (RDD).
Persistent economic difficulties have resulted in limited budgetary allocations
for the water sector as a whole and Government has, in the past, relied heavily
on external, principally bilateral financial assistance particularly from the
Nordic countries.



2.3         Prior to 1971, activities in the water sector were administratively
divided between the Ministry of Works (respo:sible for urban water supplies), the
Ministry of Local Government (responsible for sewerage) and the Ministry of
Agriculture (responsible for rural water supplies and water resources). In 1971,
legislation was passed to provide the then newly established Ministry of Water
Development and Power (MWDP) with jurisdiction over development of water policy
for both the urban and rural water sub-sectors, newerage and drainage,
irrigation, flood control and electricity.   In 1975, responsibilities were
expanded to include minerals and it was renamed the Ministry of Water, Energy and
Minerals (MWEM).
2.4         With the adoption of national decentralization policies in 1972, the
role of MWDP changed from one of controlling and managing the country's water
programs to one of providing policy direction and technical assistance to 20
Regional Water Departments (RWDs) which executed the design, construction and
maintenarce of water supply systems within the region and were responsible for
billing and revenue collection.
2.5         RWDs were headed by Regional Water Engineers (RWEs) accountable to
the Regional Development Director (RDD) on administrative and financial matters
and responsible to the functional ministry for the operation and maintenance of
improvements and extensions to water systems under their jurisdiction.l/
2.6         In 1972, the Universal Rural Water Supply Program drawn up by the
Government established 1991 as the target date for the provision of permanent and
reliable water supplies to all rural settlements.   In 1974, the Government
advanced the target to 1980.2/ It was estimated, in late 1976, that only 22Z
of the rural population were being served through water systems developed by
MWEM.
2.7         In the urban water sub-sector, sectoral planning for water systems
(defined as those on which consumers are charged by a metered rate or by property
tax) has been carried out on a town-by-town basis as and when external financial
assistance has become available.   In the mid-1970s, about 85Z of the urban
population had access to water at varying levels of quality and quantity.
Supplies ranged, as they do today, from untreated surface and groundwater to
completely treated water. However, towards the end of the decade, domestic and
industrial demand outgrew supply and many urban systems began operating at their
maximum capacities with limited reserves. Water shortages became common during
peak periods of consumption and quAlity deteriorated.
l/This system remains in place today.
2/Even with its original target date of 1991, this was not achieved.



- 3 -
2.8         The Bank's involvement in the water and sanitation sector in Tanzania
began in 1973, in response to a Government request for assistance in identifying
the highest priorities in the urban water sector and developing appronriate
investment proposals.  The Bank reviewed water conditions and proposed systems
for seven towns experiencing acute shortages - Shinyanga, Lindi, Mtwara, Mbeya,
Morogoro, Mwanza and Iringa. Prior to this, the Bank had been minimally involved
in the urban sector in Tanzania, concentrating its efforts instead on furthering
the Government's goals of rural development.
2.9         In December 1975, a Bank appraisal team reviewed and confirmed the
economic viability of the seven proposed systems. Since the total project, as
appraised at the time, was large- than available Bank financing, involvement was
limited to assisting with the development of the water sunply system of one town
- Morogoro.  This system was chosen because it required :h2 largest investment
and also because its development was a prerequisite for future Bank investment
in Tanzania's industrial sector.l/
2.10        A study conducted in preparation for the Urban Water Supply Project
recommended the establishment of a national w&ter and sewerage corporation to
oversee the activities of the sector. The Government viewed the creation of such
a parastatal as ircompatible with its decentralization policies and opted instead
for the creation of an Urban Water Supply Fund to manage and finance activities
within the sector.2/
2.12        With the Urban Water Supply Project, the Bank attempted not only to
alleviate the immediate pressures caused by water shortages in Morogoro, but also
to improve the broader aspects of the sector by targeting assistance to build up
its institutional capacity. The latter objective included raising the standards
of administration, technical operation and financial control of the institutions
within the sector.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1         Both the physical need and priority of the project were clear - to
respond primarily to the need of Morogoro's growing population (37,000 people in
1973) for larger volumes of water. The project also aimed to provide adequate
water to an additional 27,000 people by 1986. In addition, the project sought
to increase the amount of water available to institutions and industry from 840
m3/day to 10,500 m3/day. "hus, the Urban Water Supply Project was to make a
l/The Morogoro Industrial Complex Project (Loans 1385 & 1386, 1977, US $23.0
million) financed the establishment of an Industrial Complex at Morogoro
itcluding the necessary infrastructure and facilities for small and medium
scsle industries.
2/Thi.l suggestion was later changed to be more in line with the one made
origtnally by the Bank with the creation of the National Urban Water
Authority (NUWA).



substantial contribution to the Government's investment program in the urban
water sector.
3.2         The project also aimed to deal with the institutional and training
problems in the water sector as identified by the Bank at appraisal.
Specifically, an attempt was made to address the problem of financial
independence and discipline by the creation of an urban water supply fund.
Revenues earned from the sale of water in towns would finance operating and
maintenance costs, debt service and minor extensions in accordance with budgets
prepared by the variGus urban water supply units.
3.3         The project  aimed to develop  the production  and distribution
facilities of Morogoro's water supply system by:
- the construction of an earth dam (1,650 m long and 12 m high) across the
Ngerengere River near Morogoro with tower intake, culvert and spillway.
The dam was to have a full capacity of 10 million ma of water and yield
more than 52,000 me of water a day;
- the construction of production facilities including transmission
pipelines, treatment and pumping stations, storage reservoirs and
reticulation extensions in Morogoro; and
- supplying new vehicles for the urban water supply unit in Morogoro.
The project also provided for management and technical assistance to:
- strengthen the operations and manag';ruent in the water supply sector
through provision of management advisory services in MWEM's
headquarters; and
- carry out the sector training program for the executing agency (MWEM),
including expansion and diversification of the Water Resources Institute
(WRI).
3.4         The estimated cost of the project net of taxes was US $18.5 million.
The Bank Loan for US $1! million was to finance 81? of total project costs (net
of taxes) - 100? of the foreign exchange costs (US $9.5 million) and 61? of the
local costs (US $5.5 million). The remainder was counterpart funding from the
Government. At appraisal, physical contingencies of 15? were provided for except
in the case of dam construction where contingencies of 20? were added to the cost
due to less certain rock excavation costs.  The price contingencies included
amounted to 19Z. Initially, the project was to be implemented over the period
between 1976/77 and 1979/80.



- 5 -
3.5         The Bank Loan was supplemented in 1982 by an IDA Credit (1271-TA) of
SD,R 3.6 million (US $4.0 million) and a grant from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) administered by the Bank for US $3.2 million to cover
substantial cost overruns.  Revised total project costs were estimated at US
$34.5 million - 80Z over the appraisal estimate and the original Closing Date of
June 30, 1981 had to be extended several times to February 28, 1985.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1         The need to strengthen the existing institutional arrangements in the
sector was recognized and incorporated into the project design. Provision was
made for the recruitment of management consultants to provide technical
assistance in the area of water systems operation as well as in the execution of
a training program for MWEM staff.
4.2         Also,  valid  attempts  at  making  the  urban  water  sub-sector
commercially viable were made through the inclusion of the component creating the
Urban Water Supply Fund.
5.    Pro3ect Implementation
5.1         Delays occurred in the implementation of the contract for exploratory
works for the construction of the Mindu Dam. Site investigation was completed
in mid-1977 but as rock levels proved higber than expected on the right bank, the
search for suitable construction materials required more time than anticipated.
The contract was eventually completed in April 1979. Executed works were less
than anticipated and a 10? cost savings was realized.
5.2         The contract for the construction of treatment works, pipelines and
reservoirs, awarded in March 1979, started in April 1979 and was completed by
March 1981, three months behind schedule with a 1472 cost overrun. The delay
was experienced as a result of a nationwide shortage of construction materials.
The increase in costs resulted from need for the transportation of aggregates
from the quarries at Mbeya and Tanga to the site, since that of Morogoro was
inoperative.
5.3         Civil works on the pumping stations proceeded on target and equipment
installation which started in June 1980, was completed by the end of December
1980. The water treatment facilities were completed and commissioned by the end
of May 1985. There was a cost overrun of 75Z due to the supply of switchgear and
transformers in a voltage (as requested by TANESCO) much higher than anticipated
at appraisal.



5.4         Problems arose with the implementation of the major contract -
construction of the Mindu dam. The contract was awarded in December 1978, signed
in March 1979 and construction began in late 1979. Considerable delays occurred
in procurement and some critical items of equipment did not reach the site until
April 1980. The equipment already on the site broke down frequently and there
were protracted delays in repairs. Among the other problems faced was that of
a lack of qualified personnel.  The contractor's staff on site never reached full
strength and the chief engineer who resigned in March 1980, was not replaced
until September 1980.
5.5         In November 1979, MWEM concerned about the contract, instituted a
program of regular monthly meetings with the contractor in order to monitor
progress. In March 1980, it was determined that only 5Z of the works on the
contract had been executed in 502 of the contract time.   MWEM informed the
contractor in late May 1980 of its intention to terminate the contract unless
assurances of timely completion could be provided. The contractor presented a
revised construction schedule to MWEM allowing for completion of the dam by
February 1982 and on this basis, the original contract was amended.
5.6         The situation seemed to improve after the contractor employed new
site staff and by the beginning of February 1981, the right bank cofferdam, 55Z
of the right bank impermeable core, 102 of the right bank filter, the inlet-
outlet channel and 60Z of the spillway excavation had been completed.
5.7         Performance deteriorated again to about 152 of planned output during
February when 702 of the technical staff left the site and 502 of the
construction equipment broke down. In March 1981, the contractor informed MWEM
that he was unable to fulfill the conditions established under the amended
contract and requested additional funding to cover cost increases.
5.8         MWEM dismissed the contractor in August 1981 and negotiated a new
contract with the bidder evaluated second lowest at the time of original
tendering.   A contingency pumping system drawing water directly from the
Ngerengere River was set up to provide a supply of raw water while dam completion
was underway. The system only operated to 202 and its establishment contributed
to the 1472 cost overrun experienced on the contract for the construction of
treatment works.
5.9         There was a need for supplemental financing to complete the dam. Upon
examination of the performance of the Borrower over the preceding period, the
Bank approved a supplementary IDA Credit (1271-TA) in mid-1982.  Towards the end
of 1983, it became apparent that there would be contractors claims for cost
overruns but the country's economic situation at the time did not allow the
Government to cover them. The Bank approached CIDA who approved a grant of US
$3.2 millionl/ conditional on four points:
i/Seventy-five percent of this was transfered from funds already allocated to
the Tabora Rural Development Project (Credit 703-TA, 1977, US $7.2 million)
and the remainder from other existing programs.



that an agreement between the Government and the Bank be reached for
the diversion of funds from the Tabora Rural Development Project
(Credit 703-TA) towards completion of the Hindu Dam;
that the amount would not exceed Can $3.8 million (US $3.2 million);
that written confirmation from the Government a"d the Bank would be
obtained indicating that the grant would be sufficient to complete
the dam; and
that full prior disbursement of IDA funding take place and that the
grant would not be available before the April 1983 - March 1984
fiscal year.
5.10        On February 29, 1984 the Bank gave CIDA written confirmation that the
grant would allow full physical completion of the daml/. CIDA also received
a written assurance from the Government that it would be responsible for any
additional cost overruns resulting from contractor claims subsequent to project
completion.
5.11        The  replacement contractor faced several problems:  a nationwide
fuel shortage in 1983; the need for additional cement to carry out rock
excavation in the spillway; and the need to haul stones from the Malela quarry
to the Mindu quarry due to the poor quality of the stones from the latter.
5.12        The dam was completed after a delay of about 9 months from the
revised contract date and with a substantial increase in construction cost - 2381
over appraisal estimates.   About 111 of the cost overrun was due to the
additional quantities of inputs (diesel, petrol, cement and steel) required while
spillway modifications and rock haulage contributed another 8.4z.
5.13        The contract covering the expansion of WRI which included the
construction of a library, laboratory, and an amphitheater and a training
component, was awarded in November 1980. However, after s budgetary review in
December 1980, the contract was canceled and its funds diverted towards
completion of the Mindu Dam.
5.14        During project implementation, the issues surrounding the creation
of the Urban Water Supply Fund were the subject of protracted discussions among
various Government agencies. The Fund as originally defined, would have been a
cross between a parastatal and a government department. In April 1979, MWEM
carried out a reassessment of its sector needs and suggested that a commercially-
oriented parastatal be created with assistance from the Bank.
l/This was not the case as there was an additional cost overrun of 4Z after
the grant was administered.



- 8 -
5.15        Management consultants prepared the legislative, organizational,
financial and staffing aspects of the proposed parastatal which was to have the
initial responsibility over the Dar-es-Salaam system and eventual control over
all urban water supply systems. Cabinet approval was given to the establishment
of the National Urban Water Authority (NUWA) in June 1980, Parliament approved
its creation in April 1981, and in early 1982, the Chairman and Directors were
appointed. The Director-General was appointed in September 1982. NUWA took over
the Dar-es-Salaam water supply system on October 1, 1984 but employment of
consultants and procurement of essential items was delayed by a lack of foreign
exchange. Further assistance in this area was provided under the Dar-es-Salaam
Sewerage and Sanitation Project (Credit 1312-TA, 1982, US$ 22.5 million).
5.16        Urban water rates were increased once by 35Z effective January 1,
1980 (from 2.20 TSh/m! to 2.97 TSh/m8) to keep tariffs at their July 1976 level
(in real terms) as outlined under the Loan Agreement. The expected 32Z increase
from January 1981 and the further 89Z increase over current levela in April 1982
did not take place. Proposed flat rates were tested in 3 towns during 1978 and
the Government was expected to decide on their implementation after evaluation
of the results from these experiments had taken place.
5.17        After re-examining the tariff issue in 1980, the Government argued
that rates be based on the results of a nationwide study determining the actual
production and distribution costs of treated water in urban areas. The Bank-
commissioned, SIDA-financed study completed in April 1983 made specific
recommendations on the structure and levels of water charges to be borne by
various users. These recommendations were to have been implemented by June 30,
1983. However, in March 1983, the Bank supervision mission determined that
revisions to the study were needed in the areas dealing with the assumptions used
and tariff development for specific consumer categories.   The final revised
report was submitted in February 1985 after which, HWEH recommended to the
Cabinet an immediate nationwide tariff increase of 100Z be instituted.l/
6.    Project Results
6.1          The cost of construction of the Mindu Dam was under-estimated at
appraisal. Bid prices ranged from TSh 116 million to TSh 196 million compared
to the appraisal estimate of TSh 55 million. The cost estimates prepared at
appraisal for pumping station equipment were also inadequate, leading to a 75Z
cost overrun. As a result, there was a total project cost overrun of 87Z (from
US $19.2 million to US $35.9 million). Cost increases were also due to the poor
performance of the main civil works contractor and to the shortages and price
increases of inputs such as fuel and cement faced by the subsequent contractor.
The delay in the construction of the Hindu Dam necessitated an extension of the
Closing Date from June 30, 1981 to February 28, 1985.
l/This did not take place obviously because with the Closing Date at hand,
the leverage exercised by the Bank throughout implementation was no longer
present.



-9-
6.2         The project went part of the way towards meeting its objective of
expanding the water supply of Morogoro. By the middle of June 1985, all the
components of the new system - with the exception of the Mindu Dam - were in
place and water production, though only at 34S of the level projected at
appraisal for that point in time, had started to increase.
6.3         Although the contractor still had site clearance, grass and reed
growth and two burst pipes to take care of, the completion certificate for the
dam was issued on February 25, 1985. Completion of the Hindu Dam took 5 years
(49 months longer than anticipated) and was achieved with a 238? cost overrun
over the appraisal estimate. Part of the funds earmarked for the procurement of
vehicles for the water supply unit in Horogoro and for the provision of technical
assistance to WRI as well as for its extension and diver2ification were
reallocrted towards completion of the dam.I/ This was seen as essential for
ensuring that the infrastructure required for enterprises being supported in that
area - to the tune of US$ 250 million - be in place. (The Bank had invested in
two other projects in the area - the Horogoro Industrial Complex Project (Loans
1385-TA and 1386-TA, 1977, US $23 million) and the Horogoro Textile Project (Loan
1607-TA & Credit 0833-TA, 1978, US $20 million) on the assumption that an
increased water supply would be available).
6.4         There was only one set of financial statements (despite constant
reminders having been sent to MWEM) submitted to the Bank during implementation
thus, close monitoring of the financial condition of the project was not
possible. In July 1984, the Bank reviewed a draft summary of expenditures and
found them incomplete as far as foreign costs were concerned.   In the early
months after project completion in 1985, operation and maintenance costs for
FY1985 were estimated to be TSh 8.5 million, 81 higheL than anticipated at
appraisal.   In the same period, revenue collection was estimated to be TSh
2.80/m8, only 14? of the target set at appraisal.
6.5         The NUWA takeover of the system in Morogoro was scheduled for 1985.
However, in mid-1984, with NUWA having achieved only 30? efficiency in billing
and collection, the Bank recommended the takeover be postponed until such time
that management capacity was raised to the level required for the smooth running
of the system.
7.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.1         The sustainability of the project depends on the overall urban water
supply sub-sector becoming self-financing and well managed in a timely fashion.
Both these conditions cannot be achieved without a realistic tariff system that
will ensure cost recovery and proper maintenance. Thus, it is doubtful that the
results of this project will be sustainable in the long term.
1/A supplemental IDA credit and a CIDA grant were also approved for this
purpose.



- 10 -
7.2         Also, with the physical components of the project complete (and the
system functional), an effective institutional framework for their utilization
is essential for any benefits of this project to be sustained.   Thus, the
strengthening of NUWA in terms of re-examining the existing system of sector
management with a view to setting clear goals, achieving autonomy of action on
commercial lines, retaining competent technical staff and managing its financial
resources efficiently is imperative.
S.    Bank Performance
8.1         Project identification and preparation were professionally tackled.
Although the requisite skill mix was present at identification and preparation,
the basic project design did not meet normal Bank standards. An example of this
was seen in the lack of attention paid to sources of construction materials for
the Mindu Dam which caused the delay in the contract for exploratory works.
8.2         Appraisal was not carried out at a high level, as cost estimates for
the major civil works component and procurement of equipment for pumping stations
were proven unrealistic. Supervision seemed to have been carried out regularly
throughout the course of implementation, but it was not clear why problems with
the major civil works contractor were allowed to continue for so long.
8.3         A major aspect of the Bank's performance during project preparation
was the identification of the need for a reorganization of Tanzania's water
sector.  The Bank recognized the need for the sector to become commercially
viable and its recommendation for the creation of a parastatal to oversee sector
activities was in line with this. While the approach in this area was sensible
ie. coupling the major investment with institutional capacity building, the Bank
did not follow 'ts own recommendation as evidenced by the diversion of funds
earmarked for this purpose towards completion of the dam.
8.4         The following lessons may be learned from the implementation of the
Urban Water Supply Projects
a)    the importance of accurate cost estimates and projections made at
appraisal;
b)    the importance of an autonomous institution, well organized and
competently sta.fed in the areas of management, technical and
financial operations to the smooth operation of water supply
systems;
c)    the need  for  a comprehensive  and  realistic  tariff  structure
reflecting the full costs of provision of water to consumers in
order to make available funds necessary for the operation and
maintenance of water supply systems;
d)    the need to -3tablish systems that allow close monitoring of
contractors and provide timely warning of potential problems; and



- 11 -
e)    the need for the Bank to exercise its sanctions under the Agreements
if the Borrower's commitment is lacking.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1         Concern over the potential occurrence of substantial cost overruns
led to a delay in the decision to dis-iss the major civil works contractor.
Since at the time the country's economic situation was such that prices of
inputs, when available, had increased substantially, an earlier decision to
terminate the original contract would not only have saved time but, reduced the
overall cost of the dam.
9.2         The  decision  of the  Borrower  to establish NUWA  showed  their
acceptance of the necessity of a commercially-oriented water sector for the
country and displayed their commitment towards achieving this. However,
performance on the part of the executing agency in implementing the required
organizational arrangements suffered from its weak institutional capacity.
9.3         The commitment of the Borrower to the completion of this project was
clear and led to its absorption of cost overruns over and above both the
supplementary IDA Credit and the CIDA Grant.
9.4         Submission of audited financial accounts to the Bank after each
fiscal year did not take place and poor records were kept on foreign exchange
expenditures. This severely hindered the evaluation of the financial performance
and condition of the project during implementation.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1        The relationship between the on this project was to a large extent
colored by the Bank's relationship with Tanzania during this period.l/  The
ideological direction of the Government and thus, the environment of the country
made the resolution of key technical and professional issues difficult.
l/The report, TANZANIA - World Bank/Tanzania Relations 1961 - 1987,
Operations Evaluation Department (OED), Sections 2 & 3, Vol. 2, Jan. 1990,
details this fully.



- 12 -
11.   Consulting Services
11.1        Both the engineering and management consultants assigned competent
staff to their components of the project and thus, performed their function
adequately.   Progress reports were prepared and submitted in good time and
discussed extensively with the Borrower.
11.2        The engineering consultants alerted the Borrower and the Bank to the
poor performance of the original contractor on the construction of the Mindu Dam,
and did so in good time.   In doing so they provided valuable input in the
decision to dismiss him and re-award the contract.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1        The Loan and Credit Agreements made no specific reference to pre-
qualification procedures under the procurement guidelines. Aside from this they
provided adequate guidance to project implementation.   Reliable data on the
physical aspects of the project over the implementation period were provided by
the regular progress reports submitted by the engineering consultant.
