PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.       This is a project completion report for the three above projects.
One was for basic sanitation in small rural communities and the other two
for the water supply of the city of Managua. The implementation of these
projects was interrupted and adversely affected by local political changes
that took place in 1978. The government institutions were reorganized,
including those of the water sector. A new institution, the Instituto
Nicaraguense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (INAA), formed from the merger
of the Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM) and the Departamento Nacional de
Acueducto y Alcantarillados (DENACAL), was given the overall responsibility
of all water and sewerage throughout the country. It was also assigned the
water supply component of the Rural Sanitation Project. The newly created
'Area Higiene del Mediol of the Ministry of Health continued with the
latrine component and overall administration of the Rural Sanitation
Project.
2.       The Rural Sanitation --oject, Loan 1495-NI, was approved November
29, 1977, in the amount of US$3 million. The loan was fully disbursed, and
closed on December 31, 1983 one and a half years later than originally
planned.
3.       The Managua Water Supply III Project, Loan 1496-NI, also was also
approved on November 29, 1977, in the amount of US$10.1 million. The loan
was fully disbursed and closed on December 31, 1983.
4.       The Managua Water Supply Engineering Project, Loan 1983-NI, was
approved April 30, 1981 in the amount of US$3.7 mill%aun. Of this amount,
US$2.4 million was disbursed and US$1.3 million cancelled. The loan was
closed on December 31, 1984.
5.       The Project Completion Report of '1988 was prepared as a desk study
by the Infrastructure and Energy Division, Department II of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Region (LA2IE) on the basis of documents
contaiLad in regional files and information provided by various staff
members involved with the projects during their execution. The last Bank
mission to the country was in January 1984.

MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY III PROJECT ('?oan 1496-NI)
MANAGUA WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT (Loan 1983-NI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       All three projects were adversely affected by the change in
government and the reorganization of eector responsibilities that took
place in 1980. Modifications and restructuring of the projects was done to
adjust to the changing circumstances that resulted. The major objectives
of all the projects, however, were maintained and local funds provided to
complete the facilities and engineering studies.
Rural Sanitation Proiect
2.       This project sought to improve rural sanitation services in three
regions of Nicaragua. through an integrated program of water, sanitation,
health education, house improvement and child immunization. The project
was the first Bank operation of its kind in Nicaragua and the capacity of
the Borrower to implement the Rural Sanitation Project was overestimated.
The project was amended, restructured and reduced in scope. After the
restructuring, project execution improved considerably and coordination
among institutions was strong. At the time the Bank stopped disbursement,
on country grounds, the project was being executed in a satisfactory
manner. The number of villages attended to was 170 instead of the about
550 envisioned at appraisal, with a corresponding reduction in the number
of people benefitted (85Z). The project reached the poorer smaller
villages with an average population of about 124 inhabitants aLd provided
an integrated aanitation and related health services program. On the other
hand, the latrine program exceeded by 84Z the appraisal target but no
latrines were rehabilitated. The communities were organized and trained to
be responsible for their contribution to the project and the operation and
maintenance of the facilities.
3.       Village participation and contribution was good, reaching an
estimated 20Z, of the total cost, exceeding the minimum 15Z in the
appraisal report. Unit costs were higher than estimated at appraisal
because of higher than expected inflation rates, project delays, increased
costs for health education, and the expanded project area, however, the
average per capita cost of the water services was US$55 which is relatively
low for Latin American standards. This project also showed how to provide
services to low-income population in an effective and efficient way.
4.       More time should have been spent on project preparation,
preappraisal and restructuring to design a project iore adjusted to the
capacity of the implementing agency. Bank supervision should have been



- xi -
more frequent than once per year to allow additional time to review
progress in the field as well as at the central office. This would have
enabled the Bank to help resolve problems at an early stage and provide
guidance to the Borrower.
Managua Water SUPPly III Proiect
5.       In the preparation and appraisal of the Project, the Bank
benefitted from dealing with a well-developed and experienced institution,
the Empresa Aguadoza de Managua (EAM), that was accustomed to preparing
projects in a thorough fashion. The EAM was familiar with Bank
requirements, and lad received three loans from the Bank beginning in 1962.
The loans were for the improv3ment and expansion of the Managua water
system, and all were successfully completed.
6.       The overall objectives of the Managua Water Supply III Project,
which was to provide an adequate safe water supply and improve the
operation of the system, were not changed after the civil war, some minor
components wore deleted, and the Bank agreed to use the savings to finance
more local expenditures and interest during construction. There were some
delays in management and tariff studies, and esrablishing charges for
private wells.  With these exceptions, compliance with loan conditions was
complete.  In 1979, however, because of the unsettled conditions and the
weakened financial situation of KAM, the financial covenants were not met
and, with the agre,"ment of the Bank, rate of return targets for 1980-83
were lowered.
7.       The project had a positive impact on the delivery of water to a
large number of urban poor and the improvement of service to the users in
general.  The financial assistance program for house connections
facilitated the process for the urban poor.  About 215,000 people (the
majority of which were urban poor) were connected to the water system.
8.       The project helped make the sector reorganization a success.  It
provided technical assistance and helped with the merger of EAM and DENACAL
to form the National Institute of Water and Sewerage (INAA). As a result,
sector efficiency was improved, and better administrative, financial, and
commercial practices for the sector were extended throughout the country.
Managua Water Supply Engineering Project
9.       The Managua Water Supply Engineering Project was identified during
the appraisal of Water Supply III in 1977, and included a feasibility study
to select the next project to meet Managua water supply requirements to the
year 2000. It provided for institutional improvements, a distribution
master plan and improved metering. The distribution master plan as
conceived is likely to require substantial revisions because of the changes
in population movements and densities occurring since its preparation. The
bidding documents and specifications that were prepared, for the most part
will require only adjustments with respect to the quantities of materials
and equipment, and the sizes of equipment.
10.      The completion of the Managua III project demonstrates that when
an institution is strong, enjoys autonomy and has a motivated experienced
staff, a project can be successful in spite of great political changes that
may occur in the country.



- xii -
11.      Because of 4afaults on repayments, disbursements were suspended on
September 28, 1984. Oi this loan, US$2.4 million was disbursed and US$1.3
cancelled.
12.      The Borrower considered that the engineering studies were
essential aud a prerequisite for the construction of the needed facilities
to provide additional water for Managua. Hence, it continued the studies
with its own resources and utilizing a local engineering rirm. INAA
informed the Bank that the studies were expected to be completed by July
1988. 1 The project also continued the program to make the operation of the
Managua water system more efficient and to improve the overall management,
administration, and financial condition of INAA. It has had a positive
impact.
13.      The tariff study for INAA was completed February 1984.  It is
comprehensive, but does not provide specific tariffs to be applied to every
region. INAA accepted the recommendations and began partially to apply
them.
14.      At the close of the project, unaccounted-for water was still high.
This, in spite of the efforts to reduce it. INAA planned to continue its
efforts, and attributed part of the problems to undetected damages from the
earthquake to pipelines and house connections, clandestine connections, and
inaccurate metering.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Sector
1.01     The population of Nicaragua in 1979 was estimated at 2.6 million,
about equally divided between urban and rural areas. By 1986, the
population had grown to an estimated 3.3 million, with the urban population
reaching nearly 1.96 million and the rural population almost 1.34 million.
1.02     Health statistics in Nicaragua are incomplete, and underreporting
of mortality and morbidity prevalent. Notwithstanding this limitation,
available figures give an indication of the prevailing situation in the
sector. In 1984, infant mortality was reported as 71.5 per thousand live
births and the general mortality rate was 9.7 per 100,000 live births.1
Intestinal infectious diseases were the third leading cause of death (10.32
of the deaths) aggravated by the unsafe water and poor sanitation.
1.03     By the end of 1986, 772 of the urban population of Nicaragua had
house connections or easy access to public standpipes for water supply, and
342 had sewer connections. Of the rural population, 132 had access to
potable water and 162 were served by latrines (PAHO).2
1.04     Although the availability of water and sewerage services in the
urban areas in 1986 was not too far below the averages for Latin America
(832 for water supply, 402 for sewerage), the services in the rural areas
are among the lowest, with only two countries having inferior service
levels for water supply (Paraguay and Cuba) and six countries, for excreta
disposal (Bolivia, Chile, Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela).
1.05     INM is responsible for all urban and rural water systems in
Nicaragua, INAA is also responsible for the urban sewer systems. The
Ministry of Health is responsible for rural sanitation systems throughout
the country. Up until project completion the operation and management of
the Managua Water and Sewer system was very good (para. 1.07) but no
reliable data on its evolution since 1984 is available, much still needs to
be done to upgrade the systems in the other cities.

B. The Borrower and the Executing Agencies
1.06     Rural Sanitation Project.  The Borrower for the Rural Sanitatior.
Project was the Republic of Nicaragua and the implementing agency for the
project was the Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Rural (PLANSAR) an agency of
the Ministry of Health created in 1976. In 1977, PLANSAR with USAID
financing was carrying out a rural water supply ani sanitation project in
60 villages. PLANSAR had planning and executing branches and through its
Regional Units selected villages where sub-projects were to be carried out.
Each village would establish a local Health Committee, cooperative or other
community organization to be responsible for its participation, and
subsequent operation and maintenance of the facilities. Only after the
village had demonstrated its willingness to participate, was a formal
agreement made and the studies and works undertaken. The Rural Sanitation
Project was delayed by the revolution in 1979 and came to a halt in 1980.
The new government changed personnel and abolished PLANSAR, and transferred
the responsibility for rural water supply to the National Institute of
Water and Sewerage (INAA) and all other rural sanitation activities to the
Environmental Agency (.4HM). The project was restructured to take into
account these new institutional arrangements.   AHM concentrated on the
latrine program and INAA on the drilled wells and water systems.
1.07     Managua Water Supply III Project.  The Borrower for the Managua
Water Supply III Project was the Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAM) created
in 1932 under the Ministry of Public Works. It had an experienced and
well-trained staff with a successful record in carrying out Bank-financed
projects.
1.08     Its accounting, billing and collecting, in general was
satisfactory. Some government accounts, however, were overdue and measures
were to be taken under the project to resolve this. The personnel
situation was good with some specialized training needed for operating
personnel.   The ratio of the number of employees to water connections in
1976 was 10 employees per thousand water connections, a little high for
Latin America, and efforts were made under the project to control this and
bring it down to about eight.
1.09     In 1979, EAM transferred its assets to INAA.  EAM's organization
and staff were not materially changed. The former Departamento Nacional de
Acueductos y Alcantarillados (DENACAL) responsible for the sector outside
of Managua, was also incorporated into INAM.
1.10     Managua Water Supply Engineering Project.  INAA was the Borrower
for the Managua Water Supply Engineering Project. In 1980, it had a
combined staff of 1,883, or 14 employees per 1000 water connections. At
the time of the INAA integration the two previous agencies EAM and DENACAL
had 8.5 employees per 1000 water connections and 22 per 1000, respectively.
EAM and DENACAL had different accounting and budgeting systems. Both had
problems with billing and collection, particularly with private accounts.
In 1984, 75Z of the delinquent costumers had made partial or full payment
to INAA. INAA was taking measures to overcome these problems and the
project provided technical assistance to help solve them.

12. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Rural Sanitation Project
2.01     Preappraisal - Appraisal.  The Rural Sanitation Project was the
first such Bank operation in Nicaragua. It was prepared over a period of
two years, 1975-77, by the Ministry of Health with the assistance of the
Pan American Health Organization (PANG). Also, during Bank supervision
missions of the preceding loans for the Managua Water Supply and the
Earthquake Reconstruction Projects, discussions were held with the
authorities on the project. This project was appraised jointly with the
Managua Water Supply III Project.
2.02     Negotiations.  These took place in October 1977.  It was
considered that although PLANSAR was making good progress on rural
sanitation projects, its experience was limited and could be a source of
delay. Accordingly, provision was made for technical assistance to help in
project execution.
2.03     Proiect Obiectives and Description.  The project sought to improve
rural sanitation services in three regions through at integrated program of
water and executed disposal, sanitary house improvements, and child
immunization.  About 172,000 people in about 550 villages with a median
population of 75 would be benefitted. The Bank supported the project and
aimed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the implementing agency.
The project consisted oft a) the construction of wells, improvement of
existing wells, and mini-aqueducts; b) the construction of communal laundry
and shower facilities; c) the building, improvement and rehabilitation of
latrines; d) the improvement of housing conditions; e) immunization of
children; f) acquisition of equipment, tools and vehicles for use in the
project; g) consultant services; and h) partial payment of salaries for
health educators.
B. Managua Water Supply III Project
2.04     Preappraisal and Appraisal.  The feasibility study for the Managua
Water Supply III Project, was prepared in 1976 by consultants. The project
was appraised in March 1977. It included a study of future additional
sources and the preparation of a least cost development program to provide
water to Managua.
2.05     Negotiations.  Negotiations were carried out in October 1977.  The
proceedings were facilitated, since the Borrower, EAM, had previous
experience in Bank projects and had substantially agreed to the loan
conditions during project preparation and appraisal.
2.0O     Project Obiectives and Description.  The Managua Water Supply III
Project sought principally to provide an adequate safe water supply and
prevent future deficits. It provided the necessary equipment and technical
assistance to make the operation more efficient; and helped reorganize the
water sector and improve the management and financial performance of INAA.
The project consisted of the construction and equipping of 6 deep wells;



- 4 -
construction of water tanks; acquisition of pumping equipment; construction
of three pumping stations; installation of about 100 km of 4" - 24"
distribution and transmission mains; installation of 20,000 hous,
connections; study of new water sources; the installation of valves and
hydrants; acquisition of a compuiter; and consulting services. The
feasibility study under this Project recommended as the least-cost solution
the development of a groundwater source 25 kms east of Managua, near Tisma,
which could meet the city's needs until the year 2000.
C. Managua Water Supply Engineering Project
2.07     Preappraisal - Appraisal. The engineering project was prepared by
INAA with the help of local and international consultants over a period of
about 25 months.  The project provided for the development of groundwater
sources about 26 kms from Managua (the Tisma scheme) in a first phase, and
the development of a treated surface water supply from Lake Nicaragua in a
second phase. These supplies would be brought to Managua through a single
transmission main.
2.08     Negotiations.  Negotiations were held in Washington on March
18-20, 1981.  It was foreseen that the demand forecasts to be used for the
final design might differ from those in the feasibility studies because of
the unsettled conuitions and changes in population, and funds were provided
for revising these demand studies.
2.09     Proiect Oblectives and Description.  The primary objective of this
project was to help INAA prevent future deficits in the Managua water
supply. The secondary objectives were to improve the management of the
Managua water and sewer systems and the financial performance of INAA; and
to increase the efficiency of operating the Managua systems by providing
spare parts and technical assistance for repairs and maintenance.
2.10     The project consisted of:  (a) the preparation of a water demand
study for Managua; (b) the final design for the Tisma water supply scheme
including technical specifications and contract documents; (c) a water
distribution system master plan for Managua and the final design for the
first stage distribution improvements; (d) a repair program for production
meters; (e) pumping station instrumentation and reservoir control valves;
(f) technical assistance to improve organization and management; and (g)
the preparation of a tariff study to build up a cross-subsidy in the tariff
structure.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Rural Sanitation Project
3.01     Project History and Implementation.  The Rural Sanitation Project
became effective on May 9, 1978, one month after signing, and came to a
halt in 1980 due to sector reorganization. The new government requested
the Bank to continue the project and the amending agreement was signed
April 2, 1981, with a new Closing Date of December 31, 1983.



- 5 -
3.02     Project implementation was in two phases.  Phase I was the work
accomplished by PLANSAR before the changes in government and institutions
and by AHM before June 30, 1980.  Phase II was that done by AHM and INAA
under the project as amended. PLANSAR, AHM, and INAA in varying degrees
suffered from limited experience in carrying out projects in rural areas.
However, with a gradual buildup of staff and the assistance of consultants
in management and administration, project implementationi improved
dramatically and by the end of 1983 all funds were committed. The initial
delays caused by the passing of the water supply component functions from
AHM to INAA, was overcome through better inter-agency cooperation and
planning. Also, the standardization of designs and recommendation of the
consultants speeded up implementation. The signing of contracts with the
villages was delayed, but action was taken in 1983 and all contracts were
signed by the end of the year.
3.03     The project was completed more than four years late. It reached
170 villages, exceeding the 1988 target of 150 villages. The latrine
program surpassed the target by about 1,500 units, and the number of wells
is also higher than the target number. The housing improvement component
was deleted, and the child immunization was done under a large national
program. Delays in project execution and changes in its scope, required
amendments and reallocations of loan funds, which are recorded in Table 1.
3.04     Compliance with the Loan covenants was good, but there were delays
in the submission of audit reports and the hiring of PAHO consultants for
technical assistance. The project's main objectives for providing water
supply and sanitary excreta disposal were met with respect to the amended
program, community participation was achieved, and the institutions were
strengthened and improved.
3.05     Procurement. AHM initially had difficultiea in following Bank
procurement procedures. But, even when it had mastered the procedures, it
had difficulty in making the system work as it failed to receive bids due
to the lack of trust from the suppliers to the new government. It was
agreed to continue to use ICB for pipe, sheet metal, and handpumps, and to
use local procedures for all other items, If no response was received for
bids for the pipe, sheet metal and hand pumps then the Bank agreed that
these items could be procured by local procedures in the original bid
quantities. Finally, the vehicles were the only items purchased through
ICB.
3.06     The construction of the latrines was done by the householders with
the guidance of the field personnel of PLANSAR and AHM. The villages also
furnished local materials such as brick, wood, sand and gravel. AHM
manufactured and supplied the concrete slabs and risers. The Sanitary
Units and Mini-aqueducts were built initially by AHM and later by INAA with
their staff and some local contractors. Drilled wells were also built with
the assistance of contractors. The Sanitary Units consist of a well with
handpump, shower and washbasins. The shallow dug wells were built by the
villagers. The immunization program and the malaria and insect control
programs were done by the Ministry of Public Health.
3.07     Cost.  The project costs were adversely affected by unanticipated
high local inflation rates and project delays. The overall increase was



- 6 -
39Z (Table 2). Much of the PLANSAR equipment, vehicles and materials were
destroyed, damaged, and stolen during the political upheaval and had to be
replaced. The increased time to carry out the project and the increased
project area required greater expenditures for health educatIon and
promotion. Efforts to control costs by standardizing designs, using staff
more efficiently, and better planning were effective. A summary of project
costs as estimated at appraisal and the final costs as estimated by the
Bank mission which visited Nicaragua in January 1984 is shown below:

B. Managua Water Supply III Proiect
3.09     Proiect History and 1a lementation.  The Bank participation in
urban water supply projects began in September 7, 1962 with Credit 26-NI
(US$3 million), the First Managua Water Supply Project. This was followed
on March 17, 1972 by Loan 808-NI (US$6.9 million), the Managua Water Supply
II Project. Later, to repair earthquake damage, a US$2.5 million Water
Supply Component was provided in the US$10 million Earthquake
Reconstruction Project signed on June 6, 1973. All these projects were
successfully completed, and their objectives met in spite of the
difficulties occasioned by the earthquake. The executing agency was EAM,
an autonomous and well-managed organization.
3.10     To continue the needed expansion of the Managua Water system
because of the growth of the city, the Water Supply III Project loan was
made. Loan 1496-NI for US$10.1 million, was approved on November 29, 1977
and signed on February 9, 1978. It became effective on May 6, 1978. The
original borrower was EAM, but in 1979 it was merged with DENACAL to form
INAM. The political upheaval delayed and adversely affected project
implementation.
3.11     The project was amended to meet the changes brought about by the
political upheaval. Some minor components were deleted, the covenanted
rates of return were lowered, and the savings used to finance an increased
proportion of local costs and interest during construction (Table 3). The
overall project objectives were maintained and the project was successfully
completed. This was due in great measure to the careful way the merger was
carried out, the maintenance of EAM staff and structure, and efforts to
improve the financial situation of INAA and its dependencies. The project
was completed in December 31, 1983, two years later than originally
envisaged. Final allocation of loan funds are presented in Table 3.
3.12     There were delays in carrying out the tariff studies, and these
were continued under the Water Supply Engineering Project, Loan 1983-NI,
with the assistance of PAHO. But at the close of the project in December,
1983, INAA's performance was satisfactory with a 4Z rate of return on fixed
assets; with the Managua Division (ex-Aguadora) showing a rate of return of
16Z. DENACAL, however, only achieved a 0.4Z rate of return on fixed
assets.
3.13     Unaccounted-for water, in spite of efforts, remained a problem in
Managua. Appropriate tariff action i. the Provincial and Rural Divisions
was recommended in the studies, and efforts were started to implement them.
3.14     Procurement.  Due to its pre-ious experience with Bank projects
EAM had no difficulties with procurement and complied with the covenanted
procedures. This continued throughout the project when EAM was integrated
into INAA.
3.15     Costs.  The amended project provided for emergency rehabilitation
work on the distribution system, relocation of one of the wells and a
storage tank, changes from improved design, and the purchase of vehicles,



leak control and replacement of damaged meters and valves. The total
project cost was 9Z below the appraisal estimate (Table 5). In view of the
circumstances this was an excellent performance. A summary comparison of
the cost at appraisal and at completion is as follows:

C. Managua Water Supply Engineering Project
3.16     Project History and Implementation.  The Managua Water Supply
Engineering P!oject, Loan 1983-NI. was identified under previous projects,
and the study to select the first least cost stage prepared under Loan
1496-NI. The loan of US$3.7 million was approved on April 30, 1981 and
s)gned on June 3, 1981. It became effective on September 2, 1981 and was
closed on June 30, 1985. The amount of US$1.4 million was cancelled. The
borrower, INAA, however, continued to finance completion of the detailed
engineering studies and expected to complete them by July 31, 1988, three
and a half years behind schedule.
3.17     Project implementation was slow at first but toward the middle of
1983 it accelerated and good progress was made. An initial delay was due
to the late submission of the completed feasibility studies of the
consultants under Loan 1496-NI. There were additional delays in defining
the terms of reference, the selection of consultants, and the
implementation of the studies themselves. During the preliminary work on
the Tisma scheme, it was found necessary to relocate the proposed well
fields. The government was using groundwater from the Tisma area for
irrigation which would affect the desirel yield in the original proposed
wellfield; but by relocating the well field proposed for Managua this
problem was solved. The longest delays were in the tariff studies and
technical assistance for accounting, billing, and related data processing
activities. These were due in part to the process of converting INAA's
financial systems to a new computer. Although INAA was able to effect
tariff increases in 1981, its operations were still adversely affected by



- 9 -
the new high tariffs for electricity which greatly increased the operating
cost of the company. This required further water tariff increases which
were obtained in the following year.
3.18     Unaccounted-for water was still a problem as of the last
supervision report. IMAA proposed to make an inventory of connections, re-
institute its leak detection and repair prograi., and continue its improved
metering program.
3.19     Costs.  This project showed an overall cost increase of about 9Z
but the prime element, the final designs and studies for the next stage of
the Managua water supply, the Tisma scheme showed a 762 increase. The
table below shows a summary of these costs.

1/ Based on final supervision report and information from Managua
in 1987.
2/ In March 15, 1983 TNAA had negotiated a contract with
consultants for US$3.Z million.  INAA continued studies with
own funds after Bank suspended disbursements and closed the
loan account on 12/31/84.
D. Performance of Consultants
3.20     The performance of the consultants in the Rural Sanitation Project
was satisfactory. During Phase I, until July 1978, a PAHO engineer advised
PLANSAR on design and reviewed procurement and disbursement requests.
During negotiations on the restructured project AHM did not feel the need
for having consultants, but shortly thereafter, agreed to having short-term
consultants.
3.21     The performance of the consulting firms on the Managua Water
Supply III and the Managua Water Supply Engineering Projects was very good.
The hydrogeological studies were carefully carried out and were important
for setting needed limits on groundwater abstraction. The consultants on
the design of the mains and production facilities did a thorough and



- 10 -
competent Job. The management consultants made good recommendations and
their overall performance was satisfactory. The local consultants
continued on the final designs for the Tisma scheme, and INAA reported that
they have completed the work 3atisfactorily.
3.22     Disbursements.  Disbursements on all three projects lagged behind
the appraisal estimates. The final disbursements on the Rural Sanitation
Project and the Managua Water Supply III Project were in 1984, two years
beyond the closing date. Both loans were fully disbursed. The last
disbursement on the Managua Water Supply Engineering Project was in 1985.
A total of US$2.3 million was disbursed (772 of the loan) and US$1.4
million cancelled.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Rural Sanitation Project
4.01     Indicators for performance under thi- -roject are shown in Table
6. Most of the work in t.e Rural Sanitation iroject was accomplished in
Phase II. The changes made ir. the project were beneficial, employed to
advantage 'he capabilities of the participating agencies and the
communities, and provided facilities suited to their needs.
4.02     The basis for the project were the health educators/promoters and
the communities themselves.  The health educators were successful in
organizing the communities and directing their efforts. They gave lectures
on health and sanitation, important for the understanding and proper use
and maintenance of the facilities provided by the community and the
individual families.
4.03     Information has not been provided about the operation and
maintenance of the facilities built under the projects. Agreements were
signed under which the responsibilities of the local organizations and
villagers for participation and subsequent operation and maintenance of the
facilities were defined.
B. The Managua Water Supply III Project and Managua Water Supply
Engineering Project
4.04     The Managua Water System.  The operating performance of the
Managua Water Supply Division was outstanding, except for the lack of
success in reducing unaccounted-for water (Table 7). Strong effortF were
made to reduce the unaccounted-for water through a rehabilitation program
for the distribution network, a meter replacement and repair program, and a
public relations program which did bring down the unaccounted-for water
from 402 in 1980 to about 30? in 1982. Despite these, it rose again to 422
in 1985 (information from INAA). This situation is attributed to
deficiencies in metering and lack of spare parts, undetected damages in the
distribution network and house connections, and clandestine connections.
The number of employees was controlled and a ratio of about 8 employees to
1000 water connections achieved. INAA is aware of the importance of
bringing the unaccounted-for water and controllirg deficiencies in the
system and we understand that it has been continuing its efforts to improve
the situation with limited resources.



- 11 -
4.05     By 1985, the Managua system was producing 62.5 million cubic
meters, the limit of the available sources. Of this, 36.2 million cubic
meters was accounted for and serving 87,803 urban connections and 581
public standpipes. The Managua Division was also responsible for the sewer
system, which in 1985 had 67,829 connections. The city of Managua
represented the largest operation in the water and sewer sector in the
country - being responsible for 44.5Z of the water consumed and 72.6Z of
the sewer connections.
4.06     The Provincial Division water systems lagged behind Managua in
performance. Some training of personnel was done by INAA but on a modest
scale. Tariffs in several of the regions and special zones did not cover
the overall cost of production (see Table 9) in 1985. A study to improve
the tariffs and establish a sound base for financial planning was prepared
by consultants and completed in February 1984. In the short run the study
recommended general tariff increases, with the same general structure. In
the long term it recommended a restructuring of the tariff based on
economic, social, and financial considerations. It would appear, based on
the 1985 information, that the application of a new tariff structure had
not yet taken place.
4.07     The development of INAA and its performance under the
circumstances has been outstanding. It carried out the institutional
improvements needed to make the merger of EAM and DENACAL a smoothly
operating entity and it unified the administration, accounting, commercial
and the tariff policies. It was serving 1.3 million people with water
supply and had billings of C$ 044 million.
4.08     INAM management realizes that it needs to continue its leak
control and conservation program, control operating costs, improve its
collection of receivables, and improve its tariffs and financial condition.
It has made efforts to improve staff efficiency through training,
decentralization, and the improvement of administrative practices. It has
followed the recommendations of consultants with good results.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     The financial performance of AHM gradually improved, after
overcoming the problems caused by the sector reorganization and the
division of institutional responsibilities with INAA. During 1980 the
government experienced a severe financial crisis and was only able to pay
salaries and provide limited counterpart funds. During the unsettled
period project records had been lost and destroyed and the accounts had to
be reconstructed. This contributed to delays in the audit reports. The
modified project with a new schedule for execution by AHM helped ease the
required flow of counterpart funds, and the situation began improving
thereafter.
6%602    INAA's consolidated financial performance for 1983 was
satisfactory (Table 8) (rate of return of 42) but was expected to
deteriorate in 1984 (rate of return of 1Z) with tariff increases needed in



- 12 -
1985. The Managua Division helped achieve these results, offsetting the
poor performance of the Provincial Division and the rural water systems.
The financial performance of the Managua Division was satisfactory. It had
a 162 rate of return in 1983, and was expected to reach in 1984 the 62
covenanted without tariff increases (table 10). The Division had obtained
a series of tariff increases and taken other measures to improve its
financial position. It implemented an aggressive program of collections
and shut-off of connections for the non-payment of bills. It obtained
contracts with central government agencies to ensure payment for its
services. DENACAL and the Provincial Division barely covered operating
costs and showed a negative rate of return of 0.42 in 1983 with expected
operating losses in 1984. This was due to the number, type and size of
systems, the decentralized nature of its operations, the tariff structure,
the less efficient billing and collecting practices, and the over-staffing.
By the close of the project, however, INAA with the assistance of
consultants was introducing improved operation and management practices,
reducing the number of employees, applying better tariffs, improving the
accounting, billing and collecting for all the systems under its control.
At the end of 1983, the average tariff for the Managua Division was
equivalent to US$1.8 per 1000 gallons and that for the Provincial Division,
US$1.5 per 1000 gallons3 high by Latin American standards). INAA had
problems with the collection of accounts receivable, and the unaccounted
water in the Managua system which remains high (about 312) despite efforts
to reduce it.
5.03     INAA made progress in reducing its accounts receivable through its
aggressive program of collection. Improved collection from private clients
was achieved in Managua but this was offset by an increase of 622 in
receivables in the Provincial Division mainly due to delays in billing.
Collection from government agencies was improved by the contracts signed
for the payment of services. However, as of 1984, additional measures to
reduce accounts receivable were still needed, such as clearer rules for
write-offs of bad debts, legal authority to enforce payment of overdue
bills, and a public relations program.
5.04     INAA's 1982 audit report was submitted three months late because
of computer problems; the 1980 and 1981 reports were late because of the
merger of EAM and DENACAL and the integration of the accounting systems.
The audit reports of AHM for 1979, 1980 and 1981 were received by the Bank
on April 18, 1983; and foi 1982 on July 1983.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01     The reorganization of the sector was successful.  It met the
objectives of seeking the most efficient arrangements for the sector, and
of providing improved water and sanitation services to Managua and the
rural areas.
6.02     In  1979, EAM and DENACAL were merged to create INAA.  The general
structure of both organizations was maintained and disruption was minimal.
3/   Based on the official exchange rate.



- 13 -
Later the rural water system responsibilities of ARM were transferred to
INMA. Difficulties were encountered in unifying administrative,
accounting, commercial, and procurement practices, but steps were taken to
solve them and by 1983 considerable progress had been made. Effective
technical assistance of consultants in all these areas was provided.
6.03     At the village level, the community organizations were given
assistance and support by the staff of AHM to provide and maintain water
and sanitation facilities. These community organizations are responsible
for the maintenance of their facilities which they helped construct and can
be expected to develop other community facilities.
6.04     The consultants' recommendations to improve the design and
operation of the rural water systems and to reorganize the rural water
supply division of INAM with adequate rural water staffing were carried
out. With experience, work output and efficiency improved. AHM also
allocated more staff to more regional and local offices, decentralizing its
operations with successful results. The combined efforts of the health
educators, promoters, and field staff resulted in the successful
development of community participation and a good latrine program.
6.05     With the assistance of the consultants and the efforts of IKAA's
own staff, the following improvements were achieved: the financial,
commercial, administrative, design and planning functions were unified; the
Managua water and sewer systems' operations combine,'; the Provincial and
Rural Water Supply Divisions' operations improved; an asset base for the
Provincial and Rural Divisions and a financial planning group established;
and INAA's financial requirements analyzed. Tariff recommendations for the
future were proposed and accepted. At the close of the project INAA was
continuing its efforts to control unaccounted-for water in Managua and the
other cities, establish a better tariff policy for the Provincial and Rural
Divisions, and reduce accounts receivable.
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Rural Sanitation Project
7.01     The Rural Sanitation Project had a positive impact on the health
and sanitation conditions of the inhabitants in 170 villages in the roor
rural areas of Nicaragua. Although the project was amended and
restructured, the major objectives were intact and achieved. An integrated
sanitation and related health services program was developed. It helped
the poor rural populations in small communities with an average population
of about 124 inhabitants. The rural population was given health education
in the use of safe water, excreta disposal, basic sanitation, and
immunization and malaria control programs. With safe water and proper
excreta disposal, supported by health education, immunization and malaria
control, there is reduced infant and child mortality, lower morbidity and
longer life expectancy, and increased work productivity.
7.02     The communities were organized and trained to be responsible for
their contribution to the project and for operating and maintaining the
project works.



- 14 -
7.03     The project helped strengthen the managerial, technical, and
operational capabilities of the executing agency and the interagency
cooperation.
7.04     The beneficiaries' desire for project benefits and their
willingness to pay is demonstrated by their contribution of 202 of the
project costs exceeding the 152 covenanted and payment of the operating and
maintenance costs.
7.05     An economic rate of return for the project was not calculated at
appraisal. It is considered that the economic benefits are not
quantifiable, but they are expected to be large.
B. Managua Water Supply III Project
7.06     The Managua Water Supply III Project provided an increased supply
of water needed to meet the demands of Managua's growing population to the
year 1985. This project was the least-cost solution, it utilized the
remaining capacity of the aquifer in the Managua area.
7.07     The project had a positive impact on the delivery of water to a
large number of the urban poor and the improvement of service to the users
in general. Through the financial assistance program of the project an
additional population of about 215,000 (mainly urban poor) was connected to
the water system. At the same time, the service was improved and made more
efficient through the expansion and improvement of transmission and
distribution facilities.
7.08     The project improved the efficiency of EAM.  The managerial and
operational capabilities of EAM were strengthened and the technical
assistance provided was important. Operating costs were controlled, the
desired ratio of the number of employees to the number of water connection
was achieved, assets were revalued, tariff adjustments were obtained, and
billing and collecting made more efficient. Elements were not available to
calculate the economic rate of return of the project.
7.09     The future water supply sources for Managua were identified and a
staged plan for their development specified. A feasibility study for the
next stage was prepared and formed the basis for the follow-up Managua
Water Supply Engineering Project to prepare final plans and specifications.
7.10     The project played an important role in the reorganization of the
sector and helped make it a success. It helped determine the most suitable
institutional arrangements and provided technical assistance for the
reorganization. The merger of EAM and DENACAL went smoothly and the staff
and basic structure of EAM was kept fairly intact. As a result, sector
disruption was minimal, EAM efficiency was not impaired, and better
administrative, financial, commercial and operating practices for the
sector were extended throughout the country.
C. Managua Water SuDly Engineering Project
7.11     This project will help prevent water deficits for the city of
Managua. Under it a study was completed for the next water project to



- 15 -
provide water to Nicaragua. This study is a prerequisite for the
construction of the facilities to provide additional supplies of water to
the city. The proposed first stage would satisfy the demand to the year
2000. The population has grown rapidly, the present sources are stretched
to their limit and there are water shortages. Although the completion of
the studies was delayed and follow-up project did not take place, the plans
are ready and construction could take place as soon as financing is
available.
7.12     The project also continued the program to make the operation of
the Managua water system more efficient with good results. Instrumentation
and control equipment was repaired and replaced. With better control,
pumping and other costs were reduced.
7.13     The project had a significant impact on improving the organization
and management of INAA and the integration of EAM and DENACAL into a aingle
efficient entity. The administrative, accounting and commercial procedures
were unified with good results and a tariff study made. The tariff study
was completed at the close of the project February 1984. INAA accepted the
recommendations and began to apply them.
7.14     A rate of return for this project was not considered applicable
and not presented in the President's report. An Appraisal Report was not
prepared for this project.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     The Bank helped promote the reorganization of the sector and
introduce better administrative, financial, and commercial practices in the
sector through INAM. This included the systems formerly the responsibility
of DENACAL. The complete application of these practices was not fully
achieved at the close of the projects.
8.02     The Bank was overly optimistic in the Rural Sanitation Project
with respect to the implementation capacity of PLANSAR and AHM, and the
ability to construct the project's works at the low estimated costs. The
result was that the project had to be reduced in scope, extenied in time,
changed and restructured. During preparation and preappraisal not enough
time was spent in the field to visit the local offices and ongoing works to
verify the capacity of the organizations and the completed costs of the
facilities. The project reached 170 villages and 21,000 people with water
supply instead of approximately 500 villages and 111,600 people; and
providing 9,500 new latrines instead of ;7,000 improved and new latrines.
Per capita costs for the water component also increased several times, from
a per capita cost of about $9 to about $55 in 1983. By Latin American
standards, the $55 per capita cost is reasonable and at the lower range of
costs.
8.03     The Bank did not take timely effective action in promoting the
implementation of the technical assistance.  As a result, the technical
assistance was delayed. Stronger measures should have been taken to have
had it implemented sooner.



- 16 -
8.04     Supervision missions were of limited duration and approximately
one per year. This was not sufficient, given the nature of the Rural
Sanitation Project. More intense supervision would have permitted the
identification of problems at earlier stages and early agreement on
solutions.
IX. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
9.01     Rural Sanitation Projects are not simple to carry out, and should
be planned in the context of a long range program. This provides time for
the development of the institution responsible for the program, the
establishment of the facilities desired, and the education and
participation of the communities on a scale to have an impact on the health
and sanitation problems of the country. One project is not enough for
this. In addition, the initial project should be modest and not include
too many components.
9.02     The Rural Sanitation Project should only have contained those
components over which the executing agency (PLANSAR then AHM) had direct
control and funding or for which it had specific agreements with other
institutions for their participation. The housing improvement component
was to be done with local financing under another Ministry and was dropped
from the project. It was an excellent component and would have contributed
greatly to the project objective of improving the basic sanitation if
specific arrangements to fund it and carry it out had been provided for.
9.03     The Bank was overly optimistic in the design of the Rural
Sanitation Project, considering that this was the first such operation in
Nicaragua. More time should have been spent during project preparation,
including field trips, to design a project more within the capacity of the
executing agency. Also, more frequent supervision missions of a longer
duration to permit evaluation of field work and field staff should have
been done by the Bank, to assist and guide the Borrower in improving
project execution. In this aspect, however, it should be remembered that
during the period of civil strife, there were valid safety reasons for
restricting staff travel.
9.04     The completion of the Managua III project demonstrates that when
an institution is strong, enjoys autonomy, and has a motivated experienced
staff, a project can be successful in spite of great political changes that
may occur in the country.
9.05     The INAA experience shows that sector reorganization and
institutional development takes time and continued efforts to be achieved
successfully. Even with the full support of the authorities it is a long
term task. Both Loans 1496-NI and 1983-NI provided technical assistance to
that end. In general the following elements were important for the success
of the reorganizations
a)   the reorganization made the sector operation and management more
efficient and delivered improved services;



- 17 -
b)   it had the support of the government;
c)   the staff and structure of the sector institutions were not unduly
disrupted as they merged into the new sector organizations;
d)   the improvements in administration and operation were done
carefully and gradually throughout the sector; and
e)   adequate technical assistance was provided.
9.06     From the execution of Loan 1983-NI, we have learned that when a
project is a self-felt need by the borrower, means will be found to
complete the project even when because of external circumstances suspension
of disbursements occurs.

a/  Appraisal projections for 1982 were established under Loan 1983-NI,
President's Report April 14, 1981. No estimates for 1983 were
prepared. Higher than expected water tariffs were the primary reason
that 1982 estimates exceeded 1982 appraisal projections.
bl   Depreciation expense was not revalued.
cl  Estimated mission figures were prepared during the last supervision
visit January 1984.

since INMA had not closed its books. Revenues for 1983 were
estimated at C$221.4 million, or 30Z higher than in 1982 mainly due
to the increase in sales. Operating expenses increased by 161 in
1982.
