SUPPLEMENTARY ANNEXES TO
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Preface
This report contains annexes which are common to two agricultural
development projects in Central Nigeria. These are:
- Ayangba Agricultural Development Project in Benue State, and
- Lafia Agricultural Development Project in Plateau State. 1/
Since these two projects are very similar, material common to
the two projects has been collected in this separate volume in order to
avoid duplication, and only brief summaries are presented in the respective
appraisal reports.  Coverage in this report is extensive as this allows
detailed back-up of the analysis in the two appraisal reports. This should
be especially useful for project management and supervision. The report,
therefore, is a collection of various important working documents and has been
edited as such; it has not been distributed as an appraisal report, but is
available upon request.
Supplementary annexes were prepared by the appraisal mission com-
posed of Messrs. van der Lugt, Pease, Draper (Bank), Reader, Hallgrimson
(Consultants), Tagoe (WARDA), Deprez (Trainee CPDCET) and Dalton (FDL expert),
which visited Nigeria in May/June 1976 to appraise the above two projects.
1/   See Report 1369a-UNI, dated May 20, 1977, Appraisal of Ayangba Agri-
cultural Development Project and Report 1368a-UNI, dated May 20, 1977,
Appraisal of Lafia Agricultural Development Project.






SUPPLEMENT 1
NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
AGRICULTURE IN NIGERIA
Background
1.        There are a number of Bank reports on Nigeria, although updating
is required in some cases. For example, in the general economic field the
following have been published:
(i)  Report No. AW-35a, dated June 9, 1972, The Current Economic
Position and Long Term Prospects of Nigeria (four volumes). 1/
(ii)  Report No. 416a-UNI, dated August 5, 1974, Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Nigeria (three volumes).
(iii)  Report No. 1235-UNI, dated June 30, 1976, Nigeria Economic
Memorandum.
2.        The first economic report assessed the postwar reconstruction work
needed and formed the basis for increased Bank assistance.  In contrast,
the latest economic memorandum briefly assesses the latest five-year develop-
ment plan (1975-1980) from the macroeconomic point of view. Initially the
"oil boom" had a major impact on the Nigerian economy, but, with a more
realistic assessment of future oil wealth, financial projections are becoming
increasingly pessimistic.
3.        In agriculture .the main Bank report is:
- Report No. PA-115(A), dated January 26, 1973, Agricultural
Sector Survey Nigeria (in three volumes).
In addition food production was extensively treated in the 1974 economic report:
- Report No. 416a-UNI, Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Nigeria, Volume III, Problems and Prospects of Food Production.
4.        Another report 2/ which recently became available in Nigeria is:
1/   This report was published by Johns Hopkins University Press as "Nigeria,
Options for Long-Term Development", 1974.
2/   This supplement uses this report to a large extent as its base.



SUPPLEMENT I
Page 2
- Agricultural Development in Nigeria 1973-1975, published by the
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources 1/, Govern-
ment-Planning Committee, Lagos 1974.
This report arose from a National Agricultural Development Seminar held at the
University of Ibadan in 1971 whose findings were published by the joint plan-
ning committee of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Some of the projections in this report have already been challenged (see also
Supplement 11 on demand and supply projections) and further updating is
inevitable. For these reasons this supplement can, at this stage, only pro-
vide a background to the Nigerian agricultural sector.
The Economy
5.        Following the recent creation of seven new states, the Federal
Republic of Nigeria now has 19 States. It covers an area of 924,000 km2.
Reliable population figures are absent as the 1973 census was never completed.
However, it is believed that Nigeria's population is now 75 million (1975
estimate). GNP per capita (around US$327 in 1975) remains low and most of the
Nigerian people earn less than this. For example, in rural areas, economic
activities are based primarily on smallholder farming with low-level tech-
nology for which average household incomes would not exceed US$320 per annum.
In urban centers average household incomes are much higher but unequally
distributed.
6.        Economic growth in Nigeria over the last six years was in two phases:
from January 1970 (the end of the war) until December 1972 was a period of
rehabilitation and recovery as the economy responded quickly to pent-up demand
and realization of postponed investment and production; following a year of
consolidation and slower growth in 1972, the second phase was characterized by
a resumption of growth, generated by increased public sector activities,
accompanied by increased inflation, supply shortages and infrastructural
congestions as excess capacity was eliminated. Although the performance of
directly productive sectors has been disappointing, the rapid economic growth
continued due to phenomenal expansion of the service sectors, and average GDP
increase was 6.5% per annum from 1972-1975. Nigeria's economic development
has been increasingly dominated by the oil sector which by 1974 accounted for
41% of GDP, 93% of export earnings and 82% of total Government revenues,
surpassing the agricultural sector in all areas except employment.
7.        The Third National Development Plan covers the five-year period
April 1975 - March 1980. Plan allocations are US$53 billion, but due to
slippage the effective program is projected at US$32 billion. The plan has
been reviewed by the current Government and more emphasis has been given to
health, housing and agriculture. Additionally, Government recently launched an
"Operation Feed the Nation" program to encourage food production in the
country.
1/   Since early 1976 renamed Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (FMARD).



SUPPLEMENT I
Page 3
The Agricultural Sector in the Economy
8.        Although economic growth has been high, performance in the agricul-
tural sector has been disappointing. The average growth rate in the agricul-
tural sector over the period 1970-1975 was 1.3% 1/ compared with 7.0% for GDP
and 6.2% for nonoil GDP. Serious drought conditions in the northern part of
the country led to a sharp decrease in output in 1972 and 1973, and output of
millet and sorghum, major food crops in the north, was an estimated 30% lower
in 1973 than in 1970; for groundnuts the output was almost 50% lower. Due to
favorable weather conditions in 1974 and 1975, millet and sorghum output
recovered significantly, but groundnuts continued to suffer from disease and
other problems. Production in the south was less affected. However, agricul-
tural sector growth continues to be impeded by the low level of technology,
declining productivity on existing farms and substantial migration of the
rural labor force to urban centers. Despite this some 75% of employment is
in the agricultural sector. Agriculture's share in GDP has declined from 48%
in 1970 to 37% in 1975 (in constant 1973 prices) and from 49% in 1970 to 28%
in 1975 in current terms. Details are in Table 1.
9.        Foodcrop production over the last decade has not kept pace with
population growth. Output in recent years is estimated to be 25-30% higher
than the average 1961-1965 level compared with a population increase of
some 35-40% in the same period. Per capita income also increased during this
period by about 50%; assuming an income elasticity of demand of about 0.5 and
the above-mentioned population increase, the increase in demand must have been
twice the estimated increase in output. Even allowing for a wide margin of
error in the assumptions, they point to a substantial gap between output and
demand growth. This is confirmed by sharp increases in both food prices and
food imports; the latter rose from about N 50 million in 1970 to around N 300
million in 1975. 2/  For details see Table 2.
10.       The long-term trend in export crop production is equally unsatis-
factory. Recently, Marketing Board policies were changed to provide incen-
tives for investment in export crops, especially tree crops, but the impact of
these policies (if any) will not be felt for many years. Cocoa output is at
the same level as in the early sixties; oil palm production is some 10-15%
lower and groundnut production has decreased by some 70-80%. Due to decreased
output and increased domestic demand, palm oil and groundnuts are no longer
exported and only cocoa remains as a significant export crop. Details are in
Table 3. Agricultural commodities have become insignificant in terms of total
exports from Nigeria, decreasing from 37% of total exports in 1970 to 5% in
1975. However, they are still important when oil exports are excluded,
accounting for 89% in 1970 and 73% in 1975.
1/   The annual growth rates for various years were 1971 5.2%; 1972 -7.3%;
1973 -1.9%; 1974 6.7%; 1975 4.5%
2/   As a percentage of total imports, food imports remained fairly constant
at 8-10% during the 1970-1975 period, but this is due to the massive
overall increase in imports during the period.



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 4
The Setting
11.       With an area of 924,000 km2, Nigeria has its greatest east-west
length over 1,127 km and greatest north-south length over some 1,046 km.
The coastline is 960 km. Nigerian Atlantic territorial waters extend to
48 km offshore. 1/ The continental shelf is narrow (12-28 km), but fairly
wide in the area of the Niger Delta (80 km).
12.       The Nigerian coastline consists of a series of surf-swept sandy
beaches (0.3-16 km wide). In the west, this is very regular; towards the
east it becomes an intricate network of creeks which form the Niger Delta.
The coastline is backed by a belt of mangrove swamps that extend up to 96 km.
Beyond the marshlands is an expanse of undulating country with scattered hills
progressively going to hilly ranges. Further inland, the topography develops
into an undulating plateau with hills of granite rock and sandstone at an
elevation of about 600 m. This rises to the central plateau (over 1,830
meter). The northern extremities stretch in rolling but sandy topography.
13.       There are three major drainage systems. The first and major drainage
system consists of the Niger and its main tributary the Benue. Together with
all their tributaries they form the Niger-Benue drainage system (see map
12135(3R) attached to this supplement). The second drainage system comprises
the Komadugu Yobe river and its tributaries which empty their water into Lake
Chad. The third system consists of the many rivers flowing southwards into
the Atlantic.
14.       Nigeria's climate is tropical with year-round high temperatures.
Climate and vegetational zoning are given in a map attached to this supple-
ment. The rainy season is as short as three months in the far north and
as long as 11 months in the far south. Rainfall varies between 50 cm (far
north) and 400 cm (far south). In the south temperatures and humidity are
high with little variation; the range increases further north and the dry
season there is accentuated by the "harmattan" winds bringing cold air
from the Sahara.
15.       The vegetational zoning largely reflects the climatic zoning.
There are three zones: the tropical rain forest zone of the south with
luxuriant tree growth; the northern Sudan Savanna zone with tall grasses
and acacia trees; and the Guinea Savanna zone which is the "middle" belt in
between the two first distinct zones. Cropping patterns follow the same
zoning: perennial treecrops and multiple cropping in the south to single
annual cropping in the north. See also a map attached to this supplement.
Crop possibilities in various ecological zones are in Table 4.
1/   This might be changed following changes in territorial waters in other
countries.



SUPPLEMENT 1

History
16.       Agriculture.  During colonial times (1861-1950) emphasis was on
extension and research.  Moor Plantation was, for example, established in
1899. During the Second World War more attention was given to food production
and export crops, such as rubber, to satisfy war demand. During the period
of internal self-government (1950-1960), agricultural functions were divided,
with the Federal Department of Agriculture responsible for research and the
regional departments for extension. After independence there was increased
regional competition and heavy concentration on export commodities. The
marketing boards were used as taxing mechanisms for development finance and
there was a general feeling that food production activities could take care of
themselves without Government intervention.
17.       Livestock.  Livestock production in Nigeria was characterized by
nomadic and seasonal pastoralism long before the advent of the colonial admin-
istration. The immediate interest of the colonial administration was the
health and hygiene of domestic cattle, and the Veterinary Department was
established in Zaria in 1974. 1/ The research center at Vom was established
in 1924. The department was reorganized by the end of the Second World War
and livestock activities have been well organized. Initial breeding policy
was concentrated on local available breeds, but in the fifties there was
increased attention on international breeds. In the sixties many dispersed
activities were undertaken throughout the sector.
18.       Fisheries.  The history of fisheries is fairly recent.  Definite
efforts to develop the country's fish resources date back to the Second
World War when because of the blockade of the high seas it was decided to
develop local resources including fisheries. A fishery office was established
in 1941. Initially, attention was given to brackish-water fish culture, canoe
fishing and small-motor fishing craft for lagoon and creek fishing. Fish
farming was also promoted and the Panyam fish farm was established in 1951.
From the mid-1950s to mid-1960s the coastal trawler fleet was expanded (one
in 1956, and 13 in 1960) and the catch increased, but declined following heavy
exploitation. However, commercial quantities of prawns were discovered
in eastern areas and many vessels were converted for prawn fishing. By 1970
the fishing industry had recovered and expansion is so rapid that plans are
being made to regulate fishery.
19.       Forestry.  Involvement in forestry dates back to the beginning of
the century when officials became worried about uncontrolled forest des-
truction. A forest law was passed in 1908 under which forest reserves could
be established. The aim of the lawmakers was to acquire 25% of the country,
but actually declared reserves at present do not amount to more than 10%
of total area. Details are in Supplement 5. Forestry passed through several
stages: exploitation without replacement; plantations of exotic species;
natural generation; and finally plantation forestry.

Resources
20.       The resources for further agricultural development are available,
but changes will be required. For example, labor is available and it is
estimated that up to 90% of all farm operations are manual. However, labor
availability might be critical at certain periods of the year and intermediate
mechanization and technology could almost certainly be applied to relieve
labor shortages at peak periods. With rapidly increasing wage rates throughout
Nigeria, it is also important that returns to labor in agriculture increase to
avoid wide disparity between the agricultural and other sectors. Land is also
an abundant resource and it is estimated that about 75% of the total land area
could be cultivated. On that basis, the land-population ratio is 1 ha per
person; however, there are large regional variations, the ratio being 0.2 ha
per person in the southeast and about 2.5 ha in the northeast. However, if the
present system of bush/fallow continues, land will be insufficient. River
systems and groundwater provide the water resource base, but these have not
been fully investigated or exploited. Capital is an abundant resource at
present, but it is important that savings be created-in the agricultural
sector itself to provide a source of continued investment. As in other
developing countries, management and entrepreneurship are scarce resources.
Development Potential
21.       There is little controversy about Nigeria's development strategy:
the importance of agriculture and rural development to the future growth
prospects of the country is now generally recognized. Equally noncontro-
versial is the potential of the agricultural sector in terms of available
land for future development, room for improved productivity and yields through
new technology improvements, and the size of the market for both food and cash
crops. However, institutions and available manpower are inadequate compared
with the needs and potential of the sector. There is therefore a role for
external institutions to assist governments in preparing and implementing
rural development projects and in agricultural research and manpower training.
The Bank has increased its assistance in this area.
22.       The Third Five-Year Development Plan covers the period 1975-1980.
Total plan allocation amounted to N 32 million but the effective program is
set at N 20 million due to expected substantial slippage. Public sector
investment in agriculture is aimed primarily at providing the infrastructure
and incentives necessary, particularly for smallholder development. Growth
in agriculture is set at 5%, about the same rate of growth as achieved
in the 1950s and early 1960s but considerably higher than recent growth rates.
Planned direct public investment for agriculture is about US$4 billion and
includes the development of several major river basins for large-scale as
well as smallholder farming; an accelerated foodcrop development program
aimed at adopting and disseminating modern farming techniques to smallholder
farmers; programs to improve input distribution and marketing of food and
export crops; and the several agricultural development projects with which
the Bank is associated. While the allocation is smaller than for other



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 7
sectors (6-7% of total) it represents a sevenfold increase over the previous
plan allocation and might be rather ambitious in view of the low technology
and smallholder nature of Nigerian agriculture and the institutional and man-
power constraints. In addition there is a program to promote rural develop-
ment mainly based on complementary investments in infrastructure and social
services. It includes rural electrification of 500 towns and villages, and
construction of 20,000 km of secondary and feeder roads, including 6,000 km to
open up inaccessible areas; a large portion of health and other social services
is also planned for the rural sector.
23.       Government is acutely aware of the need tQ improve performance in
the agricultural sector. This is demonstrated by numerous measures which
are continuously announced. Although the effectiveness and scope of some
measures are open to dispute, they do reveal Government's concern. Recently,
Government initiated "Operation Feed the Nation" to increase food production.
The program has no specific planning and organization base, and it is no more
than an ad hoc collection of measures. The most important is an increase in
fertilizer subsidy. New prices for a 50 kg bag of fertilizer throughout
Nigeria have been set at between N 1.00 to N 2.00, which amounts to an 80%
subsidy. The subsidy is unnecessarily high and is bound to create misalloca-
tion of fertilizer. However, fertilizer subsidies will not create a fiscal
burden on Nigeria in the foreseable future, and can generally be supported by
the need to transfer oil revenues to the rural sector. The marketing board
system has also been completely overhauled (see Supplement 11) and floor
prices for most crops have been announced recently. What is missing, however,
is a consistent framework for agricultural incentives, and the Federal Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) has appointed consultants to
study agricultural incentives and make recommendations.
Bank Operations
24.       Since 1971 a total of ten projects in the agricultural sector have
been approved; they are listed in Table 5. Following the end of the Civil
War, a sector survey was undertaken and a first cocoa project was approved
in 1971. This was followed by a second cocoa project. in 1974. The cocoa
projects are working well and are completely under Nigerian management. The
first cocoa project is completely disbursed. Some reorganization of the
second cocoa project is required, since new States have been created and
the Cocoa Development Unit of the former Western State is now divided among
three States. Substantial project preparation work was undertaken by the Bank
in the early seventies. In 1974 a livestock project, a rice project and three
agricultural development projects were approved. The latter three Northern
Agricultural Development Projects are now being implemented successfully and
are models for similar projects in and outside Nigeria. The rice and livestock
projects were slow to start, but are now operational.

25.       Three oil palm projects were approved in 1975.  There were long
delays in getting the loans signed; however, operations have already started,
and two of the three projects are under satisfactory management.
26.       An irrigation project and rubber project have been appraised and
negotiated. However Bank involvement in those projects is no longer con-
templated, since FMG has withdrawn the irrigation scheme and since increased
costs made the rubber project no longer viable in the form as appraised.
27.       Monitoring and evaluation is an important component of all projects.
A unit has been established in Kaduna for the agricultural projects; this is
working well and is being expanded under the proposed project. A unit has
also been established in Benin for the tree crop projects but is not completely
staffed. The rice project has a small evaluation and second phase study
component, but is not yet formally part of the evaluation unit "network." In
addition, as part of project supervision, the Bank is engaged in a continuous
dialogue with the Nigerian Government regarding agricultural policy.

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
CROP DEVELOPMENT
A. General
1.        The project areas lie in the transitional zone between the south-
ern root and tree crop and the northern cereal and livestock farming systems.
The relatively long rainy season, 1/ April to October, followed by a pro-
longed dry period from November through March (hardly any precipitation is
received between mid-November and mid-March), allows a diversity of food
crops to be grown along with some tree crops such as citrus and mangoes.
2.        Crop production exploits these ecological conditions by growing
such long-duration and semiperennial crops as yams, cassava, cocoyams and
pigeon peas; medium-duration crops such as local rice and sorghums; and
short-duration crops such as maize, millet, cowpeas, groundnuts, benniseed
and melons.
3.        While yams usually take first place in the cropping system after
clearing from a long fallow period, cassava is usually planted as a last crop
after 3-4 years of cropping and before land is reverted to bush/fallow for
regeneration.
4.        In between the yam and cassava crops, a system of undersowing,
relay cropping and intercropping is practiced, depending primarily on the
farmer's priority and to some extent on the fertility of the soil. The
"compound" farm which receives all the household wastes and is of adequate
fertility at all times is usually planted to maize (and sometimes early millet
in the Lafia area) followed by tall sorghum. Also within the compound farms
can be found such crops as cocoyams, watermelons, groundnuts and cowpeas
(the leaves of which are used as vegetable). Compound farms are rarely
fallowed.
5.        "Bush" farms or farms away from compounds where nutrient status
declines with each year of cropping tend to follow a loose pattern such
as yams followed by early maize undersown with tall sorghum and/or pigeon
peas. This is then followed by early millet or cowpeas, followed by tall
sorghum or late maize. Sometimes when the fertility of the soil is con-
sidered adequate another yam crop is sandwiched into the second and third
1/   Rainfall data are summarized in the appraisal reports, but
rainfall charts for various towns are presented in the charts
attached to this supplement under Appendix 6.



SUPPLEMENT 2

crops; in such a case the yam mounds are made in the standing sorghum plants
which are panicle harvested, leaving the sorghum stalks to act as stakes for
the yam. Cassava is then planted and before the field is allowed to fallow a
second crop of cassava may be taken if the tubers from the first crop indicate
that another crop is possible. Within this broad pattern are a number of
combinations involving other crops such as melons, groundnuts, bambara nuts
and benniseed.
6.        The system shows such flexibility that with ample supply of ferti-
lizer the pattern is likely to be modified significantly, since fertility
limitations might be substantially reduced. This may be particularly true
in the case of yams which dominate the agricultural economy of both areas and
serve both as a cash crop and as staple food.
7.        Rice is important in the alluvial flood plain soils of the main
streams and in the heavier soils of flat lands bordering the main rivers.
Since rice soils are generally not suitable for other crops it is grown as
a sole crop in these areas.
8.        Few farm surveys have been undertaken in recent years in the pro-
ject areas, and this makes estimating crop acreages in such a complex system
rather difficult; the figures should be interpreted as such.
9.        Plant population densities are generally low, probably the result
of a combination of factors such as low soil fertility, high soil permea-
bility, the practice of intercropping and the tools and implements used in
farming. However, with an abundance of land and a limitation in labor, the
farm tools have been designed to allow for a rapid coverage of a relatively
wide area per man unit of time.
10.       Production is primarily oriented towards subsistence security;
poor soil conditions, seasonal vagaries and low average incomes combine to
create an environment in which technological adventure is undertaken only
when proved to yield significant economic returns.
B. Agronomic Aspects
11.       The importance and ecological requirements of the crops selected
for special emphasis in the projects are briefly described here and an
assessment made of the development potential for each of the crops. While
certain agronomic practices are advocated here, it must be realized that
because the project areas lie between the two main ecological zones of the
country where most research is carried out, these recommendations, extra-
polated from research results at the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR)
Samaru, and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Ibadan,
will have to be modified in light of future findings under the projects' ap-
plied applied research program.



SUPPLEMENT 2

WHITE YAM (Diosconea rotundata oPoir")
12.       The white yam is grown in all zones and is the most important cash
crop in the area, although low soil fertility limits its proportionate area in
the rotation.
13.       Ecology.  Yam prefers fairly hot (30 C) temperatures with a long
(7-8 month) rainy season giving 1,100-2,000 mm of rain. Soils should be per-
meable, sandy loams with reasonable fertility and for this reason the yam
is usually grown as a first crop in the rotation.
14.       Current Practices.  The crop is grown on mounds usually constructed
from September to November which, however, could be extended to January either
on newly opened land or under a growing sorghum or pigeon pea crop. Planting
is by setts sectioned from harvested tubers, or from seed tubers that have
developed following careful harvesting of an earlier crop. Planting extends
from December to January, and the mounds are normally protected by capping
with vegetative mulch.
15.       The vine sprouts and develops with the onset of the rains but
the plant relies on food stored in the sett for the first month or two after
sprouting. Although the vine is often allowed to trail on the ground, higher
yields are obtained if trained to climb on stakes. Since staking for a
large number of vines is not an easy task, farmers often use standing crops
such as maize interplanted in the yam field, or sorghum stalks which have
been panicle harvested the previous year, or pruned pigeon pea stands of
the previous year. Weeding is important and is often combined with reshaping
of mounds washed down by rain.
16.       Some harvesting is carried out in August and continues until Octo-
ber. During this early harvesting, tubers are carefully cut and removed,
leaving the crown and vine undisturbed, from which will grow a second, smal-
ler tuber. The main harvest period, however, is during November and Decem-
ber following the drying and dying back of the vines. The tubers are stored,
either lying or standing on end, in airy thatched shelters. They are suscep-
tible to high storage losses-due to drying out, sprouting and decay, which
may amount to an overall weight loss exceeding 30% over a long storage per-
iod. Average losses for the project have been estimated at 20%.
17.       Pests and Diseases.  The major pest is the yam beetle (Heteroligus
meles) which bores into the tuber, damaging the growing point and reducing
tuber size.  Nematodes (mainly Scutellonema bradys) are serious pests which
reduce yields and allow entry of fungi which reduce the value and keeping
quality of tubers. The nematode problem is aggravated by using already in-
fested tubers as planting material. Dieback, a disease causing premature
drying of tubers and loss of yield of up to 60%, is associated with the in-
cidence of nematodes. "Shoestring" can also reduce yield by up to 50%; the
causal agent is unidentified at present but the disease is less common than
dieback.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 4
18.       Development Potential.  Existing yam yields can be more than doubled
by the simple application of nitrogenous fertilizer to the'tune of about
50 kg of elemental nitrogen per hectare, staking the vines, and introducing a
number of improved husbandry practices.  In the first place, one of the main
drawbacks to increased production is the low plant population; field observa-
tion shows a total of 5,000-7,000 mounds per hectare, and this can be increased
to 10,000 mounds per hectare without adversely affecting yields. Competition
among yam plants is more for light than for soil nutrients since the crop
usually occupies the more fertile fields in the rotation. A program aimed at
getting farmers to provide adequate staking should be accompanied by a higher
plant density than presently practiced. Experience in IITA shows that very
large tubers are not only prone to harvesting, handling and storage injuries,
but are more fibrous than medium-sized yams.
19.       Considerable research attention has been given to the yam crop at
IITA and the prospects for substantial production improvements are high.
Crops have been successfully prepared from vine cuttings and yam seeds; the
latter offer immediate opportunities for the plant breeder while both allow
high yielding crops to be grown without risking heavy and expensive demands on
yam yield. Breeding attention is being directed towards a range of objectives
including yield, disease resistance and growth habits to reduce the need for
staking; yields already achieved at IITA have reached 90 tons per hectare.
Within the next three years IITA confidently expects to have produced a number
of stable high yielding lines with production technology suitable for dissemi-
nation to small farmers.
20.       Although the prospects for advanced technology are high, production
forecasts under the projects are based on existing technology with which
yield improvements of up to 300% over existing levels are possible. This
would be achieved by higher planting rates, closer spacing, efficient staking
and application of muriate and potash.
21.       Two levels of technology are proposed:

CASSAVA (Manihot esculanta: crantz or M. utilissima. Pohl)
22.       In common with most humid tropical areas, cassava has assumed a
very important role in the farming systems and diet of Nigerians, largely
because of its ability to utilize the minute quantities of nutrients left
in the soil after a number of years of cropping, and because it stores
very well in the field and when processed as gari or flour.
23.       Ecology.  Cassava does well on most soils that are deep, well-
drained and not too stony. It is adaptable to a wide range of climatic
conditions and has a high tolerance to drought once established, although
in drier areas it requires a longer period to produce acceptable tubers.
24.       Current Practices.  Because of its capacity to produce a crop
from exhausted soils unsuitable for the production of-other crops and its
ability to compete successfully with weeds once established, cassava is
usually the last crop in the rotation before leaving the land to fallow.
The crop is established from stem cuttings and may be interplanted with
an early crop if soil fertility allows. One or two weedings are essential
during the early stages of crop growth, after which no weeding is done.
Harvesting normally commences about nine months after planting but this
varies according to plant growth and consumption requirements. If the first
crop is good, a second crop may be planted before allowing the land to revert
to bush/fallow.
25.       Pests and Diseases.  The main pest is the grasshopper (Zonocerus
variegatus) which causes severe damage when the young gregarious instars
eat the cassava leaves. Damage is most severe during January to April, as
the crop has little moisture to grow on and recovers very slowly. Mosaic,
which is transmitted mainly by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), is widespread
in the area and can cause yield reductions of up to 50% if plants are in-
fected at an early stage. Bacterial blight is a more recently recognized
disease which causes necrotic spots on leaves which spread, coalesce and
lead to defoliation, dieback, stunting or death. Some varieties are more
resistant than others and disease occurence appears to be associated with
mosaic.
26.       Development Potential.  Work ac IITA has produced improved and
disease tolerant varieties capable of yielding at least 15,000 kg per hec-
tare of tuber under present farming practices, and more than 40,000 kg with
fertilizer application on station plots. The present yields of 4,000 kg
per hectare can therefore be raised to 10,000 kg per hectare by simple mul-
tiplication and distribution of improved planting material, and for ad-
vanced farmers up to about 15,000 kg by using fertilizer and closer spac-
ing (1 m x 1 m). Because of cassava's high demand for potash and the low
general fertility of the soils, an application rate of roughly 50-45-90 of
NPK is recommended for achieving a high level of production by the advanced
farmers.



SUPPLEMENT 2

27.       There should therefore be three levels of technology in the pro-
ject areas as follows:

RICE (Orvza Sativa. L)
28.       Rice is grown mainly on the alluvial flood plains of the main
streams and rivers and on the low-lying fadamas which become inundated at
the height of the rains in August-September. Some upland rice is also
grown on flat heavy soils with impeded drainage, and most marketed rice
contains a proportion of red grained Or7za glaberrima which is still
grown, particularly on the uplands.
29.       Ecology.  Rice normally prefers warm temperatures (20-30 C), a
lot of sunshine and inundation of the soil over much of its growing period.
Varieties exist, however, and have been selected to suit a wide range of
ecological conditions.
30.       Current Practices.  Land preparation usually starts between May
and June. The land is cleanly hoed and all weeds removed by hand. A fine
tilth is achieved by breaking up clods, and even where land is plowed and
harrowed mechanically, farmers usually finish off seed bed preparation by
hand hoe. Planting is usually carried out by dibbling (making a hole with
the big toe, dropping in a number of seeds and then covering up the hole
again by foot), or by broadcasting rather thinly (about 25 kg/ha) and cover-
ing up seeds lightly by foot. Local varieties are generally red grained
(O. glaberrima Steud) but, through the National Accelerated Food Production
Program (NAFPP), improved varieties such as IR 20, FARO 15, TOS 78 and
TOS 42 for irrigated and fadama areas, and OS 6 and FARO 56/30 for uplands
are rapidly replacing the local varieties. One or two hand weedings are
undertaken during early growth stages but bird scaring is essential for
about four to six weeks from grain setting to harvesting, depending on



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 7
maturation period. At harvest, the rice is tied into bundles and stacked
in a central area for drying and threshing. Surplus over domestic needs
is generally sold as paddy immediately after harvest. Parboiling before
commercial milling is almost universal.
31.       Pests and Diseses.  Stemborers, termites and army worms are com-
mon though damage is not extensive except on variety OS 6, which is suscep-
tible to stemborers. Rodent and bird damage is important and is reduced
by trapping and scaring. "Blast," particularly neck blast, has been reported
in the area on some of the improved varieties. Other fungal diseases such as
sheath blight and brown spot have also been observed although damage is not
serious.
32.       Development Potential.  As a result of the NAFPP, it should be
possible to assess easily the potential of the various varietes within each
ecological area and to reduce the number of varieties in the kit for multi-
plication for farmers. There is, however, room for improvement in the fer-
tilizer application rates and times. For swamp and irrigated rice, it is
likely that the NAFPP recommended rate of 80-30-30 NPK may be too high
in nitrogen, resulting in increased susceptibility to leaf diseases, while
for both upland and swamp it would be advantageous to split the nitrogen top
dressing to two applications, one after each hand weeding, i.e., about three
and six weeks after sowing respectively. Phosphate fertilizer application
can also be considered at the time when the final tilth is made just prior
to planting.
33.       With fertilizer application it should be possible to increase plant
population, particularly in the fadamas and irrigated areas, since rice is
sown direct and transplanting is not practiced. For uplands, where there is
a possibility of water stress during the middle of the season, the recom-
mended rate of 45 kg/ha should be satisfactory. However, for the fadamas
which receive seepage water from about July to September, increasing seed
rate should not pose serious problems of water stress in the crop and would
also help in the suppression of weeds.
34.       With work in progress at IAR on ULV (ultra low volume) spraying of
herbicides, it would be worth examining the use of such equipment for weed
control in rice. If successful, this would markedly reduce the present
high labor requirements for both weeding and planting, the latter by elimi-
nating the need of dibbling in straight lines at 20 cm apart.
35.       Although seed dressing for rice is not essential where direct
sowing is carried out, it is advisable to encourage seed dressing in the
project area since most of the seed is produced by farmers and seed dress-
ing would help in cases of low seed vigor.
36.       Levels of technology anticipated in the project areas are as
follows:

MAIZE (Zea Mays L)
37.       Maize is the most important cereal crop and is grown both as an
early and a late crop.
38.       Ecology.  Although maize is grown on different soils and under a
wide range of climatic conditions, seedling development is adversely affected
by high soil temperatures. At the time of planting in April/May, soil tem-
perature in the project areas can be as high as 40 C and this affects the
germination and seedling vigor of the present available improved varieties,
the parents of which have been developed in warm temperate conditions where
soil temeratures at planting time are 30 C or lower. The problem is now re-
ceiving considerable research attention resulting in rather frequent changes
in recommended improved varieties.
39.       Current Practices.  The early crop is normally planted in April-
May, and harvested in July-August. Planting is usually on ridges in both
the compound and the bush farm. In the latter case it usually follows the
yam crop. Plant population is low (16,000-20,000 plants/ha), most probably
because it is usually undersown with sorghum before harvesting. The se-
cond season crop is usually planted in August and harvested in November.
It usually follows an early season crop like millet, groundnuts or melon.
40.       Pests and Diseases.  Major pest problems are caused by stemborers
(Eldana sacharina, Busseola fusca and Sesamia spp.) and grain weevils (Stio-
philus spp.), the latter occurring in both field and stores. Diseases in-
clude rust (Puccinia polysora), blight (Helminthosporium maydis), maize
streak virus, grey ear rot and downy mildew. Striga hermonthica is a common
weed pest.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 9
41.       Development Potential.  Present improved varieties of the TZA and
TZB crosses have been giving average yields of over 4,500 kg/ha in country-
wide trials. However, these trial results are from sole cropped maize
planted at high population densites which are not likely to be suitable for
the type of system adopted for the early crop. However, with the use of these
varieties and fertilization, accompanied by good cultural practices, the low
population densities might give rise to a high percentage of plants with two
cobs and would therefore increase yields significantly. Higher plant popula-
tion can be advocated for the second crop and this is likely to be accepted.
42.       Yields of the second crop are unlikely to reach the high national
average because although the seedlings would have the advantage of starting
in cooler soils they have the big disadvantage of growing in a period of
overcast skies and low radiation, and the crop is usually heavily attacked
by stemborers. A compromise would be to grow 120-day varieties which would
be planted in mid-July (i.e., immediately after harvesting the earliest
planted short duration crops) to enjoy 2-3 weeks of growth before adverse
weather conditions occur. Existing yields are estimated at 700-800 kg per
hectare for the early crop and 600 kg for the late crop. With seed dressing
and basic application of 75 kg of triple superphosphate and 25 kg of muriate
of potash followed by a top dressing of 100 kg of calcium ammonium nitrate, it
is estimated that yields of the early crops can be raised to 1,750 kg/ha while
with the same treatment and increased plant population (about 30,000 plants/ha)
yields of the second crop can be increased to about the same level as that of
the early crop. Experience in many parts of West Africa indicates that sulfur
is an essential chemical for upgrading crop development, especially for grain
crops. Because of this, some countries will not change from the use of
ammonium sulfate to other nonacidifying fertilizers. In Nigeria, however,
Goverament has decided to replace ammonium sulfate with calcium ammonium
nitrate. Should it be found in the project and by field trials that the
fertilizer recommendations in this report fall short of the sulfur needs for
optimum yields, it is recommended that provision should be made for sulfur
application, particularly to the grain crops, at a rate of about 15 kg per
hectare.

WATERNELON (Citrullus Lantanus (Thunb) Mansf)
44.       Although grown in most parts of the world for its juicy pulp, in
Nigeria it is valued for its seeds, which are dried, dehusked, and either
ground for making soup or chewed as confectionery. It is an important cash
crop particularly in the Ayangba area, where it is said to be replacing
early millet in the rotation.
45.       Ecology.  Watermelons grow under a wide range of climatic and soil
conditions from the tropics to the subtropics, but prefer sandy, free-drain-
ing soils and do not do well with too much shading.
46.       Current Practices.  Watermelons are usually grown as an early crop
planted both around the homestead or in the bush farms. They may be planted
on the flat around the compounds or in ridges in the bush farms. Three to
four seeds, later thinned to one or two seedlings, are planted at very wide
spacing of between 3 m x 2 m and 3 m x 3 m. Very little cultivation is done
since the crop establishes itself very rapidly and provides a good ground
cover which reduces weed growth. Fruits are usually harvested early, about
3-4 months after planting, chopped and left to rot. The seeds are then
washed and dried. A few fruit may be left in the field to grow larger and
allow the pulp to ripen.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 11
47.       Pests and Diseases.  Varieties grown in Nigeria do not seem to
suffer much from the number of diseases and pests reported elsewhere such
as mosaic virus, fusavium wilt (Fusarium oxysorum schlecht), nematodes
(Meloidogyne spp.) and cucumber beetles (Diabrotica spp. and Acalymma tri-
vittata Maun).
48.       Development Potential.  The hardiness of the crop and its impor-
tance in Nigeria's agriculture has become so evident that research into find-
ing higher yielding cultivars has begun. It is reported by IITA that five
promising cultivars have been selected since work started on the crop two
years ago. Spacing trials are also in progress and yields of 1,750 kg/ha
of seed have recently been reported. No conclusive fertilizer trials have
so far been reported, but because of the poor soils of the project area some
nitrogen would help increase yields. Present yield in the area is estimated
at about 300 kg/ha of dried seed. With slightly closer spacing and fertili-
zer application, and using improved cultivars from IITA, it may be possible
to double this yield.
49.       The levels of farming expected in the project will therefore be:

SORGHUM (Sorghum bicolar (L) Moench)
50.       Sorghum, generally known as guinea corn in West Africa, is another
very important cereal crop in the project area. Traditional sorghum is us-
ually undersown within an early crop and is important both for food and for
brewing local beer, while the tall stalks are used for building and fencing
and sometimes for staking yams.
51.       Ecology.  Sorghum is a crop for warm to hot tropical areas.  It
does not thrive under very humid conditions, but is very drought resistant.
Local varieties are long duration, with a growing period of about five
months. Local sorghum is photosensitive and matures in the dry season on
residual soil moisture.
52.       Current Practices.  Tall sorghum is planted in June/July and is
nearly always undersown within an early millet or maize crop. Plant popu-
lations are low (about 10,000-15,000 plants/ha) and the crop is commonly in-
terplanted, mostly with cowpea. Sorghum is tolerant to interplanting and it



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 12
is unlikely that yield of the widely-spaced traditional crop is adversely
affected by the presence of the intercrop. Sole-planted sorghum is usually
designated for yams in the following season and mounds will be prepared
within the standing sorghum crop during October and November. Farmers grow
no dwarf sorghum and the results from a few trial plots planted have been
disappointing, mainly because of fungal diseases of the panicle.
53.       Pests and Diseases.  Stemborers (mainly Busseola fusca, but also
Sesamia spp.) are very common but appear to do little damage to the thick-
stemmed local varieties. Sorghum shoot fly can be troublesome and is best
avoided by early planting. Sorghum midge may cause some yield loss and
bird damage is a problem at flowering. Covered smut and loose smut are en-
demic and cause considerable crop loss but both can be controlled by seed
dressing. In addition to pests and diseases, striga, a common weed, causes
significant reductions in yield.
54.       Development Potential.  While higher-yielding, short-straw vari-
eties have been developed for the more northern areas of Nigeria, these have
yet to be successfully integrated into the farming systems and climatic con-
ditions of the project area. Although plant population is very low, since
the crop matures with residual soil moisture, plant population may be in-
creased only slightly because of the free-draining nature of the soils in the
project areas. The crop has, however, been found to benefit from fertilizer
application, and interviews with farmers indicated that sorghum came third,
after yams and maize, in terms of their priorities in fertilizer application
to crops.
55.       Existing yields are estimated at 600 kg/ha.  With seed dressing
and fertilizer application of a basal dressing of 50 kg of triple super-
phosphate and a split application with 100 kg of calcium ammonium nitrate,
yields can be increased to 1,200 kg/ha.
56.       The levels of farming expected in the project areas are as fol-
lows:

COWPEA (Vigna Unguiculata (L) Sari ex Hassk)
57.       The cowpea is a very important legume crop in the project areas
where it is grown both for its leaves, which are used as a vegetable, and
for its seeds. It is generally planted as a mixed crop but sole cropping
on bush farms is not uncommon. It is grown either as an early or late crop.
58.       Ecology.  Cowpea prefers warm climates with moderate rainfall
during the growing season and free-draining soils. It does well on moder-
ately rich soils but on soils that are too rich it runs to leaf instead of
seed.
59.       Current Practices.  The crop is generally grown as an intercrop
and though sometimes planted early, it is usually planted as a late crop.
Intercropping is preferred because it offers some protection against in-
sect attack. As a late crop, it is planted around August, and harvesting
would be around December. This is because local varieties flower unevenly
and ripen over a long period, requiring four to five pickings to complete
the harvest. Shelling is either by beating with sticks or by breaking pods
by hand.
60.       Pests and Diseases.  Leaf-eating beetles may cause serious defoli-
ation; thrips and leaf hoppers attack the plant at all stages and coreid
bugs suck from green pods, causing them to shrivel. The seed is attacked
both from the field and in storage by boring beetles and weevils. The root
knot nematode (Heterodera marioni) causes irregular swellings on the roots,
stunting the plant and reducing yield.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 14
61.       The most important disease is mosaic.  The vector for mosaic is
the beetle Otheca mutabilis. Other diseases are anthracnose, corynespora,
and cercospora leaf spot.
62.       Development Potential.  Strains showing some resistance to leaf
hoppers, thrips and pod borers have been isolated and are available. If
acceptable in the project area on grounds of taste and cooking qualities,
these should reduce the number of sprayings required to obtain high yields.
However, spraying is necessary for high yields and with the introduction of
ULV sprayers substantial yield improvements are now possible with compara-
tively less labor than with conventional sprayers. Current yields are es-
timated at 200-300 kg per hectare. With improved cultivars and spraying,
together with an application of 50 kg of calcium ammonium nitrate and 50 kg of
triple superphosphate, yields of 1,500 kg/ha would be possible.
63.       Since ULV sprays have to be introduced primarily for the devel-
opment of cowpeas, it would be necessary to encourage its production on
larger acreages than presently allocated for the crop. A possible method
of increasing acreage would be by encouraging intercropping with cassava,
tall sorghum or late maize. In the first instance, fertilizers applied to
maize or sorghum should benefit the cowpea and thereby demonstrate the
need to apply fertilizer to the cowpea crop.

BENNISEED (Sesamun Indicum L)
65.       Once an important schedule crop in the project area, benniseed is
now grown mainly for home consumption and local trade. It is included in
the project proposals because of the present attractive minimum price and
its relatively low labor requirements. Farmers' views, gathered in Lafia
Division, indicate that with improved marketing and increased soil fertility,
the crop could become important once more.
66.       Ecology.  Well-drained light soils are preferred, and the crop
is tolerant of short periods of drought though excessive rainfall can be
damaging. Shading can be beneficial during establishment and early growth,
but good sunlight is necessary from flowering onwards. Temperatures of
25-300C give optimum growth.
67.       Current Practices.  Benniseed can be grown either as an early or
late crop, but is more frequently grown as a late crop, planted in August. In
most cases it is sole cropped though mixed cropping with sorghum is practiced.
It is also sometimes planted on early-formed yam mounds which are reshaped
after benniseed harvesting and planted to yams. Harvesting commences just
prior to the lower capsule splitting and the whole plant is cut, tied into
bundles and stooked, occasionally over sacking.
68.       Pests and Diseases.  The leaf roller (Antigastra catelaunalis) and
the gall midge (Asphondylia sesami) can cause severe yield losses, but timely
planting and vigorous growth will usually reduce their effects to an accep-
table level. The most important disease is leaf curl, which is carried by
whitefly (bemisia tabaci). Second season crops are not seriously affected,
however, and some resistance is found on hirsute leaves.
69.       Development Potential.  Recent trials with improved varieties in
the Lafia Division have given encouraging results of between 750 kg/ha and
900 kg/ha. With fertilizer application and improved marketing the crop is
likely to draw much greater farmer attention than it now enjoys. The crop,
particularly the late crop, is moreover attractive to farmers in having low
labor requirements except for threshing, which can be programmed to avoid
peaks.
70.       Levels of technology expected in the projects are as follows:
Traditional          Improved
a)   Seed                                    Local              Improved

SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 16
OTHER CROPS
71.       There are a number of other crops in the areas, some of which are
useful in the diet of the population, but which have limited potential for
development at the present time and would require further investigation be-
fore any sound development plans could be formulated.
72.       Millet (Pennisetum typhoides (Burm. f.) Stopf and Hobbard).  Bul-
rush millet is an important cereal grown both as an early and late crop,
though the early crop is more common in the project areas. Research work
on millet is concentrated on improved varieties for-the more northerly parts
of West Africa where it is one of the very few cereals that will grow under
conditions of very low rainfall. Although it is likely that some of the im-
proved varieties developed for the more northerly areas may be suitable for
the project areas, few adaptive trials with these varieties have been con-
ducted. The crop is known to extract substantial quantities of nitrogen from
the soil during early growth but its response to fertilizers has not been
accurately measured.
73.       Local yields are estimated at 400-450 kg per hectare. In Senegal
local yields, using improved varieties, have been reported as 850 kg/ha for
improved practices without the use of fertilizers, 1,100 kg/ha with moderate
fertilizer application and 1,700 kg/ha with recommended fertilizer application.
74.       The project will try to find high yielding varieties suitable for
the areas and it is felt that the local crop will benefit from the general
rise in soil fertility as a result of project activities.
75.       Bambara Nuts (Voandzeia subterranea (L) Thon).  Bambara nuts are
popular in the plateau area of Ayangba where they are said to have replaced
cotton. They are also an important crop in the Keana area of Lafia. The
crop does well on poor soils and is generally free of pests and diseases.
It is also likely to beneift from general raising of soil fertility as a
result of project activities.
76.       Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum).  Once a useful crop in the project
areas, cotton has declined rapidly in importance. The decline in production,
like benniseed, is blamed on poor marketing facilities as well as on low
economic returns from the crop. Efforts by MANR to revive the industry have
met with poor response from farmers. In the Lafia area, two years' stocks of
seed remain undistributed in MANR stores because farmers will not take them
although they are given out free. Under the circumstances, the project will
therefore not concentrate its activities on cotton development.
77.       Pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan (L) Mill sp.).  The pigeon pea is a use-
ful grain legume crop in certain areas of Ayangba. It is an important end-
of-rotation crop, often left in the field for about three years. Although
yields decline after the first harvest, the plant continues to be harvested



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 17
until after the third year, when yam mounds may be made in between the stand-
ing crop. The plants are then pruned to act as stakes for yam vines. Be-
cause of its qualities as an enhancer of soil fertility, pigeon peas can be
encouraged as an end-of-rotation crop.
78.       Groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea L).  Although commonly found in the
project areas, groundnuts are not grown on a commercial scale. They are
grown mainly for home consumption though some are sold at local markets.
They are usually planted as intercrop with maize, cassava or millet. Eco-
logically the crop prefers warm temperatures with rainfall of 500-1,000 mm.
The project areas cannot therefore be regarded as good groundnut growing
areas. In the project areas where they are planted in April/May, ripening
takes place in dull overcast conditions followed by harvesting during heavy
rains.
79.       Since any program of improvement would require changing dates of
planting which may not be readily accepted by farmers because of the rela-
tive insignificance of the crop in the whole farming system, it is not re-
commended that the project devote too much attention to it. The crop should
also benefit by the general raising of soil fertility through project acti-
vities.
TREE CROPS
80.       Extensive wild oil palm groves are found in the Ayangba area where
large quantities of palm kernels are purchased by the Nigeria Produce MIar-
keting Corporation. In the Lafia Division scattered groves are found in the
valley bottoms. Small areas of coffee and cocoa are also found in the Ayangba
project area although scheduled purchases are insignificant. There is a
small but growing citrus industry and farmers are becoming interested in
growing some kola nuts.
81.       The Benue State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
maintains three nurseries in the Ayangba area, one each at Ankpa, Ochaja and
Idah, where seedlings of oil palm, cocoa, coffee, coconut, guava, citrus,
mango, kola and, more recently, cashew and avocado pears are raised. In
Lafia, emphasis has been placed on citrus seedlings, most of which have been
used to supply farmers from the Local Government Council (LGC) nursery near
Lafia town. The adjacent Plateau State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources nursery, started in 1972/73, is being expanded rapidly to meet
increasing demands and will supply an estimated 20,000 citrus seedlings to
farmers by 1978. This nursery has also started to raise kola nut seedlings
and it expects to distribute over 2,000 seedlings in 1977.
82.       Oil Palm (Elacis Suineensis Jacg).  Despite the prevalance of wild
oil palm the area is not well suited to intensive oil palm production. An-
nual rainfall is around 750 mm, which is less than the minimum requirements
for successful oil palm culture, and given the free draining characteristics
of the soil, considerable moisture stress would result during the dry season.
Although oil palm is not included as a major development component of the



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 18
project, improved oil palm seedlings would be made available to farmers from
the project nurseries for planting around the homestead.
83.       Coffee (Coffee caenophora Pierre).  A few fields of robusta coffee
have been established in the area and although somewhat neglected the plants
look healthy and vigorous. W4hile the climate in the higher elevations is
quite satisfactory for robusta coffee, the plant requires deep, well-drained
loams with ample humus and nutrients, and there is only limited scope for ex-
panding its presently insignificant area. Moreover coffee is more difficult
to maintain in good productive condition and to harvest and process for mar-
keting than most of the other tree crops in West Africa.
84.       Coffee cannot, therefore, be considered as a major development com-
ponent though guidance on improved husbandry would be provided by the project.
Typically the established coffee is suffering from poor management; trees
are unpruned; gaps are not refilled; weeding is haphazard; little fertilizer
is applied; and the trees have gone into biennial bearing. To rejuvenate
the plots the farmers need to prune, quite drastically in places, apply fer-
tilizers and attend to weeding. Improved seedling should continue to be
sold to farmers as a service operation.
85.       Cocoa (Theobroma cacao).  Cocoa requires an annual rainfall of
1,250-3,800 mm and deep, well-drained sandy clay loams or clay loams with
high organic matter. Small plantations have been established in the area
but are not thriving on the sandy soils. The GRIN Station at Ochaja con-
siders the area unsuitable for expansion of the crop, though the nurseries
in Ayangba will continue to raise seedlings for sale to farmers.
86.       Cashew (Anacardium occidentale).  There are no established cashew
plantations in the area though occasional "wild" trees are found. The crop,
however, was considered as a development possibility since it tolerates a
wide range of rainfall and will grow well on poor soil, provided it is not
impermeable. The crop, also, has a low labor requirement and benefits from
annual crop cultivation during establishment. With the main harvest occur-
ing in February, there would be little clash with annual crop operations.
Seedling raising would be expanded in Ayangba project area and started in
Lafia project area for sale to farmers.
87.       Citrus.  The area has a small, but flourishing, citrus trade in
which orange predominates although grapefruit and tangerines are also grown.
Most trees are grown as a compound crop by farmers and are flourishing and
healthy with no symptoms of distortion, excess suckering or reversion to the
rootstock that characterizes citrus in a hostile locality. A number of ab-
sentee farmers and business men have started substantial acreages of citrus
plantations and it is likely that this will be an increasingly attractive
investment in the future.
88.       The sources of seed and seedlings were variable and the varieties
could not be identified. The oranges, however, were green with tough tight
skins, but juicy and sweet to eat. Though unattractive to the international



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 19
market as a dessert crop, it sells very well in Nigeria and the fruit would
be suitable for processing, particularly juice extraction.
89.       A total lack of information on existing tree populations and
yields, or the scope and ramifications of the domestic market, prevents any
formalized planning for the area's citrus industry at this stage. Quali-
tatively there is almost certainly scope for market and production devel-
opment but quantification would require detailed appraisal by project man-
agement. The project should endeavor to provide good quality orange, man-
darin and lemon seedlings to farmers with the facilities to expand distri-
bution if suitable fruit disposal arrangements can be identified. Seedling
production in Ayangba would be improved and expanded while the expansion of
the two nurseries in Lafia would be undertaken.
90.       Other tree crops worth raising and distributing to farmers are
kola (Cola spp.), coconuts (Cocos nucifera), avocado (Persea americana Mill)
and mango (Mangifera indica L.).
C. Cropping Practices
91.       Sequential Cropping.  Due to the long growing season of over 200
days, a wide range of crops with differing growing periods are observed in
the area. These can be divided into full season crops with growing periods
that span all or most of the growing season, and short season crops for which
rainfed double cropping is possible.
92.       Short season crops can be early or late according to their posi-
tion in the growing sequence; this may be one of relay cropping, whereby a
late season crop is planted immediately after the harvest of an early season
crop, or one of undersowing, when sowing takes place before the harvest of
an early season crop. The latter practice is commonly observed in maize,
millet, and sorghum combinations, with the sorghum being planted in June
within the standing millet crop which is usually harvested in late July,
after which the sorghum crop grows to maturity for harvest in November.
93.       Mixed Cropping.  Superimposed on the pattern of sequential crop-
ping is the practice of mixed cropping, referring to regular interspacing of
two or more crops with the growing period of each crop nested within the
growing period of another. Mixed cropping is often looked down upon as re-
presenting low level technology, but has been shown to offer a number of
advantages:
(a) Certain crop mixtures enhance utilization of prime
growth factors giving increased physical yield per
hectare. This can result from differing factor
requirements of component crops or from peak fac-
tor requirements occurring at different times in
the growing season.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 20
(b) A more complete and longer-term soil cover is made
possible and thereby reduces the risk of erosion.
(c) It offers the farmer a degree of security since
adverse growing conditions are unlikely to exert
themselves to the same extent on each component
crop.
(d) Labor inputs are reduced by combining field oper-
ations common to the component crops.
(e) Crops susceptible to pest attack can be afforded
some protection if grown within a pest-resistent
cover crop.
94.       Mixed cropping is now receiving increasing professional attention
but no satisfactory methodology has yet been devised for its analysis.
Within both areas, however, the mathematical problems posed by crop mix-
tures are not severe, for while many plots are mixed in that they contain
more than one crop, a single dominant crop is in most cases readily ap-
parent, with admixtures occurring as scattered plantings or rogue crops,
neither of which is likely to exert any significant competing effect on
the dominant crop.
95.       Cropping Patterns.  Applying these structural definitions of
cropping sequences and crop mixtures to the model practices observed in
the project areas, the following much simplied picture emerges:

96.       Estimates of existing cropping patterns, made on the basis of plot
counts during preparation and appraisal, are included in Table 1. Each crop
is expressed as a sole crop or as a principal crop in a crop mixture; with
the exception of cowpeas, the areas (and yield estimates dealt with later
in this supplement) can be equated with sole crop equivalent areas, since
the competing effect of any intercrop is considered insignificant.  Cowpeas
are widely grown as a subsidiary admixture and the area recorded in Table 1
represents only that grown as a sole crop; no attempt has been made to es-
timate the individual areas of 'other' crops for which specific technical
improvement packages have not been included, nor has an estimate been
attempted of the sole-cropped equivalent areas of cowpeas and other sub-
sidiary admixtures.
D. Crop Economics and Development
97.       The main development components of both projects are centered on
removing or reducing the main productivity constraints presently faced by
farmers in the area. These components, which involve crop input distribu-
tion, research discrimination, and improved crop transport and market in-
frastructure, are expected to attract a substantial response from the farm-
ing community, but the extent to which the response would be directed to-
wards specific crops can only be controlled to a limited extent by the pro-
jects. New technology in crop production would change the relative impor-
tance of each individual crop, and a prediction of these likely changes
would depend on the extent to which farmer motivation and production con-
straints can be defined and the degree to which these can be satisfied by
the output of each crop in relation to competing demands and the farmer's
resources.
98.       Accurate analyses and predictions of this sort are constrained
by a data base which is generally inadequate to support mathematical spe-
cification of the rather complex farming system described above. Data
assembly, therefore, has had to rely heavily on information and experience
gained outside the project areas and on observation and primary data col-
lected by the preparation and appraisal mission.
99.       Crop Budgets.  Crop budgets are detailed in Appendix 1.  Physi-
cal budgets have been compiled from analyses of control and treated exten-
sion demonstration plots, modified in certain cases by field observation,
and from research results collected from IAR and IITA, downgraded to re-
present development potential under smallholder management. The levels
of crop inputs used are generally conservative, representing average
application rates that are likely to prove most attractive to the farming
community. Economic and financial translations of the physical budgets
have been made using the commodity price forecasts which are detailed in
Supplement 11. The economic budgets, which are based on the 1980 forecast
economic farmgate prices expressed in 1976 constant Naira, include a



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 22
shadow price for labor of N 1.00 per manday;l/ the economic budgets have
been used as the basis for projecting the economic crop production bene-
fits of each project.
100.      Financial budgets calculated at full cost have been used to re-
present the returns per hectare and per manday in a situation of no Govern-
ment subsidies on purchased inputs, with market prices competitive with
those of the world market. Financial budgets at actual prices represent
existing Government subsidies on purchased inputs, guaranteed prices for
export crops and market distortions which have caused some domestic farngate
prices to differ substantially from those derived from world market prices.
101.      Labor Requirements.  Within Lafia, and to a lesser extent in
Ayangba, labor availability is generally a more important constraint on
holding size than land availability. Since the improved and advanced tech-
nical packages demand a substantially higher labor input than under exist-
ing (traditional) production, the impact of technical change on overall
cultivated area must be considered.
102.      Detailed monthly labor requirements for each crop are given in
Appendix 2; these have been compiled by reference to data collected within
and outside Nigeria. Large differences among sources were found, with
apparent discrepencies within sources, when comparing labor inputs for
similar operations with different crops. For all crop operations, manday
requirements inevitably contain a high degree of natural variation. Those
detailed in Appendix 2 have been drawn selectively from sources to repre-
sent as closely as possible the relative requirements of different crops;
all exclude the potential of mechanization for improving labor producti-
vity and include all operations necessary to convert the standing crop into
the marketable form used as the basis of farmgate price projections in Sup-
plement 11.
103.      Production Development.  Development analysis is undertaken on
the assumption that farmers behave in an economically rational manner, though
the environment of risk and uncertainly will influence both the range of ob-
jectives to be maximized and the rate of progress along the path to optimi-
zation.
104.      The influence of improved technology on response rate and crop-
ping patterns will be dictated by financial returns at actual prices; the
assumption has been made that Government intervention in produce and input
prices will not substantially change during the project development period.
Reference to the farm budgets shows that the proposed technical packages
substantially increase the returns per hectare of all the listed crops;
this is particularly so in the case of yam, improving its already dominant
position as a cash crop for the area. The ranking order of returns per
hectare does not change in the case of full season crops but those for
1/   The current rural wage rate is estimated at N 1.40.



SUPPLEMENT 2
Page 23
cowpeas, and to a lesser extent for late maize, improve substantially, while
early maize and tall sorghum decline.
105.      In view of the constraint of labor on holding size, return per
hectare may prove less important than return per manday. For the latter,
new technology substantially improves the ranking order of cowpeas and
cassava largely at the expense of early maize and tall sorghum. However,
in an area with a pronounced seasonal labor profile, returns per manday
during the main work peak in the profile are likely to exert a stronger
influence than returns to total mandays.
106.      Despite these considerations, the extent to which new technology
would influence cropping patterns is likely to prove rather limited during
a five-year development period. Most farmers still grow their subsistence
food requirements and the overall volume of marketed food crops would need
to increase substantially before specialization of production becomes com-
mon.
107.      Expected adoption rates of new technology for each crop have been
estimated by judging the improved return per hectare and per manday, and are
included in the production estimate of Appendices 3 and 4. These estimates
incorporate some expected changes in overall cropping patterns in each
area, and were made by considering the impact of increased labor require-
ments in an area where present holding size is largely dictated by labor
availability. Farm labor profiles have been calculated in Appendix 5 for
the 'average' farm in each project area, under existing technology. The
profiles reveal a peak labor demand during June mainly resulting from weeding
requirements. Since this peak is likely to serve as a continuing constraint
on total area cropped, a reduction in early season crops, which make high de-
mands on June labor for the least return, is expected to occur. Although it
would be to the benefit of project returns, no other shifts in cropping pat-
terns have been included except in Lafia Division, where advanced cowpea
production is expected to occur at the expense of sorghum production.
108.      A summary of expected cropping patterns at the end of the project
development period is included in Table 1. Production summaries based on
the working tables of Appendices 3 and 4, along with estimates of produc-
tion economic benefits, are contained in the individual appraisal reports
for each project.
109.      Crop budgets are in Appendix 1.  An average farm budget has been
calculated and is presented in Table 2. This is based on an average holding
size (2 ha in Ayangba and 2.5 ha in Lafia) and applies the average cropping
pattern 1/ of each area (see Table 1) to this hypothetical farm. 2/
1/   Other crops (for which no benefits have been calculated) had to
excluded.
2/   The same methodology was applied to determine farm labor pro-
files in Appendix 5.

SUPPLEXNT 3
NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
FARM DEVELOPMENT
A. Production Development
1.        The development projections of Supplement' 2, although substantial,
are largely the products of large project areas and the present marked dif-
ference between existing and potential yields. The proposed production
packages are not unduly sophisticated; farmers appreciate the use and value
of fertilizer, and expected crop yields of even the advanced budgets are
still more than 40% below those of research institutions.
2.        The immediate problem, therefore, is one of logistics.  Present
distribution of inputs is sporadic and insignificant despite demand which
in Lafia has been prepared to pay high prices for fertilizer traded on the
black market. Dissemination of technical information is likewise limited
but in any case has little relevance if the basic inputs for applying an
improved technology cannot be obtained. Present subsidy policy has largely
prevented development of private input trading and the disappointing per-
formance of Government in input procurement and technical dissemination
has led to farmers lacking confidence in Government's interest or ability to
help.
3.        A marked response can therefore by expected from the most basic
improvements in agricultural services; this is particularly so in the Lafia
area where substantial surplus production already exists which reflects a
strong commercial outlook by farmers and a willingness and ability to
respond to market incentives without Government assistance. However,
although the basic problems are simple, their solution is difficult, for
it involves contact with a very large number of small and widely dispersed
producers.
4.        Agricultural Services.  Agricultural production services fall into
two distinct categories which should be administered separately: (a) services
involving provision of farm inputs that should in the long-term be controlled
by non-Government agencies; these are essentially trading services; (b) tech-
nical (extension) and research functions that are primarily the responsibility
of Government and which, for effective use, demand a long-term Government
commitment. Both are linked, however, in that effective utilization of the
one requires the presence of the other while both are faced with the same
diseconomies of scale in dealing with small producers.



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 2
5.        All agricultural services must also achieve a high level of
reliability and the farming community's confidence. Traditional farming
systems are the result of farmers' inherent knowledge of the environment
and their assessment of risk and uncertainty. New technology usually
increases production risks, for investment overheads have to be carried
and enterprises gradually become more dependent on other services in the
economy. Complete confidence in the latter must be achieved before farmers
will move along an irreversible path to new technology.
6.        To achieve this objective a network of multifunctional Farmers
Service Centers (FSC) would be created at which basic project field services
would be clustered and which would become reliable sources of technical
advice and trade inputs for farmers. FSC have been located 1/ primarily
to allow economies of scale in the input delivery system and each FSC serves
a hinterland of up to 15 km radius; a total of 20 are included for Lafia
and 30 for Ayangba. Proposals for commercial services development are dealt
with as a separate subject in the respective appraisal reports. FSC would
also form the field headquarters of the general extension service which would
provide the main communication link between project management and farmers.
7.        General Extension.  A general extension service would be provided
at the ratio of one Agricultural Assistant/Instructor to 500 farm families.
An Assistant Agricultural Superintendent would be in charge of each FSC
responsible to an Agricultural Superintendent in charge of 5 FSCs. Total
staff required (for further details see also Table 1) at full development
would be as follows:
-----Number---

Senior Agricultural Officer        SAO            1              1
Agricultural Officer               AO             3               1
Agricultural Superintendent        AS             6               4
Assistant Agricultural
Superintendent                 AAS            30              20
Agricultural Assistant             AA            60             40
Agricultural Instructor            AI           240             80
8.        The initial task of the extension staff would be to compile an
inventory of villages and village farming populations 2/ and to define
geographical areas of responsibility; the traditional authority should be
fully involved in the program and their assistance and support should be
assured by explanation and discussion with staff at all levels. A dissemi-
nation network should then be created through village committees organized
1/   See project maps in the respective appraisal reports.
2/   This inventory will also be required for evaluation purposes.  Therefore
the Chief Evaluation Officer and the Head of the Crop Development Divi-
sion would work closely together so as to ensure that one inventory will
provide base data useful for dual purposes.

with the assistance of village heads and through other assemblies such
as schools and religious institutions. The objective at this stage would
be to widely inform the rural population of the scope and objectives of
the project and to provide a fast and effective two-way channel of com-
munication between farmers and extension service.
9.        Group Formation.  During the initial stages of the project,
contact with farmers at the individual level will be necessary both for
technical dissemination and commercial supply. However, high operating
efficiency of both these services will be possible only with economies of
scale; an effective group structure among small farmers is therefore
essential.
10.       This need is recognized in Nigeria and has formed the basis of
Government's policy to create a network of rural cooperatives. However,
this program has had very limited success, largely because structures have
been imposed on the community and have frequently been too sophisticated
for the basic needs. of members while lacking the necessary business exper-
tise to undertake broader commercial operations. Successful group formation
of any type can only occur if farmers can easily identify the benefits of
membership.
11.       The successful formation of farmers councils in the Ayangba area
is largely a result of this. The councils are small and cohesive, serving
the simple basic needs of the farming community and carrying the minimum
of overheads; council members have the advantage of easier access to credit
and service provisions and have confidence in their organizers' genuine inter-
est in rural development. For the Ayangba project, the network provides
contact with around 10,000 farmers through 43 zonal committees and 625 indi-
vidual councils.
12.       This type of group structure would need to be expanded in Ayangba
and created in Lafia, and every opportunity should be taken to provide incen-
tives for group formation. Proposals are contained in the Commercial Services
Annex of the respective appraisal reports for providing incentives and special
services for bulked orders of inputs; credit provision and tractor hire
charges (see below) would also contain incentives for scale. General exten-
sion staff would be responsible for disseminating information on these incen-
tives and for explaining to farmers the importance of scale if they are to be
assured of the long-term viability of services. Priority on extension staff
time would also be given to groups and training courses and demonstration
visits for farmers would progressively be directed to groups or group repre-
sentatives.
13.       The projects would not attempt to take over existing groups, such
as the farmers councils in Ayangba, which have been formed independently
from Government. The objectives would be to provide efficient and effective
services to all project farmers and to give special attention to any form of
group structure which is well founded and provides economies of scale. From
these somewhat humble beginnings an important pathway would be laid for
developing advanced production and marketing organization; this subject is
further discussed in Section B of this supplement.

14.       Feedback.  Effective extension requires sensitive understanding of
production problems and constraints faced by growers. As the main communica-
tion link between project and farmer, the general extension service has an
important rQle to play in feeding back information to management. Farmers'
reactions to new technology must be observed and reported, and used as the
basis for modifying research and work programs. Close liaison must also be
maintained with traditional leaders and all institutions involved with or in a
position to influence rural development.
15.       Support Services.  To obtain the necessary caliber of staff, an
intensive program of inservice training will be necessary; this would
be the responsibility of a separate Training Division within each project
which would also operate mobile audio-visual training units for the benefit
of farmers. Details of content and outturn of existing training institutions
in Nigeria, along with proposals for staff and farmer training, are contained
in Supplement 8.
B. Farm Managemen,t
16.       Crop production proposals contained in Supplement 2 are based on
average anticipated response rates to improved technology. During imolementa-
tion, however, it is expected that an elite of farmers and progressive small-
holder groups would emerge who would be suitable for application of more
advanced technology. Such groups would require specialist services outside of
the prime work routine of the general extension service, and a special Far=
Aavisory Division has been included in the project for this purpose. Advanced
farm development has been shown to have an important role to play in the three
Northern Agricultural Development Projects, 1/ both in spearheading technological
development beyond the level of simple husbandry improvement and in attracting
private capital into agriculture.
17.       In addition, there is growing concern within Nigeria at the drift of
labor from the land. Young men are becoming attracted away from agriculture's
drudgery to the expectation of an easier urban life, and the movement is
graining momentum against the background of Universal Primary Education (UPE).
Recent increases in the official daily minimum wage rate are an additional
factor limiting the availability of rural labor. The minimum wage rate was
less than R 1.00; it was increased to ' 1.75 following Udoji salary review
and is now established at 'N 2.10. To some extent the trend would be arrested
by the projects' crop development proposals which would substantially improve
returns per manday under existing methods of production; however, technology
to raise physical returns to labor will become increasingly important in
Nigeria; possibilities exist both through mechanizing and modifying the
existing cultivation systems.

SUPPLEMENT 3

18.       Tractor Mechanization.  Labor productivity of small family farms
is not easily improved by tractor mechanization, this being witnessed by
existing Government tractor hire units which provide a highly subsidized
service achieving low output per tractor and covering an insignificant
portion of total cropped area. Output per tractor in the four tractor
hire units visited during appraisal ranged from a low of 12 ha per year
to a high of around 40 ha; although absorbing a large portion of extension
service time and operating costs, they are presently cultivating less than
0.005% of total cropped area.
19.       Demand from farmers for tractor services is presently very high.
To qualify for the service a minimum request for 2' ha cultivation is necessary
though small farmers can group to achieve this area, since it is not a condi-
tion that the area form one continguous block. A high proportion of time is
spent traveling to isolated holdings, and stumps and other hazards impair
field performance. In the Ayangba area, the Benue State Government is
attempting to ease these problems as part of a land development scheme in
which large blocks are being cleared manually at Government expense, the
contracts often being awarded to the farmers themselves. Apart from the
heavy demands on public funds, little consideration has been given to
problems of soil conservation or to the farming system which should be
applied.
20.       No clear policy exists on the contribution mechanization can make
gtowards raising overall productivity. At present, tractor hire services are
directed almost entirely towards land preparation whereas crop weeding
represents the main peak in the labor profile and no mechanical service
exists for this function. Timely planting and efficient weed control which
could be assisted by mechanical aids would provide real benefits. However,
in practice the existing service is so unreliable that potential benefits
are negated by delay in providing machinery.
21.       The scope for private ownership of tractors, which is essential
in the long term, is less than in the three Northern Agricultural Development
Projects, for the areas do not contain a significant number of large farmers
who would be able to support the heavy overhead and operating costs. Tractor
hire services therefore have a part to play in these areas but development
must be cautious and within the framework of clearly defined objectives.
22.       The projects would take over the existing tractor hire services (for
details see Table 2) in Ayangba and Lafia but expansion would be limited and
attention directed toward substantially improving tractor output with a long
term objective of transference to private ownership. Tractor output would be
increased both by improving servicing and operating efficiency and by provid-
ing a broader spectrum of operations throughout the farming year. All tractor
work would be primarily restricted to areas where sufficient land is available
in large and continugous units to permit viable operation. Initially the most
suitable locations are likely to be in the rice producing areas along fringes
of the major rivers' flood plains; these areas would be handed over entirely
to private contractors as and when they become available.



SUPPLEMENT 3

23.       The tractor units would be deployed at Farmers Service Center
level to reduce transport times to contract points, and the present hire
charges on-an acreage basis would be replaced by hourly rates (for details see
Table 2); this would overcome the problem of area measurement when calculating
hire payments and would enable strict financial and operational control by
fitting service recorders for each tractor. Hourly hire rates, which would
include transport to and from service centers, would automatically provide a
strong incentive to farmers and farmer groups to (a) increase the area culti-
vated per contract so that the ratio of operational to nonoperational time
is improved, and (b) increase field size and remove obstructions so that
operational field efficiency is improved.
24.       Tractor hire services would be provided against cash payment only.
The projects would purchase additional tractors to provide the equivalent of
two tractor units per Farmers Service Center. Funds have been included for
trailers for transport services during harvesting and for a range of planting
and cultivation equipment, but purchase of the latter would be subject to
experience and recommendations emanating from the three Northern Agricultural
Development Projects. Regular servicing of tractors and machinery would be
carried out by a mobile maintenance unit.
25.       Credit would be provided by the project to assist farmers in land
clearing for tractor cultivation. No specific land clearing equipment is
included in project costs, but surplus capacity exists within the Engineering
Department of each project for subsoiling and ripping of roots and obstruc-
tions to the order of 800 ha over the development period; this could be pro-
vided at a charge to farmers of ; 30 per hectare, plus a delivery charge of
N 1.00 per km. Credit provision would be subject to a detailed farm plan
showing the incremental area of cultivation resulting from tractor use, a
cropping and rotation plan, and a financial projection of benefits resulting
from the investment. Credit repayments would be made over three years; to be
eligible a farmer must have previously and successfully adopted the technical
crop production packages of the project appropriate to his cropping program.
26.       Credit for land clearing and subsoiling and use of the tractor
hire unit would normally be restricted to farmers or groups that can assemble
a minimum of 10 ha for mechanical cultivation, but judgment would rest with
the project according to careful financial analysis. Likewise farmers or
groups with suitable management and operational capacity who wish to purchase
their own equipment would receive specific technical and budgetary advice
from the projects. Farmer credit for tractors and tractor equipment would
be sought from commercial banks against farm development plans prepared by
the project; this system is proving particularly successful in the Northern
Agricultural Development Projects.
27.       Intermediate Mechanization.  The projects would continuously review
the scope for labor productivity improvement at the intermediate level. In
this respect, improved hand tools could make an important contribution,



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 7
particularly hand-operated seed planters and fertilizer drills, seed
dressing drums, and threshing, shelling and winnowing equipment. Close
liaison would be maintained with the agricultural engineering units at
IAR and IITA which are already investigating the scope for small equip-
ment on smallholder farmers in West Africa. There is no precedent for
work oxen in either of the project areas and with a general lack of inter-
est and experience in cattle management among crop producers, this is
unlikely to prove an attractive alternative to hand- or tractor-powered
machinery.
28.       Transport.  New technology in crop production is expected to
significantly influence the seasonal labor requirements of project farmers
(see Supplement 2, Appendix 5). Much of the additional labor requirement
resulting from improved technology occurs in the harvesting peak and is
most marked in the case of yam when headloading of the substantial potential
yield increase could prove to be a major bottleneck. It is already common
for farmers to sell yams directly from the field or occasionally to sell
the standing crop well before harvest to a trader who takes responsibility
for both harvesting and haulage. This practice is frequently condemned as
a means of exploitation, but it is significant that with the improved yam
budget of Supplement 2, sale price per ton could be reduced by N 10 with
direct haulage from the field, and by N 20 for a harvest and haulage agree-
ment, without reducing financial return per manday. Considerable scope
exists; therefore, for onfarm transport, which could have an important
impact on the economics of tractor, oxen and small equipment use. Like-
wise, there is considerable potential for groups to bulk their produce
and crop input requirements into full lorry loads and to make transport
arrangements with private haulers.
29.       Land Management.  The advanced technology of components described
above can rarely be introduced in rotation since they frequently have
repercussions on the entire farming system. For example, expensive clearing
for mechanization must be rewarded by an extended period of cultivation and
has far-reaching repercussions on the whole bush/fallow cycle. Likewise,
to achieve economies of scale in machinery use, block farming operations
would inevitably embrace a greater diversity of soil types than would occur
with selective bush clearance of small plots, while exposure to the elements
and loss of the binding effect of roots would increase the risk of soil
erosion. Expertise in land management planning would therefore be an important
service for the progressive farmer.
30.       The Land Use and Farm Advisory Division would maintain a library
of air photographs and would have survey and mapping capability. Air photo-
graphy of the areas has already been carried out and prints should be made
available to the projects. In addition the Land Resources Division of the
UK Ministry of Overseas Development has a project, based in Jos, which
covers a broad investigation into all land resources in the central part
of Nigeria (see map attached to this supplement). Although not completed,



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 8
valuable information has already been collected 1/ and various reports
published. The projects would note duplicate efforts and close cooperation
would be maintained with ODM's Land Resources Division in Jos.
31.       Land classification of block farming areas would be undertaken
by photo-interpretation and ground survey, and marked onto overlay photo
maps of 1:5,000 scale. Cropping proposals, based on soil capability, would
reflect latest research findings and would draw heavily on experience gained
in mechanized and large farm operations elsewhere in Nigeria. Adoption
of soil conservation recommendations would be a precondition of receiving
tractor hire services from the project.
32.       Modified Tillage.  Perhaps the most pressing need for farming in
the area is for a more stabilized farming system which reduces or removes the
need for bush/fallowing, and a more effective system of weed control, parti-
cularly for spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) which is a problem in both
project areas. These problems will particularly confront mechanized farming
operations.
33.       Research attention is now being given to ways of reducing conven-
tional tillage through the use of herbicides and fast-growing cover crops to
smother weed growth. Under West African conditions, there are considerable
theoretical advantages of minimum tillage both to reduce tractor dependence
and to avoid disturbing the often fragile soils more than absolutely necessary.
Research at IITA has also shown that minimum tillage can effectively lower
soil temperatures during the early season when this is at or near the threshold
for seedling survival of crops such as maize.
34.       However, the practical potential of minimum tillage has still to be
verified both in terms of cost and effectiveness, and in the context of
farming systems based on ridging and mounding. The projects would closely
monitor these developments and incorporate field trials into the applied
research program as appropriate.
1/   The maps attached to Annex 1 (project area) of the respective appraisal
reports are based upon unpublished data collected by the Land Resources
Division in Jos.

1.        The two project areas have a sedentary cattle population of some
70,000 head out of a national total of some 11 million head. In addition,
there are some 76,000 goats, 56,000 sheep and 16,000 pigs in the area, to-
gether with large numbers of native poultry.
2.        There is no integration of crop and livestock farming in the proj-
ect areas; cattle ownership is almost entirely in the hands of the Fulani
pastoralists, and small stock of the agriculturists survive as scavengers
around the homestead and adjacent lands.
3.        There has been a significant increase in the resident cattle popu-
lation of the Plateau State over the last decade. This trend is likely
to accelerate as the Sahel and Sudan grazing areas continue to deteriorate
or are alienated by agriculturists. The role of the Lafia area in supplying
year-round grazing will become increasingly important. Trade stock passing
through the Ayangba area each year has been reduced because of the easier
routing now available by road and rail. This trend is expected to continue.
Thus as far as cattle is concerned, there is a large difference between the
project areas. In Lafia there is an Increasing demand for resident cattle and
a good potential for grazing reserves. This does not exist to the same degree
in Ayangba, and furthermore, the number of resident cattle is dimishing.
There are important trade routes which favor the Lafia project area, but
whatever trade routes existed in the Ayangba area (Makurdi-Idah), are now much
diminished in usage.
4.        Existing services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Re-
sources would be incorporated in the project. Thus under both projects
the veterinary services in the project areas which are presently not very
satisfactory would be improved. In addition, both projects would also under-
take to improve the small stock in the areas, mainly poultry; but some work on
goats and pigs would also be undertaken. The aim would be to have small stock
activities largely pay for themselves, either through a direct charge to
farmers or through sale by the project of produce obtained from these activ-
ities but not required for distribution to small-holders.
5.        Detailed proposals, including background information on cattle in
general, for the Lafia project are in Appendix 1; detailed proposals for the
Ayangba project are in Annex 3 attached to the appraisal report.

LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT IN LAFIA
A. General
1.        The project area has a sedentary livestock population estimated
at 60,000 cattle 37,000 goats, 36,000 sheep and 12,00 pigs. Migratory
Fulani herds, chiefly from Bauchi, Kaduna and Plateau States, enter the
division for dry season grazing. This annual influx numbers about 60,000
head but a proportion are en route to the Benue, Dep and Mada river flood
plains outside the division. Furthermore, some wet season resident herds
also move south for "fadama" grazing so that dry season cattle numbers are
increased by approximately 30,000 head.
2.        There has been a significant increase in the resident cattle
population over the last decade. This trend is likely to accelerate as
the Sahel and Sudan grazing areas continue to deteriorate or are alienated
by agriculturists.  The role of the division in supplying year-round
grazing will become increasingly important.
3.        Despite a high degree of motivation and competence displayed by
senior local staff, existing extension and disease control efforts are insuf-
ficient due to severe material, manpower and organizational deficiencies.
4.        Increases in agricultural production and population incomes have
resulted in a rising demand for livestock products. The development of a
service abattoir at Keffi in the short-term and the proposed national capital
near Abuja in the long-term will exacerbate this demand.
5.        Despite many restrictions on expanding livestock production, the
fundamental physical resources and technology are available. With an ex-
panded extension input this considerable potential could be exploited.
B. Cattle
Background
6.        Cattle population can only be estimated from Jangali (cattle tax),
vaccination and slaughter figures. Collection of Jangali has now been
rescinded but figures for the division 1970-74 show an average collection of
22,600 head. Jangali collection is recognized to be 30-80% effective. It
was collected from June to September and should represent wet-season-only



SUPPLEIIENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 2
resident cattle population. At 50% collection the total herd would be approx-
imately 45,000 but figures for the inoculation program in (October-March) 1973
indicate 47,000 head. Assuming an 80% turnout for inoculation, the total herd
would be approximately 59,000 head. Consideration of these figures and wet
season slaughter records at about 500/month (actual probably around 650/month)
indicate resident population to be approximately 60,000 head but increasing
annually.
7.        District livestock population figures are only indicative but show a
predominence of cattle in the Awe (45%), Obi (20%), and Assaikio Districts (15%)
while Keana and Lafia town each carry about 10% of total head. Doma district
is virtually empty of cattle in June, reflecting the recognized high tsetse
challenge in this area. Although districts vary in size and proportion of
land under agriculture, these figures illustrate the current importance of
Awe, Obi, Assaikio and Keana for wet season grazing, the likely tsetse distri-
bution, and their correlation with intended grazing reserves.
8.        The bulk of Nigeria's cattle population (variously estimated at
about 10 million head) has traditionally been located in less than 10% of the
total area, i.e., north of the 120 parallel. This concentration is the result
of historical, cultural and social factors, but the distribution of tsetse fly
has had profound influence in maintaining this imbalance. Traditionally, a
large proportion of the herd follow an annual north-south migration to seek
adequate grazing and water which become progressively deficient in the north
and available in the south following the dry season retreat of the tsetse.
However, the increasing alienation of northern land from grazing by expanding
agriculture, the control of major epidemic diseases such as rinderpest which
previously decimated the herds from time to time, and the recent protracted
Sahelian drought have led to serious overstocking and deterioration of
northern rangeland. The Government has adopted a variety of major programs
aimed at encouraging graziers to become more sedentary, particularly in the
more southerly areas where a longer growing season and greater pasture produc-
tion enable a higher year-round carrying capacity. These programs include the
national Tsetse Clearance Program, which is aimed at eradicating tsetse from
100,000 square miles in the Sudan and Northern Guinea Zones. The land freed is
being settled, partly by graziers under the provisions of the 1965 Grazing
Reserves Act which permits Government to set aside land for the exclusive use
of nomadic graziers. In an effort to stimulate this activity, the Government
has recently initiated an active program of relocation of the national herd
with a budget to 1980 of N 24 million.
9.        Meanwhile, the increased spread and settlement of southern cul-
tivators northwards into the Guinea Zone has resulted in increased bush
clearing, hunting and decline of native tsetse hosts, resulting in a decline
in the tsetse challenge to domestic livestock. A significant decrease in
the tsetse challenge is evident in the Lafia Division as large herds now
remain throughout the year, undertaking only local migration, often within
the division.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix 1

10.       The traditional livestock owners are nomadic Fulani who possess
herds of classical Zebu type which are well adapted to nomadic conditions,
exhibiting good trekking abilities, rapid compensatory growth and slow
sexual maturity. A high degree of lactation and nutrition anoestrus is
also probably typical, which is in keeping with nomadism and a seasonally
harsh environment, and may account for low calving percentages.
11.       Despite varying degrees of settlement or residence within the
Lafia Division, the basic cattle management system remains essentially
traditional and aims at exploiting the environment to the greatest short-
term advantage. Cattle movements are, therefore, conditioned primarily by
immediate range carrying capacity (and quality) and the availability of
suitable surface water, but the proximity of known or suspected diseased
cattle in trade stock will usually cause sudden abandonment of an otherwise
suitable location. Supplementary feeding is limited to salt and various
local mineral preparations. Crop residues are grazed after harvest and
pastoralists' cattle are generally welcomed by farmers for their manurial
value though occasionally farmers charge a fee for stubble grazing. There
is a tradition of tribal rivalry between Fulani and Tiv which is resulting
in increasing claims by cultivators against passing herdsmen. These claims
are frequently exaggerated and occasionally fraudulent. The tendency of
immigrant Tiv cultivators to settle in isolated scattered hamlets in other-
wise unfarmed areas further aggravates the problem.
12.       The quality and productivity of pastures in the Lafia Division are
generally high by northern standards, particularly in areas that have not been
farmed or overgrazed and burnt. However, the seasonality of grass growth
means that most pastures are undergrazed in the wet season resulting in rapid
maturation and deterioration to tall, fibrous growth by mid-August. It is
common practice to burn these areas as soon as possible in the dry season to
facilitate access and to induce a flush of growth on residual soil moisture.
This is achieved at the expense of plant reserves and encourages generally
inferior, fire-resistent species. Frequent 'cold' fires also tend to promote
regrowth and coppicing and lead to dense, short-scrub formation carrying
little grass, as is exemplified by the traditional dry season grazing area
south and east of Wuse. During the dry season, only crop residues and fadama
lands offer reasonable quality grazing, though these areas also exhibit
evidence of overgrazing. Current dry season weight gains are low to negative,
especially for cows with calves, but the shortness of this period and the
generally high and reliable annual rainfall facilitate attempts to increase
dry season pasture production and overall carrying capacity.
13.       Traditional cattle owners are frequently criticized because they
lack a commercial outlook. Herd size is undoubtedly important and the
Fulani's simple material demands can be met by relatively few cattle sales,
a situation which is aggravated by current rapid inflation in cattle prices.
Additional income is also gained by selling milk and milk products. M{ilk

vending is a major activity of the women and the major source of day-to-day
income for purchasing grains, cloth, etc. Herd productivity is generally
low. National calving rates are estimated at 40-50%, mortality is 10-20%
for calves and 4-10% for adults, and growth rate to slaughter maturity is
slow (4-5 years). Low turnoff is, therefore, a corollary of such low produc-
tion parameters, though there is still a strong tendency to increase herd size
against some future catastrophe. The relatively large herd size evident at
Lafia is indicative of improved production, especially higher calving rates,
lower mortality and a faster growth to maturity.
14.       Disease control measures by Government have been generally accepted
by Fulani but have not been accompanied by programs to improve animal nutri-
tion. Within the limitations of the existing system, particularly the lack of
rights of usufruct for graziers, the Fulani have developed a delicate manage-
rial balance with the environment; a detailed knowledge of grazing and water
conditions over a wide area, of cattle handling, disease avoidence and recog-
nition; and a skill at assessing their cattle's needs and the pasture quality.
15.       The considerable numbers of settled or semi-settled Fulani in
northern states and their generally positive response to vaccination and
treatment programs indicate that the traditional Fulani wanderlust is a
result of his concern for his cattle and their feed and water requirements.
The opportunities for improved cattle production in developing new management
systems under which an increasing degree of technical inputs can be applied
efficiently and practically are based on the Fulani and their cattle.
Diseases
16.       Tr7panosomiasis.  This disease has previously been a major restraint
on the development of a cattle industry in the division. Both G. Hlorsitans
and G. Longipalpis species of tsetse were evident in initial surveys in the
1940s. However, there has been a definite decline in the tsetse challenge
since that time so that now G. Morsitans is apparently no longer present
and G. Longipalpis concentrations are chiefly in the west, based on the Doma
Forest Reserve. The actual extent of tsetse decline and current status
cannot be accurately determined without proper surveys of the entire divi-
sion to determine fly population distribution and degree of infection.
Survey of the Doma forest early in 1976 indicated only G. Longipalpis present.
Fixed wing spraying of the reserve appears to have been only 80% effective.
17.       An estimate of the degree of challenge can be gained from the
number and infection rate of cattle in the area, particularly those resident
in the wet season. The high challenge in the Doma area is well recognized
by the Fulani who completely vacate the area by mid-June. The request for
tryps treatment (at N 0.1/head with Berenil) is not high (estimated at 250-300/
head/month). The inadequate veterinary coverage, the frequent shortage of
drugs, the operation of confidence men posing as veterinary staff and peddling



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 5
drug substitutes, and the resultant Fulani disillusionment with treatment, all
distort any real assessment of disease incidence from treatment frequency.
However, the increasing population of resident cattle and their apparently
good production indicates that trypanosomiasis is currently down to tolerable
limits as far as the Fulani, a disease-conscious people, are concerned.
18.       The greater grouping of cattle at high stocking rates that will
be a necessary adjunct to good grazing management on the reserves in the
wet season could lead to increased tsetsc challenge, although the reserves
are located in traditional wet season grazing areas where current challenge
is low. Furthermore, the ready access to diagnostic, treatment and pro-
phylaxis services on reserves should control the problem. If the Tsetse and
Trypanosomiasis Division of FDL detects a high challenge through their sur-
veys, an eradication program could be undertaken. However, the latter is
feasible only if natural barriers to fly re-invasion exist around the area in
which the eradication will take place.
19.       Rinderpest was formerly the most important epizootic disease of
cattle. It has been greatly reduced by an intra-African (OAU) cooperative
vaccination program (Government Program 15). Regular annual vaccinations
continue.
20.       Contagious Bovinue Pleuropneumonia.  Following increasing incidence
of the disease, despite a costly slaughter program, the Federal Government
adopted an eradication program based on vaccination (J.P. 28). Under the
scheme (unofficially operating since late 1971 though officially launched
in 1973), states are supplied free of charge with vaccine manufactured at
Vom. The disease is strongly associated with trade and migratory cattle
from Bornu region in the northeast where it is endemic and proving difficult
to eradicate. The greatest likelihood of outbreaks is, therefore, in the
Azara and Wuse regions.
21.       Streptothricosis is common in the area and no prevention or cure
is yet available. The most suitable control method is to eradicate carriers
and prevent skin damage by biting insects or rubbing. Spraying or dipping
for tick control appears to reduce incidence of this disease but is probably
associated with reduced biting fly attack as spraying is frequently carried
to extremes of twice a week. Supplying simple back-rubbers to the pasto-
ralists or encouraging them to construct their own, as well as supplying
suitable chemicals, warrants investigation.
22.       Brucellosis.  The status of this disease is difficult to estimate.
A Federal survey is currently being undertaken to assess frequency before
adopting a Federal campaign. Abortions are known to occur and severe oedaema
of knee joints of bulls is often noted, particularly in trade cattle. In
this wetter climate, with the increasingly dense animal concentrations to-
gether with persistence of open mating systems, the disease could rapidly
increase in frequency and be of economic importance. If no Federal program
is forthcoming a survey of frequency should be carried out within reserves
and if necessary a vaccination program of all weaner females with strain
19 should be adopted as a regular procedure.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 6
23.       Foot and mouth disease seems endemic to the area and outbreaks
occur about twice a year, chiefly in Awe and Azara Districts, particularly
in the dry season, and is again probably associated with migratory cattle.
The local cattle have a high degree of resistence and mortalities are low.
24.       Tuberculosis could become a problem with intensification.  Testing
is carried out by the veterinary division free of charge. Carcass inspection
at slaughter slabs indicates that incidence is low.
25.       Tick-borne diseases appear infrequently.  Only rudimentary treat-
ment is available with clinic hand sprays or in the form of cariscide provided
to Fulani who apply it to their animals with a cloth.
26.       Helminthiasis infection is widespread and aggravated by high humidity,
short dry season, concentrated herding at night camps and close fadama grazing
in the dry season. Incidence of liver fluke is similarly high. The debilitating
effect of these diseases, particularly on young stock, poses a major production
loss.
Trade Routes
27.       The project area lies on one of the major north-south trade routes.
Trade cattle (chiefly bulls) from Bauchi, Bornu, and Gongola States converge
at Wuse and then on via Yelwa entering there from the northeast, crossing
the Dep river at Wuse, then to Azara, Ribi, Adudu, Keana and out south of
the area by Makurdi to the southeastern markets. Some cattle avoid Makurdi
by crossing the Benue river at low points to the west. This route carries
about 2,800 head/month in the dry season and 1,800 head/month in the wet
season.
28.       Another lesser route (about 140/month) branches off this major
route at Yelwa and goes via Shendam to Assaikio, crossing the Dep river,
then onto Lafia and west to Nasarawa joining main northern routes from
Akwanga and southern Niger State at Keffi and leading onto Umaisha, Lokoya
and major urban markets of southwest. This route is expected to become
dominant once the Dep River Bridge is completed and hence avoid the difficult
swim at Wuse. The bulk of the cattle would swing south from Assaikio towards
Obi and Keana through to Makurdi. A third and minor route (about 120/month
in dry season) branches off the major route serving Jos Plateau, Bauchi and
Kaduna States at Akwanga and moves south through Lafia, Agyarako and Kodarko
through to Makurdi.
29.       Control Posts.  Currently ther are no control posts in the Lafia
Division although one is planned for Lafia within the 1976/77 State budget,
which would enable a record to be kept of cattle originating in Lafia Division.



SUPPLEXENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 7
30.       Check points are also absent although a Livestock Assistant has
recently been stationed at the river crossing at Wuse to record cattle
numbers and check permits. Frequent encroachment of cultivators onto or
proximate to trade routes poses a continual challenge to traders' safe
and unhindered passage.
Marketing and Slaughter
31.       Crude slaughter slabs are maintained at every village though meat
inspection can be carried out only at major centers (chiefly Lafia). Although
records of small animal slaughterings are probably very unreliable, cattle
numbers are reasonably accurate and probably represent about 80% of total.
Strong butcher cartels exist, particularly in Lafia where about 50% of total
cattle slaughterings occur. Here 100 butchers operate, with only 20 senior
butchers actually slaughtering an average of 10 head/day. Butchers buy direct
from Fulani (and traders) through a network of employed buyers throughout the
area and they have a facility at Lafia to hold and fatten cattle, so regulat-
ing the number slaughtered and the supply of meat onto the market. Butchers
also give some cattle out with resident Fulani in groups of 5-20 head for
contract herding, payment being made in kind or by mineral and salt supple-
ments. Senior butchers, particularly the master butcher (a hereditary post),
sell a large proportion of their turnover to other butchers at a negotiated
margin. These then allocate each carcass amongst themselves in proportion to
their capacity to pay. Similarly, the senior butcher gives credit in kind to
apprentices who retail sheep and goat meats. A new slaughter facility includ-
ing roof, carcass hoist, cutting-up table and running water is planned for
Lafia within the Third National Development Plan.
32.       Contrary to the commonly-held belief that Fulani are reluct to sell,
the generally low proportion of mature bulls in surveyed herds (9%) indicates
that turnoff is near its potential at current production parameters and static
herds. Furthermore, many trade cattle are semimature males that could be
further grown out. More than twice as many males as females are slaughtered
indicating that a rapid breeder-herd build-up could be occuring, though the
trade cattle figures for Lafia Division that will become available from the
proposed Lafia control post will provide a more reliable assessment.
33.       Cattle and meat prices are considerably lower than around major
centers, even to the north. Price/kilo liveweight is approximately N 0.5-0.6
but varies somewhat with fleshing, e.g.:
(i) four-year-old mature bull in good condition (420 kg), N 220-240
or N 0.52-0.57/kilo liveweight;
(ii) aged cull cow, poor condition (250 kg), N 110-120 or N 0.44-
0.48/kilo.



SUPPLE?MENT 4

Mixed Farming and Draft Oxen
34.       While few draft oxen exist in the area as yet, they are signi-
ficant examples of a considerable potential. A number of farmers exhibit
a genuine interest in owning and rearing cattle, utilizing bush grazing
and crop residues. The practice of village youth laboring with a Fulani
family for a year and being paid in kind, usually a heifer, has led to an
increasing interest and expertise in cattle rearing in certain farming
communities, e.g., Wuse, Awe.
35.       In the more densely populated and farmed areas a potential exists
to encourage short-term fattening operations (e.g., five months). The exist-
ing fattening scheme of the Lafia butchers involves day grazing within four
miles of Lafia on crop residues and grassland and a daily supplement of
branmash at a central night camp close to the town. The operation is run
by Fulani employees.
36.       A declining number of Dwarf Muturu cattle occur in association
with Tiv cultivators, particularly around Obi.  These cattle are allowed
to scavenge freely, the Tiv having a tradition of little interest or
management skill with livestock. Because of low productivity (particularly
calving rates and calf and weaner growth rates) they hold little potential
for increased exploitation in a mixed farming system. Their only advantage
is a degree of trypanosomiasis tolerance but the apparently low challenge,
particularly in farming areas, and the existence of adequate prophylaxis and
treatment reduces the importance of this characteristic. In Benue State,
there is a breeding ranch for N'Dama cattle at Raav which is outside the
Ayangba project area. There is a demand for N'Dama in the more tsetse-
infested areas to the south and west but this breed is inferior to the
White Fulani for beef and milk production relevant to the Lafia area.
37.       The requirement for draft oxen is currently unknown, two units
only being in use at Awe where interest in acquiring further plows and
oxen is high and probably associated with heavy fadama soils used in rice
cultivation. Experience in the Northern Agricultural Development Projects
and in the Chad Basin indicates that the demand for plows and a pair of
oxen is almost unlimited. It offers the most practical means of introducing
livestock to agriculturists; but see also Supplement 3 on farm mechaniza-
tion.
Development Potential
38.       Following the largely effective control of epizootic cattle diseases
in Nigeria, the emphasis must turn increasingly towards expanding production.
Production can be improved by increasing the turnoff numbers (i.e., increasing
calving and weaning rates) and the turnoff weight (i.e., rates of gain to
high liveweight at slaughter).



SUPPLEMEENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 9
39.       The deterioration of traditional tsetse-free northern rangeland
and its use for purposes other than cattle raising highlight the relative
potential of more southerly Guinea Savanna areas as locations where this
production improvement is most possible.
40.       The extension of tsetse eradication into this ecological zone,
the apparent natural reduction in tsetse challenge and the existence of
suitable treatment and prophylaxis removes the major limiting factor to
livestock development in the middle region.
41.       The long growing season of at least eight months, the relatively
high and reliable rainfall and the generally high status of existing
rangeland, particularly in areas selected for establishing grazing re-
serves, indicates that reasonably high animal performance should be
possible.
42.       Areas selected are currently relatively free of cultivators and
would pose few compensation and resettlement difficulties. However, the
farming community is expanding rapidly and the opportunity to establish
suitable reserves will diminish equally rapidly.
43.       Areas of deteriorated rangeland, due to overgrazing and frequent
light burns with resultant invasion of unsuitable grass species and accent-
uated bush coppicing, are evident, particularly in the extreme east. However,
this area is unlikely to be in demand for agriculture due to its soil type and
its relative isolation and the fact that it has long been a major dry-season
grazing area. Enclosure and management offer an opportunity to arrest this
deterioration and eventually to improve the reserve.
44.       Grazing Reserves.  Increased veterinary coverage, particularly
for internal and external parasite control, reproductory disease and try-
panosomiasis, would undoubtedly have a major impact on herd productivity.
In addition, pasture management in the form of heavy wet-season stocking
to maintain pastures in a quality state, fire control to prevent fodder
wastage and range deterioration, and a controlled plan of strategic burning
for regrowth control together with light grazing after fresh burns, would
have a major impact on the nutritional value of the reserve and on herd
productivity.
45.       However, these measures are not compatible with nomadism.  Develop-
ment must, therefore, aim at settled herds in the long-term and eventually
even the possession of some form of leasehold land title to encourage
pastoralist involvement and responsibility for the status of the reserve and
promote the evolution of commercial attitudes towards individual ownership,
turnoff and profitability.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix I
Page 10
46.       In the short-term, significant production improvements can be
made by small innovations and development. Delineation of grazing reserves
so that pastoralists have security of grazing rights and to prevent ingress
of cultivation is a prerequisite. Offering an attractive package of good
grazing and water supplies, veterinary services, marketing outlets and
simple human requisites such as a clinic is likely to encourage Fulani to
register their entry into the reserve.
47.       Although three of the four proposed reserves have dry season fadama
grazing within their boundaries, the full contingent of wet season stock could
not be carried through the dry season. Dry season r'angeland carrying capacity
must also be improved but initially migration out of the reserves (and often
out of Lafia Division) must be allowed in the dry season. Conditions must be
sufficiently attractive to induce a large-scale return to the reserve in the
wet season for reasons of pasture management and disease surveillance.
48.       There is little doubt that strong social and economic reasons exist
for establishing grazing reserves or that the practical technology and the
physical resources exist to support their function. However, in the final
analysis, the successful development of a grazing reserve system must depend
on the strength, practicality and sensitivity of the extension effort.
49.       Trade Routes.  Any attempt to monitor and improve cattle production
within the area must include veterinary involvement and responsibility for the
trade routes through the project area. The improvement of the trade route
system to enable surveillance and control of disease, reduce wastage and
offtake and to rationalize marketing Is an integral segment of any overall
livestock development program.
50.       Although improvements within the Lafia Division are relatively
insignificant nationally, the area does contain major national routes. Any
progress towards exposing the need for delineated, serviced routes and
publicizing their function is extremely valuable.
51.       The survey and delineation of routes can be rationalized so as not
to conflict with the development of grazing reserves or other land use.
C. Small Stock
52.       Both West African Dwarf sheep and goat breeds are dominant in the
project areas though some tall sheep are associated with migratory Fulani
pastoralists.
53.       Unlike cattle, the official figures for sheep and goat population
show a significant decline over the period 1970-73. Sheep population
apparently declined by more than 80%, and goat population by more than 16%
over this period. This decline may be due to rapidly increasing human



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix I
Page 11
population, increasing incomes and sharply rising beef prices resulting in
heavy pressure being thrown on the small animal population for meat supply
(pig population has apparently remained static, however). Sheep meat
prices are now high at N 2.00-2.50 per kilo and may reflect this market
situation. There is also a definite consumer preference for sheep meat
over goat meat though goat meat prices are only slightly lower.
54.       The distribution of sheep and goats is very uneven in Lafia Division:
70% of sheep and 60% of goats occur in the Obi District and only 10% of each
in Lafia and Assaikio Districts, the next largest concentration. Official
slaughter figures for small animals are also very inaccurate but indicate Obi
must be a major source for other parts of the division, particularly Lafia.
55.       Current management practices are virtually nil, sheep and goats
scavenging freely. Although helminthiasis and especially liver fluke are
constant delibitating factors, the major disease is a serious infectious
and contagious disease of unknown origin called "kata". The disease exhi-
bits symptoms of rinderpest though animals usually die of pneumonia. It
has a high morbidity and mortality if animals are moved from another area
or herded together in large flocks. Previous attempts to establish intensive
goat farms have met with massive mortalities. No effective treatment is
known. Enteritis can also cause serious losses, particularly in young
stock at the onset of the rains.
56.       The pig population is relatively stationary at around 12,000
head. The majority are found in Obi district (80%) and Awe district (12%).
They are usually associated with Christian and pagan cultivators. Official
slaughter figures (only 600/year for Lafia) indicate most slaughterings
occur outside official scrutiny and probably approximate 5,000/year. At
this level, they contribute significantly to meat supply and relieve
pressure on the sheep and goat population. Usual pig meat price is about
N 1.00/kilo.
57.       The local pigs are small, active, carry little fat and survive
entirely by scavenging. Their litter size is normally low (4-6) but they
are reported to be well adapted and disease resistant.
58.       Local poultry, although numerous and hardy, are small and lay only
40-60 small eggs/year. They cross well with exotic breeds and the results
of a small but effective State-run cockerel exchange program, based on day-
old chicks reared to five months and issued to farmers, are generally good.
Development Potential
59.       Until "kata" disease is controlled there is little potential for
intensifying goat or sheep production and management inputs on a large
scale. However, a regular and strategic treatment program for helminthiasis,
particularly in lambs and pregnant or nursing ewes, would increase growth
rates and survival.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix 1

60.       A program for the construction of containment stables for 2-6
animals woul-d assist in disease control and in the conduct of improved
management practices. These would be simple roofed structures, built
of bamboo above ground, with slatted floors to control disease and to
facilitate manure collection. Once contained in this fashion, improved
management inputs can be used in the form of disease control, balanced
feeding, culling and selective mating. Such a system could equally be
applied to goats. However, the additional labor requirements and the
current low value of manure (due to high fertilizer subsidy) may limit
acceptance.
61.       Although Large White and Landrace breeds of pigs are available for
crossbreeding from State farms at Jos and Vom, and the State provides loans
to farmers to start pig keeping, there is very little farmer demand in the
project areas. Some individual attempts to utilize improved breeds have
met with failure due to disease. The level of management necessary to gain
the advantages of improved genotype is inapplicable at this stage and the
local breed is best suited to local conditions.
62.       The improved cockerel exchange program has met with very wide
acceptance and could be greatly expanded, the major bottleneck at present
being the centers' capacity to hold the pullet section as laying birds.
Although purchasing sexed chicks (cockerels only) would avoid this problem,
an exchange program that includes pullets will have a greater effect on
production. The efficacy of the program could be further improved by
identifying and possibly reducing the cause of the 20-25% mortality in
exchanged birds.  A basic extension effort to encourage greater use of
supplementary feed to poultry, particularly rice bran, and a supply of
suitable watering facilities is fundamental to increased production.
D. Development Proposals
Grazing Reserves
63.       The objectives of establishing grazing reserves are:
(i)  to secure land strictly for use by pastoralists and their
herds by indirectly controlling the settlement and expansion
patterns of immigrant and established cultivators;
(ii)  to create a system in which modern production methods and
concepts could be effectively introduced to the traditional
sector including a basis for the eventual development of
group or individual title to grazing lands and responsibility
for their maintenance.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix 1
Page 13
64.       Attainment of these objectives would involve:
(i) surveying and delineating grazing reserve boudaries so that
they could eventually be gazetted;
(ii)  delineating internal grazing management units or blocks based
on the land system and management factors and each capable of
carrying a similar number of cattle;
(iii) providing grazing and treatment rights to those pastoralists
who elect to join the reserve. This would include a system
of registration and enumeration of each herd and would carry
an implied willingness to accept management directives from
reserve staff;
(iv)  providing adequate dry season water and undertaking extensive
improvement to rangeland productivity, particularly dry season
pasture quality;
(v) providing comprehensive veterinary coverage, suitable handling
facilities, necesssary nutritional supplements and herd manage-
ment advice;
(vi)  maintaining detailed records of herd size, composition, and pro-
duction, and developing a measure of rangeland performance on
which to base future management policies and further reserve
development;
(vii) assisting in the development of suitable market outlets for
both animal and milk products;
(viii)  enabling and encouraging pastoralist participation in usual
social services, e.g, health care and education; and
(ix)  encouraging the identification or association of each family
or group with a particular grazing unit to foster the
development of responsibility for range quality, facilities,
fire, etc.
65.       Four suitable areas for grazing reserves have been identified.  All
include light or nil cultivation so that minimum disruption and compensation
to cultivators will be necessary. Tentative boundaries discussed with the
traditional authorities are shown on the map attached to the appraisal report.
The approximate area in each reserve and the project year development begins
is as follows:



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix I
Page 14
(1)  Keana Reserve              29,000 hectares           Year 1
(ii)  Assaikio Reserve           24,300 hectares           Year 2
(iii)  Awe Reserve                47,000 hectares           Year 3
(iv)  Wuse Reserve               36,400 hectares           Year 3
66.       The Keana, Assaikio and Awe reserves are already major grazing
areas for resident cattle while the Wuse reserve is part of a heavily-grazed,
traditional dry season area for migratory cattle and has deteriorated due to
over-grazing and frequent firing.
67.       Each reserve would have resident management and development staff
housed at a base unit or headquarters where cattle handling facilities,
consisting of yards, crush, plunge-dip, holding paddocks, scales, and loading
ramp, together with store room, workshop, clinic and mobile UPE 1/ base, would
also be located.
68.       This base unit would be serviced by an all-weather road and would
serve as a nucleus for management, venue for sales and markets and terminus
for transport to and from villages outside the reserve.
69.       The Grazing Unit (GU) would be the basic unit within the reserve and
would be an area capable of carrying about 2,000 head in the wet season.
Improvement staffing and services would be allocated according to the needs of
the Grazing Unit and would include:
Water facilities - one 6-10,000 cubic meter earth dam for each GU
Stock handling   - one set of yards with crush, plunge-dip and
ramp per three GU's
Staff            - Grazing Control Officer (GL 06) per GU assisted
by one laborer
- Reserve Ranger (GL 07) per three GU's
- Range Management Officer (GL 13) per grazing
reserve.
70.       The Grazing Control Officer (GCO) would maintain direct contact with
pastoralists, would be the communications channel between them and manage-
ment and vice versa, and would actively participate in all husbandry and
management procedures initiated by the reserve management. Reserve Rangers
would supervise three GCO's each and would be responsible for implementing all
range management, husbandry and veterinary activities on the 6,000 head
involved. The Range Management Officer would be charged with overall super-
vision and coordination of entire reserve management, implementing develop-
ment plans, initiating all husbandry procedures, marketing outlets, etc.
1/   Universal Primary Education.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Appendix I

71.       St,rict registration of cattle entering and leaving each GU would
be essential and would comprise a record of herd size and numbers in each
class, and production data. An annual vaccination program would be imple-
mented together with trypanosomiasis treatment or prophylaxis depending on
surveyed tsetse challenge and experience. A program of strategic dipping for
tick control and treatment for helminthiasis would be undertaken.
72.       Grazing conditions, veterinary coverage and sympathetic extension
would be of such an order as to positively encourage graziers to join the
reserve in sufficient numbers in the wet season to enable heavy wet season
grazing for maintenance of pasture quality throughout the wet season. On
current estimates about 30% of wet season stock must vacate the reserve in the
dry season. The numbers and the individuals to leave would have to be clari-
fied well in advance by discussion between GCO and pastoralists. Keana has
particularly acute dry season problems because of the absence of any fadama
grazing, but it is proximate to large amounts of stubble and bush/fallow
grazing to north and east.
73.       Grassland development would involve better management of existing
pastures; strip sowing and the introduction of improved grass species are not
contemplated at this stage.
74.       Marketing developments would aim at increasing returns to pastor-
alists, increasing market knowledge and rationalizing turnoff to culling
policy, grazing and seasonal conditions. Regular sales could be held at the
base unit where both butchers and graziers could become familiar with sale by
weight and sale stock could be trucked out.
75.       The traditional sale of milk and milk products would be made
possible by encouraging and organizing the establishment of regular com-
mercial transport services to and from major adjacent villages and markets.
76.       Offtake will increase principally in response to increased calving,
weaning and growth rates and reduction of deaths due to disease. By limiting
specific graziers to specific areas with a mutually agreed maximum carrying
capacity, a degree of pressure would be brought to bear to stimulate turnoff.
Similarly, by an extension effort through the GCO, encouragement would be
given to sell all diseased or non-breeding animals.
77.       Once the benefits of the reserve are seen to be clearly recognized
by the Fulani, a mutually negotiated and agreed per head fee could be levied
to help pay for services and inputs supplied by the reserve. This fee could
best be paid in kind at an agreed price per kilogram liveweight and be payable
at the end of the wet season.

78.       Cost estimates are in Table 1, herd projections in Table 2, model
herd composition in Table 3, valuations in Table 4, and cost/benefits of
grazing reserves in Table 5.
Trade Routes
79.       The objective of establishing trade routes is to develop permanent
facilities that will enable full control of trade cattle movement, disease
surveillance and treatment and reduced production loss en route by: (i)
providing suitable cattle handling facilities at check points on all entry
points of routes into the project area, and adequate, staff and equipment for
thorough disease surveillance, treatment, dipping and recording, (ii)
providing clearly delineated routes free of farmer encroachment or harass-
ment, and (iii) providing at regular intervals night camps with containment
and water facilities and good grazing.
80.       The routes would be developed in successive years beginning with
the Wuse-Abudu-Keana route in Year 1. Both Assaikio-Obi-Keana and Lafia-
Kodarko would be developed in the second year.
81.       Routes would be surveyed preliminary to initiating formal gazetting
procedures and delineated with chained and raked line about 30 meters wide.
The perimeter of night camps (about 100 hectares) would also be cleared as
would water and camp sites.
82.       Night camps would be perimeter fenced, and would contain dams or
wells with- pump, tank and troughing. A hut would house the resident pump
attendant who would double as supervisor and guard.
83.       Check points would be developed after but adjacent to the river
crossings at Wuse, Assaikio and a control post at Lafia. They would involve
yards, crush, plunge-dip and ramp, and would be associated with the usual
night stop facility which would be further subdivided to enable separation
of mobs and short-term isolation. Staff other than pump attendants and guards
would be based at nearby Farmers Service Centers at Assaikio, Azara and Lafia,
and would consist of a GCO and two laborers.
84.       Cost estimates are in Table 6.
Poultry Upgrading
85.       The objective would be to attempt a high degree of saturation
with improved cockerels and pullets throughout the project area so as to in-
crease meat and egg production.
86.       The project would establish a Poultry Rearing Unit based in Lafia
town.  Day-old, unsexed, vaccinated chicks would be purchased from the NLMA
hatchery at Jos or from one of a number of commercial hatcheries in the south.

Chicks would be raised to five months before exchange for village poultry, al-
lowing a period for adaption before sexual maturity. Rearing capacity would
be 10,000 chicks per year, enabling an output of 9,000 birds/year for exchange
after allowing time for cleaning and disinfection between batches and a 10%
mortality.
87.       Pullet and cockerel distribution would be on an exchange basis
though a 20% bonus would be offered to villages that agreed to a complete
exchange of either sex of local poultry. The high demand likely to be
enjoyed by the program enables certain conditions of improved management
(e.g., water supply and supplementary feeding) to be a condition on those
entering the scheme. All stock would undergo a minimum of two weeks limited
free range prior to release to enhance adaptation. All birds received by
the project during the exchange operations would be sold at prevailing market
prices possibly after a short fattening period on limited free range, during
which they would run with the next batch of exchange birds. No egg produc-
tion per se I/ would be undertaken but the unit would concentrate its efforts
on exchange and extension to increase survival and production of exchanged
birds.
88.       Cost estimates are in Table 7.
Smallholder Fattening of Draft Oxen
89.       The objective would be to encourage and assist agriculturists
wishing to procure cattle for draft and/or fattening purposes so as to
enable an integrated and balanced approach to cattle development, and would:
(i) provide a credit and extension package for agriculturists
to procure and run cattle;
(ii) provide an outlet for store, cull or "fee" cattle turnoff
from grazing reserves;
(iii) introduce agriculturists to the benefits of a mixed farming
system;
(iv) utilize the large body of crop residues, bush/fallow and by-
products associated with the agricultural system; and
(v) improve production by helping to ensure slaughter cattle
are as near to optimum weight as possible.
90.       The program would be directed to progressive farmers and preferably
to those with access to some cattle experience who would agree to adopt certain
1/   Some egg production might be undertaken to provide additional revenue,
which, together with sales of old birds, would cover the costs of the
poultry units.

management practices. A high level of supervision would be required at the
outset including practical demonstration of the use of draft oxen. The latter
are likely to find greatest initial application on the heavy soils in rice
growing areas, e.g., Awe.
91.       Cattle would be issued in groups of 2-5 depending on cattle supply
and the individual's credit worthiness. Farmers must have suitable shaded
stalls and would be encouraged to organize themselves into small groups with
up to 25 head for day grazing under supervision whenever suitable grazing is
available. Credit would be provided for cattle, veterinary expenses and
mineral supplements and would be included with insurance backup, marketing
assistance and a specific sale contract in an all-inclusive package.
92.       Cattle would be stall fed at night and whenever quality grazing was
scarce. Use would be made of crop reserves, mill by-products (particularly
rice bran) and small plot plantings of fertilized pennisetum. The establish-
ment of perennial stylosonthes in first year bush/fallows, to provide better
quality grazing or cut fodder and to reduce "imperata" invasion, could become
a condition of credit, with seed provided in the package. The length of
the fattening period has been estimated at ten months but in practice could
vary with the season of purchase, though it is unlikely to exceed this figure.
Draft oxen could be funded on an annual or biennial basis to ensure one
trained animal was always available.
93.       Butcher Fattening.  A general extension effort would be aimed at
expanding and improving the existing butcher fattening and holding program
so as to maximize slaughter weights and to increase butchers' capacity to
absorb seasonal market oversupply without seriously affecting price.
94.       A partial budget for smallholder fattening is given in Table 6.
Livestock Extension Unit
95.       In addition to the above all existing services of the Livestock
Division within the area would become the responsibiliy of the LEU, including
meat and hide inspection and handling, and compulsory inoculation programs.
The latter would be undertaken by a mobile team of verterinary staff that
would use strategically located FSCs as field bases. These would provide
accommodation, drug storage and refrigeration facilities.
96.       The LEU would provide specialist advice to any farmer wishing to
undertake commercial livestock production. With a long-term objective of
encouraging mixed farming, it is intended that responsibility for routine
management advice be gradually assumed by the General Extension Services and
supported by LEU advisers. To this end the LEU would include basic husbandry
training for extension staff in its training program. Livestock training
would initially be aimed at turning out practically-oriented Grazing Control
Officers and Livestock Assistants for reserves, routes and general extension.
97.       Capital and recurrent costs for LEU are given in Table 9 and a
summary of total costs of the Livestock Development Section is given in
the respective appraisal report.

SUPPLEMENT 5
NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
FORESTRY
A. The Sector
1.        An assessment of the Forestry Sector is contained in the following
Bank documents:
-    Agricultural Sector Survey, Nigeria, Report
PA-115(a), dated January 26, 1973 (see Volume
II, Annex 5);
-    West Africa Forestry Sector Study, Report
1114-WA (MR), dated March 30, 1976; and,
-    Industrial Development Prospects in Nigeria,
Report 310 - UNI, dated January 4, 1974
(see Volume II).
This section summarizes the main features and some important aspects of the
sector, which are dealt with in more detail in the earlier reports, and up-
dates information regarding recent changes in forestry development emphasis
and forest management.
2.        Forest Resource.  Up to the present time, virtually all timber
used in the country has been harvested from the natural forests and savanna
woodlands. These have undergone progressive depletion over time by incursions
for agriculture, grazing and plantation crops, fellings for local requirements
for buildings and fuelwood and commercial exploitation of valuable timber
species. Review of the Bank reports and current UNDP/FAO studies indicates
that there is a progressive decline in the rate of natural regeneration
of the forests and savannas in relation to the increasing demand function
for forest products and a progressively declining area under tree cover, which
is resulting in an absolute decline in the growing stock. In aggregate
terms, this situation holds for all forest products. With firewood, for
example, while there appears to be an abundance of scrub savanna to meet
local requirements in many areas, there are severe shortages in the bigger
townships and many thousands of tons of fuelwood are being transported an-
nually over distances exceeding 160 km (100 miles) radius around, e.g.,
Kaduna, Jos and Makurdi, which is progressively depleting the surrounding
resource base. The position is similar elsewhere in the country. The general
shortage of straight durable poles is a contraint on the quality of local
housing and buildings and development of transmission lines for electrification

and telephones. Commercial exploitation of the forests is progressively
depleting the stock of merchantable species and recent estimates by a joint
Federal Department of Forestry (FDF)/FAO team indicate that a vigorous pro-
gram of man-made plantations will be needed to meet future domestic demand
beyond the 1980s.
3.        The Federal Military Government (FMG) has placed an embargo on
the export of all logs and manufactured forest products in order to con-
serve existing resources, and through FDF is expanding State Forestry
Department activities in forest plantations development.
4.        The quality and extent of the existing forests is related to the
natural vegetation zones and the degree of exploitation which has taken
place. A simplistic portrayal of the different types of Nigerian forestry
resources is given in the map attached to this supplement, which was pre-
pared by the Savanna Forestry Research Station (SFRS) and which classifies
the country into various zones of broadly similar characteristics as fol-
lows:
Sudan Savanna   NW, N, and NE as far south          Natural vegetation profoundly
as Yelwa in the west, Rano in    modified by extensive culti-

around the major towns, and

shade, fruit and fuelwood.

Derived Savanna   Transition zone between the   Originally high forests which
rain forests of the south      have been mainly cleared for
and the S. Guinea zone.         rotating cultivation; tall
savanna grasses colonize the
abandoned cultivation areas
during the fallow period and
carry fierce fire, killing out
regeneration of the high forest
species and permitting only
fire-tolerant savanna species
to survive. Small patches of
original high forest remain.
Rain Forests,      Coutinuous belt between the   Complex high forest with

to as High         coastal mangrove swamps.        2250 mm (60 and 90 inches),
Forests)                                           containing some 600 different
species, of which 100 to 130
are economically valuable.
These are the richest resource;
initial logging of the remain-
ing forests is expected to be
completed before year 2000.
5.        Forest Estate.  Within the various zones, forest reserves were es-
tablished earlier in the century with the objective of bringing selected
areas under systematic management for protection and production. These re-
serves which represent about 10% of the total land area contain the major
remaining forest resource. Many of the reserves, particularly those outside
the rain forests, are protection forests in steep and shallow soil areas,
with little or no productive function. Present data on the stocking den-
sities of the reserves are sparse and inadequate and an ongoing FDF/UNDP/FAO
project 1/ is assembling inventory data covering the major resources in the
Derived savanna and rain forest zones and also producing vegetation coverage
data for the whole country. Forest reserve areas are summarized in Table 1.
6.        In previous years, a significant proportion of commercial timber
was harvested from forests and woodlands outside the forest reserves. This
resource has now been mainly exploited and is now contributing only some 20%
to total annual fellings. Supply of commercial timber from this source is
expected to be exhausted within the next decade or so. However, these con-
tinue to be the main supply areas for fuelwood, which is by far the largest
product of the forests.

7.        Forest Plantations.  The major development has taken place in the
forest reserves of the high forests; data for plantation development in the
savanna areas are not available except for Plateau and Benue States (see
para 28 and subsequent paras), but the latter are not extensive. Records
for the high forest areas indicate that up to 1974, some 80,000 ha had been
cleared for planting, about 55,000 ha of which was cleared during 1966 to
1974 and most of the remainder during 1951 to 1965. The actual area success-
fully planted is not known and is likely to be far less. FDF have carried
out a recent aerial survey of a selected area of pulpwood plantations for the
proposed Iwopin pulpmill which indicated that only about 50% of the recorded
area was actually planted and that poor stocking occurred in the planted area.
Plantations before 1950 (about 3,000 ha recorded) are mainly composed of in-
digenous hardwood including mahogany (Khaya species) and obeche (Triplochiton).
Between 1951 and 1965, teak (Tectona grandis) and Gmelina aborea were intro-
duced on a larger scale and these species account for over 60% of the area
planted during 1966 to 1974. Teak is favored because it is expected to have
a shorter rotation (some 60 years) than the traditional hardwood (e.g., ma-
hogany, 80 years). A problem of butt rot (Rigidoporus iignosus) has occurred
and is presently being closely monitored by the Federal Institute of Forest
Research (FIFR). This is estimated to be affecting some 5% of the trees
planted. A curative treatment is possible if infection can be identified in
the early stages, otherwise the disease is fatal to the crop. Gmelina is
being extensively planted for pulpwood. Plantation data are summarized in
Appendix 1.
8.        The Savanna Forestry Research Station (SFRS) at Samaru was estab-
lished under a joint Federal Government/UNDP/FAO project in the 1960s to
consolidate earlier pioneer work and develop techniques for plantation de-
velopment in the northern States. FAO involvement terminated earlier this
year and the station is continuing under the direct management of FIFR. The
project has been successful in developing introductory trials of fast grow-
ing species and establishment techniques at the nearby plantations at Afaka,
and these have a potential for application over a wide area of the savanna
zones. FIFR operate another research station at Kano and are undertaking
the establishment of substations to Samaru in the NE, Middle Belt and
Mambilla Plateau in the SE, to set up introductory trials along similar
lines.
9.        Production, Consumption and Projected Demand.  The FAO Year Book3
of Forest Products 1975 records total roundwood production as 45 million m
in 1962 rising to 60 milliSn m in 1973, of which firewood is recorded as 43
million m and 57 million m respectively. There is some doubt as to the ac-
curacy of the data.
10.       A 1970 study 1/ carried out by the UNDP/FA0 Savanna Forestry Re-
search Station project, estimated local annual production for the "Savanna
Areas," composed of the Sudan, N. and S. Guinea, Jos and Derived Savanna
zones, with a population of about 35 million, as follows:

equals consumption of
these products in
"Savanna Zone."
11.       The ongoings FDF/UNDP/FAO High Forest Development Project has pro-
duced an interim report 1/ of industrial roundwood production in 1974 and
projected demand for forest based products up to 1990. These data are sum-
marized in Table 2.  The forecasts of future domestic demand are acknowledged
to be optimistic and are related to the relatively high growth in GDP which
has taken place over the past four years and is forecasted to continue over
the next plan period and beyond.
12.       Forest Industries.  With the exception of two or three larger saw-
mills, (e.g., the Northern Nigerian Timber Corporation Sawmill at Ochaja,
Benue State) and small township sawmills in the savanna zones, which resaw
to dimension sizes timber balks produced by local pit sawyers, the major
forest-based industries are concentrated in the high forest zone. Indus-
tries include some 400 sawmills, 4 plymills, a small blockboard plant, pre-
fabricated housing and several match factories. There is one paper mill at
Jebba, with a production of 14,000 tons/year, presently operating on imported
pulp and recycled waste paper. Minor industries of the Sudan and Guinea
zones include gum arabic production from Acacia senegal, tannins produced
from Acacia milotica and shea butter produced from Butyrospermum paradoxum.
13.       The sawmilling industry is predominantly composed of small-scale
units operating with one or two CD5 type band-saw headrigs with overall aver-
age production of 1900 m3 sawn-timber at 250 x 8 hour shifts/year and average
employment of 17.3 men/mill. Total production in 1974 was estimated at
847,000 m3(sawn). In addition to this volume, it is estimated pit sawyers
produced about 85,000 m3/year, mainly in the Guinea Savanna zones and S.E.
State. The distribution of sawmilling production is summarized in Table 3.
14.       The largest plymill, with a capacity of 33,000 m3/year, and the
blockboard plant, are operated by the African Timber and Plywood Co. (AT & P)
at Sapele and integrated with one of the larger sawmills in the country.
There are two plymills with capacities of 11,000 m3/year, one at Piedmonte
near Benin with a private Italian company participation, and the other at
Epe, Lagos State, operated by the Swiss-Nigerian Plywood Co. The fourth mill
is situated at Calabar, Cross River State, with a capacity of 1,000 m3/year

and producing only veneers; this is reported to be now wholly State-owned
with the former US partners terminating their interests. There is cur-
rently no production of particle board or fiber board although imports of
the latter are around 12,000 tons/year.
15.       Expansion plans for the mechanical wood-using industries include:
-    increasing the capacities of the Piedmonte and
Calabar plymills by a further 10,000 m3/year each;
-    constructing a particle board mill of 32,000 tons/year
capacity at the AT & P Sapele complex;
-    constructing a further particle board mill in Lagos
by private sector;
-    constructing two integrated industries including
sawmill/plymill/particle board, one in Ondo State
and the other in Calabar, Cross River State, by
joint venture between Rumanian/State Governments.
16.       Pulp and Paper.  Recent estimates of consumption carried out by
the ongoing FDF/UNDP/FAO project, 1/ summarized in Table 4, indicate total
consumption of 90,000 tons in 1972, 106,000 tons in 1973 and 122,000 tons
in 1974, based on production at the Jebba mill of 14,000 tons/year and im-
portation of the balance. The estimate for 1972 is some 30,000 tons lower
than the estimate given in Bank Report 310-UNI and 23,000 tons lower than
a Jaakko Poyry (JP) study, commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Indus-
tries, which formed a preliminary basis for development plans for the sec-
tor.
17.       The JP study estimates demand will increase to 484,000 tons by
1985, which is considered by FDF to be a conservative estimate. Proposals
for the construction of two new mills, a 120,000 ton/year cultural paper
and market pulp mill at Iwopin in the former Western State and 60,000 ton/year
newsprint mill at Calabar in Cross River State and expansion of the Jebba
mill in Kwara State to a capacity of 60,000 to 100,000 tons/year have been
under active planning from 1974, with follow-up studies being carried out by a
number of international consultants sponsored by the Federal Ministry of
Industries, with the objective of achieving construction and start-up of
the industries between 1978 and 1980.
18.       A substantive dichotomy has developed between FDF and the Federal
Department of Industry over the timing of the Iwopin and Calabar mills
because of the limited area of pulpwood plantations so far established.
FDF has also indicated its reservations about the Jebba mill expansion
1/   NIR/71/546, November 1975.



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 7
because of technical problems expected in establishing fast-growing pulp-
wood plantations in the area compared with the more favorable growing con-
ditions in alternative areas. There is a further apparent difference in
approach regarding the utilization of the indigenous forest as an interim
supply of pulpwood, and the availability of pulpwood from these sources.
Utilization of indigenous hardwoods is proposed for the Jebba expansion,
but appears not to be under consideration Sor the Iwopin and Calabar
proposals. FDF consider estimates of 40 m /ha of indigenous species in the
forests selected to supply Jebba a gross over-estimate, whereas volumes
of this order of magnitude or more would be available in the forests supply-
ing the Iwopin and Calabar mills.
19.       FDF has indicated additional development proposals which could be
alternatives to the Jebba mill, which include a possible short-fiber mill
in the Ageneboo-Lokoja areas in Kwara/Benue States based on Gmelina arborea
plantations to be developed in the forest reserves situated adjacent to the
east and west banks of the Niger river and for which Federal funds are being
allocated (see para 26), and a possible long-fiber mill in Kaduna State to
be based on pine plantations which it is proposed to develop in that area.
Table 5 s=mmarizes the reported pulp and paper development proposals.
20.       Forest Management.  Management of the forest reserves and control
of the exploitation of non-reserved forests is the responsibility of the
State Governments. Each state has a Forest Department (FD) headed by a
Chief Conservator of Forests with field staff, including professional, tech-
nical and policing grades, having territorial charge of assigned areas. In
addition to State FD staff, there are Local Government Council (LGC) staff in
the lower grades, whose main function is to control felling and revenue
collection. A major function of FD has been the protection and control of
natural forest exploitation.
21.       In some States (e.g., Plateau State), the LGC receives all revenues
from sales of forest products. This position is inconsistent in areas where
heavy investment in plantations establishment is being undertaken by the State
and changes in the beneficial ownership pattern have taken place in some
States.
22.       Until 1971, the Federal Department of Forestry Research located at
Ibadan provided technical information to the State FDs and managed forestry
training at subprofessional level at the Ibadan forestry school; the Jos
forestry school was upgraded to a higher technical standard and also became
the responsibility of the department in 1971. In the same year, a separate
Federal Department of Forestry (FDF) was established with the responsibility
for developing a national development program and coordinating forestry de-
velopment in the States. In 1976, the Department of Forestry Research was re-
named the Federal Institute for Forestry Research and made responsible to the
Agricultural Research Council and not directly to the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development as in the past. As such, it is not di-
rectly integrated with FDF, which comes directly under RIARD.



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 8
23.       FDF is expanding its activities through the development of spe-
cialist divisions at Federal headquarters, consisting of planning, manage-
ment, forest industries, wildlife and conservation, extension and publicity,
and a sawmill training center. FDF offices are being established in State
capitals.  The allocation of Federal funds to the States for forestry de-
velopment is now managed and monitored by the FDF. In 1974/75, allocations
to the States for pulpwood plantation development amounted to US$8.3 million
and US$2.9 million for other plantation development.
24.       Development Plans.  The FDF proposals for the current plan period,
1975 to 1980, anticipate an expenditure of some US$144 million (at 1975
prices), which would be dispersed mainly through State Forestry Departments
(FDs). Detailed features of the activities are given in Appendix 2 and sum-
marized in Table 6.
25.       In addition, FDF have proposed a number of new UNDP/FAO projects to
give support to the activities under FDF 2, FDF 4, FDF 5, and FDF 9, at es-
timated costs of Federal Government US$4 million, U1DP/FAO US$2 million.
(See also Appendix 2 and para 27).
26.       The main emphasis is given to pulpwood plantations development for
the proposed Iwopin, Calabar and Jebba mills, (US$84 million). Other indus-
trial plantations (US$12 million) and local forestry, in the central and
northern states (US$18 million) are also selected for special emphasis. Some
US$20 million expenditure is proposed for developing a detailed data base and
management plans for the national forest resource, and for strengthening par-
ticipation of the FDF in forestry development.
27.       International Participation.  Besides the two UJNDP/FAO projects
discussed in paras 5 and 8 (High Forest Development and Savanna Forest
Research Station), there are two other ongoing joint FDF/UNDP/FAO projects
assisting with forest utilization; the Timber Design and Construction Pro-
ject, NIR/68/012 and the Sawmill Training Center, Benin, TF/NIR-22 (FIN).
In addition, the British ODM is cooperating with FIFR in a project to
study propagation of obeche (Triplochitan sclerox7lon), which was formerly
a major export species. The Irish and Finnish governments are partici-
pating in projects in foresty and game management training at Ibadan Uni-
versity. Canadian aid assisted between 1965 and 1973 with projects in for-
est utilization in the former Western State and forest industry in Oban
forests in Cross River State. FDF is also negotiating with CIDA for a wood
consumption and marketing survey.
B. Plateau and Benue States
28.       Forest Resource.  The forest resource includes gazetted forest
reserves (FRs), community forest areas (CFAs), mining reclamation areas,
and extensive areas of low volume savannas in unallocated and private
lands. Records exist which indicate the areas of FRs and CFAs and rough



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 9
maps have been prepared to show the location of the former. (See maps
attached to the respective appraisal reports). It is reported that in some
cases, boundary demarcation of the FRs has not been completed on the ground,
and some encroachment has taken place through cultivation by farmers; the
actual areas are therefore likely to be less than those recorded. No detailed
information is available regarding the stocking density and types of trees
both in the FRs and savannas, and assessment is largely subjective. The
UNDP/FAO High Forest Development Project will be providing forest inventory
data for some of the FRs in Benue State and a report on the forests of Jos and
Jemaa Plateaux and Benue Valley is currently under preparation as part of the
Central Nigeria Land Resources Project, aided by the British ODM. Both
reports are expected to be available by the end of 1976. A. list of the main
tree species and their uses is included in Appendix 3.
29.       Plateau State.  Table 7 contains a tabulation of the forest re-
sources and base data. The recorded area of FRs, CFAs, and mine reclama-
tion areas is 3,727 km2, 103 km2 and 12 km2 respectively and comprise about 8%
of the land area. There is little tree cover on the Jos Plateau and the FRs
which exist are mainly in the hilly and rocky areas bounding the plateau and
serve as protection. In response to severe shortages of fuelwood and timber,
the development of CFAs was initiated in the Jos division some 30 years ago,
and they are mainly concentrated in this area (see para 31). The mining
reclamation areas are also located on the plateau and the local timber short-
age is a main incentive to undertaking the rehabilitation of areas disturbed
through mining operations. In the other divisions of the State, the FRs
contain scattered stands of commercial species, but these are reported to be
insufficient in quantity to sustain any sizeable forest industry. The Doma
FR, about 864 km2 in the Lafia project area, is by far the largest reserve.
This is composed of a variety of soil and vegetation types, with about 25%
ironstone outcrops and hills, a predominance of savanna woodlands and grass-
lands, and very little closed-canopy forests.
30.       Management of the FRs and CFAs is the responsibility of the State
FD of MANR. Ownership of the forests vests with the Local Government Councils
(LGC). The FD, headed by a Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) with supporting
field staff in each of the administrative divisions, recommends protection and
exploitation practices and tariffs to be charged for forest produce, which
upon agreement by the LGCs are then codified in forest rules. The last
revision of tariffs was in 1963 and it is due for updating. Besides the CFAs
the FD have also initiated small reforestation programs in FRs amounting to
about 1,100 ha to date, mainly of eucalyptus, gmelina and teak, and providing
the finance and field staff for their implementation. Consideration is now
being given to changing the existing pattern of revenue payments to LGCs so
that revenues from plantation produce will accrue to the State to offset
against expenditures.
31.       Community Forest Areas (CFAs).  These date from the 1930s and were
initiated in the Jos Plateau with the objective of supplying local require-
ments of fuelwood which was even then in short supply. Initially, villagers



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 10
agreed to setting aside areas for fuelwood production, and under the guidance
of FD staff, undertook responsibility for providing their own labor for estab-
lishment and maintenance and effectively protecting the tree blocks. By 1945,
some 1,200 ha had been planted in Jos division, but with limited technical
success because of unsuitable species, poor quality planting stock and inade-
quate supervision. A central nursery was established at Bukuru in 1960 to
supply improved planting stock, of many Eucalyptus species, and in the
ensuing years much of the earlier planting was replaced and the areas of
CFAs increased to about 3,200 ha.
32.       The scheme was extended throughout the former Benue-Plateau State
and CFAs were established in most divisions.  By the 1960s, some 134 CFAs
covering about 103 km2 had been created in what is now Plateau State, mainly
in the Jos and Pankshin divisions, and 138 CFAs covering 31 km2 had been set
aside in what is now Benue State, mainly in the Gboko and Katsina-Ala divi-
sions (see Tables 7 and 8). Only a portion of the areas set aside have
been planted.   No CFAs were established in the Ayangba project area (Ankpa,
Dekina and Idah divisions) and only token planting was carried out in the
Lafia project area. No new CFAs have been created sinced about 1965.
33.       Local support for the scheme, however, diminished, with a reduction
in the amount of voluntary labor, and gradually the FD and LAs increased their
commitment, in many instances paying cash wages to the villagers employed on
the operations and introducing a limited amount of mechanical cultivation.
34.       Problems have arisen with respect to management of the tree blocks
on a sustained cutting cycle, with cases of local people disregarding the
management plans prepared by FD staff; uncontrolled fellings have taken place
with the result that gaps in the canopy caused by felling have allowed weed
growth in the tree blocks that has severely downgraded both the production
and quality of the crop. Harvesting arrangements contribute to the lack of
support since the common practice is for the crops to be sold standing to a
contractor who is then free to resell the produce in markets and at prices of
his choice. Revenue from sales are paid to the LGC and used for community de-
velopment projects such as bridges, water supplies and roads; there is no di-
rect benefit payment to the participating villagers.
35.       New planting in CFAs substantially decline in the laCte16  s anid
there has been a change in attitude by FD staff towards the concept. In the
Jos division, emphasis has moved to establishing pole/fuelwood plantations
in FRs; at one scheme at Heipong, some 40 km from Jos, local farmers have
been paid compensation to free land for plantation development to be carried
out by ED. At the same time, tree seedlings are available for sale to lo-
cal farmers (at N 0.05/seedling) wishing to plant on their farms. In Lafia
division, no planting in CFAs has taken place for over ten years. Govern-
ment is now considering gazetting these CFAs as FRs.
36.       FD is presently experiencing a severe shortage of staff, aggra-
vated by the recent State boundary changes which resulted in several senior
staff transferring to other States. Besides the CCF, there are only two



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 11
senior field staff (Divisional Forest Officers), against a complement of four,
and insufficient experienced trained technical staff; the position of the
latter is expected to improve in the next two years as trainees complete
their courses at the Jos Forestry School. In addition to FD staff, LGCs
employ junior forestry staff primarily for protection of the FRs, control of
felling in the non-FR areas and revenue collection. FD staff supervise the
work of LGC staff, but have no direct employer/employee relationship.
37.       All forest exploitation of timber is carried out by minor contrac-
tors, using pitsaws and power saws, who are licensed by the LGCs and market
their timber either directly to the end buyer, or more commonly, as baulks
to intermediary traders. Small circular resaw benches are operated by pri-
vate traders in some townships which breakdown the balks to dimension sizes.
A large proportion of the wider size planks (e.g., 12" x 1") are purchased
from the south, and also other dimension stock. Felling is restricted to
non-FR areas, with the objective of retaining the limited stocks of merchan-
table trees in the FRs for future controlled exploitation. Illegal removals
are reported to be significant. Split poles from the borassus palm (Borassus
aethiopum) are used extensively, particularly for roofing supports for
thatched roofs of houses. These have an advantage of termite resistant
heartwood and have been in plentiful supply in the past. The palm is slow
to mature, with an estimated rotation of 60 to 70 years, and is wasteful
in conversion, with about 30% of the split poles becoming mishapen and unsuit-
able for construction. Fast-growing pole crops of Eucalyptus spp. with
simple preservative treatment will provide a more satisfactory and lower cost
product.
38.       Firewood is the major forest product and there are well-established
markets in all the towns visited. In Jos, firewood is transported to the
township from distances over 160 km (100 miles). Much of this is carried
as "'unofficial" cargo behind the cabs of trucks and as top-up loads. Along
the roadsides radiating for up to 50 km (30 miles) or so from the towns,
stacks of bundled firewood are offered for sale by villagers. This trade is
steadily depleting the savanna woodlands. Charcoal is a well established
trade in Jos, but so far has not been adopted elsewhere in the State.
39.       Prices for forest products are high; for sawn timber retail prices
range from US$150/m3for the lowest grade whitewoods to US$250/m3for redwoods
(mahoganies); borassus poles range from US$1/12' bent pole to US$2/14'
straight pole; charcoal retails at US$7.5/100 lb bag in Jos; firewood sells
at US$12/m3(solid) at country roadside and between US$30 and US$50/m3in the
townships. Firewood is a significant item in the family budget of town dwel-
lers and at the estimated consumption of around 4 to 5 m3/family/year, is
likely to account for 10% to 20% of family income.
40.       Foresty Development.  A detailed summary of the Plateau State de-
velopment proposals 1976-1980 is contained in Appendix 4. The main activity
proposed is for Gmelina pulpwood plantations in Doma FR. Earlier in the year,
2,000 acres of the FR was mechanically cleared on contract at a cost of



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 12
US$348/acre, as an initial planting target. The small adjacent nursery com-
menced in 1975 to supply the plants and has sufficient stock for only a few
hundred acres. Planting, using a stumping method, is likely to result in a
high proportion of failures as stumps were being cut back to an overall size
of some 75-100 mm (3" - 4") instead of the prescribed 150-205 mm (6" - 8")
with weed growth beginning to suppress the stumps before shooting had taken
place. The supervisor of the field operations commutes from Lafia town daily;
there is no on-the-job housing provision nor any basic infrastructure. Local
farm casual labor is employed for the field operations. The Doma FR is not
included in the areas selected for pulpwood development in the Federal plan
and it has not been possible for the mission to establish a rationale for the
project. This aspect and some of the technical/ management problems were
discussed with FD and FDF at the invitation of the CCF, and it is understood
the project will be reapproached with the objective of relating the develop-
ment activities to accord with national plans and undertaking a yearly program
which can be effectively achieved within the manpower constraints.
41.       Other activities in the plan include teak plantations in Ayangba FR,
also in the Lafia division, fuelwood plantations, mainly in Jos and Pankshin
divisions, inventories and surveys and a large investment in game reserves
and the Jos wildlife park.
42.       Benue State.  A tabulation of the resource base data is contained
in Table 8. FRs are recorded as covering 1,756 km3and CFAs 31 km3which to-
gether are about 4% of the land area of the State. There are no CFAs in the
Ayangba project area (formerly Kwara State), but these three divisions con-
tain 95% of the FRs. They also differ from the other divisions of the State
in that ownership rests with the State and not the LGCs.
43.       The Northern Nigerian Timber Corporation (NNTC) sawmill at Ochaja
is the only large-scale forestry industry in the State; there is a small saw-
mill at Makurdi, and elsewhere, minor exploitation is carried out by pitsaw-
yers.  NNTC (formerly Coast Timber Co.) has been operating for some 18 years.
Ownership is now 60% State, 35% LGC and 5% private. The concession area in-
cludes the FRs of Alla, Acharane, Ajofu, W. Okura and Okuralyale (some 382
km2), and merchantable trees in the non-forest areas of Ankpa, Dekina and Idah
divisions.  The sawmill has a capacity of`--17        tyear (400,000 ft ) (sin-
gle shift). Annual log production in the past has been approximately 42,000 m3
(1.2 million ft3), of which 23,000 m3 (0.8 million ft3) was marketed as
roundwood, about half of which (composed mainly of obeche = Triplochiton) was
exported. Since the embargo on exports in March, 1976, the mill has increased
sawmill production for the local market, adding an additional vertical band
breakdown saw, and is currently exploring the possibility of producing pre-
fabricated housing units. Preliminary studies are also being undertaken into
the prospects of establishing an integrated particle board mill utilizing
mill residues and species of Antiaris and Ceiba. The mill employs some 300
mill and logging operatives and has its own village in which more than 50%
of employees reside.



SUPPLEaNT 5
Page 13
44.       The staffing position in Benue is more satisfactory than in Plateau
State, with all divisional forestry officer posts being filled. Most of the
senior staff are newly transferred and in the process of taking up their
territorial duties.
45.       The prices of forest products 3are similar to those in Plateau State;
NNTC prices ex-mill range from US$186/m  for whitewood (for which demand is
limited) to US$260/m3 for mahoganies; pole and fuelwood prices are in the
same ranges previously discussed.
46.       Forest Development.  The development plan 1976-1980 is summarized
in Appendix 5. The main emphasis is on timber plantations development, of
which a major part is scheduled for the FRs in the Ayangba project area. It
is possible that part of this program will be included in the FDF pulpwood
plantation development program for the proposed Ageneboo-Lokoja pulpmill.
Next to timber plantations, fuelwood is given emphasis, particularly in the
Makurdi, Gboko and Katsina-Ala divisions. Other activities include forest
surveys and inventories, fire protection, game control and development of re-
serves, and roads and buildings infrastructure.
C. The Project
47.       A description of the forest areas within the project areas is given
in Appendices 6 and 7. The project forestry activities will be directed to-
wards local supply of products to complement the development program, within
the constraints of a realistic work schedule to be managed by the project
authority, land availability and availability of staff and labor. Proposed
activities will include establishment of plantations for poles (a proportion
of which would be expected to be grown to timber dimensions), and fuelwood;
supply of tree seedlings to farmers, including fruit trees; training courses,
to be conducted at the project training centers, including introductory
courses for forestry staff and courses in the use of tools and their mainten-
ance, simple sawmilling technology, and carpentry for local operators; pro-
vision of technical assistance to small local sawmillers to enable them to
obtain credit; initiation of a charcoal industry in conjunction with land
clearing for plantations establishment; support of national activities in
research, introductory trials and forest development planning. Project
activities are summarized in Table 9.
48.       Plantations Establishment.  In both project areas, the present
stocking of the savannas is generally sufficient for local farm supply of
rough poles and fuelwood for the immediate future. For this reason, and
because CFAs are experiencing serious difficulties at the present time, it
is not expected that the projects will undertake the planting of community
tree blocks, although emphasis will be placed on the sale of seedlings to
farmers (see para 55). Around the main townships, however, the land
has been cleared of trees for a radius of 5 km or more, and both poles and
fuelwood are trad5d goods commanding high prices (upwards of N 0.01/lb for
firewood (US$20/m ) and N 1.0/12' pole of borassus). Moreover, cursory visual
assessment of the tree stocking in the rural areas is deSeptive, since the
actual volume of solid wood, estimated at about 4 to 8 m /ha, is far 'Less



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 14
than would be expected by the vegetative cover, which is mainly composed of
branchlets and foliage. There are strong indications that over most of the
area, the annual off-take of solid wood is significantly greater than the na-
tural regeneration so that the capital stock of woodlands is being depleted
at an increasing rate, which will result in a progressive shortage of poles
and fuelwood unless steps are takeu to supplement the natural supplies. Fur-
thermore, the poor quality of poles from the natural woodlands in terms of
straightness and length limits the type of construction and other farm uses
(e.g., cattle corrals, sheds, fencing) to which they may be put.
49.       The project will establish pole/fuelwood plantations within 5 km
radius of the major towns so as to secure future supplies at reasonable cost
to these main centers. The techniques developed during the project would es-
tablish standards for forestry management and be used for extending this sys-
tem to other areas of growing deficiency in subsequent development phases.
50.       The operations will be carried out by project staff on land set
aside and titled for forestry. In Lafia, existing forest reserves would be
used except for Awe; in Ankpa, Dekina and Idah (and Awe), suitable areas,
capable of sustaining vigorous tree growth and situated within 5 km of the
main towns, will be selected in consultation with the LGCs.
51.       Produce from the project plantations will be sold at economic stum-
page prices so as to provide refinancing of replacement plantations.
52.       The results of the plantations so far developed in the project
areas and the systematized demonstrations of SFRS, Samaru, will provide
the basic technology for the project. Plantation areas will be surveyed and
access tracks/firebreaks constructed a year or two prior to planting. Any
merchantable trees will be exploited by minor contractors being directed to
these areas and fuelwood removed by local farmers and contractors. The main
species will be Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. teriticornis (poles and fuelwood),
E. cloeziana (poles and timber), Gmelina arborea (poles, timber and fuelwood).
The denser canopy provided by E. cloeziana and Gmelina arborea would be
utilized to minimize weed infestation and fire hazard by planting these
species along the external portions of the plantations.
53.       Seed supply will be provided by FIFR, using selected seed of known
provenance and a liaison maintained with the project with the objective of
designating selected areas as seed collection areas. SFRS, Samaru, will pro-
vide technical back-stopping for soils survey and evaluation of fertilizer and
trace element deficiencies, particularly boron. The expected rotation for
poles and fuelwood is eight years and average growth rate 15 m3/ha/year.
54.       A later development, to be instituted when the plantations become
yielding, will be the preservation treatment for poles. A simple open-tank
(hot-cold) method, possibly obtaining creosote from the proposed coking-
coal mining industry at Obi, is a likely technique for a wide range of pole
products including construction poles for improved house and farm building,
fencing and stockades. A later development would be pressure treatment for
larger-sized poles for power transmission and telephone cables.

55.       Tree Seedlings to Farmers.  The nurseries supplying the planta-
tions program would also raise tree seedlings for sale to farmers and amenity
trees for sale to the LGCs for townships and public buildings. Sales to
farmers would include fruit trees of citrus, mango, coconut, guava, and
cashew. This service has already been established, particularly for citrus,
in parts of the project areas, and the objective will be to expand supply
to meet the demand and at the same time introduce other varieties, e.g.,
paw paw, pineapple, avocado pear.  Initially, supplies will be for local
fruit consumption; a later development could be the expansion of a fruit
growing industry.
56.       Fruit Tree Production.  There are two existing nurseries near Lafia
town; one of almost two acres operated by the LGC was constructed some
12 years ago and has developed a small citrus orchard for producing budding
material; there are proposals for expanding the size of the nursery to five
acres by acquiring adjacent land. The other is a five-acre nursery operated
by MANR which commenced operations in 1972. This is currencly being extended
by a further five acres, finalization of which is contingent on the payment
of compensation to affected farmers. The MANR nursery also handles some
seed multiplication for agricultural crops. Both nurseries have inadequate
irrigation facilities.
57.       Both nurseries produce similar varieties of fruit trees for sale
to farmers. Citrus, mainly orange, is by far the main species, with some
mango, coconut, cola nut, guava and cashew; the MANR nursery is currently
building up stocks of pineapple. Varieties of orange produced include Wash-
ington Naval, Tangello (locally developed) and "King." Root stock is raised
from seed obtained from local farmers (Obi district) and budding material from
the LGC nursery and local farmers; the Government farm at Yandev used to be a
supply source. Sales of orange trees in the current season are limited
by the available supply and are expected to be 5,000 from the LGC nursery
and 4,100 from the MANR nursery. MANR reports more than 17,000 request-orders
from farmers. Sales of other fruit trees range from a few hundred up to
1,000 and are limited by supply. The current prices charged by the nur-
series are:
LGC Nursery                    MANR Nursery
Citrus            N 0.20/tree                    N 0.15/tree
Coconut           N 0.30/tree                    N 0.30/tree
Mango             N 0.30/tree                    N 0.30/tree
Local opinion indicates farmers would willingly pay higher prices.
58.       The technique of grafting citrus has been satisfactorily de-
veloped although the MAENR nursery reports a shortage of budders and both
nurseries are currently without grafting tape and are improvising by using
cut plastic sheeting and raffia binding. Improved varieties of mango in-
clude "Peta," "Julie," and "Alfonso"; the intention is to use local mango



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 16
as root stock and graft on these, although there have been difficulties in
obtaining budding material and developing a satisfactory technique. Improved
oil palm have been raised in the past and are considered to be an important
crop for local consumption. Pineapple and paw paw are presently considered
to be luxury crops which are not yet common in the diets of local people, but
these, together with avocado pear, are regarded as promising introductions,
initially for home consumption and with the possibility of expanding for
market production in the future.
59.       In Ayangba, there is local demand for cocoa, coffee and oil palm,
in addition to the species discussed, and these will be included in nursery
production. It is estimated farmers would absorb 50,000 to 60,000 fruit
trees/year in the Lafia project and 100,000/year in Ayangba.
60.       Farmers will also be offered seedlings of plantation trees (Eucal-
yPtus and Gmelina spp.) for establishing farm woodlots for pole/fuelwood
production and stakes. The lack of suitable material for staking the yam
crops is a prime reason why this practice is not common. Suitable stakes can
be produced on an annual coppice system using Eucalyptus spp. once the tree
rooting system has been satisfactorily established. A further 50,000 to
60,000 seelings of these species will be produced for sale.
61.       A separate nursery will be established for each of the plantations
to be developed (four to five in Lafia and one each in Ankpa, Dekina and Idah);
these will be amalgamated with the existing agricultural tree nurseries (e.g.,
Lafia).
62.       Charcoal Industry.  At present, the use of charcoal in the project
areas is confined to blacksmiths and laundry men (charcoal irons), with
occasional use by vendors of roasted maize cobs. However, in Jos, there is
a sizeable domestic demand for charcoal and a well-developed charcoal market,
with prices of N 4/45 kg bag upwards. Charcoal has a significant advantage-
over fuelwood in its convenience as a domestic fuel, because it is more
easily handled and stored and contains about double the heat value of well
dried wood. There are good prospects that it would be adopted as fuel in
the larger twowns. From the supply side, the transport costs of charcoal are
less than half those of firewood, and when charcoal is produced as part of a
land clearing operation, it can significantly lower the cost of clearing,
besides utilizing timber which would otherwise be burned to waste.
63.       The project would initiate charcoal production in both project
areas, using both traditional (Jos) earth-kilns and portable steel-kiln
methods, to establish the industry in these areas. Provision is included
for the services of a charcoal specialist consultant to assist in setting
up this component. A technical note prepared by the ongoing FDF/UNDP/FAO
project 1/ on developing portable charcoal kilns is attached as Appendix 8.

64.       Training Courses.  The present product standards, and conversion
rates from roundwood to sawnwood, can be significantly improved. Discussions
with local small-scale sawmill operators and carpenters indicate they will
be anxious to attend short courses in tool maintenance, simple sawmill tech-
nology and carpentry.
65.       The FDF sawmill training center at Benin will include a mobile unit
which would be available for periodic short-course instruction in aspects of
sawmilling and tools maintenance. Specialist instructors in carpentry are
available for courses in carpentry from the Trade Schools, and also FDF Work-
shops, Ibadan.
66.       The project would arrange for short residential courses (2-3 weeks)
to be conducted at the project Training Centers in cooperation with the FDF
and Trade Schools. These are expected to be held once yearly, with some
20-25 small-scale operators per course.
67.       Initiation courses would also be given to forestry staff employed
by the project in nursery practice, and extension advice would be given to
farmers on plantation establishment and maintenance.
68.       Credit to Small Forest Industries.  In Lafia township, there is a
well-established small-scale forest industries section comprising four simple
circular saw benches, each under separate ownership, housed in one open shed
with adjacent open sheds in which some 80 independent self-employed carpenters
produce joinery and furniture products. Similar small-scale carpentry shops
occur in most towns in the project areas. Significant improvements in re-
covery rates, productivity and product quality are possible with the introduc-
tion of simple improved technologies (see para 64). The Small Industries
Credit Scheme operated by the Ministry for Industries is expected to provide
credit finance to bonafide applicants wishing to upgrade sawmilling and car-
pentry workshops. The project would assist in processing applications.
69.       National Forestry Program.  The project would assist in the develop-
ment of the national forestry program by supervising the extension of intro-
ductory trials of tree species in the project areas and assisting with com-
plementary planning of national forestry projects.
70.       Management.  The forestry activities will be under the responsibility
of a forestry specialist and team of technically trained forestry staff se-
conded from the State forestry services to the project. Because of the present
severe staff constraint, it is expected the forestry specialist will be in-
ternationally recruited; secondment of sufficient numbers of other staff may
also be difficult and the project would then undertake inservice training
of suitable candidates in collaboration with the State FDs.
71.       Costs.  Costs are summarized in the appraisal reports.  For Lafia,
total costs 1/ are estimated at N 1.69 million. Detailed cost calculations are
in Appendix 9. For Ayangba, total costs are estimated at N 1.17 million. De-
tailed cost calculations are in Appendix 10.
1/   Without physical and price contingencies.



SUPPLEMENT 5

72.       Benefits.  The rate of return on the investment in pole and fuelwood
plantations would be 10.4%. Project costs, adjusted for postproject expendi-
tures to complete the growing and harvesting of the plantations over the three
eight-year rotations expected, have been used to calculate the profitability.
Revenues have been based on stumpage rates, which are related to the cost of
growing and are about 50% of what the market would bear, since as discussed in
para 30, present forest tariffs are outdated and have no relation to current
market prices. Details of the calculations are in Appendix 11.
73.       Cost Recovery.  Analysis of project costs indicates that the average
cost to the project of raising tree seedlings would be N 0.13/seedling. De-
tails are in Appendix 12. This compares with current prices charged to farm-
ers of N 0.05/seedling for forest trees and N 0.15-0.30/seedling for fruit
trees (citrus and mango). Full cost recovery on sales of seedlings to farmers
can therefore be achieved with only marginal average increases in the present
charges.  (See para 57.)
74.       Project Implementation.  For successful project implementation the
following aspects will require detailed attention:
(a) Land for nurseries should be set aside.
(b) Acquisition of land for pole/fuelwood plantations in Awe
(Lafia), Ankpa, Dekina and Idah (Ayangba) is necessary,
while other pole/fuelwood plantations would be estab-
lished in already gazetted areas.
(c) A nucleus of trained forestry staff should be seconded to
the project.
(d) Forest tariffs are outdated and should be brought in line
with today's costs of growing forest products.
(e) Tree seedlings should be sold to farmers at full cost,
and prices should be raised to that level.

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Charcoal Production 1/
Preamble
1.        The studies being conducted under the High Forest Development Pro-
ject already indicate clearly that the forests can be more intensively uti-
lized by converting to timber more species and smaller diameter logs. This
is an essential development objective if the rapidly increasing demand for
wood products is to be satisfied from the dwindling forestry resources.
2.        However, this will take some time to fully implement since it
will be dependent on the introduction of new sawmilling and wood processing
machinery, and the restructuring and integration of the forestry industry.
3.        Meantime some immediate measures are necessary, especially where
natural forest has to be converted to intensive industrial plantations for
the pulp and paper industry. At present, the remaining trees are destroyed by
burning after logging, to clear the site. At the same time we are aware of
the ever increasing problems of domestic fuel supply in terms of both avail-
ability and cost, as exemplified today by both kerosine and cooking gas. The
Federal Department of Forestry proposes therefore to initiate charcoal produc-
tion on a moderately large pilot scale, and to utilize for this the wood at
present being destroyed. It also proposes to integrate this project with the
larger forest village and agro-silvicultural project, together with the
introduction of wood-based craft centers as an additional income-generating
activity for the new villages.
4.        The implementation of the project is described in the following
pages together with the costs involved and resulting benefits.
Charcoal Production Project
5.       The manufacture of charcoal in metal kilns has been proposed as part
of the plantation development scheme, to provide an alternative source of fuel
for local residents. The increasing price of kerosine and cooking gas has
caused numerous difficulties.
6.   Currently the local price is N 2.50 per sack of 88 lbs (40 kg) at the
Ibadan Circle Forest Office for charcoal made by traditional methods in the
Ijaiye Forest Reserve.

7.        A proven kiln is a circular model originally designed in Uganda
and used there with some success. It is cylindrical in shape with two nest-
ing sections approximately 2-3 meters in diameter and 1.7 meters high. It
has a conical cover and a number of conduct pipes to provide the air required
for burning and four stacks for the escape of smoke and steam. The kiln it-
self has a cubic volume of 7.1 cubic meters (250 cubic feet).
8.        The Western Nigerian Technical Company in Ibadan provided an estimate
of N 560 in August 1973 for the fabrication of a kiln of this type. For the
purpose of this report the cost is assumed now to be 100% more, i.e., N 1,120,
but a more accurate estimate will be obtained. As the kiln is manufactured
of sheet steel, its weight is considerable, and in Uganda it was rolled on its
,side for short distances or put on a trailer for longer moving.
9.        FAQ reports on the operation of this type of kiln have been pre-
pared as a result of studies made in Uganda and Malagasy.
10.       These reports state the cycle time from charging, firing and cooling
was 72 hours and that a two-kiln unit was the minimum cycle which could be con-
sidered economic as a unit. This size would employ two men full-time. During
firings in East Africa and elsewhere, the average yield of 35% by weight was
achieved.
11.       Thus assuming:
1.   the volume of wood per charge to be 200 cubic feet
to allow for gaps in the pile during charging;
2.   a cycle time of three days;
3.   a two-unit operation;
4.   a yield of 20% by weight;
5.   a kiln life of three years;
the following results are achieved:
N 2240 or N 62.22
1.   Monthly cost of kilns -  36
2.   Wood cost -
Alternative (a) prepared by daily paid crew
3 men for 8 hours per day for 1 month at N 1.50/manday
N 4.50 per day for 30 days          =       N 135.00.

5.   Cost of bags per month
400 at N 0.75 per bag                            N 300.00
Cost per month:
Alternative (a)                                  N 619.72
11    (b)                                 N 684.72
Cost per bag:
Alternative (a)                                  N 0.62
of     (b)                                 N 0.68
12.       Yield is estimated as follows:
1.   4,000 cubic feet of solid wood;
2.   Weight per cubic feet, 40 lb;
3.   Total wood burned, 160,000 lb;
4.   Yield, 20% or 34,000 lb;
5.   Weight per sack, 80 lb;
6.   Thus 400 sacks per month.
13.       Sales price in Ibadan is N 2.50 per sack, but price at site excludes
transport cost of, say N 75 per trip and 4 trips needed, i.e., N 300 per month
or N 0.43 per bag.
14.       Thus, the price at the manufacturing site is N 2.07 with a production
cost of N 0.62 or a profit of N 1.45 per bag (N 580.00 per month).
15.       The size of the wood used in the kiln should be fairly regular in
size and billets should be from 2 to 4 feet long and up to 1 foot in diameter.
Wood should be cut 3 or 4 weeks before burning to reduce the moisture con-
tent.

over, 70 m /ha. Branch wood and small trees wsuld increase this volume con-
siderably.  There thus should be at least j0 m  per hec are of wood utilizable
for charcoal making, or a total of 4,000 3  (140,000 ft ).  Each two unit kiln
utilizes 4,000 ft per month or 48,000 ft in a 12-month operating season.
Thus 6 kilns (3 two-kiln units) could be used in the demonstration area.
17.       Note:  all costs, wages and yields have been estimated and could be
checked by staff. If a unit of 6 kilns were established, it is recommended
that an ACF be put in charge. Also, a proper design should be obtained since
refinements to the kilns have been made, such as a grating for the bottom, etc.,
which have increased yields and efficiency. The foregoing, however, presents
an introduction to the subject which can be used in the preliminary stages of
preparing the demonstration program.
18.       A reference used in preparing the foregoing was a pamphlet entitled
"Latest Techniques in the Treatment of Natural High Forest in South Mango Dis-
trict," prepared by D.E. Earl, published by the Government Printer, Entebbe,
Uganda, in 1968. 2/
Estimates of Expenditure for Charcoal Project
19.       Much of the expenditure on this project has already been included
in the agro-silviculture project because the two must be seen as an inte-
grated whole.
20.       It is assumed that 32 men will work at each center, with a Charcoal
Overseer and Forestry Assistant for supervision and record maintenance.
The cost of staff, labor and housing have already been allowed for. It has
also been assumed that the charcoal will be transported from the field when
the tractor and trailer are not working on the agricultural crop. For this
reason the charcoal burning will have to be done in the dry weather, after the
maize is harvested (approximately October to February). From March to July the
labor will be involved in cutting wood, and in August and September in assist-
ing with the maize harvest.
21.       The following expenditure is therefore further required:

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
SEED MULTIPLICATION
General
1.        Present seed multiplication activities in the project areas are
divided into three stages of bulking; all three stages involve multiplying
seed received from research stations. The first stage is usually carried out
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) on its farm
centers. Depending on the yield obtained and anticipated demand from farmers,
a second multiplication may be carried out on the farm centers or contracted
out to farmers. TWhere demand for seed is high enough, further multiplication,
the third stage, is always carried out by contract farmers.
2.        Contract farmers sign an agreement with MANR.  Farmers are usually
provided with tractor services and farm inputs, including seed, at the normal
cost, and they have to pay for these at harvest plus a 5% interest charge.
They are also obliged to sell all produce from the stipulated acreage to .XAN-R
at agreed prices.
3.        Contracting farmers are usually assisted in planting and fertilizer
application by an Agricultural Instructor (Al) who works under the supervision
of the Divisional Agricultural Officer. Weeding, rogueing, spraying, harvest-
ing and cleaning are carried out by the farmers without assistance but under
continual supervision of the Al. Seed purchased from contract growers is
bulked, treated and stored in air-tight drums. Sales to farmers are made
through farmers' groups but some seed is reserved for emergency demands and
for farmers who do not belong to groups. The price of seed to farmers is the
same as the price at which it is purchased from growers, with Government
absorbing collection, treatment and storage costs.
4.        In Lafia, seed multiplication is carried out at the Lafia Farm
Center and at the two irrigation centers at Dep and Rutu. In Ayangba two farm
centers are involved in seed multiplication. These are at Otobi and Ochaja
and are mainly involved with multiplication of groundnuts and maize seed. An
important center for seed multiplication for the whole of Benue State is the
Yandev Farm Center and Training College. The Yandev Farm Center is mainly
responsible for bulking seed from research stations for distribution for Stage
III type multiplication by farmers. Seed production at Yandev covers maize,
sorghum, rice, benniseed, soyabeans, groundnuts, cowpeas and kenaf. It
also raises seedlings of oil palm, citrus, mango, coconut and cashew. The
Yandev Farm Center is situated five miles north of Aboko in Benue State.
Though some distance from both project areas, it has sufficient land resources
(a total area of 240 hectares, and another adjacent 260 hectares have been
approved for acquisition) and other facilities.



SUPPLEMNT 6

Seed Ifultiplication for Project Crops
5.        The main crops for which seed or planting material will be required
are cassava, rice, maize, melons, benniseed, cowpeas and perhaps sorghum,
if acceptable new varieties are identified.
6.        Yams.  Although development projections have been based on tech-
nology that already exists, IITA confidently expects to have new stable lines
of yams for general release during the project development period. The
potential of new technology has been described in Supplement 2. In the event
of new technology becomina available for farmers, propagation of yam seeds
could easily be undertaken by the farmers themselves under supervision of the
project and with assistance from IITA. This could easily be accommodated
under the seed multiplication component of the projects.
7.        Cassava.  The project has to produce improved planting materials
for farmers during most of its life, although farmers will be encouraged to
produce their own. Like yams, the system does not require too large an area,
as it is estimated that a plot of two acres should be enough for the produc-
tion of 50,000 cuttings. The project should concentrate on material for
demonstration rather than try to organize the complete supply of planting
material. Farmers' demand for improved material is likely to rise very
rapidly and an early effort should be made to encourage farmers' groups to
establish nurseries for their own needs. Since it may be difficult initially
to get farmers to harvest cuttings before they are ready to harvest the
tubers, the projects would establish enough nurseries to supply seedlings in
Years I and 2.
8.        Maize and Rice.  It would be unnecessary for the project to estab-
lish a system of multiplication different from the present; attention should
be applied to examining and correcting the practical pitfalls in this system.
One area that needs strengthening is collection, cleaning, dressing and
storage; for example, since the viability of maize seed can be sharply reduced
under warm humid conditions, maize for seed should be grown only in the late
season. This would also allow for efficient drying (sun-drying) to a moisture
content of 12% or lower, and for storage during the dry season. Also, to be
sure that only seed from seed farms is sold to the project, it will be neces-
sary to have a mobile sheller that can be moved into the farm to shell the
harvested seed for immediate collection by the project. In the case of rice
it would be advisable if the project supplied pedal threshers to seed produ-
cers. For all grain crops there is also an urgent need for seed cleaning
facilities, while for general seed production there is a need for a moderate-
sized seed-testing laboratory.
9.        There is, however, a need for the project to produce some foundation
seed of experimental material which project research found promising. In the
case of maize, new and improved varieties are constantly being tried, and an
area should be set aside for the project itself to multiply foundation seed.
Rice would, however, pose some problems because of its demand for specific



SUPPLEMENT 6
Page 3
soil types. Production of this will therefore mainly be by farmers on their
own farms but with the help and under the supervision of project management,
but the project would also have an area available at the project farm. Rice
seed production may also be contracted out to Government projects at Dep or
Rutu.
10.       Benniseed.  Like maize, the project would have to make provision
for producing foundation seed of improved varieties. Further multiplica-
tion can be carried out by farmers themselves. Because of the small area
under the crop at present, there is need to change seed only about once in
five years, and because benniseed is generally self-pollinated, the project
needs to set aside only two hectares for bennised seed production.
11.       Melon.  Initial bulking of seed of improved cultivars, as they
are released from research institutions and tested on project experimental
farms, would have to be undertaken on project seed multiplication farms.
Unlike benniseed in Lafia, melon is not only grown by a large number of
farmers in Ayangba, but its importance is rapidly increasing. Demand for
improved types, therefore, is likely to be high. Since melon is predominant-
ly cross-pollinated, and since seed requirement per hectare is small, it would
be best if project seed.requirements were met from the project farm.
12.       Cowpeas.  Seed will have to be changed every three years and area
requirements would be limited since seed production would also be done at
contract farms. However, it will be necessary to set aside some area on
the project farm for bulking new improved varieties resulting from project
research efforts.
13.       Other Crops.  Of the other crops grown in the areas not specifi-
cally part of the project effort, perhaps the more promising ones in the diets
and farming system are groundnuts and pigeon peas. It would be worth alloca-
ting some area for producing improved varieties, in case farmers show some
interest in them. The project farm would be large enough to accommodate
this.
14.       Tree Crops.  The project will maintain the existing tree crop
nurseries for sale of seedlings to farmers. The nurseries will, however,
be-expanded to produce seedlings of forest trees and other fruit trees pre-
sently not grown in the nurseries. For more details see Supplement 5.
15.       Seed requirements and areas needed for seed multiplication (both on
the project farm and on contract farms) for both projects are detailed in
Appendix 1.
Organization of the Seed Multiplication Program
16.       The emphasis would be on multiplying seed by contract farmers,
and since a system of contracting seed production to farmers already exists in
the areas, the existing systems would be examined and improved under the
project so as to ensure good, clean and viable seed.



SUPPLEMENT 6
Page 4
17.       For such a program, a graduate trained in seed technology will be
needed for each of the projects. Since this type of training requires a
relatively short time (three to six months), arrangements would be made to
send a graduate or fairly senior officer for training in Year 0. This officer
will be responsible for organizing seed production under the project. His
major tasks would be to ensure the purity and viability of seed sold to
farmers.
18.       There will be two main aspects of the project, the field production
aspect and the laboratory processing and storage aspect. The field aspect
will be under the supervision of Agricultural Assistants and Agricultural
Instructors. The processing and storage aspects can be handled by a seed
technologist with the support of experienced storekeepers and laborers.
19.       Excluding cassava and yams, the total acreage of seed grown by
farmers would be built up to about 300 ha for Lafia and 500 ha for Ayangba
(see Appendix 1). One Agricultural Assistant, supported by two Agricultural
Instructors, should be capable of supervising 50 ha. One AA and one AI
will be assigned to the project seed farm. Training for short periods at
existing research centers will also be required. Detailed staffing require-
ments for the two projects on the basis of these assumptions are in Table 1.
Zonal employment of field staff would be used. Inputs for seed multiplica-
tion would be provided and seed purchased from farmers would be assembled in
selected farm service centers before transmission to project seed storage
centers.
20.       Seed requirements for Year 1 will have to be contracted out at
existing national and state institutions with enough facilities to produce
good seed, such as Yandev Farm Center, as it is not possible to completely
organize the seed multiplication program in Year 0.
21.       Since it is important to evacuate seed from farmers' farms as
soon as possible after harvest, it is recommended that simple moveable
threshers be acquired by the project, sent to the seed farms for threshing,
and that the seed then be carted to project stores. It is also recommended
that seed be cleaned, tested for purity, treated against pests and dressed
before storage. Before sale to farmers, seed should also be tested for
viability. A seed laboratory will be needed for these activities, and provi-
sion has been made for this together with the necessary equipment. An equip-
ment list is in Table 2.

2/   One AA for 50 ha, 2 AIs for 50 ha; other staff for seed multiplication
not included.
3/   For details see Supplement 6, Appendix 1, Table 2.
4/   More staff then required as all requirements will be contracted out to
existing seed multiplication units, but staff will then need to be
trained in Year 0.
5/   Since staff should be experienced by that time, they should be able to cope
with increased supervision (more than 50 ha) by the end of the project period;
and it does not make sense to increase in Year 4 and decrease in Year 5.

NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
RESEARCH
General
1.        Research in the project areas comes under the three main research
institutions in the country (see also paras 6 to 10). These institutions are
the Federal Department of Agricultural Research (FDAR), the Institute of
Agricultural Research (IAR) and the International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA). These institutions design the field experiments, supply
the necessary inputs for these experiments and analyze the results, but
the actual experiments are carried out by staff of State Ministries of Agri-
culture and Natural Resources (MANR).
2.        In each State's MANR, an Agricultural Officer is in charge of re-
search, and normally, one Agricultural Assistant is employed for research
purposes in each division under the AO's supervision. It is this Agricultural
Assistant who actually lays out trial plots, supervises labor and records
observations in log books provided by the research institutions. Trials are
conducted at MANR "farm centers" and there is normally a farm center near each
divisional headquarters.  In the Lafia area there is a farm center near Lafia
Town with a subcenter near Doma, and seven separate trials were being con-
ducted in 1976. In the Ayangba area there is one farm center each in Ankpa,
Dekina, and Idah. Respectively, seven, eight and four separate trials were
conducted in 1976.
3.        A log book is kept for each trial and is sent back to the appro-
priate research institution at the end of the season for analysis of results.
IAR at Samaru regularly (every January/February) convenes a cropping scheme
conference to discuss the results of previous year's trials and to program for
the next season's.
4.        Research presently carried out in the project areas under the
system described above may be grouped as follows:
(a) soil fertility trials - fertilizer and micronutrient studies;
(b) varietal trials;
(c) spacing trials;
(d) intercropping and farming systems trials involving maize,
sorghum, cowpeas, groundnuts, yams, cassava and soyabeans;
(e) insecticide and fungicide trials involving the use of ULV
sprayers;



SUPPLE}ENIT 7
Page 2
(f) sowing date trials;
(g)  disease observation trials - leaf spot on groundnuts and leaf
blight on maize;
(h)  nematode survey, on groundnuts;
(i)  ridging versus mounding, with yams.
5.        Although a number and variety of trials are conducted in the project
area, more applied research into problems peculiar to the project is required.
With the recent improvements in communications in Nigeria, accessibility
from the project areas to the established research institutions should improve,
and closer links between project research needs and work undertaken at the
research institutions should be possible.
Existing Research Institutions
6.        Except for normal research work carried out by faculties of agricul-
ture of the various Nigerian universities, three main institutions are engaged
in foodcrop research in Nigeria.
7.        The Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR).  This institute,
attached to the Ahmadu Bello University at Zaria, is situated in Samaru.
TAR was responsible for research in the whole of the former State of Northern
Nigeria, and therefore its main research efforts are concentrated on problems
in the more northerly areas of Nigeria. However, a number of its research
results could be applied to the project areas. Research work at IAR covers
cereals, grain legumes, oil seeds and cotton.
8.        The Federal Department of Agricultural Research (FDAR).  This
is part of the National Research Council with headquarters in Ibadan. Its
main station is in Moore Plantations, but it has a number of outstations
in various other parts of the country. Its area of influence, earlier confined
to the former Western State, is now gradually spreading throughout the country.
FDAR research activities cover cereals, such as maize and rice, root crops and
grain legumes. FDAR also provides support to Federal programs, such as the
National Accelerated Food Production Program (NAFPP) operated by the Federal
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD). No formal link exists,
however, between FDAR and FMARD.
9.        The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA).  The
IITA is situated a few miles north of Ibadan. It is an international institu-
tion with responsibilities for research in low altitude tropics throughout
Africa. As such, it is one of the institutes benefitting from the Consulta-
tive Group on International Agricultural Research. However, because most
IITA work is carried out in Nigeria, it has a significant influence on agricul-
ture there. IITA works closely with FDAR and it even seconded some staff to
it. IITA was founded in 1970. In the short period since its establishment,
IITA has made some very significant strides in a number of areas such as root
crops (cassava and yams), maize, and grain legumes such as cowpeas and pigeon
peas.



SUPPLEDNT 7
Page 3
10.       No specific research stations or substations exist in the Lafia
project area, but there are two small substations of specialized Nigerian
research institutions in the Ayangba project area. The Cocoa Research Insti-
tute of Nigeria (CRIN) has a field station at Ochaja, where it studies such
crops as cocoa, kola, coffee and cashew. The Nigerian Institute for Oil
Palm Research (NIFOR) maintains a varietal trial at Acharu. Both operations
are, however, small and marginal, compared with research done in the insti-
tutes' main stations.
Project Applied Research
11.       Because of the lack of properly organized applied research specifi-
cally geared to the need of the project areas, there is a need to establish
an applied research unit under each project. This unit would be staffed by
qualified and experienced staff, but would maintain close liaks with existing
research institutions. The emphasis of the research activities would be
applied research and pure research activities would be avoided. Current
national trials undertaken in the project areas would be incorporated in the
projects' research programs and would receive improved supervision. Based on
experience with the existing trials, the project research officer would make
recommendations to the research institutions for their improvement. The
projects will apply for participation in international trials such as those
carried out by IITA, as well as continue to participate in national trials.
12.       The projects need to emphasize certain areas of research activity
in view of the distinct ecological conditions of the project areas as opposed
to those prevailing in the two other major ecological zones of the country;
areas which need special attention are detailed below.
13.       Variety Trials are needed to select improved varieties, especially
for those crops to be developed under the project, but also for those crops
not specifically included in project development proposals. For the latter,
few improved varieties have yet been found which would be suitable for the
area's environmental conditions and taste preferences, but further research
could change that in the future. In the process of selecting varieties,
consideration should be given to both their adaptability to the ecology of
the area and their ability to fit into the farming systems of the areas.
14.       Soil Fertility Studies.  The project areas' soils, derived from
sedimentary rocks, are quite different from those of the main research centers.
The projects, moreover, are geared towards improving the inherent low fertility
of the soils with inorganic fertilizers. There is, therefore, a need to
strike a compromise between a high NPK content of the soil and its needs for
micronutrients and organic matter for the optimum performance of the various
crops, and it is also necessary to examine the effect of increased soil
fertility on weed growth and competition. This latter aspect will be parti-
cularly important in the Ayangba area in view of the seriousness of spear
grass in the area.



SUPPLEMENT 7
Page 4
15.       Seasonal soil samples would be taken from sample farms and sent
for analysis to one of the research institutes. Results would be correlated
with fertilizer inputs, crop responses (yields), types and quantity of weed
growth, as well as with the cropping system followed on the sample farms.
The effect of alternatives to the bush/fallow system in relation to soil
fertility would also be studied, using such leguminous cover crops as colo-
pogonium, pueraria, centrocema, and stylosanthes either in single or in
mixture, or even pigeon peas as end-of-rotation crop, although the ability of
this crop to smother spear grass and other weeds may not be as high as cover
crops.
16.       Farming Systems Studies.  Although in theory included in existing
trials, the prevailing view is that present trials do not reflect the actual
farming systems of the project areas. This needs careful examination and
if necessary more appropriate experimental designs have to be made for the
project areas. Minimum tillage systems with potential for planting on the
flat and reduction in labor demands for weeding need to be investigated; and
ridging versus mounding for yams should also be investigated, at least for
yams, if planting with setts grown from seeds becomes viable in the project
area.
17.       Mechanization.  Since labor constraints determine to a large extent
the holding size in the project areas, there is a need to study the suitabi-
lity of hand-operated or small motorized farm equipment for the area. Inter-
esting work in this field is now in progress at IITA, and the projects could
benefit from these trials. However, it is not expected that these trials
would produce immediate results or suddenly increased demand in mechanization
by project area farmers. Therefore, except for proposals detailed in Supple-
ment 3, no mechanization is included under the project.
18.       Minor Crops.  A number of crops grown in the project area have
not been considered worthy of too much attention. Nevertheless, break-
throughs in technology might occur and induce applied research programs. For
instance, work on pest resistance in cowpeas in a number of research institu-
tions needs to be followed up by the projects, so as to test suitability of
these varieties for the project areas. The same is true for pigeon peas, the
new varieties of which were not yet accepted in the project area although the
crop itself is important in some parts of the Ayangba area. Other trials
should involve such legumes as winged beans, yam beans and lima beans, as
production potential of some of the varieties is great.
19.       Farm Management Studies.  There is an almost complete lack of
information on farm management practices which is needed to provide a better
understanding of the farmers' main problems. The project itself will make
major efforts to study the farm management systems through its evaluation
unit. The latter unit will therefore be specifically responsible for these
studies. Work on farm management studies is done elsewhere in Nigeria--there
is a proposed FAO project and in addition, graduate university students
show interest in specific studies. The latter would be of special interest



SUPPLEMENT 7
Page 5
and the projects would favorably regard any requests from Nigerian universi-
ties to study farm management systems in the project areas. For example,
since the Ayangba project is quite close to the University of Nsukka, it could
easily maintain close relations with the University.
20.       Applied research would be conducted on the projects' research plots.
The aim would be to have sufficient land available adjacent to the projects'
seed multiplication centers. The farm manager of the seed multiplication
center would also oversee labor used on the research plots and equipment would
be used both for seed multiplication and research. For reasons of efficiency,
therefore, there would be one project farm for both nucleus seed multiplication
and research. The project farm would be under a farm manager.
21.       However, trials would be undertaken not only on the project farms
but also on smallholdings to examine the applicability of research findings
under actual farm practices. Such trials would be very simple so that they
can be easily supervised by properly instructed extension staff.
22.       Project research will be under the responsibility of a senior agro-
nomist supported by a soil technologist and some research assistants (at
Agricultural Assistant level). The latter will be mainly responsible for
supervising farmers' trials.
23.       As mentioned above, the projects would also participate in national
research schemes and would work closely with the existing research institutes.
Data collected by the project will--if necessary-be processed in the existing
data processing facilities of the research institutes or agricultural facul-
ties of universities. In addition, the Agricultural Projects Monitoring,
Evaluation and Planning Unit (APMEPU) in Kaduna has an agronomy section
responsible for crop recommendations, liaison for research, etc. The project
research officers would be obliged to maintain close contact and liaison with
APMEPU and APMEPU's Chief Agronomist would organize regular meetings (at least
once every two months) of all project research officers. In addition seminars
on various crops could be organized in the different project areas. A lump
sum allowance has been made under each project to cover the costs of various
visits to research institutes and to allow for the organization of crop
seminars.

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
TRAINING
A. General
1.        The project's training program is of fundamental importance to the
long-term success of the development proposals it will initiate. An experi-
enced and qualified Chief Training Officer will, therefore, be recruited
and supported with adequate training staff to permit the conduct of a range
of training programs encompassing both the farming community and project
staff.
2.        The project's training program will consist of the following
components:
(a)  Institutional.  Establishing a training center at the
respective project headquarters. In Lafia this training
center would allow training of about 40 Agricultural
Instructors per annum. Under the Ayangba project the
existing Ochaja training center would be expanded and
improved to accomodate about 60 students.
(b)  Staff.
-    The provision of scholarships for senior staff;
-    Upgrading courses for various staff categories;
-    Residential courses for training Agricultural
Instructors;
-    Introductory courses for all project staff;
-    Refresher courses; and
-    Specialized training.
(c) Farmers.
-    Mobile units (two units in the Lafia project and
three in the Ayangba project) which would visit
two villages per day and which would include audio-
visual teaching aids in their methodology.



SUPPLEMENT 8

Day courses at Farmers Service Centers.
Limited residential courses in the project training
center. This would be undertaken later in the
project period.
An allowance for production of programs over re-
gional radio networks.
A program to inform teachers about agricultural de-
velopment.
-    One mobile home economics team, phased later in the
project period.
3.        Adequate training facilities already exist for Agricultural Assist-
ants and Superintendents. Output of graduate students for the next few years
is detailed in Table 1 for the Lafia Project and Table 2 for the Ayangba
Project.
4.        Organization of agricultural training in Nigeria is detailed in
Chart 16326 attached to this supplement, and some details are given below.
5.        Diploma Courses.  Two-year diploma courses for Agricultural Super-
intendents and Higher Superintendents are provided by FMG. Diploma courses
relevant for project personnel are given at the following institutions:
-    Federal Division of Agriculture and Livestock Service
Training with facilities in Samaru, Kabba, and Kaduna.
Subjects taught include general agriculture, farm
management, agricultural mechanics, and horticulture.
-    Federal Soil and Water Conservation School in Jos.
-    Federal School of Agriculture located in Umudike/Umahia.
6.        All students receive a ten-week training session in official agri-
culture services. Students wishing to enter project service after completing
their course would be obliged to carry out in-course and practical work on the
projects during which their suitability for future employment would be as-
sessed.
7.        Certificate Courses.  Two-year certificate courses are designed
for Agricultural Asssistants and are given at the following FMG or State
Institutions:



SUPPLEMENT 8
Page 3
Federal School of Agriculture at Samaru offering
courses in the following subjects: irrigation and
agronomy, general agriculture, and agricultural
mechanics.
Federal School of Agriculture at Kabba for general
agriculture.
School of Agriculture at Yandev run by Benue State
Government for General Agriculture (Extension)
Certificate.
8.        The Yandev training schedule includes a three-month practical
assignment in agricultural services. Students undergoing certificate training
would also be encouraged to undertake practical work on the projects in which
their suitability for future employment would be assessed. The Yandev Center
includes 73 ha of farmland, and instruction includes practical work on seed
multiplication, research and production activities, which take place on an
additional 240 ha held by the Center. Buildings (classrooms and dormitories)
were built in 1973, but are inadequate for future needs. Construction of new
classrooms will commence before the end of 1976 but dormitory accomodation
remains a bottleneck. Dutch Aid has provided a few teachers and funds for
housing and equipment but continued Dutch financial assistance for Yandev
after completion of tour of duty of the present teachers is uncertain.
Principal subjects taught in Yandev's Agricultural Assistant (Extension)
Certificate Course are: agricultural extension, farm management, crop protec-
tion, agricultural engineering, horticulture, animal science and administration.
9.        In 1975-76 two refresher courses for agricultural staff were run:
one ten-day course on the operation of experimental work and one four-day
course on seed control and the use of chemicals. The availability of students
from Yandev is set out in Table 3.
10.       The Certificate Course can be preceded by a pre-technical course,
the aim of which is "to enable students with no scientific background hitherto,
to acquire the fundamental scientific principles upon which agriculture is
based." The subjects taught are biology, chemistry, geography, mathematics,
physics, and English.
11.       Instructor Certificate Courses.  The States operate three-term
certificate courses during the agricultural year (April-October) for Agricul-
tural Instructors. Plateau State operates two Farm Training Centers at
Gridan Adamu (Shemdam Division) and Abatie. Benue State operates a training
center at Ochaja near Ayangba.
12.       Farm Institute.  Plateau State operates a Farm Institute at
Nassarawa Division for advanced farmers. No school performance is required
to gain entry. However, throughput is very low and few who were schooled
at the Institute establish themselves as farmers in spite of encouragements
such as credit facilities, land provision, etc.

B. Staff Training
13.       Senior Staff.  From time to time, in conjunction with the Project
Manager, the Training Officer will review the inservice training performances
of both trainees and trainers. This will be especially indepth for all
positions occupied by expatriates so as to ensure that disengagement of
expatriates will be able to proceed as scheduled without disruption in manage-
ment continuity. Following each review the number of staff to go to overseas
or Nigerian courses would be determined. Development of local management
capability would be an important objective of the project and training of
senior staff would be in that direction. Under the project allowance has been
made for overseas scholarships. However, the State Governments concerned
would ensure that Nigerian staff of high technical and managerial potential
were seconded or recruited to key local appointments.
14.       Intermediate Level Training.  In conjunction with the relevant
department head, from time to time the Training Officer will review with
divisional and sectional heads the performance of all intermediate staff. The
training officer will devise such training programs as may be necessary for
such staff and this may include assistance in taking correspondence courses or
by assuring the release of staff on bonded guarantee of continued employment
on their return, to permit them to attend more formalized training courses.
15.       A close liaison would be maintained with other agricultural educa-
tional and research institutions and direct contact between project staff and
members of such institutions would be promoted. Nevertheless, the main thrust
of training such staff will be centered on inservice training and the
Training Officer will monitor this process for all departments.
16.       Introductory Training.  The Training Officer will be responsible
for providing short introductory training sessions for all staff. Introduc-
tory training sessions will be held periodically throughout the year to
ensure that all incoming staff are adequately aware of the aims and objectives
of the project and of their own individual jobs within it.
17.       Residential Course for Extension Workers.  During the early years
of the project the main thrust of the project's training program would be
on the training of extension personnel (Agricultural Instructor level). A
residential center to accommodate 40 trainees would be established at Lafia.
For Ayangba, the existing center at Ochaja would be expanded and improved to
accommodate 60 trainees. The training program would be carried out under the
direction of the Training Officer. In Lafia the training team would consist
of three full-time training instructors assisted by two experienced but lower-
grade field workers who would assist specifically in teaching practical field
work. In Ayangba there would be four instructors and three field workers.
Training staff would be selected for their experience, field knowledge and
training techniques. At least one training instructor would be of diploma
level and the remaining two would be certificate holders; but all training



SUPPLElfENT 8
Page 5
instructors would possess wide experience and ability. Provision will be made
for other specialist instructors (either project staff or outsiders) covering
subjects, such as, for example, mechanics or carpentry, in which the resident
instruction team may not be skilled. Interns would receive a 45-week training
period (i.e., one year including holidays) beginning the third week of January
and ending the second week of December. Approximately 2/3 of training time
would be devoted to practical field work of which about 1/4 would consist of
intensive instructional work at the training center and the remainder would
take place on project demonstration and seed multiplication holdings.
18.       The training timetable is detailed in Table 4 and a curriculum is in
Appendix 1. This curriculum would encompass all aspects of the technical work
of extension workers and in addition would provide a wide background in the
overall aspects of agricultural development in the area. Each project division
would assist in training Agricultural Instructors by providing some inputs in
their specific fields.
19.       A certificate would be awarded to each successful trainee and
a high standard of passmark would be insisted upon. Such certificates would
be officially recognized as of equal value to those issued by other institu-
tions providing training for Agricultural Instructors and would thus have the
same career advancement value; the Training Officer would ensure that State
Governments accept these principles.
20.       Refresher Courses.  Refresher courses will be run as and when
required. Exact requirements cannot be known in advance, but will be de-
termined jointly by department heads and the Training Officer. It is ex-
pected that most refresher training will be inservice. Refresher courses
or sessions will be mostly technically oriented.
21.       Specialized Training.  Specific training programs will be conducted
for project staff in such fields as credit, marketing, forestry and fisheries.
These courses would be mainly the responsibility of the relevant head of
department or division, but would be coordinated with the Training Officer;
project training facilities would also be used for specialized training.
C. Farmer Training
22.       Mobile Units.  Farmer training will be carried out mainly at village
level by peripatetic training teams operating under the direction of the
Training Officer. No specific facilities would be provided at village level
and the training process would concentrate on field appreciation of cultural
practices being undertaken by the villagers themselves. Each peripatetic
training unit would be supplied with a van equipped with a loudspeaker system
and audiovisual aids, and would consist of a training instructor, and a
driver. Units would operate in the field for four days a week, using the



SUPPLEMENT 8
Page 6
week, using the fifth day for coordination and reporting to the Training
Officer and for vehicle and equipment maintenance and servicing. Two villages
would be covered by each unit on each field day. Two units would operate in
the first year and for Ayangba this would be increased to three in Year 2.
Thus approximately 60 villages could be visited per month which would permit
sufficiently frequent coverage to ensure that the agricultural calendar was
adequately covered for all project farmers. Field extension staff for the
area would attend visits of the peripatetic team and would thereby automati-
cally upgrade their own knowledge.
23.       Day-Courses.  A system of one-day courses would also be employed
as a tool of farmer training. Groups of farmers from a location together with
their agricultural extension personnel would be transported in the project
training bus to points outside their locations, where one-day training sessions
would be conducted. One day courses would be held in Farmers Service Centers,
but would include visits to progressive farmer plots or other demonstration
centers. Day courses would commence in Year 2.
24.       Residential Training.  It is envisaged that from Year 4 residential
training for farmers would be desirable and this could be conducted at a small
satellite training center attached to the project training center. Provision
for two 20-bed residential farmers training centers is provided in Year 4, by
which time the project would have trained adequate staff to man these centers.
It is likely that as the project progresses there will be a need for special-
ized farmer training (e.g. tractor or village water supply maintenance). This
would also be provided as necessary in the expanded training center through
one-week residential courses.
25.       Use of Mass Media.  The Training Officer would investigate ways
and means whereby the mass media could be utilized for farmer training.
In particular this applies to the use of the radio and to the inclusion
of programs specifically designed for project farmers. In addition, use
would be made of information services, newspapers, etc. Funds have been
provided to cover any financial requirement of utilizing such services.
26.       Training within the Education System.  The Training Officer would
establish contacts with secondary and primary teachers in the region with
the intension of ensuring that teachers become aware of the functions and
intensions of the project so that they would be better able to disseminate
the concepts of the project - not only in the classroom, but more especially
in their role as leaders in the village communities.
27.       Home economics.  Later in the project-period (Years 4 and 5), a home
economics team will be included in the training team. This would also operate
as a peripatetic team, and home economics instruction would be coordinated to
a large extent with the other mobile units so that home economics instruction
for women would take place at the same time as agricultural training for
men.

CENTRAL AGRICILTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Training Center: Curriculum for Al Training I/
General
1.        It is intended to commence staff training for Agricultural Instruc-
tors (AI) as soon as possible after project inception. Courses would have a
strong practical bias which will be increased towards the end of each 45-week
training period. Assessment of the suitability of trainees will be judged by
character and overall personal performance during training in addition to
written and oral examinations.
2.        Training Balance.  A balance will be maintained throughout each
course between practical and theoretical work which will be inter-linked to
the agricultural calendar. It is proposed that approximately three hours each
day will be devoted to practical work during lecture weeks and nearly one week
out of two to practical assignment.
3.        Permanent Evaluation.  A running evaluation would be maintained
throughout the course on trainee performance and the effectiveness of the
training course. The objectives will be to:
-    appraise and evaluate continuously the performance of
trainees in on-the-job situations;
-    improve curriculum content and training methods;
-    summarize training experience and responses; and
-    prepare future course work based on past findings.
4.        Instructor's Handbook.  Within two years of the commencement of
these training courses a handbook of technical and practical memoranda will be
prepared by training staff, in conjunction with other senior project staff,
which will be published in two forms: for use as a school book, and as a
professional instructor's handbook.
5.        Agricultural Training Calendar.  The training calendar will be
coordinated into the agricultural year to ensure effectiveness of classroom
and practical training. The training year will therefore be divided into four
sessions separated by one-week holiday breaks.
1/   The curriculum is presented as a schedule in Table 4.

NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
General
1.        The two projects combined would involve an estimated 210,000 farm
families spread over an area of some 22,000 sq km cultivating 450,000 ha. 1/
This would be equivalent to a population the size of the Peoples Republic of
Congo and an area equivalent to twice the size of Gambia. However, the project
areas represent only 2.4% of the total area of Nigeria, and the population
represents only about 2% of Nigeria's population. Mlonitoring production in-
creases in this situation would be a formidable task, and will require a
considerable resource input. Furthermore, the Ayangba project area is divided
into three ecological zones and the Lafia project area is populated by people
of different tribes with different cultural affinities. This would call for
particularly careful evaluation of project progress.
Organization
2.        Project field evaluation units would be under the overall direction
of the Agricultural Projects Monitoring, Evaluation and Planning Unit (APMEPU)
at Kaduna. Work plans would take cognizance of APMEPU's experience with the
monitoring and evaluation of the three ongoing Northern Agricultural Develop-
ment Projects, financed by the Bank at Funtua, Gusau and Gombe. 2/ Each
project's Chief Evaluation Officer would, together with his Project Manager,
determine project priorities for evaluation. A work plan would then be agreed
between APMEPU and each project's Chief Evaluation Officer. It is important
that programs be both flexible and standardized: flexible enough to incorpo-
rate investigation of project-specific problems and sufficiently standardized
to use standard analytical computer programming and data processing techniques.
APMEPU's Steering Commitee, on which the Project Managers would sit, would
resolve any disagreements between project evaluation staff and APMEPU.
Staffing
3.        Each field evaluation unit would be headed by a Chief Evaluation
Officer who should have experience in collecting and analyzing micro-economic
data in a smallholder environment and a degree in agricultural economics,
preferably at the Ph.D. level. Some formal course work in sociology would be
an advantage. Above all, these persons would need to be imaginative, flexible
and capable of working with other management staff.
2
1/   Lafia: 9,400 km , harm families 60,000 and cultivated area 150,000 ha.
Ayangba: 13,150 km , farm families 150,000 and cultivated area 300,000 ha.
2/   Funtua Loan 1092-UNI, Gusau Loan 1099-UNI, Gombe Loan 1164-UNI.



SUPPLEMENT 9
Page 2
4.        In addition, each project evaluation unit would be staffed by
evaluation officers, senior enumerators, enumerators and clerks. A Senior
Evaluation Officer would be a deputy and assistant to the Chief Evaluation
Officer. Senior enumerators and enumerators would mostly be assigned to the
field. Where practical, every effort would be made to hire persons, such as
school teachers, on a part-time basis to assist in data collection, for
instance from farmers when they return home from their fields in the evenings.
The project evaluation unit would ensure that it does not become overloaded
with enumerators to the extent that surveys are designed primarily with the
object of keeping enumerators occupied, resulting in unnecessary and surplus
data collection.
5.        The Chief Evaluation Officer would liaise closely with the Head
of the Development Services Department and the Head of the Crop Development
Division (and other division heads as required), in deciding how best to
share the responsibility of data collection. It has long been the experience
in Francophone West Africa for extension staff to have responsibility for
limited data collection, a task they have in some locations done well, there-
by saving unnecessary employment of enumerators. In English-speaking West
Africa, extension agents have not been used for this purpose, but this pos-
sibility should be explored in the projects since there are no inherent
reasons why it cannot be done and the cost savings would be significant.
However, as the extension staff is being trained and expanded, this is clearly
not possible in the early years of the project as the baseline survey and
first mainline survey should be well organized. These surveys are important
as they are the base against which project progress will be evaluated.
6.        There is a limit on the number of field enumerators a Chief Evalua-
tion Officer can effectively supervise. The quality of data collection is
particularly important when sample sizes are necessarily a small proportion of
the population and where farming systems are complex, involving a large number
of input and output parameters. Evaluation of smallholders is particularly
prone to the 'garbage-in, garbage-out' syndrome. The number of field enumera-
tors would be limited to a maximum of 50 at Ayangba and 40 at Lafia, 1/ the
limit being stretched at Ayangba to cope with the particularly large project
area. For every seven enumerators, there would be a senior enumerator. The
Chief Evaluation Officer would have two evaluation officers working under
him.
Work Program 2/
7.        The Chief Evaluation Officers would be in post by March/April
1977. The first two months would be spent familiarizing themselves with the
work of APMEPU, visiting the ongoing Bank-financed Northern Agricultural
Development Projects and reviewing the literature on their project areas. In
particular, at Lafia, the Chief Evaluation Officer, in conjunction with APMEPU,
1/ This is regarded as the maximum number of enumerators one Senior Evalu-
ation Officer can supervise; employment of a second Senior Evaluation
Officer would not be justified.
2/   For a timetable see Table 1.



SUPPLEMENT 9
Page 3
would review the need for a short-term consultancy mission by an experienced
sociologist/anthropologist to make recommendations on the different approaches
to extension required by the several ethnic groups within the project area, in
particular the feasibility of the 'group' approach to farmers. Consulting
time has been included in project costs for this purpose. Consulting time has
also been included to assist with any start-up problems which have to be
tackled early in the project period.
8.        Following initial orientation, a listing of all villages in the
project areas would be made, with information on number of households, tribal
affiliation, infrastructure such as schools and markets, and, on a sample
basis, household size. This information would be analyzed quickly to assist
project management in locating Farmers Service Centers and priority areas for
project involvement. This listing is not only important for evaluation
purposes but for all project activities. Therefore the Project Manager and
other project staff would be involved although the actual execution of the
listing exercise would be best done under the control of the Chief Evaluation
Officer.
9.        A baseline survey similar to those instituted at the Northern
Agricultural Development Projects could be carried out during five months
at the end of 1977 and early 1978. The survey would provide data on the
following factors:
1.   family composition and employment
2.   land holdings and cropping patterns
3.   farm equipment owned
4.   farm input use
5.   farmers' credit
6.   crop use
7.   crop marketing arrangements/channels
8.   hired labor availability
9.   land tenure systems
10. group farming experience.
Items 1-6 would be collected through farmer questionnaires, and items 7-10
through structured questionnaires directed at informed local inhabitants such
as extension officers, school teachers, village heads, etc.
10.       Following the baseline survey, a detailed farm management study 1/
would be instituted to record farmers' activities, farm inputs and outputs over
1/   Also called mainline survey.



SUPPLEMENT 9
Page 4
a cropping cycle (one year), beginning in February/March 1978. In conjunction
with the basic recording of input/output data, a series of questionnaires
would be completed to investigate project-specific problems. Experience to
date with the Northern Agricultural Development Projects indicates that a
detailed farm management survey should not take place every year. Consequent-
ly, detailed farm management studies are proposed for Project Years 1, 3
and 5. This would allow comparison to be made between the years and an
estimate of project impact. However, flexibility would be maintained and
timing and frequency of surveys would be dictated by experience gained.
11.       The work plan would draw primarily on APMEPU's earlier experiences
with the monitoring and evaluation of the Northern Agricultural Development
Projects at Funtua, Gombe and Gusau, particularly with respect to:
1.   sample size for different types of surveys;
2.   length of recall period and data reliability;
3.   development of reliable indices of economic activity;
4.   use of broad-based on-off opinion surveys;
5.   monitoring of multiplier effects.
12.       Both projects have a number of component parts besides the principal
crop production activity, namely fisheries, charcoal industry, timber, live-
stock, etc. These components would be studied in detail in Years 2 and 4.
In order to encourage Nigerian research students to study aspects of the
project and familiarize themselves with what is proving to be a successful
form of development, the project would provide services where possible in the
form of transport, office accommodation, etc., to students wishing to investi-
gate facets of the projects. Research proposals would be vetted and approved
by the Chief Evaluation Officer and Project Manager in conjunction with
APMEPU. In particular, following the findings of the baseline survey, a
marketing and storage study would be organized in each project area, ideally
undertaken as part of a Nigerian researcher's thesis requirement. Such an
arrangement would have the benefit of being inexpensive as well as encouraging
operation-oriented research.
Project Costs
13.       Project costs for evaluation are detailed in the respective appraisal
reports.

NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
1.        The projects would be executed by largely autonomous and independent
units under the State Ministries of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Proj-
ect organization would mainly consist of a Project Executive Committee and a
Project Management Unit. An edict establishing both the Project Executive
Committee and the Project Management Unit would be gazetted immediately
following negotiations. A pro-forma edict, to be updated to reflect specific
project requirements, is attached as Appendix 1.
2.        Details on project organization are in the respective appraisal
reports but the main outline is presented below.
3.        The Project Executive Committee would have full authority for
project execution under the Commissioner of Agriculture. It would approve
budgets, appoint senior staff, deal with major procurement matters and award
large contracts. Membership 1/ in this committee would be as follows:
(i)  Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (Chairman);
(ii) Representative, Ministry of Finance and Executive Planning;
(iii) Representative, Ministry of Local Government;
(iv) Representative, Ministry of Works;
(v)  Representative, Water Board;
(vi) Representative, Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Cooperatives;
(vii) Representative Federal Department of Rural Development;
(viii)  Representatives of the project area appointed by the Military
Governor upon recommendation of the Local Government Council(s);
1/   Exact membership is in the appraisal reports, but the main membership
categories are detailed here.



SUPPLEMENT 10
Page 2
(ix) Chief Agricultural Officer;
(x)  Chief Veterinary Officer;
(xi)  Chief Conservator of Forests;
(xii)  Chief Fisheries Officer;
(xiii)  the Project Manager; and
(xiv)  project's Head of Administration Department (Secretary).
4.        Project organization is detailed in charts attached to the respec-
tive appraisal reports, but is almost identical for both projects. The
organization proposed is built upon the very successful projects implemented
in northern Nigeria. Project organization consists of four major departments:
(i) Administration Department;
(ii) Commercial Services Department;
(iii) Development Services Department;
(iv) Engineering Department.
In addition, there is an evaluation office and a control office which would
come directly under the responsibility of the Project Manager.  A description
of the major departments and divisions in the project organization is ;Lven in
Appendix 2.
5.        Relations with the local people would be maintained through divi-
sional advisory committee(s). Membership of this committee depends on local
circumstances and is detailed in the respective appraisal reports. In general,
the following would be members of this committee:
(i)  the Resident (Chairman);
(ii)  two representatives of the Local Government Council;
(iii)  a representative of the Cooperative Union;
(iv)  all district heads;
(v)  the four project department directors;
(vi)  representatives of other farmers groups (if they exist);
(vii)  Senior Project Administration Officer (as Secretary).



SUPPLEMENT 10
Page 3
6.        One of the principles of project organization is that all existing
facilities and functions of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
would be incorporated in the project. There are, however, a few exceptions.
These are:
(i) management of forest reserves (excluded because they should
be organized on a commercial basis);
(ii) the Alloma Oil Palm Estate (in Benue State);
(iii) irrigation schemes (Plateau State).
7.        The core of project organization is the Farmers Service Center.
A number of FSCs will be built under each project and each FSC would cover a
region of about 15 km radius. FSC would consist of a fertilizer store (about
400 tons), small stores for other farm inputs, and offices. There would be a
small shed for teaching purposes and there would also be a demonstration plot.
Houses would be built in the neighborhood of FSCs to provide housing for
staff employed there. An Assistant Agricultural Superintendent would be in
charge of each FSC. He would also supervise extension staff deployed in the
region covered by the FSC. Other staff include a storekeeper, a salesman, and
a marketing assistant. The latter would only be employed at FSC level from
Year 3. Two tractors would be available at each FSC.
8.        Development Centers (DC) would be created to supervise five FSCs. It
is not envisaged that large infrastructure would be required for DCs as a few
simple offices would suffice. In most cases, existing facilities of MANR
could be used for this purpose. DCs would not be organized along divisional
boundaries which are subject to change anyway, but would be organized strictly
on the basis of supervising five FSCs in a certain region. Supervisory staff
at DCs would consist of the following:
(i) Agriculture Superintendent;
(ii) Sales Supervisor;
(iii) Marketing Advisor;
(iv) Credit Officer with some Credit Assistants.
As seasonal credit is not required with the present level of fertilizer sub-
sidies, credit operations would be restricted to medium- and long-term credit
and some trading facilities for fertilizer sales to farmer groups. Therefore,
these credit operations would be easily controlled at DC level. In any case,
credit staff would organize a system of weekly visits to each FSC in regular
rotation.



SUPPLEMENT 10
Page 4
9.        Communications are very important to assist in project implemen-
tation, and the basic tool used to organize instant communications would be
the radio. Different radio networks to be used in the project are:
(i)  a radio link between the project and the Agricultural Projects
Monitoring, Evaluation and Planning Unit (APMEPU) in Kaduna.
This would provide the project with instant access to the
telex facilities of APMEPU and with other projects in Nigeria;
(ii)  a radio network, which wculd connect all DCs with project
headquarters;
(iii)  a mobile radio network for the project's engineering
department; and
(iv)  a mobile radio network for the project's senior staff.
B. Staffing
10.       Experienced staff will be required for project implementation.  The
job descriptions and qualifications of senior project staff are in Appendix 3.
II.       There are likely to be four different types of recruitment for
project staff:
(i) secondment by the State Government;
(ii)  direct recruitment by the project in Nigeria;
(iii)  international recruitment under a direct contract
between the Government and the staff member;
(iv)  international recruitment under a World Bank secondment
contract.
12.       International recruitment will be required to insure that experienced
staff be available for project implementation. Attached at Appendix 4 is a
list of senior staff likely to be recruited internationally. However, if
well-qualified Nigerians were available for these positions, no international
recruitment would be required. It is, however, important that Nigerian staff
be available in time so as not to delay project implementation. Recruitment
target dates are given in Appendix 5.



SUPPLEHENT 10
Page 5
C. Start-up Plan and Post-Project Development
13.       The first full year of project activities would be in 1978.  This
might seem far away in the future but it should be remembered that to get
equipment and supplies in the project area by 1978, orders will have to be
placed almost a year in advance. 1977 is regarded as the project start-up
year and a detailed start-up chart is presented in the respective appraisal
reports. A summary of key start-up dates is in Appendix 6.
14.       The project development period covers the five-year period 1978-1982,
and it is important to consider what will happen with project organization by
the end of the project period. Basically, there are two alternatives: (i)
continuation of the proposed organization or (ii) dismantling and dividing
functions to various existing institutions. If a second phase project is
contemplated, either with Bank financing, other outside financing, or Federal
financing, then the project organization could be kept as proposed under this
project. The only change which should be contemplated would be to establish
the commercial services department as a separate legal entity which would,
nevertheless, be closely linked to the Project Management Unit. If no second
phase project is contemplated, then the Project Management Unit should be
dismantled in such a way as to safeguard the development initiated by the
project. In that case, the engineering department should be transferred
to the road maintenance and wells maintenance section of the Local Government
Council and/or the Ministry of Works. The commercial services department
should be established as a legal company which would continue to provide
credit, input delivery, and market services in the project area on a strictly
commercial basis. The administration department and development services
department would together form the regional branch of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Natural Resources. They would continue to provide the necessary
extension and other services in the project area.

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Draft Order for Project Establishment I/
1.        For general information, it is hereby notified that a Project
Executive Committee 2/ and a Project Management Unit 2/ have been set up with
the objectives and duties as hereunder stated.
2.        The Project Management Unit would be managed by the Project Manager
and its objectives should be:
(i)  development of .... LGC areas with a view toward increasing agricul-
tural production, promoting livestock and fisheries, developing
communal forest resources, and raising the living standards of
the rural population;
(ii)  construction of roads and water supplies associated with agricul-
tural development;
(iii)  development and management of a seed multiplication and research
capacity;
(iv)  training of project staff and farmers;

persons and organizations either inside or outside the State
for the erection of buildings, the construction of civil
works, and-the supply of goods, services and materials as
may seem requisite for the proper discharge of its duties;
(v) the operation of project bank accounts;
(vi) the preparation of reimbursement claims against project
expenditure for submission to the Federal Government and

7.        The Project Management Unit would administer an evaluation unit
that would be technically directed by a Federal-Government-controlled Agricul-
tural Projects Monitoring, Evaluation and Planning Unit estabished in Kaduna.
8.        The Project Management Unit would be responsible for the collection
and dissemination of market information to the farmers in the project area
and would cooperate with the State and Federal Governments or their agencies in
improving marketing practices. The Project Management Unit would also be
authorized to act as a Licensed Buying Agent or in any other equivalent
capacity to the Commodity Boards to be established (or similar marketing
organization which may be established).

CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Description of Major Departments
Prolect ManaRement Unit
1.        Organization of the Project Management Unit is detailed in charts
attached to the respective appraisal reports. The Project Management Unit is
divided into four major departments. These are:
(i) the Administration Department;
(ii) the Commercial Services Department;
(iii) the Development Services Department; and
(iv) the Engineering Department.
In addition, there would be an Evaluation Unit and a Control Office.
Administrative Department
2.        This department would control all personnel matters, recruitment,
staff, transportation, office management, public relations and communications.
In addition, it would be responsible for the coordination of all project
procurement. The actual power to procure would rest with the Project Manager
and would be delegated by him to department heads. However, coordination must
be ensured and this would be affected in the Administration Department. A
major function of the Administration Department is the preparation of budgets
and the keeping of accounts. The department would also be responsible for
security. The department would work closely with existing Government agencies
to ensure proper transfer of staff in and out of the Project Management
Unit and would ensure adequate salary increments and performance and promotion
gradings. In short, it would ensure that personnel matters are managed
in the first place in accordance with all regulations of the State Government,
but secondly, to properly reflect additional incentives needed to attract
experienced staff to the project.
3.        Communications are very important for the successful implementation
of the project. The Administration Department would be responsible for the
operation of the various radio networks operated by the project; this would
mainly concern the radio network with Kaduna and the mobile project radio
network. The Engineering Department would have its own mobile network, as would
the Commercial Services Department, to link up the various Development Centers.
However, the latter network would have a link with the Administration Depart-
ment in headquarters.



SUPPLEMENT 10
Appendix 2

4.        In order to carry out its functions, the Administration Department
would have the following divisions:
(i) Accounting Division;
(ii)  Personnel Division;
(iii)  Housing Division;
(iv)  Transportation Division;
(v) Public Relations Division;
(vi)  Procurement Division;
(vii) Communications Division; and
(viii)  Security Division.
Commercial Services Department
5.        This department would be responsible for credit, input supply,
and marketing advisory services, and would also include the Produce Inspection
Division. The department would be operated along commercial lines and this
would be especially reflected in its accounting systems. The department would
mainly work through a system of Farmers Service Centers, five of which will be
under the supervision of a Development Center. More details concerning
the functions of the Commercial Services Department are in the respective
appraisal reports.
6.        In order to implement its functions, the Commercial Services Department
is divided into the following divisions:
(i) Credit Division;
(ii) Input Supply Division;
(iii) Marketing Advisory Service Division; and
(iv) Produce Inspection Division.
Development Services Department
7.        The Development Services Department is the main operational depart-
ment responsible for project implementation. It is made up of the following
divisions:
(i) Land-Use and Farm Advisory Division: This is the division which
will advise large farmers or groups of farmers about developing
their holdings. They will also be responsible for mapping;
therefore it is divided into the following sections:



SUPPLEMENT 10
Appendix 2
Page 3
(a)  Photo Interpretation and Mapping;
(b) Tractor Hire Service; and
(c) Group Farm Advisory Service (including liaison with
cooperatives or other farmers' groups)

(ii)  Crop Development Division:  This division is responsible for the
agricultural development component of the project and as such is
divided into the following sections:
(a) Extension;
(b) Seed Multiplication; and
(c) Experiments (applied research).
(iii)  Livestock Development Division:  This division is divided into the
following sections:
(a)  Veterinary Services;
(b)  Small Livestock (This section will promote improved practices
for such small livestock as poultry, goats and pigs);
(c)  (only in the case of the Lafia Project) Cattle Section
which will be responsible for management of the grazing
reserves and trade routes.
(iv) Forestry Division;
(v) Fisheries Division;
(vi)  Training Division:  This division is sub-divided into two sectionsr
(a) Staff Training; and

Page 4
(iii) Building Division; and
(iv) Central Workshop.
Control Office
9.        The Control Office will be established directly under the Project
Manager and will be responsible for store control. Internal audit could also
be a part of this office, but it was felt more appropriate to have the external
auditors much more involved in project control. Therefore internal audit
would not be required under the projects for the time being.
Evaluation Office
10.       This office would be part of the Project Management Unit and would
be administratively responsible to the Project Manager. However, technical
direction would be provided by the Agricultural Projects Monitoring, Evaluation
and Planning Unit which is established in Kaduna as part of the Federal
Department of Rural Development.
Coordination
11.       In order to provide coordination within the project, senior staff
would meet monthly to discuss project implementation. The following would be
members of this committee:
(i)  Project Manager (Chairman);
(ii) Head of Administration Department;
(iii) Head of Commercial Services Department;
(iv) Head of Development Services Department;
(v)  Head of Engineering Department;
(vi) Chief Credit Officer;

No formal regulations would be made for meetings of this committee and the
Project Manager would adjust membership in this "unofficial" committee to
fit the specific circumstances of the project.
12.       Within the Development Services Department the head of this department
would hold fortnightly meetings with his division chiefs to discuss day-to-day
operational questions in relation to the project. Major issues would be
referred to the Project Manager or to the project committee referred to in
para 11 above.

SUPPLEMENT 11
NIGERIA
CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
MARKETS AND PRICES
A. Market Outlets Today 1/
Background
1.        Until recently 2/ official market support and intervention in
Nigeria have been confined to a narrow sector of export crops while food
crops which represent over 85% of agricultural output have been marketed
almost entirely within the private sector. Against a background of actual
or apparent self-sufficiency, the export, or scheduled, crops came to be
disproportionately stimulated as sources of cash in a basically subsistence-
oriented economy.
2.        Since the end of the Civil War, a substantial rise in oil-ori-
ginated income and an increasing market-dependent population have caused
food prices to rise sharply. Cash returns from foodcrop production in-
creased relative to export crops and led to both an absolute decline in
scheduled crop plantings and to a smaller proportion of the non-industrial
scheduled crops being marketed through the statutory system. 3/
3.        Against this background FMG has introduced a series of changes aimed
at reforming and revitalizing the Marketing Board system and stimulating pro-
duction of desirable crops.  Overall policy continues to be further developed,
but steps so far announced 4/ have been directed towards linking scheduled
crop prices more directly to world market levels through abolishing produce
taxes and protecting farmers against heavy market overheads; and improving
price stability for domestic crops through wider distribution of fertilizer,
seed and credit to all sectors of agriculture. Further changes have been
announced (described in section B) which, if effected, will dramatically
change the marketing system in existence today as it is described below.
1/   At time of appraisal and for the remainder of 1976.
2/   For proposed changes see Section B.
3/   Recent substantial increases in scheduled crop prices are expected
to reverse this trend.
4/   Not including the announcement made on June 30, 1976 which included
the proposals for drastic changes in the Marketing Board system.



SUPPLEMENT I1
Page 2
Scheduled Crop Marketing
4.        The Nigerian Produce Marketing Company Limited (NPMC), a private
company wholly owned by FMG, is responsible for domestic and export market-
ing of scheduled crops, with initial purchase and assembly performed through
a series of franchise operations negotiated between NFMC and the various
Marketing Boards. 1/ Under the 'reformed system' the Marketing Boards have
the status of agents only; 2/ crop purchase finance is advanced by the Central
Bank through NPMC and an allowance paid in the form of a difference between
official producer prices and NPMC takeover prices to cover administrative
overheads and operating expenses. Their income is totally dependent on turn-
over and allowances are therefore fixed annually on the basis of anticipated
purchases. Provision exists for NPMC to make good unavoidable losses such as
could result from below-target throughputs.
5.        Produce taxes have been abolished and the consequent shortfalls in
State revenue are compensated by FIG payments equal to the amount of tax
that would have been collected under the old tonnave-related system.
6.        Determination of producer prices for scheduled crops is the preroga-
tive of the Head of State, advised by the Technical Committee on Producer
Price Fixing; those for annual crops are announced pre-planting, usually in
the Budget Speech, and those for tree crops before the turn of the year or at
some time more appropriate to the harvesting cycles.
7.        Marketing Boards.  Prior to 1972, scheduled croD marketing in
both project areas was the responsibility of the Northern States Marketing
1oard (NSMB). In 1972, however, the former Benue Plateau State Government
established the Benue Plateau Marketing Board (BPMB) in order to introduce
policies and practices specifically geared to the conditions within the
State and the requirements of State farmers.  Since the creal-on of additional
States, the geographical responsibility of the Marketing Boards has remained
in a state of flux (but see section B). BPMB has changed its business address
to the Plateau Marketing Board but still conducts operations throLg'. I.s
self-accounting area office at Makurdi, in the former Benue-Plateau divisions
which now lie within the Benue State. Likewise the divisions contained by the
Ayangba project, which was formerly part of Kwara State, are still served by
NSMB.
1/  Marketing Boards operate on a regional basis and each Marketing
Board covers all scheduled crops.
2/   Earlier Marketing Boards used to be independent with NPMC acting
as their sales agent.

S.        Buying Arranagements.  Crop purchases from farmers are made by
Licenced Buying Agents (LBA) serving gazetted buying points. Producer
.prices are uniform at all gazetted points, LBA commercial incentive being
provided by a block allowance per ton of produce, plus a transport dif-
ferential on a fixed ton/kilometer basis. Prior to dispatch to the
Marketing Board depots, all produce is subject to inspection and grading
by staff of the Ministry of Agriculture Produce Inspection Division; crops
accepted as being of exportable quality are check weighed, tied, tagged
and appropriately labeled. Check gradings and weighings are made on
delivery, responsibility for shortfall resting with the LBA.
9.        In order to obtain the necessary Certificate of Registration and
the Trading License, 1/ a prospective LBA must provide the minimum of a
standard covered store and a platform scale, and provide proof of bank credit-
worthiness for obtaining necessary crop financing; due to LBA misuse of
credit provided by the Marketing Boards, this facility has not been provided
since 1971.
10.       Market Problems.  The relatively small number of buying points in
relation to the extent of production results in an active assembly trade
occuring between farmgate and gazetted buying station.  This is frequently
carried out by sub-agents of the LBA who buy from farmers using cash advanced
by LBA and subsequently "sell" to their principals at the gazetted markets.
Under these circumstances the difference between official and farmgate prices
can be substantial, and this problem is compounded by both claimed and actual
lack of finance among LBAs who are required to provide their own working
capital without the backing of NPMC guarantees.
11.       For many scheduled crops, volume of transactions in the project
areas is extremely low (see Table 1) and is insufficient to support satis-
factory buying arrangements while expansion of foodcrop marketing has pro-
vided an increasingly attractive alternative employment for traders' funds.
BPMB attempted to ameliorate this problem by creating an official buying team
to operate in areas where farmers complained of inadequate LBA service. Apart
from the difficulties of volume which still confront farmers (quantities
offered have to be on a truck load basis) this policy could result in LBA
abandoning the less attractive rural markets altogether, and serving only the
more accessible points, leaving BPMB to directly handle the high-cost supplies.
12.       Operating costs of the Marketing Boards are also high in relation
to the tonnage of produce handled; indicative administrative and trading
costs of BPMB are given in Tables 2 and 3 and exclude NPMC overheads. Under
the reformed system farmers are protected against these high costs but the
effective removal of the profit motive is likely to prove a disincentive to
improving management and operational efficiency of the Marketing Board.

Food CroD Marketing
13.       The extensive nature of both supply and demand has resulted in
a large number of somewhat unconnected markets. Tne degree of intermarket
relationship differs both geographically and between crops, but is generally
greatest for those having few rmiain supplying areas, such as cowpeas, and
least where there are many localized resources of supply such as occurs with
maize and, in some cases, yams.
14.       Most markets are efficient in themselves, but although in some cases
this efficiency has been shown to extend throughout a market area 1/ there is
evidence that many individual markets operate in almost startling isolation
from each other, particularly in urban centers. 2/ To some extent price
irregularity reflects the high cost of short haul transportaton and thinness
of supply and demand in a typical market; however non-availability of accurate
information also contributes to this situation and severely inhibits the de-
velopment of seasonal as well as daily marketing decisions and operations.
Difficulties over obtaining and disseminating marketing information are
magnified through goods being sold by volume rather than weight.  Measures of
similar description can vary in capacity, 3/ while natural weight also differs
between crops. For grains and pulses, the smallness of the basic unit of
trade relative to that of the monetary system, results in very coarse price
movements.
15.       Seasonal production effects are magnified by dispersed and frag-
mented output; furthermore, while crops grown mainly for sale tend to be
marketed very shortly after harvest, residual quantities produced primarily
for home consumption may be held off the market for some months, frequently
until the prospects for the following season become clear. Under these
circumstances, balanced judgement of available supply is virtually impossible.
16.       Food crop marketing thus tends to be conducted on a hand-to-mouth
basis with minimal stocks held in the marketing channels at any one time;
this passive approach by traders results in seasonal and interseasonal
storage being carried out mainly on the farm. In the past a number of
small, officially sponsored, cereal storage schemes were introduced with
the aim of assisting markec stability and reducing storage losses. These
have been generally unsuccessful for a number of reasons, including use of
unsuitable types and methods of storage and stock finance problems. Conse-
quently, initial assembly is still almost entirely performed by traders whose
naturally stronger bargaining position is sometimes further enhanced by
farmers' urgent cash needs.

3/   The Lafia Local Government Council (Corn 'Marketing Standard Measure) Rules
stipulate that in a legally established market, threshed grain may only
be traded in accordance with the standard measure issued to a market
master. A standard measure of similar description can be of different
capacity in another division.

17.       The Market.  Probably the equivalent of 25% of Nigeria's population
is wholly market-dependent, although a larger share of total production may
be actually traded, most of the difference being in the form of interchange
at village level. Thus each 1% in production could cause a 4% change in
marketed supply with an even greater effect on price levels, particularly
on the downside, because of apparently low price elasticities; the impact
of changes in supply would tend to be further magnified by poor short-term
price correlation between market centers. It must, however, be borne in
mind that with a still primarily subsistence-oriented production effort,
seasonal differences alone can cause output variations in excess of 5%
between one year and the next. In many cases, however, seasonal variation
and producer cash requirements result in considerable consumption elasticity
which to some extent tends to stabilize marketed quantities, particularly
in past years.
18.       Government intervention into the food crop market has been restricted
to strategic grain purchases, but total storage capacity is insignificant at
present. Under the Third Five-Year Development Plan, the strategic grain re-
serve is targeted to reach 250,000 tons.  Responsibility for grain acquisition
and maintenance presently rests with the Ministry of Agriculture's Produce
Inspection Division but control under the Third Plan proposals is expected to
change, either to the recently formed National Grains Company Limited or to a
reorganized marketing board structure.
B. The New Marketing Svstem 1/
19.       Reorganization of the Marketing Boards has been a pressing need for
some time and this was heightened by the creation of the new states. It was
felt undesirable to create Marketing Boards for each of the 19 States because
of the likely enormously expensive overheads, wastages and duplication of
efforts. Previously the Marketing Boards were geared to supplying raw mate-
rials for the world market. The main objective of the proposed new Co=modity
Boards would be to encourage the production and organize the marketing of
Nigeria's major agricultural commodities, and home consumption and local
processing would be promoted rather than export of raw material.
20.       The new commodity marketing system will consist of a price-fixing
authority and seven Commodity Boards which will operate on a nationwide basis.
These seven Commodity Boards are:
-    Cocoa Board, also responsible for tea and coffee;
-    Groundnut Board, also to look after soyabeans, benniseed,
sheanut and ginger;
-    Cotton Board, also to deal with kenaf and similar fibers;
1/   As announced in a broadcast to the nation by the Nigerian Head of
State on June 30, 1976.



SUPPLEMENT 11

-    Palm Produce Board, to deal with palm ':ernel, palm oil
and copra;
-    Rubber Board;
-    Grains Board, to handle all food grains; and
-    Root Crop Board, to dealt with tubers and root crops.
Headquarters of each Commodity Board will be located as near as possible
to the area of greatest production of the major commodity. Each Commodity
Board will provide guaranteed minimum prices, but farmers and plantations
are free to sell to consumers or local processors outside the relevant
Commodity Board.
21.       In order not to create a great distruption in marketing, the
Commodity Boards will be established as soon as possible. NPMC and the
existing Marketing Boards will be phased out during the first quarter of
1977.
22.       The effects of these complete reorganizations of the marketing
system and especially the effects of floor prices on project proposals
cannot be assessed until the new system is operational. However, the
Marketing Advisory Service will closely follow this development and dis-
cuss implications from time to tim.e with the Bank.
C. Market Outlook
23.       SuDDlY and Demand.  There have beer. a number of attempts to
quantify present and future supply and demand in Nigeria. 1/  A11 recognize
the inadequacy of the existing data base to conduct such analyses and use
different current and projection parameters in their calculations. These
projections are summarized in Table 4 and could support substantially

different conclusions, though much of the relative change in the future
surplus/deficit position results from assumptions regarding productivity
improvements. Convincing arguments have been presented against the optimism
of FMG estimates, 1/ while the West Africa Foodgrain Study relies least on
nonquantifiable assumptions 2/ and could prove most accurate in relative
(trend) if not in absolute terms.
24.       As a benchmark for comparison, the following order of magnitude
should be borne in mind. Present annual consumption, expressed in terms of
grain equivalents 3/, is believed to be in the order of 175 kg per head per
year. During the 1960s, food consumption is estimated to have grown at
just under 3% yearly, rising to over 6% after the Civil War and projected
at around 6% for the Third Plan Period. Assuming an average population of
80 million for the next decade, a 5% demand growth would mean roughly an
extra 700,000 tons grain equivalent being required each year. If presently
estimated root cereal proportions are maintained 4/ this would break dowr.
to roundly 380,000 tons of cereals and 1.1 million tons of roots and tubers.
At present average yields this would require additional cultivation of over
700,000 ha each year. Any trend away from roots towards cereals, unless
accompanied by important yield increases, would require an enlargement
of the figure.
25.       Measured against human requirements, quantities of grain used in
animal feed are very small; approximately half of the about 100,000 tons of
feed presently consumed is raw grain, the balance being by-products of the
brewing and milling industries, and high protein meals. Although demand
for livestock products is expected to increase, the effect on overall
requirements for starchy staples is likely to be relatively unimportant, 5/
although impact on individual crops, particularly maize and dwarf sorghum,
could be significant.
1/   Nigeria Staple Foodgrain Projections, oo. cit.
2/   While others are based largely on estimates on income growth and
demand elasticity, this study centers primarily on estimated growth
in urban (and hence market-dependent) population and its impact on
the present Nigerian food balance.
3/   For a given weight, grains contain between 3.25 and 4.0 times as
many calories as roots and tubers.
4/   About 95 kg grain and 270 kg roots.
5/   Over the remainder of the decade a 20% compound growth rate for
animal feed would add an average of less than 50,000 tons per
year to the total demand for starchy staples.

D. Prices
26.       Domestic Prices.  Data on domestic crop prices in Nigeria are
limited and unreliable. Ministry of Agriculture crop and weather reports
provide a monthly record of retail prices in selected markets but enumeration
procedures are inadequate 1/ while differentials between wholesale and farm-
gate price are not collected. Despite guaranteed prices for the scheduled
crops, a large proportion of surplus production, except for cotton and palm
kernels, also enters the domestic market. This situation has largely resulted
from rising domestic food prices compared with those for export crops, but
continues despite substantial recent increases in guaranteed prices. Market
prices collected during appraisal were often at or below guaranteed price
levels, a situation that tends to reflect deficient marketing board services
rather than noncompetitive prices.
27.       For crops not traded in quantity on the world market, existing
farmgate prices have been assembled both by reference to crop and weather
report records (Appendix 1) and by consultation with cooperative staff,
farm association officials and large farmers; check weighings of local
measures were also made in the Ayangba area. Conversions to farmgate
were made on the basis of estimated retail overheads, local transport
along a 50 km radius, and costs of assembly and bagging (Appendix 2). For
millet, sorghum and rice, farmgate prices have been checked against imports
from world markets into main demand centers in the country. Close and
acceptable correlation occurs except for rice which remains something of
an enigma.  Rice has the status of a luxury food in Nigeria and market
prices are unrelated to those of the world market, despite recent removal
of import tariffs; this is reflected in the high prices paid for paddy by
the Rice Company, Jos (Appendix 2, Table 3).
28.       Price Forecasts.  Evaluation of the supply/demand estimates 2/
(Table 4) indicates quite clearly that stimulated food crop production
would be effective import substitution, in contrast to the officially
marketed output of scheduled crops which would be essentially export directed.
Considerations of world market conditions are thus likely to govern the overall
prospect for production, modified as necessary by circumstances specific to
Nigeria.
29.       Grains.  Combined incremental production of grain crops by Year 5
of the project amounts to about 58,000 tons; this is small in relation to
projected grain deficits even in the company of other Government efforts to
1/   Information is collected on prices for local measures and converted
into prices per ton. Standard weights are used in this conversion
and vary substantially (up to 100%) between divisions. Size of
the local measure results in coarse price differences, this being
most noticeable when enumerators changed to the metric system.
During assembly, marked and abrupt price changes pass unquestioned.

stimulate production. 1/ For maize, sorghum and rice, IBRD forecasts have
been made as the base for calculation; rice presently supports a price incon-
sistent with world trade or its nutritional worth and is expected to decline
during project development. For millet, economic pressure from other crops is
expected to result in reduced millet plantings 2/ despite the importance of
the crop as an early source of grain, particularly in Lafia; this trend is
also predicted in the three northern projects and prices could improve in
relationship with those for other cereals. Much of the early planted maize is
harvested green, the bulk of the later crop being taken through to grain; in
both cases prices are expressed in grain equivalent terms. Higher losses
occur with the early crops due to severe problems posed by climatic conditions
at and after harvest.
30.       Cowpeas.  Cowpeas are an extremely important source of vegetable
protein within the area and the country as a whole. The crop is widely traded
but suffers badly from pre- and postharvest infestation which adversely
affects producer returns. Despite successive increases in value over the past
few years, future prices are expected to decline slightly in line with the
general trend.
31.       Benniseed.  There is a small but steady local food trade for benni-
seed which is fairly widely retailed throughout the area. The main market,
however, is as a scheduled export crop, and prices are forecast on this basis.
Benniseed attracts a rather premium position amongst oil seeds on the world
market. 3/ In the absence of IBRD forecases, NPMC current export price
estimates have been used but trends have been pegged to those for groundnuts.
32.       Roots and Tubers.  Root and tuber crop development represents the
main thrust of both projects and combined incremental production amounts to
330,000 tons; this, however, only represents just over 10% of the West African
Foodgrain Study projected shortfall in Nigeria, but judgment of impact on the
domestic market must depend on production developments elsewhere in the coun-
try. Roots and tubers are presently an unimportant component of development
projects in Nigeria, though distribution of improved cassava cuttings has
begun in the western states. However, in view of Third National Development
Plan proposals for starch processing from cassava, 4/ incremental market
surpluses are expected to be readily absorbed into the economy. Current
relative prices for cassava (as gari) compared with the grain crops generally
reflect its caloric contents and forecasted prices are therefore expected to
move in line with those for maize.
1/   Operation Feed the Nation, The National Accelerated Food Production
Project and the IBRD assisted northern projects.
2/   Returns to labor are low and prospects for improvement limited.
3/   Some countries require a minimum proportion of sesame oil in
domestic cooking oils and sesame seed is also used in the bakery
trade.
4/   A plant is under consideration for Lafia.



Page L0
33.       In contrast, yams contain only a quarter as many calories as
maize yet weight for weight trade roughly at par.. In addition, there are
marked price differentials between centers of production and demand which
are far in excess of normal transport components.  The intrinsic appeal
of yams, a prized traditional food, seems unlikely to decline, while the
backing of a sound market intelligence service could substantially i=Drove
producer returns.  Prices have therefore been based on the lowest recail
market records and are assumed to be maintained under the projeccs.  Storage
loss can be high for yams and no new cechnology is available to reduce th-s;
prices have therefore been discounted to reflect this.
34.       Price Calculations.  Price calculations for individual cr-os are
contained in Appendix 2 and expressed in both fnanmcial and economic terms.
Transport has been based on actual rates quoted (N 0.08 zer ton/kilomecer 'or
long haul and N 6.50 per ton for short haul); in the economlc calculations
a flat rate of N 0.05 per tor.b   for long haul and N 5.00 per ton for sho-t
haul has been used. Statutory crop marketing costs are those presently
ruling; bags have been charged at current new price.
35.       Innuts.  Project prices for fertilizer are concained in Appendix 2,
Table 10.  Prices are based cn Euronean ports and reflect un-to-date quocat-ons
from suppliers already trad-ing on the Nigerian market.  Far-gata price calcula-
t-ions have assured commerc-al handlinrg and include a mark-uz in retail ccsts
to cover administra ion, storage and handling. Financiai and economic Micce
derivations have used transzort costs as defined in ia-a 34 above.  orrecascs
have been based on projected 13RD trends.
36.       Prices for inputs other than fertilizer have been assii lat-d froM
local quotations; they are given i: Appendix 2, Table !I.
