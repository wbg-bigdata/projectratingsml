INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR AN
EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$21.0
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard IDA terms, to
help finance an Education Project. This credit would replace (i) a
US$4.5 million credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of March 1964 for
the East Pakistan Education Project (Credit No. 49-PAK) and (ii) a US$13.0
million credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of June 1966 for the Second
East Pakistan Education Project (Credit No. 87-PAK), on the basis set out in
paragraph 2 of my Report and Recommendations to the Executive Directors,
dated September 15, 1972, on the Second Chandpur Irrigation Project (IDA/R
72-77). The proposed credit would add US$3.5 million to the total of the
original education credits, in order to help the Government meet part of the
increase in total project cost.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh" was
distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972 (IDA/R72-230).
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of the territory comprising the former East Wing of Pakistan. Even in the
best of circumstances Bangladesh constitutes a complex development problem.
The population is poor (per capita income of US$50 to US$70 per annum,
a figure which has not risen over the past 20 years), overcrowded (population
density is nearly 1,400 per square mile).and becoming more so (population is
growing at three percent per annum), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is
well under 50 years), in many cases unemployed (perhaps 25-30 percent),
and largely illiterate (under 20 percent literacy rate).
4.        The physical problems of Bangladesh -- its precarious environment,
lack of natural resources, and alluvial terrain with resultant high cost of
infrastructure -- have been compounded by poorly chosen and implemented
investment programs in the past. Perhaps the most striking failure lies in
the increasing gap between foodgrain production and requirements. Bangladesh,
a predominantly agricultural country, must import about 15 percent of its
food requirements even in years of "normal" production such as 1969/70
when 1.5 million tons of foodgrains were imported. Bangladesh today is one
of the most extreme examples of rural poverty in the world.
5.        The one year in which the Government of Bangladesh has been in
control of the country has been dominated by the need to tackle the urgent
rehabilitation tasks arising out of the cyclone of November 1970 and the



- 2 -
political struggles and war of 1971. First, law and order had to be re-
established, political stability achieved and the administrative framework
reconstituted. Second, refugees had to be resettled, relief provided and
the transport system reconstructed to permit the distribution of food. Third,
the economy had to be restored to pre-war levels of output and employment.
6.        Two of the principal achievements of the Government since indepen-
dence have been the progress towards restoration of law and order to the
countryside and the formulation of a new constitution. The constitution
which came into effect on December 16, 1972, provides for the establishment
ot a parliamentary democracy in which the President is the constitutional
Head of State and executive authority is exercised by the Cabinet under
the Prime Minister. The Cabinet collectively is responsible to Parliament,
which consists of 300 members elected by the people from single territorial
constituencies by direct election. The first parliamentary elections
were held in March 1973.
7.        Most of the refugees have been resettled, relief has been
provided and the widely feared famine has not materialized, thanks in
part to massive assistance initially from India and subsequentLy from a
number of other countries, mostly under the auspices of UNROD 'United
Nations Relief Operation in Dacca). The port of Chittagonng was restored
to 90 percent of its prewar capacity by the end of last June. The roads
were quickly repaired and ferries brought in to substitute for damaged
bridges. The vital Bhairab bridge which links Chittagong to Dacca by rail
will not however be usable till October 1973. The reconstruction process is
now well in hand and aid commitments have been received for meeting the
most urgent needs.
8.        The gravest problem confronting the Government since independence
has been the food situation. The 1970/71 crops were poor and the aman crop
of December 1971 was disrupted by the war. Record levels of food imports of
about 2.5 million tons in 1972 have prevented famine from occurring. Never-
theless, per capita foodgrain availabilities in 1972 were well below 1969/70
levels and this, combined with the internal transport difficulties, widespread
hoarding, and smuggling of foodgrains to India, led to a 50 percent rise in
prices over the year. By October 1972 it was apparent that the monsoon was
exceptionally poor and that a critical situation was likely to develop once
again. According to preliminary assessments the main rice crop was 20 per-
cent lower than the original estimates. Even assuming that the winter rice
crop is satisfactory, there will still be a total foodgrain import require-
ment of at least 2.5 million tons in 1973.
9.        Non-agricultural sectors have also been slow to recover.    Indus-
trial activity came to a virtual standstill from November 1971 to January
1972. Since then, production in general seems to have returned to about
70 percent of pre-war levels, though there is considerable variation among
industries. Many industries have experienced serious shortages of raw
materials (such as cotton, yarn, chemicals and cement), spare parts and
capital goods. In large part this is due to the disruption of trade both
during the war and subsequently with new Government licensing and importing



- 3 -
institutions not operating effectively. In addition, industrial production
has been affected by a variety of problems ranging from lack of demand
(especially for those industries formerly exporting to West Pakistan) to
labor problems. Low output, combined with the Government's inability to
get a substantial amount of imported consumer goods flowing into the
country, has been a major factor contributing to the rapid price increases.
10.       Exports increased fairly rapidly after the resumption of trade in
February 1972. The recovery was made possible by the existence of large
inventories of jute and jute products at a time when the prices fetched on
world markets still reflected the severe shortages of 1971. One of the
first acts of the Covernment was to devalue the taka by 53 percent at
official rates, to establish it at par with the Indian rupee. The bonus
voucher system for exports was removed and this, combined with the devaluation,
had the important effect of offering a higher effective exchange rate for raw
jute and a somewhat lower rate for locally manufactured jute goods. As 1972
wore on, there were reminders of the difficult world market position of jute,
with clear evidence of European raw jute importers switching to synthetics
and of declining demand. As a result, jute exports are projected at US$325
million in 1972/73 as against US$350 million in 1969/70. Total exports of
the country over the year are projected at about US$375 million, which
compares with about US$500 million exported to West Pakistan and third
countries in the pre-war period. Most of this decline is on account of items
such as tea, matches, fish and paper products which were formerly exported
to West Pakistan.
11.       In July 1972 the first budget and Annual Plan were presented.
The Plan proposed some US$430 million of public development expenditure
and a further US$160 million for reconstruction. About half of the develop-
ment expenditure was for agriculture, rural institutions, and water and
flood control. The Plan is a pragmatic document which aims at restoring
economic activity to the pre-war level. Even so, the projected amounts of
development expenditure represent a sizeable increase from the past and
there is likely to be a considerable shortfall. The level of imports
(and the consequent foreign aid disbursements) which is assumed in the Plan,
may not be achieved in 1972/73, leading to shortfalls in revenues from
customs duties and counterpart funds. The budgetary situation is very
closely tied to indirect taxation and this in turn is dependent on foreign
trade levels. Pressing budgetary needs have had to be met through an
expansion in the money supply of 82 percent between January and December
1972. This has combined with commodity shortages to cause the serious price
problems, which because of their political implications loom largest in
short-term economic concerns of the Government at present.
12.       The elections of March 1973 and the publication of the Five-year
Plan expected for June signal the end of the "reconstruction" phase and the
attempt by the Government to come to grips with the long-term development
problems. The authorities will be faced with a host of fundamental decisions
concerning policies and programs. The Plan will provide the basis for
analysing the quantitative dimensions of the development problem. The
following is an attempt to delineate the issues in general terms, drawn mainly
from the Economic Report on Bangladesh.



- 4 -
13.       Perhaps the highest priority attaches to gearing up the economic
administration to prepare and implement development projects in a manner
quite different from the past. While the Planning Commission is now technically
well prepared to devise economic plans, the need for effective coordination
and improved project preparation and implementation has not yet: been met.
The operating ministries and autonomous institutions, which were already weak,
were in many cases weakened still further as a result of changes in key per-
sonnel during 1971 and the unsettled period in early 1972. It will be
necessary to face these problems squarely, identify the gaps in personnel
and prepare for the combination of training and technical assistance which
will be necessary to close these gaps.
14.       The urgent need to engineer a rapid and visible improvement in
rural living standards points to a rapid expansion of programs related to
rural development. These programs are central to future development, and
development activities in all sectors should be designed to reflect the
crucial importance of rural development. The programs evolved at the Comilla
Academy for Rural Development are especially promising and deserving of
support.
15.       In view of the great technical difficulties arising in the construc-
tion of large-scale water control projects, Bangladesh's urgent need to
increase food production requires emphasis to be placed initially on less
ambitious projects with greater immediate impact in increasing yields.
Emphasis should be placed upon improved distribution of inputs; appropriate
pricing policies for both inputs and agricultural products; much more research
than hitherto on developing new varieties, improved methods of cultivation,
input requirements and alternative cropping possibilities; attention to
such currently neglected areas as livestock production and fisheries;
encouragement to private investment in agriculture; and extension of credit
facilities to smallholders.
16.       Products such as leather goods, fish and paper products are minor
export items at present, but represent possible growth opportunities for the
economy. A proper system of incentives for these and new export items
needs to be considered. Marketing and promotion activities need to be under-
taken both to redirect the products formerly exported to West Pakistan and
to increase and diversify exports.
17.       There is no easy way to increase public savings in the short-run.
A program of taxation needs to be drawn up which will be elastic to growth
in income. An essential element in any such program will be the efficient
operation and economic pricing of public utilities and enterprises. There
should be flexibility and experimentation to provide financial incentives
to management and labor, and improved financial reporting to enable
authorities to make necessary changes.
18.       Programs with a high employment content should be emphasized.     The
rural works program has the potential for creating productive infrastructure
in the rural areas, through tapping the seasonally unemployed; Bmall-scale
industries can have an impact on both output and employment if promotion,



financing and incentives are adequate; and the high labor content of jute
production increases the importance of efforts to keep jute competitive.
19.       The population will double by the year 2000 if present growth rates
are maintained. The population control program needs a completely new
approach with proper political backing and a sense of real urgency. It
must be not merely the particular program of one department, but a concern
permeating the entire administration.
20.       Bangladesh will require large and continuing external assistancE
to achieve an acceptable growth rate. Long-term projections suggest that,
even to maintain the existing per capita income level in the face of
continued population growth, net aid disbursements of between US$100 million
and US$200 million per annum would be required. Aid disbursement levels of
about half the former Pakistan level (i.e., US$300 million for Bangladesh)
would only permit imports of about US$700 million, which, given the higher
foodgrain component, would allow for no more investment goods and raw materials
than were imported in 1969/70. Average aid disbursements of US$500 million
per year over the five year plan period would be required to permit imports
to be maintained at a level of US$900 million and the rate of investment at
the 12-15 percent of GDP figure which is needed for a five percent per annum
growth of GDP. There is little prospect for substantial domestic financing
of investment in the short-term given the depressed levels of income. In
time, of course, the substitution of domestically grown foodgrains for
imports would release foreign exchange for expanded capital and raw materials
imports.
21.       Aid disbursements this year and next are likely to be limited by the
capacity to import efficiently rather than by inadequate commitment levels.
Commitments, which were at about US$1.3 billion as of the end of 1972, have been
extremely high, reflecting the sympathetic response from donors to the needs
of the critical food situation and reconstruction program. While levels of
aid commitments during the next few years will certainly be lower, it is
essential for disbursements to be maintained well above pre-war levels if
Bangladesh is to make any significant progress in raising living standards.
22.       With an adequate aid flow and better economic management, Bangladesh
should certainly improve on past growth rates. A sustained growth rate
of close to five percent should be possible, although it would need good
fortune as well as exceptionally good management to get above that level
given the unfavorable ratio of population to resources. The keys to growth
will probably be increased agriculture production on the one hand, and good
export performance on the other. A sustained rate of growth of five percent
would mean that by the end of the century the majority of the population
could be adequately, if simply, fed, housed, clothed and educated. Given
the difficult circumstances of Bangladesh, even this would be a major
achievement.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
23.       Prior to the independence of Bangladesh, the Bank and the Associa-
tion had made one loan and 19 development credits, totalling US$4.7
million and US$168.1 million respectively (net of cancellations), for
projects located wholly within what was then East Pakistan. Of these, the
loan and seven of the credits had been fully disbursed, and US$95.6 million
remained undisbursed under 12 development credits.   In addition, under
ten loans and eight development credits for projects involving expenditures
in both East and West Pakistan, a total amount of US$257 million was out-
standing in December 1971; part of this amount has been used to finance
goods located in Bangladesh, or services rendered there. The right of
Pakistan to make further withdrawals in respect of expenditures for projects
located in the East was suspended on December 29, 1971 (Sec M71-60), and the
undisbursed amounts for projects in the East were cancelled on September 29,
1972.
24.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the International
Monetary Fund, the Bank and the Association. It was decided that proposals
would be submitted to the Executive Directors for reactivation of all the
uncompleted projects wholly located in Bangladesh which had previously been
financed with credits to Pakistan. Accordingly, nine such credits in an
aggregate amount of US$105.4 millioni have since then been made to Bangladesh.
Following the proposed reactivation of this Education project, only one more
remains (in an amount of US$25.0 million for the Dacca-Chittagong Highway
Project) which should be ready for submission to the Executive Directors
before the end of this fiscal year. The aggregate amount of these reactivation
credits of US$151.4 million includes about US$44.1 million for the notional
repayment of amounts disbursed under the corresponding previous credit
agreements with Pakistan, thus debiting Bangladesh with this amount.
25.       In addition to the reactivation of pre-independence projects
described in the preceding paragraph, the Association has made one new
credit for US$50 million to Bangladesh to help finance the foreign exchange
costs of imports required for the Government's reconstruction program.
Several other new projects are under preparation, particularly in the field
of agriculture. Proposals for credits of about US$7 million for a cereal
seeds project, about US$3 million for inland water transport rehabilitation,
and about US$4 million for technical assistance are expected to be ready for
submission to the Executive Directors in the near future.
26.       Annex II contains a summary statement of (i) IDA credits made
to Bangladesh since 1972, and (ii) the loan and credits to Pakistan for
projects located wholly in Bangladesh, which have not been reactivated.
Annex II also contains notes on the status of execution of ongoing projects.
There are no IFC investments in Bangladesh.
27.       The Bank Group intends to assist the Government towards its
development objectives in various ways. In the early years, a large
measure of program lending will be needed, to finance the import of
production and construction materials and components. In the longer run,



the emphasis of Bank Group financing would again be on project assistance.
In order to build up a sizeable project pipeline, a major input of technical
assistance will be of high priority in the near future.
PART III - THE SECTOR
28.       Training large numbers of technicians, both for agriculture and
industry, is a matter of critical importance for the development of the
Bangladesh economy. The development of the agricultural sector where
over 80 percent of the population earn their livelihood will require an
increasing number of properly trained agricultural specialists to serve as
extension workers, researchers, farm managers, irrigation engineers, and in
similar positions. Increased education and training in the rural areas is
also required to provide cooperative managers and accountants, pump operators
and mechanics, and model farmers able to transmit information on modern
techniques.
29.       In addition, given the strong population pressure (the present
75 million is growing at a rate of about three percent per annum), new
jobs will have to be provided by other sectors than agriculture, in order
to absorb the additional rural labor surplus. Industrial growth is also
essential to provide the inputs required for a growing agricultural sector.
The progress of the industrial sector will be significantly affected by the
output from suitable technical training institutions. The tasks of develop-
ing an efficient management structure for Bangladesh's industries and
creating a development oriented administration for the new state are
additional priority areas for specially designed training schemes.
30.       The Government of the newly-created nation allocates a high
priority to raising the educational standards of its people and modernizing
its educational and training practices. In the past, too much emphasis
on theoretical formal education, especially in urban areas, has created
a surplus of unsuitably trained graduates who, because of slow growth in
employment, must wait an average of three years to find work. Hence, the
Government's wish to see education more in touch with the practical needs of
a developing economy. A National Education Commission, in charge of revising
the educational programs and policies so they would meet Bangladesh's require-
ments, was set up. At the same time, the Ministry of Local Government, Rural
Development and Co-operatives laid out an ambitious program for mass education
(about 80% of the population is illiterate) that, by mobilizing the people
at the local level, ties it to rural development.
31.       To accomplish these formidable tasks, funds and expertise are
required in vast amounts. More reliable information on the education and
manpower situation will be required and the relevant institutions will have
to be improved in order to plan and manage the development of education and
training. The Bank Group has, along with other donors, already initiated
its assistance to Bangladesh in these fields. In cooperation with the Inter-
national Labor Organization, it provided technical assistance for a study



- 8 -
of rural employment and for a brief period, a staff member advised the
Bangladesh Planning Commission in the field of educational planning. We plan
to remain in close contact with the Government with a view to assisting it in
shaping its educational plans and improving and expanding its training
programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       Credit No. 49-PAK, made in 1964, and Credit No. 87-PAK, made in 1966,
were intended to help the Government finance two education projects which
included assistance to the country's agricultural university at Mymensingh
and to several of its technical training institutions. Credit No. 49-PAK
(US$4.5 million equivalent) was to assist a first project estimated to cost
US$9.2 million equivalent; Credit No. 87-PAK (US$13.0 million equivalent)
was to assist a second project, estimated to cost US$21.6 million equivalent,
complementing the first one. The two projects together comprised:
I.   Mymensingh Agricultural University
(a) Construction and equipment for the expansion of the
Agricultural University of Mymensingh (financed under
Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK);
(b) Teacher fellowships amounting to 50 man-years of overseas
study, for the training abroad of selected personnel for
Mymensingh University (financed under Credit No. 87-PAK);
II. Technical Education
(a) Equipment for eight technical institutes at Comilla, Faridpur,
Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Feni, Jessore and Kushtia
(financed under Credit No. 49-PAK);
(b) Construction and equipment for the expansion of five technical
institutes at Barisal, Bogra, Pabna, Rangpur and Sylhet
(financed under Credit No. 87-PAK);
(c) Expansion of the technical teacher training program at the
Technical Teacher Training College at Dacca, by the employ-
ment of expatriate teachers in selected disciplines and
the provision of funds for the training overseas of local
teachers (financed under Credit No. 49-PAK).
33.       The total cost of both education projects was estimated at US$30.8
million equivalent, including local currency costs amounting to US$19.4
million equivalent. The Association was to finance the foreign exchange costs
(US$11.4 million) of these two projects, plus US$6.1 million equivalent in
local currency costs.



- 9-
34.       When disbursements frofi Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK were
suspended on December 29, 1971, US$7.7 million had been disbursed (US$3.7
million from Credit No. 49-PAK and US$4.0 million from Credit No. 87-PAK).
Total estimated expenditures for the two education projects at that time
were US$17.3 equivalent (US$10.1 million equivalent for Agricultural Univer-
sity and US$7.2 million equivalent for technical education). During 1972,
work to be financed from the two education credits has continued albeit
at a very low level. The current situation of the two projects is as follows:
35.       Mymensingh Agricultural University.   Implementation has been
retarded over the years by various causes, such as delays in the appointment
of consultant architects, numerous changes of Project Director, shortage cf
local funds and of building materials, and more recently, by the 1971
hostilities. Thus, less than half of total construction works included in
the two projects has been completed so far. However, most of the teaching
and research accommodation has been constructed or is under construction.
Repairs of the physical facilities, which were damaged only slightly during
the war, are being financed by the University's own budget. More than half
of the funds allocated from the credits for instructional equipment and books
has been spent. Four-fifths of the total allocated funds for overseas
fellowships has been disbursed. Eight candidates have completed their studies
and four others are presently studying abroad. The three consultant
architectural firms have not yet resumed work, pending decisions by the
Government regarding their contracts.
36.       The Technical Institutes.   The 13 technical institutes supported
by the two previous credits suffered little damage during the war. Supply
of instructional equipment and utilities for eight technical institutes
financed by Credit No. 49-PAK is almost complete. Construction work at the
other five technical institutes supported by Credit No. 87-PAK, is more than
half complete while only about one-fourth of the necessary instructional
equipment has been procured so far. Work is proceeding slowly because of
shortage of materials; however, the Government has budgeted sufficient funds.
The consultant architects have agreed to continue to supervise the construction
work without increasing their fees.
37.       The Technical Teacher Training College.   The program for bringing
in expatriate teachers and for training local teachers overseas has been
completed. In March 1970, the Government and the Association decided to
reallocate lists of instructional equipment financed under Credit No. 49-PAK,
to provide the College trainees with suitably equipped demonstration work-
shops. This equipment, which is yet to be procured, would be similar to what
the teacher graduates would find in the technical institutes. Most of this
equipment, valued at US$171,000, will be placed in the workshops of the
Dacca Technical Institute, which is adjacent to the College; the equipment
and workshops will be shared by College and Institute trainees.
38.       A Swedish Interim Credit of US$11 million equivalent to
Bangladesh, which was signed on June 1, 1972, included financing for urgent
expenditures incurred under the two former education projects from
January 1, 1972 until the effectiveness of the proposed IDA reactivated
credits. A memorandum describing arrangements under the Swedish Interim



- 10 -
Credit was considered by the Executive Directors on April 18, 1972
(IDA/R72-74). It is expected that disbursements from the Swedish credit
prior to effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit will total about US$150,000.
39.       In July and August 1972, shortly after the Government had requested
a new IDA credit to reactivate the two education projects, a mission visited
Bangladesh to review the situation. A Development Credit and Project
Summary as well as a Technical aote describing the findings of the mission
are attached as Annexes III and IV respectively. The mission found that
the total cost of a new project, combining the former two education projects,
has increased substantially; increases have occurred in the foreign exchange
cost as well as in the local currency expenditures, the latter despite the
Taka devaluation (see paragraph 10). Therefore, the Government has requested
the Association to increase the proposed education credit from US$17.5 million
(the aggregate amount of the two former credits), to US$21.0 million to help
meet the increase in total project cost (see also paragraphs 43 and 44 below).
40.       The proposed new education project would remain fundamentally the
same as the ones financed under Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK (with the
1970 modifications described in paragraph 37), except that provision has
been included for eight additional fellowships for training abroad, amount-
ing to some 24 man-years, for Mymensingh University.
41.       The Government has indicated that Mymensingh Agricultural University
is to develop courses more in touch with the needs of a developing economy
and it intends to provide a revised university development plan, which is
currently being prepared by a special university committee for submission to
the National Education Commission in charge of national educational reforms
and plans. The Government has undertaken to send to the Association by
September 30, 1973 a development plan for the Agricultural University. The
Government does not contemplate major changes in its technical training
policies. However, since one of the major deficiencies in this field is the
lack of reliable manpower data, the Government would, by March 31, 1974, send
to the Association for review a plan for a survey of the needs for, and the
development of, skilled industrial manpower including industrial training
at skilled craftsman technician and graduate levels. Lastly, prior to the
award of fellowships for training abroad selected Mymensingh Agricultural
University personnel, which would be financed under the proposed credit, the
Agricultural University would discuss its proposals with the Association.
42.       The Project Implementation Unit at Mvmensingh University which
had been implementing the University items under Credits Nos. 49-PAY and
87-PAK would continue to be responsible for the administrative and financial
control of the Agricultural University subproject, under a suitable Project
Director, appointed on a full-time basis. For the implementation of the
technical education items partially financed under Credits Nos. 49-PAK and
87-PAK two Project Implementation Units were originally established in the
Directorate of Technical Education, both are now operating. Both Units
would be fully merged, to operate under a full-time Project Director.

43.       The revised total cost of the proposed combined education project
has been estimated, prior to the recent international monetary adjustments, 1/
at US$36.4 million equivalent, including US$14.6 million in foreign exchange.
The total project cost has thus increased by about 18 percent over a period
of eight years. The increase in total foreign exchange cost (from US$11.4
million to US$14.6 million) by about 30 percent is due mainly to the
escalation in the prices of instructional equipment and imported materials
for construction and furniture which has occurred since the mid-sixties. The
increase in local currency expenditures, from US$19.4 million equivalent
(Rs 92.3 million or T 141 million after devaluation) to about US$21.7 million
equivalent (T 158 million), by ten percent, despite the recent 53 percent
Taka devaluation, is due to higher construction costs reflecting particularly
the sharp price increases since January 1972, due to shortages of construction
materials, higher transportation costs and minimum wage rates.
44.       Originally, the credits of the Association were to finance 57
percent of the total project cost: the total foreign exchange costs and
35 percent of local currency costs. A US$17.5 million credit would now
finance 48 percent of total project costs only, including 17 percent of
local currency costs. The proposed US$21.0 million credit would permit the
Association to raise its contribution again to cover 58 percent of total
project costs, including total foreign exchange costs and 29 percent of
local currency costs.
45.       The proposed credit would finance:    (i) notional repayment of
amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. 49-PAK (US$3.7 million
equivalent) and Credit No. 87-PAK (US$4.0 million equivalent), thus debiting
Bangladesh with these amounts; and (ii) about 70 percent of the total costs
needed to complete the combined Education Projects (about US$13.3 million
equivalent). The last item includes (a) payment of the foreign exchange
portion of outstanding amounts for consulting services incurred under
Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK, before December 29, 1971 (about US$0.35
million); and (b) reimbursement to Sweden for that portion of SIDA's
interim credit that may have been disbursed for the two Education Projects
by the time the proposed credit becomes effective.
46.       Although the benefits expected from the project are not directly
quantifiable, it is clear that the project would make an important contribution
to the economic development of Bangladesh. The training to be provided at
Mymensingh Agricultural University and at the Technical Institutes would
contribute to providing the necessary manpower required for the moderniza-
tion of agriculture and the development of the industrial sector. Mymen-
singh University would also assist development through its research activities,
1/   The impact upon project costs of recent international monetary adjust-
ments (the devaluation of the US dollar and the movement of the Taka
from 7.28 to 7.55 per US dollar) is difficult to assess with precision
at the present time, but is expected to be very small. The increase
in the dollar value of the foreign costs of the project likely to result
from the dollar devaluation will be substantially offset by the reduction
in the dollar value of local costs resulting from the change in the
Taka/dollar exchange rate.

focusing on high yielding varieties, which is in accord with the country's
agricultural priorities. Industrial technicians, besides contributing to
the development of the industrial sector, would contribute to improving the
government technical departments concerned with transportation, water
supply and electrification development. In short, both components of
the project fall within the general lines of the Bank Group lending strategy
for Bangladesh which stresses rural development, economic diversification
and better standards of living at the village level.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU1,1ENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving tne proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the prior
Development Credit Agreements with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and
incorporate the relevant provisions of the Project Agreements with the then
Province of East Pakistan. There will not be a separate Project Agreement.
48.       Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be:
(i) the appointment of a full-time Project Director, acceptable to the
Association, to the Agricultural University Project Implementation Unit; and
(ii) the integration into one Unit of the Technical Education Project Imple-
mentation Units set up for Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK under a full-time
Project Director acceptable to the Association. A condition of disbursement
against expenditures for the Agricultural University sub-project would be
the employment of architectural consultants on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Association. A similar condition of disbursement would apply against
expenditures for the technical institutes.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C.   Projects in Execution-
Cr. No. 339      Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; $25.0 Million
Credit of October 18, 1972; Closing Date June 30, 1976
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. Implementation
of the original project, financed under Credit No. 228-PAK of 1971, did
not commence prior to the suspension of disbursements. The Government has
now set up the central organization for the project, and task forces for
tl D execution of the sub-projects are being assembled. Sites for cyclone
shelters are being selected, tenders for construction have been invited,
and the Project Coordinator is hopeful of completing sixty shelters before
the onset of the monsoon season. On the primary roads sub-project, surveyors
are in the field determining alignments and making detailed assessments
of work quantities. On the Cyclone Warning sub-project, the sub-project
manager is finalizing specifications of equipment which must be imported
to strengthen the meteorological stations serving the coastal area. Other
sub-projects (inland water transport, telecommunications, feeder roads, and
coastal fisheries) are less advanced. A supervision mission in March
1973 has reviewed with Government the actions required to expedite imple-
mentation of these sub-projects.
Cr. No. 340     Chandpur Irrigation II Project; $13.0 Million Credit of
October 18, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1977
This Credit becl-ie effective on January 17, 1973. When work on
the project, previously financed under Credit No. 184-PAK of 1970, was
suspended in 1971, the major project civil works were about half completed.
The contractor manufacturing equipment for the regulators haA also made
substantial progress. Interim financing by Sweden has alloved reappointment
of project consultants, resumption of construction and renegotiation of the
contract for manufacture and installation of the equipment for the regulators.
Cr. No. 341    Tubewells Project; $14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Closing Date December 31, 1976
The proiect is also being assisted by a $6 !nillion credit from
Sweden and a $6 million grant from Canada.   The IDA and Swedish credits
became effective on January 17, 1973. The project was originally financed
by IDA Credit No. 208-PAK of 1970 and credits from Sweden and Canada. bids
for the drilling of project wells had been received in 1971 but no
contracts were awarded due to the disturbed conditions. Interim financing
from Sweden has permitted reappointment of project consultants and
retendering. Bids have been received for well drilling and suoply of
pumps and engines for the wells, and contracts are expected to be awiarded
in the next few weeks. Contracts have been awarded for required vehicles
and uiscellaneous equipment.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
tney do not purport Lo present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. .'A3   Telecommunications Project; $7.3 Million Credit of
November 15, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1975
Credit became effective January 17, 1973. The project was
originally financed as part of Credit No. 145-FAX of 1969, and goods
and services valued at about US$2.2 million were received in Dacca priot
to suspension of disbursements. Orders had also been placed for the
remaining equipment now to be financed under Credit No. 343, and the
suppliers are understood to be prepared to resume work at the original
contract prices.
Cr. No. 345    Reconstruction Imports Project; $50.0 Million Credit
of November 30, 1972; Closing Date August 31, 1974
Credit became effective January 30, 1973. The Governxment has
prepared a statement allocating the proceeds of the Credit among the various
eligible categories of expenditure, taking into account funds expected to
be available from other sources of assistance. Disbursements are expected
to commence shortly.
Cr. No. 353     Small-Scale Industry Project; $3.0 Million Credit of
January 19, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976
Credit became effective May 14, 1973. The project was originally financed
by IDA Credit No. 192-PAK-o-f1970.  By December 1971, when disbursements were
suspended, 28 sub-projects had been approved and $2.19 million had been
allocated to these projects. Work hias now begun on reactivation of the
interrupted sub-projects and canvassing for new sub-projects.
Cr. MTo. 367   Chittagong Water Supply Project; $7.0 Million Credit
of April 9, 1973; Closing Date June 30_ 1975
Not yet effective. The project was originally financed by IDA
Credit No. 42-PAK of 1963. By December 1971, when disbursements were
suspended, US$ 3.3 million had been disbursed. The project is now about
60 percent completed. The former project consultants have been reappointed
and tender documents are expected to be issued shortly.
Cr. No. 368     Dacca Water and Sewerage Project; $13.2 Million Credit
of April 9, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1975

Cr. No. S-14   Irrigation Engineering Project; $3.15 Million Credit
of April 92 1973: Closing Date July 31, 1975
Not yet effective. The project was originally financed by IDL
Credits No. S-8 and S-10 of 1969 and 1970. The studies financed under
Credit S-8 have been completed, except for some final payments to the
consultants. The studies financed under Credit S-10 are expected to be
completed by December 31, 1974.
Cr. No.        Foodgrain Storage Project; $19.7 Million Credit
of May 18, 1973; Closing Date December 31, 1974.
Not yet effective. The project was originally financed by a
$19.2 million IDA Credit No. 83 of 1966 and a 25 million Kronor credit
from the Kingdom of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden is again providing a
25 million Kronor Credit. The project is almost completed and 95 percent
of the new IDA and Swedish credits will go toward repaying the previous
credits. The remaining funds ($1.25 million from IDA and about $0.25
million equivalent from Sweden) will be used to pay outstanding bills for
work completed prior to the war, completion of some supporting facilities
for the grain storage silos, replacement of spares and equipment dAmaged
during the war, strengthening of the infestation control system, and a
feasibility study for a second grain storage project.

TECHNICAL NOTE ON
AN EDUCATION PROJECT
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.        This technical note is based on the findings of a mission 1/ which
visited Bangladesh from July 28 to August 18, 1972, to reappraise two IDA
education projects assisted under Credits Nos. 49-PAK (March, 1964), and
87-PAK (June, 1966), to Pakistan. The credits were extended to assist the
agricultural university at Mymensingh, 13 technical training institutes and a
technical teacher training college. The total original cost of the projects
was estimated at US$30.8 million; the combined total of the two credits was
US$17.5 million of which US$7.7 million has been disbursed.
2.        Work on the projects was initially delayed due to the belated
engagement of consultant architects and later by shortages of local funds and
building materials. In consequence, the Closing Date for the project under
No. 49-PAK was extended from December 31, 1968, to June 30, 1971. The
Closing Date for No. 87-PAK remained at June 30, 1972. The 1971 conflict
completely interrupted implementation and, after consultation with the
Pakistan Government, IDA suspended disbursements from the credits in
December 29, 1971. Work was resumed in January, 1972, at a much reduced rate.
3.        The Bangladesh Government gives both projects high priority and has
asked the Association to resume its financial assistance. It has indicated,
however, that the university is to develop courses with a more practical bias
and intends to provide a revised university development plan, full details
of which have yet to be worked out. No major changes are foreseen in the
technical institutes component. An IDA credit of $21.0 million to Bangladesh
is now proposed to replace the two earlier credits.
B.   BACKGROUND
4.        Bangladesh, with 75 million people in an area about the size of
Greece, is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Per
capita income is believed to be less than US$70. The country is not self-
sufficient in food production although over 80% of the population is directly
engaged in agriculture which contributes over half of GDP. Illiteracy is
widespread and is estimated at over 80%. Adding to these long standing
problems, the country recently suffered severe destruction due to natural
and political events - the cyclone in late 1970 and civil disruption and war
in 1971. Since the beginning of 1972 the country has been endeavouring to
rebuild the economy and restore normal life.

and Miss M. Grosse.



ANNEX IV
Page 4
5.        Education, both within and outside the formal school system, is
receiving considerable attention: the 1972-73 budget allocates to education
20% of total recurrent expenditure and 5.7% of total capital expenditure,
ratios which accord with those of other developing countries. The govern-
ment has not yet developed long-term educational policies and strategies
but an educational development plan is now being prepared. Meanwhile, it
appears that the Government intends to increase emphasis on meeting the
practical needs of a rural society and i:he demand for technically trained
people in the modern sector of the economy. Increased agricultural production
is vital to the new nation of Bangladesh and would be aided by the education,
rebearch and ex-ension work carried by the country's only agricultural
university at Mymensingh. Industrial development is also essential to the
new state and the technical institutes would help to meet the need for skilled
workers and technicians.
C.   THE PROJECT
6.        The two projects which were re-appraised had been assisted by
Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK. The former, for $4.5 million, was to
az;sist a project estimated to cost US$9.2 million. The latter, for $13 mil-
lion, was made to assist a second project, estimated to cost $21.6 million,
complementing the first project. The two projects together comprised:
(a) the construction of buildings, the purchase and installa-
tion of equipment for the establishment or expansion of
facilities at the agricultural university at Mymensingh
and provision for overseas fellowships for university
staff;
(b) the construction of buildings for five technical institutes
and the purchase and installation of equipment for these
five and eight other technical institutes; and
(c) the provision of equipment, expatriate teachers and training
grants for technical teachers to upgrade the Technical Teacher
Training College, Dacca.
The proposed project would remain fundamentally the same as provided for
under Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK (Reports Nos. TO-397a, P-486; and
TO-534a, P-364, respectively), and involve the completion of civil works,
equipment procurement and technical assistance still outstanding.
Agricultural University
7.        The agricultural university was established in 1961 to train
agriculturists, farm managers, extension workers, researchers and educators,
and high level personnel for the agricultural industries. The university
comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and has no official
connection with the Ministry of Agriculture or with other Ministries,
Departments and agencies which also offer agricultural education and training.



ANNEX IV
Page 5
The government is aware that training programs of the university and other
related agencies have yet to be coordinated and intends to effect improve-
ments.
8.        Courses.  Since the 1966 appraisal, the university has added two
new BSc degree programs, in Fisheries and Agricultural Statistics, and
several post-graduate courses leading to Master of Science degrees. It now
has six faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Animal Husbandry,
Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Economics and Fisheries to which may
later be added Faculties of Forestry and Home Economics; the latter would
focus on training women for community development roles. The university has
recently set up a committee to review its academic programs. Pending its
findings, the university's programs remain basically unchanged.
9.        Research. The 1966 appraisal report indicated that the university
was expecting to increase its research and relate it more closely to research
supported by government agencies. University research has increased gradually
during recent years but there is need for closer collaboration between this
work and that of the agricultural agencies. The government feels that
university research has not been sufficiently related to the immediate problems
of the agricultural economy. The university shares this view and, in col-
laboration with other agencies, is preparing recommendations to the government
for coordinating agricultural education and research and relating them to
the country's needs.
10.       Extension.  Extension training at Mymensingh is limited.    Altogether,
total enrollment in pre-service and in-service courses in extension services,
refresher courses for rural science teachers and short courses for government
employees was planned for about 1,000 annually. The new Department of Agri-
cultural Extension of the University estimates that about 500-600 students
are enrolled in its courses. The department has also organized a small
University Extension Project area as a field laboratory for students and
teachers. To date, about 200 farmers, 100 secondary school teachers and a
few Agricultural Development Bank personnel have been trained by the Department,
some of the training being in short courses.
11.       Enrollment.  University admission was originally determined on the
basis of interviews and the matriculation (10th grade) examinations. In
1970-71 entrance requirements were raised from 10th to 12th grade and the
course shortened from a six-year to a four-year program. In 1966, approximately
half of the student body was supported by scholarship assistance: at present
all students receive financial assistance. Approximately 85% of the students
come from poor rural families and earn additional money by cultivating
university land and performing other manual tasks.
12.       Although financing of the development of the university was divided
into two stages (incorporated in the 1964 and 1966 IDA credits), the construc-
tion and equipment at each stage were an integral part of a Master Plan to
expand the academic program and increase the undergraduate enrollment from
1,000 students in 1964 to 3,500 in 1974. The university was to produce
approximately 900 graduates during 1965-1970 and 2,600 during 1970-75. By
1975, it was to produce annually over 90% of the country's agricultural



ANNEX IV
Page 6
graduates. Implementation delays and the war severely disrupted the develop-
ment schedule. According to the Master Plan, combined undergraduate and
graduate enrollment by 1971-72 should have been 3,195 with an output of 500
which compares with figures of 1,700 1/ and an output estimated at 360.
Because the university closed during part of 1971 and final examinations
were disrupted, the classes due to graduate in 1970 actually passed out two
years later. With new entrants expected in September and December, 1972,
it is anticipated that, by January 1973, enrollment will be 2,000. The
university, by accelerating enrollments and intensifying teaching schedules,
is now aiming at the 3,500 target for 1977 (Appendix 1).
13.       It is estimated that in the past five years about 50% of the
graduates from the Agricultural Faculty and almost all those from other
faculties went into government service, the majority into Ministry of
Agriculture extension programs. Of those who did not do so, most work for
autonomous bodies where the pay has been higher. There are indications that
the Ministry's Extension Department needs many more extension agents than
the university is supplying.
14.       Staff.  The faculty is still intact and the educational qualifica-
tions of the teaching staff are impressile: out of a total staff of 207,
69 are Ph Ds and 39 hold other foreign degrees, mostly MSc's. In addition,
about 24 teachers are currently studying abroad. This teaching staff,
augmented as necessary by the University's new MSc graduates to teach lower
level courses, should be sufficient to meet increased student enrollments.
15.       Future Development.   The government, in reconsidering its educa-
tional policies, is particularly concerned with their relation to agricul-
tural and rural development and therefore with the role of the agricultural
university at Mymensingh. The Annual Development Plan for 1972-73 stated
that, "the university has to undertake extensive training of farmers in
modern methods of agriculture in association with the cooperatives and
finance the programs out of its own allocation in the current year on a high
priority basis". However, the Government has not yet reached a decision on
matters affecting the direction of the University's future development. In
particular, the structure and functions of the University and its relation-
ship with planned farmer training and rural development programs have still
to be explicitly stated. During negotiations the government has agreed to
provide a development plan for the agricultural university within six months
of the signing of the Credit Agreement and to exchange views on it with the
Association.
16.       Implementation.   Implementation has been retarded by various
causes, such as delays in the appointment of the consultant architects and
by shortage of local funds and building materials. More recently, the 1971
conflict interrupted construction. Today, about 44% of construction work
included in the two projects has been completed (Appendix 2). Most of the
teaching and research accommodation has been constructed or commenced.
1/   Because of recent disruption, statistics for the University after
1970-71 are for the most part estimates by the registrar.



ANNEX IV
Page 7
Accommodation is still required for food technology programs, the veterinary
clinic, an auditorium and library, student hostels and staff housing. Addi-
tional site development is also needed. Repair of the physical facilities,
which were only slightly damaged during the war, is in progress and financed
by the university budget. New construction has been resumed from Government
resources but at a reduced rate because of the lack of materials. The three
consultant architectural firms have discontinued work pending decisions by
the government regarding their contracts. The main firm, Paul Rudolph, which
holds the copyright of the campus Master Plan and building designs, is un-
likely to resume work until an agreement is reached with the Government
regarding payment for services already rendered. However, negotiations have
started between the concerned parties and progress has been made toward
resolving differences. The employment of competent architectural consultants
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association would be a condition
of disbursement against expenditures for the university item in the proposed
credit.
17.       Instructional equipment and books already procured represent 55%
of allocated funds. Lists for the remainder of the equipment have been
approved by the Association. The former credits provided for 50 man-years
of overseas study. Eight candidates have completed their studies; four
others will complete their courses about February, 1974. It is anticipated
that 10 out of the 12 fellows will return to the university in compliance
with their five-year bond. The project contains provision for a further
eight fellowships for overseas study (Appendix 3). During negotiations the
government has agreed that, before these fellowships are awarded, the
university will discuss with the Association its proposals for the award of
these fellowships.
18.       The Credit Agreement for No. 87-PAK required the Project Unit
to be headed by a full-time Director. This condition has not always been
observed, partly due to the recent disturbances, and at one time the post
remained vacant for about 16 months. The problem has adversely affected
implementation of the project. To ensure effective implementation, the
appointment of a full-time Project Director acceptable to the Association
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Technical Institutes and Technical Teacher Training College
19.       The two former Credits also provided assistance in an amount of
US$8.0 million for 13 technical institutes and the technical teacher training
college at Dacca to help them train engineering technicians. The project
institutes, plus three others, make up a system of 16 technical institutes
located so as to provide technical education facilities in each of the major
regions of Bangladesh. Their enrollment was to increase from 4,000 in 1964-65
to over 12,000 in 1969-70 but due to the events referred to in para 4, total
enrollment in 1971 was only 8,750 and the target is now expected to be reached
in 1975 (Appendix 4).
20.       Administration and Planning of Technical Education.   The structure
of technical education administration remains unchanged (Chart) and the
administration appears to be functioning well. Planning is the immediate



ANNEX IV
Page 8
responsibility of an Assistant Director in the Technical Education Division
whose proposals are submitted through the Education Planning Division to the
Bangladesh Planning Commission and to the Development Department in the
Ministry of Finance. All departments have been asked to present their 5-year
development plans before the end of July, 1973. The planning process appears
to work reasonably well although the available labor market information is
not sufficient for considering educational investment alternatives. The
government is aware of the need for manpower planning to provide the basis
for rational further development of vocational training and for better
coordination between the Ministries of Education and of Labor which operate
skill training programs and is taking steps to overcome these deficiencies.
21.       Enrollment.   Precise up-to-date information about curricula, the
student body, output projections and staffing of the institutes is not
available. The staff is adequate; entrants are available and enrollments at
the new institutes are planned to make up for lost outputs (Appendix 4).
Labor market information is virtually non-existent and only broad estimates
can be made about the current and prospective demand for graduates of the
project institutions. Limited information available suggests that currently
there is unemployment among technicians. This is said to be a temporary
effect of the war and its aftermath which have reduced opportunities for
technical employment, rather than a basic imbalance between supply and needs.
Data on enrollments of graduate engineers from the four engineering univer-
sities and colleges suggest that the stock and annual output of graduate
engineers will reach 4,780 and 800 respectively by 1975 (Appendix 5). In
comparison, by 1975 the total technical institute system will have a projected
enrollment of 12,623 and an estimated annual output of 3,500. The ratio
(1:4.5) of engineers to technicians appears reasonable. In order to relate
better education and training to manpower needs, the government has agreed
to provide, within twelve months of signing the Credit Agreement, its plan
for a survey of the needs for, and the development of, skilled industrial
manpower at graduate, technician and skilled craftsman levels.
22.       The Technical Teacher Training College in Dacca, which provides
staff for the technical institutes, lost about 75 trainees because of the
closing of the college during the war. However, the staffing of the project
institutions has not been impeded since there was a reduced demand arising from
slow implementation. Three of the four staff teacher trainers were trained
abroad under Credit 49-PAK. Indications are that the program can be re-
instated without difficulty. The 1972 intake of two-year degree candidates
was doubled to 60 and the enrollment of one-year degree candidates will be
restored to the normal figure of 75. There is no shortage of well qualified
candidates from amongst graduates of the institutes and engineering colleges.
23.       Implementation.   The 13 technical institutes sustained little damage
during the war and repair work is proceeding. Procurement of the instruc-
tional equipment financed by Credit No. 49-PAK for the existing eight insti-
tutes is about 93% complete although about $68,000 will be necessary for the
replacement of damaged or lost equipment. The three-year program for supplying
expatriate teachers to the Technical Teacher Training College and the overseas
training of local teacher trainers for the College staff, financed by the



ANNEX IV
Page 9
same credit, has been completed. However, equipment to the value of about
US$170,000 for demonstration workshops at the Dacca Technical Institute, also
to be used by the neighboring Technical Teacher Training College, has yet to
be procured.
24.       Construction work at the five technical institutes (Barisal,
Bogra, Pabna, Rangpur and Sylhet) partially financed by Credit No. 87-PAK
is about 50% complete (Appendix 6). Work is proceeding slowly because of
shortage of materials although government has budgeted sufficient funds.
The consultant architects have agreed to continue to supervLse construction.
without an increase in fees. The ermployment of consultant architects/engineers
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association would be a condition
of disbursement against expenditure from the credit for the technical
institutes item. About 75% of the instructional equipment remains to be
procured and lists have already been approved by the Association.
25.       Project Units were originally established for the implementation
of each of the former projects under the Directorate of Technical Education.
Integration of the two Project Units under a full-time Project Director
acceptable to the Association would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit. In short, no difficulties are foreseen in completing the
technical education component of the project as originally envisaged; the
training programs remain essentially unchanged, the units administering the
institutes and the project itself are satisfactory and the government has
assigned high priority to this type of education.
D.   PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
26.       Project Costs.   The total cost of the project is now estimated
at US$36.34 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$14.62 million or 40% of the total project cost. This estimate represents
an increase of 18% over the original estimated total cost of US$30.8 million
equivalent. The estimated local currency requirement has risen by about
10%, from Tks 141 million 1/ (US$19.4 million) to Tks 158 million (US$21.7
million), due to increased costs of construction arising from material
shortages, higher transportation costs and minimum wage rates. The foreign
exchange component at $14.6 million is 28% higher than the $11.4 million
original estimate due to the price escalation of imported material for
construction and furniture and instructional equipment from the time of
appraisal in 1964 to 1972.
27.       Of total cost, US$17.32 million relates to the works completed
prior to January 1, 1972. The estimated costs and foreign exchange component
of the work required to complete the projects as originally envisaged at the
time of appraisal are given in Appendix 7 and summarized below together
with the costs of the works completed prior to January 1, 1972:
1/   Or Rs 92.3 million at the Tk/Rs exchange rate prevailing at the time
of reappraisal, August, 1972.

The estimated cost of the work required to complete the projects is based on
recent building costs in Bangladesh and on equipment lists prepared by the
Bengali authorities (Appendix 8). Contingencies are equivalent to 8% of the
total estimated costs to complete the project, based on estimated increase
in prices of 5% p.a. and on the implementation schedule in Aippendix 9.
28.       Project Financing. The proposed credit of US$21.0 million
equivalent would finance (i) notional payment to the Association of the prin-
cipal amount of US$7.68 withdrawn under Credits Nos. 49-PAK and 87-PAK; (ii)
the amount of US$13.32 million, or about 70% of the total cost (US$19.02
million) of the works and services needed to complete the project. Included
in this latter amount would be repayment of the foreign exchange portion of
the amount outstanding for consulting services incurred under Credit Nos.
49-PAK and 87-PAK before January 1, 1972 (about US$0.35 million) and re-
imbursements to the Swedish Government for that portion of the SIDA interim
credit 1/ which may be disbursed by the time the proposed credit becomes
effective (Appendix 10).
29.       The estimated foreign exchange required to complete the project
is US$9.55 million. This amount would be completely covered by the proposed
credit and about US$3.77 equivalent or 28% of the credit would meet local
currency expenditures.   Thus, the credit would finance about Tks 27.4 million
of local currency requirements of the works and services to complete the
project leaving about Tks 41.5 million for government financing.
30.       The following table, given in greater detail at Appendix 11 shows the
present disbursement position and the revised cost and credit allocation:
1/   The Swedish Interim Credit of US$11 million equivalent to Bangladesh,
signed on June 1, 1972, included financing for urgent expenditures
iacurred under the East Pakistan education projects under Credit Nos.

of disbursements; and (c) funds for repayment to Sweden of amount it may
have advanced under the Swedish Interim Credit.
E.   IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
32.       Implementation Period.   The project would be completed in about
five years (Appendix 9) from the date of credit effectiveness. Construction
at the university would require four and one-quarter years, a total of 12.5
years as against the original estimate of four years. One further year would
be required at the five technical institutes, a total of eight years as
against the appraisal estimate of six years.
33.       Administration.   The Project Unit at the university would continue
to be responsible for the administrative and financial control of the agri-
cultural university project item. The Project Unit established in the
Directorate of Technical Education for former credit No. 87-PAK would absorb
the staff of the Project Unit for credit No. 49-PAK and continue to be
responsible for the administrative and financial control of the technical
education project item: the integration of these two Units under a full-time
project director would be a condition of effectiveness of the new credit
(para 25).
34.       Consultants.   It is believed that the government desires to
continue the services of two architectural consulting firms (paras 16 and
24). The re-appointment of these firms or appointment of new firms upon terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association would be a condition of
disbursement against each entity of the project, namely, the agricultural
university and the technical institutes.



ANNEX IV
Page 14
35.       Procurement.   Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA Guidelines for Procurement. Following previous experience
with the projects, it is expected that all civil works and most furniture
contracts would be awarded to local firms. Nearly all equipment is likely
to be procured overseas. Preferred domestic manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% or the existing rate
of import duties whichever is the lower, over the price of competing imports.
At present imports of educational equipment are exempted from duties but
the government is reviewing its overall tariff policy.
36.       Disbursement. Disbursement (Appendices 12 and 13) would be on
the basis of : (a) 100% of foreign expenditures on (i) instructional
equipment and books, (ii) imported materials and equipment for construction
and furniture, (iii) architects and engineers' services and (iv) technical
assistance; (b) 60% of local currency expenditures for construction and
furniture for tae agricultural university and the five technical institutes.
The above percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements
over the implementation of the project and to ensure full disbursement.
Disbursement schedules include estimated reimbursements against expenditures
incurred from January 1, 1972.
F.   BEN4EFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
37.       Although the benefits expected from the project are not quantifiable,
some indications can be given of the contribution the project would make
to economic development in Bangladesh, specifically in regard to the role
that the agricultural university at Mymensingh and the technical institutes
would have in supplying trained manpower for agriculture and industry.
38.       Mymensingh is the only agricultural university in Bangladesh
and the need for its graduates is made clear, in the absence of accurate
manpower data, by the increasing number of expatriate agricultural
specialists employed for identifying, preparing and carrying out agricultural
projects. It is regrettable that development at Mymensingh has been much
delayed and that in 1972 the university enrolled only a total of 1,800 as
against a planned target of about 3,000. With the emphasis on agricultural
development which is now a feature of economic policy in Bangladesh, the
estimated output of 750 p.a. of the university at fu:Ll capacity in 1978
would meet only a modest proportion of the needs for agricultural graduates.
Furtlher expansion, however, cannot be programmed at this moment due to
budgetary constraints; it also awaits a fuller definition of the role that
the university is to play in the future (para 15). Mymensingh would also
help increase development through its research activities which would focus
on high yielding varieties of basic staples in an environment similar to
that within the reach of the average farmer.
39.       The technical institutes are the main source of supply for middle
level technical manpower in engineering. At the time of appraisal of the
two IDA projects assisting their development, it was estimated that their



ANNEX IV
Page 15
planned output of 4-5,000 p.a. would have met about half of the need of the
industrial sector for technicians and helped increase industrial productivity
in Bangladesh. As indicated in paragraph 20, the information at present
available on labor market is not sufficient to estimate future manpower needs
for industrial growth; in addition, due to the disruption caused by the
disturbances of 1971, industry is suffering a recession and, therefore, there
are indications that not all the graduates of the last few years have been
absorbed. These factors, however, have also slowed down growth in the
enrollment at and the output of the institutes. It is now anticipated that
output would be about 1,500-1,800 p.a. from 1975 onwards; even if industrial
development were not to achieve a new momentum, this limited output would
be required to improve the technical departments of the central and provincial
governments to implement needed programs for transportation, water supply
and electrification development.
40.       Both the university and the technical institutes are expected to
have a significant role as a part of the government plans to improve income
distribution. This is shown, primarily, by the reform of the programs at
Mymensingh which as a part of the redirection of Bangladesh agricultural
policy would direct its courses of study closer to the practical needs of
agriculture. The technical institutes, strategically located throughout
the country in towns with a central role in the provinces, would supply
graduates largely for government technical services and improve the government
capability in extending the infrastructure required to increase the standards
of living in rural areas.
41.       In summary, these benefits expected from the project indicate its
suitability as an integral part of the Bank Group lending strategy for
Bangladesh which is addressed to rural development, economic diversification
and better standards of living at the village level.
G.   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
42.       During credit negotiations, agreement was reached with the govern-
ment on the following principal points:
(a) the development plan and the fellowship program for the
Bangladesh Agricultural University (paras 15 and 17); and
(b)  the preparation of a plan for the survey of the needs
for and the development of skilled industrial manpower
(para 21).
43.       In addition to the customary conditions, the appointment of a full
time director to the Agricultural University Project Unit (para 18) and the
integration into one Unit of the Project Units for the technical education
project component (para 24) would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit.
44.       A condition of disbursement against expenditures for the
university item would be the employment of architectural consultants on terms



ANNEX IV
Page 16
and conditions acceptable to the Association (para 16). A similar condition
of disbursement would apply against expenditures for the technical institutes
item (para 24).
45.       The project is suitable for a development credit of US$21.0 million to
the Government of Bangladesh.

facilities and the requirements of graduates in the different areas
in agriculture as may be determined by the government.
