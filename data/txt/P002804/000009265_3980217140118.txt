A.   Project Development Objective and Project Description
1.    Introduction
The agricultural sector is the main pillar of Tanzanian economy. It contributes 60% of the country's GDP, 61%
to export earnings and provides 84% of rural employment. It has been realized that accelerated agricultural
growth can be achieved by increasing the productivity of the land base, focusing on the smallholder sector.
Agricultural research plays a major role in this development as increased productivity depends on the
application of scientific knowledge to generate improved technologies for the production systems. Agricultural
extension complements this effort by transferring technology developed by research to the farmer. In a drive to
increase smallholder productivity, a National Agriculture and Livestock Research Project (NALRP, Cr. 1970-
TA) has been supported by IDA since August 1989, along with a national extension project (Cr. 1994-TA)
which has been succeeded by a second phase National Agricultural Extension Project (NAEP II, Cr. 2899-TA)
which became effective in October 1996. Both the research and extension projects are regarded by the
Government as the top two core activities of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The proposed Tanzania
Agricultural Research Project (TARP) would be the second in support of the national program of research; IDA
would finance a time slice of the long-term national agricultural research program.
2.    Project Development Objectives and Key Performance Indicators
The project would support the generation of technology to increase efficiency and productivity of crop and
livestock production systems with sustainable use of natural resources, focusing on the needs of the smallholder
sector. The project would continue to support the institutional development of the national agricultural research
system and assist in decentralizing financial resource management, operational decision-making and the
fonnulation of research agendas to zonal research stations; support privatization of research as appropriate;
emphasize client-oriented adaptive research; and further strengthen farmer-extension-research linkages,
inc][uding by emphasizing the farming systems research approach. The project will assist in human resource
development, and will support the improvement of research planning, zonal research management, and
monitoring and evaluation procedures.
3.    Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The project will have the following main components.

and agro-forestry); (ii) strengthen research infrastructure in
Sokoine Agricultural University (SUA) and provide support for
research programs; (iii) assist in establishing Zonal Agricultural
Research Funds (ZARFs; through pilots in a few zones
initially), and establish guidelines for operating the ZARFs on a
demand-driven basis; and (v) help in breeder seed production at
the zonal research stations.

technical assistance; (iv) selective rehabilitation of research
stations, equipment and infrastructure; and (v) strengthening
financial management and accounting, information and
communication services, documentation and library services,
and research monitoring and evaluation.
Total      22.98        100
4.    Benefits and target population
The direct benefits of the project would include:
* more effective and efficient agricultural research institutions capable of cost effectively addressing the
problems of farmers in the major ecologies of the country;
* improved capacity for training of scientific personnel;
* a better trained and motivated cadre of agricultural researchers; and
* improved research-extension-farmer linkages for speedier and more effective transfer of technologies.
The project will benefit agriculturists and livestockists but it will particularly help most of the 3.5 million
smallholders in the country. By increasing livestock and agricultural productivity, it will help reduce poverty,
increase food security, and improve nutrition levels. Women who constitute over 50% of the smallholder
farmers will particularly benefit. Through generation of messages related to improved fallows, afforestation, and
anti-erosion techniques the project would have a positive impact on soil fertility, conservation and water
management. The project will have complementarity with the National Agricultural Extension Project II and
assist in improved and more dynamic linkages with extension and farmers.

5.   Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation period: 5 years
Executing agencies: The Department of Research and Training under the Ministry of Agriculture; Zonal
Research Stations for zonal research and Sokoine University of Agriculture.
PrDject Coordination. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) under the Principal Secretary MOA will conduct
periodical reviews and give directions on policy and implementation issues; the NARC will be the main
advisory body and coordinate with other national research programs, and with private sector research as needed;
each zone would have an empowered zonal executive committee which would approve the zonal research
agenda, sanction expenditure proposals, recommend the annual budget to the MOA, and make required
operational decisions; a committee on 'donor coordination and collaborative research' under the Commissioner
Research and Training will be responsible for coordinating with donors and regional and international research
bodies for collaborative research. Several bilateral donors: EEC, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden and the United Kingdom have endorsed the objectives of TARP II and agreed to support one or more of
its proposed activities. As a member of two sub-regional research organizations namely Southern African
Ceniter for Cooperation in Agricultural Research and Association for the Strengthening of Agricultural Research
in Southern and Central Africa (SACCAR and ASARECA), Tanzania is well-positioned to access the
technologies that it requires from regional collaborative programs and adapt them to meet the needs of its
farning community. At the zonal research stations the zonal director assisted by the zonal research coordinator,
would be responsible for project implementation. The zonal executive committee would be responsible for
overseeing project implementation and provide guidance on policy and operational issues.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): NARC and the PSC will provide policy guidance, and PSC will
oversee implementation. The Commissioner Research and Training would be the chief executive for project
implementation and would be assisted by a deputy, a planning and monitoring officer, a procurement specialist
and a project accountant.
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements: A financial management and accounting
sysitem was established under the ongoing NALRP which will be further strengthened. A financial and
accounting management manual developed through Dutch technical assistance would provide operating
procedures and reporting formats. The Controller and Auditor General of Tanzania would conduct an annual
audit of the project accounts, SOEs and the Special Accounts. The Government will provide the annual audit
report to IDA within 6 months after the close of the Government fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The DRT will be responsible for overall monitoring of the project
and its periodic evaluation. It will prepare periodic reports on project implementation status and issues, and
furnish these to the PSC and IDA regularly. These reports will also be distributed to the zonal research stations.
The zonal stations will monitor their implementation progress, generally and particularly, in terms of the agreed
performance indicators; and these reports will be discussed in the zonal executive committee. A detailed project
evaluation would be carried out at mid-term and on project completion. The project mid-term review (MTR)
would be carried out in the second quarter of fiscal year 2000/01. Project evaluation will also include surveys
and studies to measure impact of the new technologies developed by the zonal research stations, and beneficiary
assessment of the impact of the technologies developed by research and carried to the farmers by extension.

B.    Strategic Context
Country Assistance Strategy(CAS)   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report # 16654-
objective(s) supported by the project  TA, May 6, 1997 and discussed at the Board on June 20, 1997.
1.    Main sector issues and Government strategy
Tanzania's medium term development strategy is to increase the economic growth rate to a minimum of six
percent by the year 2000, and to even higher levels subsequently. A key pre-condition for this is to ensure an
agricultural production expansion rate of about five percent per annum through application of yield enhancing
technologies/inputs together with some increase in acreage under cultivation. The CAS thus calls for efforts
focusing on raising agricultural productivity. The basis for overall growth and agricultural growth in particular,
is to be strengthened by the provision of economic services (research and extension, rural access roads, water
resource development and links between social and economic services) for smallholders. In this regard, the
Government would be building upon the agricultural sector reforms implemented over time and addressing key
sectoral issues, including the liberalization of agricultural processing, marketing and pricing and provision of
basic infrastructure. In tandem, the Government would seek to promote off-farm activities and strengthen the
environment for private sector development to further boost the rural sector.
In the short term, the Government will continue to support the improvement of market efficiency, particularly
with respect to agricultural inputs, the enhancement of smallholder productivity through research and extension
activities and further rehabilitation and development of rural infrastructure such as roads and irrigation. In the
longer term, the Government will also address other critical issues such as the rural payment system and
financial services, land tenure reforms, and resource and environmental management.
2.    Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
The project reflects the country's development objectives and the CAS. It is designed to: (i) continue to support
efforts to reshape the role of the MOA limiting its core functions to policy formulation, regulation, extension
and essential research which cannot be carried out in the private sector; assisting the Ministry in downsizing and
decentralization to the field units; and privatizing research as feasible; (ii) reducing the research burden on the
Government budget by providing that all cash crop research will be self-financing, and excluding it from the
Government budget and the proposed project support; (iii) enhancing the farmer's role in generation and
dissemination of technology and making these processes more participatory; (iv) developing the human
resource base; and (vi) increasing agricultural growth and farmer incomes, particularly of the smallholder sector.
C.   Project Rationale
1.    Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
Two main alternatives were considered for the institutional arrangement for public sector agricultural research:
a centralized arrangement with a strong DRT headquarters (as has been the case during the NALRP
implementation) or a decentralized arrangement with empowered zonal research stations responding to demand-
driven research needs and with a limited headquarters role. As the zonal research centers are the real

workstations for research and are closer to the users and stakeholders, the unanimous choice favored the
decentralized arrangement, with stakeholders providing an effective say through the zonal executive committee.
Another choice to be made concerned the role of SUA in the national agricultural research program (so far SUA
has not participated in mainstrean agricultural research). In view of the substantial human resources available in
SUA and their comparative advantage in several research fields, it was decided unanimously that SUA will be
"mainstreamed" in the national agricultural research program and would be deemed as the eighth center of
research with both a national and a zonal mandate.
Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned).

stations for research should have financial and operational autonomy to carry out their mandate: (the proposed
project provides for institutionally, financially and administratively empowered zonal research stations); (b) the
stakeholders should have an effective voice in priority setting of the agricultural research agenda and securing a
demand-driven research program: (the institutional arrangement of a zonal executive committee with substantial
representation of research users and other stakeholders would help to secure this objective); (c) focus should be
on financial sustainability of research: ((i) Government has privatized tea research and has taken steps to
privatize research in several other commercial crops such as tobacco, cotton, pyrethrum and sisal; (ii)
Government has levied a cess on several commercial commodities to pay for the research costs and more crops
are planned to be covered; (iii) Government has agreed to provide budget and project funds only for foodcrops,
livestock and factor program research; (iv) the zonal stations are being encouraged to raise resources for
meeting part of the recurrent costs and revenue retention accounts have been established in all the zonal research
stations; and (v) the establishment of the zonal agriculture research funds (ZARFs) would further promote
raising of extra-budgetary resources to fund research; (d) poor levels of compensation for scientists are
responsible for a poor "enabling environment" with negative impact on scientist motivation, efficiency and
results: (consequent upon the recent implementation of the revised pay grades (merging all special allowances
into salary) the Government has taken a policy decision not to continue any special pay and special allowances:
however, in discussion with the Treasury and the Civil Services Commission, a special incentive package is
being developed by MOA to reward talented scientists for notable outputs); (e) more pro-active measures are
needed to foster effective farmer-extension-research linkages: (all commodity research under the proposed
project would be based on the farming systems approach, and at least 50% of the research trials/demonstrations
would be on farmers' fields). Funds to carry out this objective have been included in the proposed project.
Other related specific measures to be incorporated in the proposed project include pilot initiatives to support
farmer research groups, farmer seed groups, and "action research" projects, close collaboration and interaction
through joint preparation of the research and extension annual work plans, joint implementation of
trials/demonstrations, training and action research initiatives and providing an identified budget at zonal level to
carry out these activities); (f) counterpart funding and timely release of funds for project activities: (appropriate
arrangements would be reflected in the legal covenants); and (g) there is scope to reduce the research
establishment and to manage it more cost effectively. The government has agreed to reduce the number of
research units from 47 to 23 and drawn up a time-bound plan to close/transfer/downgrade the redundant centers;
action to implement this plan has already commenced.
3.    Lessons from Agricultural Research Projects Implemented in Uganda, Malawi and Kenya
For better results priority should be accorded to the zonal/regional research centers in matters of institutional
strengthening and financial and operational empowerment, instead of starting the reform process with the apex
level of the research organization; (b) strong decentralization of operational and financial powers to
zonal/regional research centers has improved quality of research outputs, besides it has promoted demand-
driven research; (c) very high dollar-denominated compensation packages are not sustainable, (besides, these
generally attract scientists close to the age of retirement); and (d) institutional development of an agricultural
research system is a long-term undertaking, and IDA has taken the correct approach of supporting time slices of
the national research program.

4.    Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership
The Govermment has accorded to agricultural research the highest priority for allocation of development
resources. The Government established a planning team for project preparation and the proposed project has
been prepared by the Tanzanians. The Government positions described in para 10 show that for a sustainable
project the Government has shown willingness to adopt tough options.
5.    Value Added of Bank Support
Besides providing the largest share in the financial resources for carrying out the project, IDA collaboration is
expected to make a significant contribution in the design of the institutional restructuring, modernization and
strengthening of the recently decentralized research system. This would include establishing procedures for
planning and prioritizing research programs, building effective linkages within the national research system as
well as with external research institutions of repute, introducing participatory approaches to agricultural
research planning and implementation, and assisting the client with the wealth of experience gained by IDA in
promoting cost-effective and relevant agricultural research systems in over 40 countries since 1980. This
project will build on the achievements of the IDA-funded NALRP (Cr. 1970-TA) which has focused mainly on
facilitating institutional reform, building research infrastructure and providing limited training opportunities
(due to close 09/97). The project would also help in securing coordination with other donors and harmonizing
various approaches to the development of an agricultural research system and in financing the needed technical
assistance.

2.    Technical Assessment
The project design is sound and takes into account lessons learned from the operations of the ongoing NALRP
(Cr. 1970-TA) since 1989 and from regional experiences. NALRP helped in creating an appropriate
institutional structure for the research organization and strengthened the -infrastructure by supplying the required
hardware. The proposed project further builds on this base and places emphasis on the software for undertaking
a sizeable applied and adaptive research program. It provides for a minimum needed infrastructure
rehabilitation (no new civil works), and similarly programs for training a number of scientists in terms of the
required staffing levels. The proposed project inducts SUA as the eighth center for agricultural research thus
making cost effective use of a valuable resource available in the country. In the design of the project, special
care has been taken to (a) address existing weaknesses in research-extension-farmer linkages; (b) enhance
farmer participation in the technology development process; (c) provide that the farming systems research (FSR)

would become an approach for all commodity research and not a separate discipline as in the past; (d) make it
obligatory that a minimum of 50% trials/demonstrations would be on-farm and to include resources in the
program for the same; (d) emphasize the demand-driven aspects by providing that the zonal executive
committee would have a majority of research users and stakeholders represented on it; and (e) strengthen
sustainability by promoting privatization of research as feasible, and ensure that the Government budget and the
proposed project would finance research only for foodcrops, livestock and factor programs, and further, that the
funding for commercial/industrial crops research would be raised through cesses levied on the beneficiaries.
3.    Institutional Assessment
The project would be implemented by the Department of Research and Training ( DRT- includes the zonal
research stations) which is a part of the regular institutional structure of the MOA, and no new parallel
administrative units would be established. Since 1989, the ongoing NALRP has helped in strengthening
capacity for research planning and management, and the scientists and administrators at various levels in the
DRT and in the zonal research stations have gained experience through learning-by-doing, short term technical
assistance, various types of training, and support from IDA and other donors. The professional, management
and skills training of the remaining staff has been programmed in TARP II, based on a needs assessment carried
out by the DRT. Policy guidance would be provided by the Project Steering Committee (PSC) which would
also secure inter-ministerial coordination and be in charge of overall project review; linkages with other
compatible national research programs and with private sector research would be provided by the NARC. With
the establishment of the zonal executive committees and delegation of appropriate administrative and financial
authority to the zones, the zonal research stations would be able to carry out their research mandate and fulfill
the expectations of a demand-driven research.
a. Executing agencies: The DRT of the MOA would have overall responsibility for project implementation;
for carrying out the agreed research programs, the respective zonal research centers and the SUA would be the
main implementing agencies.
b. Project management: The Commissioner Research and Training would be the chief executive for project
implementation and would be assisted by a deputy, a planning and monitoring officer, a procurement specialist
and a project accountant. The Project Steering Committee (comprising of the Ministry's heads of the
departnents, assistant commissioners of crop, livestock and factor program research, the zonal directors of
research and training and the director of postgraduate studies of SUA as members, and representatives of the
concerned ministries as special invitees with head of the project implementation section of DRT as member
secretary), chaired by the Principal Secretary MOA would approve the annual work plan and budget, review
implementation progress and provide policy and operational guidance. NARC would secure linkages with other
compatible national research programs, private sector research and serve as forum for policy advice and
guidance. At the zonal level, the zonal director assisted by the zonal research coordinator would be responsible
for project planning and implementation. The zonal executive committee would approve the zonal annual work
plan and recommend budget to MOA for inclusion in the national budget; it would also be responsible for
general oversight of program implementation. For the SUA research program, the Director of Research and
Postgraduate Studies of SUA would be responsible for planning and implementation, and would report to the
Program Steering Committee established under the SUA-MOA Memorandum of Understanding.

4.    Social Assessment
The project would contribute to broad- based poverty alleviation in the country by supporting technological
change and innovation in agricultural and livestock production, which will improve returns to all production
factors including land and labor, and increase rural incomes. Women constitute more than 50% of Tanzanian
farmers; besides they also play key roles as farm laborers, managers and decision makers, and would continue to
benefit from the agricultural research and extension programs. Increased incomes for women should improve
household food security as women are the major providers of their families.

E.    Sustainability and Risks
1.    Sustainability
The institutional sustainability of the project is enhanced by the fact that there is strong Government ownership.
The project has been designed by the Tanzanians, it would use the existing channels for implementation and no
new parallel implementation units are proposed to be established. The financial sustainability will be aided by
several of the following measures. The project includes initiatives for selective privatization of research. The
Government policy decision that neither the project nor the Government budget would finance research in
commercial/industrial crops (to be funded through cess imposed on beneficiaries of the respective crop) and that
the project funds would be utilized only for crop, livestock and factor program research, would decrease
demands on the Government's limited budget; this coupled with steps taken to promote local resource
generation by the zonal research stations through the revenue retention schemes and the Agricultural Research
Funds (ARFs) would further reduce the levels of Government support needed. After the project closes in 2003,
the Government expects the research program to move to phase three and the existing institutional arrangements
would be available to operate this phase. With a vibrant agricultural sector promoted by a good technology
generation and dissemination system it is expected that the Government in future would be better able to ensure
adequate and timely funding for the publicly financed part of the agricultural research system. The Government
expects that with the above steps its overall share of public expenditure on research should gradually decline
and would continue to be sustainable within the country's public finances.

3.    Possible Controversial Aspects:             None
F.   Implementation Preparedness
Arrangements already in place for executing the Phase I National Agricultural and Livestock Project will be
continued, and will be further strengthened with the establishment before effectiveness of a Project Steering
Committee at the national level and executive committees at the zonal level. A PIP has already been drawn up
which would be adopted before effectiveness. The Government met the conditions of negotiations. The
Government furnished a Letter of Policy on Agricultural Research; a copy each of the finalized Project
Implementation Plan (PIP), Financial Management Manual, Guidelines for the Operation of the Agricultural
Research Funds; and a status report on the progress of implementing the accepted recommendations of the
Financial Management Study report. During Negotiations the Government also confirmed that (a) project
funds to SUA would be provided as a grant; (b) Government would release funds to the zonal research centers
for research on a quarterly basis; and (c) Government would provide adequate counterpart funds for project
expenditures in the respective budgets of 1998/99 and 1999/2000 (Tshs 246 million in 1998/99 and Tshs 132
million in 1999/2000). The Government also conveyed to IDA that it had reviewed the PAD and was in
agreement with the draft. During negotiations a few further modifications to the PAD draft were agreed and the
document was finalized. The Government confirmed that it had no objection to the distribution of the PAD
under IDA's disclosure policy.

Annex 2
Tanzania Agricultural Research Project Phase 2
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$2.93 million (12.8%)
(a) Institutional Development: The project will continue the process of institutional reform of the research
establishment initiated during the first phase research project. The focus of this component would be on
decentralization and zonal empowerment so that the zonal stations, which are closer to the farmers, are able to carry
out mandates of the stakeholders. The specific initiatives will include: (i) redefining roles of DRT, the National
Agricultural Research Council and Zonal Research Stations with emphasis on stakeholder participation; (ii)
establishment of a zonal executive committee with substantial representation of research users; (iii) fnancial and
operational empowerment of the zones; (iv) an effective arrangement for donor coordination and for coordinating
regional and other collaborative research programs; (v) a phased downsizing of the research establishment; and (vi)
supporting initiatives for privatizing research, as feasible. The project would finance costs of research-extension-
farmer linkage activities, consultant costs for establishing information systems and improving financial management
system, and incremental operating costs of zonal research management, and project monitoring and evaluation.
Project Component 2 - US$8.50 million (37%)
(b) Research Programs: The focus of this component would be to support research programs undertaken by the DRT,
to mainstream the SUA into national agricultural research and to promote sustainable research by assisting in the
establishment of the zonal research funds. The project would provide incremental non-salary operating costs for the
priority research programs undertaken by the national livestock research institute, zonal research stations, and the
SUA in foodcrops, livestock and factor programs (e.g. soil conservation, agro-forestry). It would meet limited costs
of strengthening research infrstructure in SUA and provide support for research programs. The project would
assist in establishing zonal agricultural research funds (ZARFs; pilots in a few zones initially) by providing seed
capital, and continue to support the ongoing national ARF; it would help establish guidelines for operating the ARFs
on a demand-driven basis. Assisted by the establishment of irrigation facilities at the research farms the project
would help in breeder seed production at the zonal research stations.
Project Component 3 - US$11.55 million (50.2%)
(c) Resource Development and Management: The component would provide support for the development of human
resource, essential research infrastructure and in improving critical support services and systems. The project would
support: (i) strengthening human resource development; assistance to SUA for carrying out approved training
programs; (ii) consulting services and short-term technical assistance; (iii) selective rehabilitation of research
stations, equipment and infrastructure; and (iv) strengthening financial management and accounting, information
and communication services, documentation and library services, and research monitoring and evaluation. The
project would finance training of the DRT staff, civil works including rehabilitation of selected buildings and
completion of the DRT headquarters building, vehicles and equipment, computers, infrastructure like irrigation
facilities at the research farms, and costs of hard and software for the information and financial systems.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement Arrangements
1. All procurement of goods and works would be done in accordance with "Guidelines for procurement under EBRD Loans and
IDA Credits, January 1995 (revised January and August 1996) Edition". Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for goods and
works would be used. All procurement of consultant services would be done in accordance with "Guidelines, Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997 Edition". Bank's Standard Forms of Contract
[Lumpsum and Complex Time-Based Assignments] would be used. A General Procurement Notice [GPN] is mandatory and
must be published in the UN Development Business as provided for under the Guidelines. GPN would be updated annually.
Specific Procurement Notices will also be required for consulting service contracts above US$200,000 prior to the
preparation of the shortlist.
(a) Civil Works: All civil works contracts amounting to US$2.3 million for rehabilitation and completion of buildings, and
services and for constructing and equipping small irrigation works [in selected centers], each costing less than
US$500,000, will be by NCB. Contracts costing less than US$100,000 including the contract for completing DRT
Headquarters Building [total not exceeding US$260,000] could be completed by force account or by soliciting
quotations from local contractors.
(b) Goods and Equipment: To the extent possible, contracts for goods, such as vehicles, equipment (office, laboratory and
field), computers and furniture shall be grouped into packages estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more and will
be procured by ICB. Contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent [estimated not to exceed US$0.45 million] will be by
NCB. Small contracts of less than US$30,000 equivalent [estimated not to exceed US$1 million] will be procured by
shopping procedures by soliciting at least three quotations from different suppliers. Under ICB, domestic manufacturers
will be allowed a preference of 15% or existing import duty whichever is lower over CIF price of the competing foreign
bidder. All procurement for O&M or miscellaneous items will follow Government procedures which are acceptable to
IDA.
(c) Services: The category of "Services" includes consulting services, technical assistance, training, linkage activities and
contracted research through the Agricultural Research Fund. Consulting services will be required for civil works and for
research programs. All consulting service contracts estimated to cost more than US$ 100,000 will be procured by
Quality - and Cost - Based Selection (QCBS). Consulting service contracts estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 will
be by other methods i.e. selection based on consultant's qualifications for contracts less than $50,000 each and
individual consultants appointed on short-term basis (less than $50,000 each as per Section V of the Guidelines). TOR
for all contracts, all sole source selection of consultants and contracts estimated to cost more than US$50,000 for
individuals and US$100,000 for frms will be subject to IDA prior review.
All other services will be procured in accordance with Annual Workplans following procedures acceptable to IDA.
(d) IDA prior review: Each civil works contract estimated to cost more than US$200,000 equivalent or more and each
goods contract estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more will be subject to IDA prior review as per Appendix I
of the Guidelines. Other contracts will be subject to post review in accordance with Appendix I of the Guidelines. All
consultant contracts estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$100,000 for firns, and equivalent of US$50,000
for individuals would be subject to IDA prior review.
(e) Procurement Plans: At negotiations, two standard bidding documents [one for works and one for goods] and an
overall Procurement Plan and a detailed procurement plan for first year of the project, showing processing time for each
contract would be agreed. By March 31 each year, DRT would update the overall "Procurement Plan" and prepare a
detailed "Annual Procurement Plan" in respect of the following year.

over a 5 year period, and a period of four months after the closing date would be allowed to make payments for the expenditures
actually incurred until the closing date. The annual estimated disbursements are given in a table on page I of the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD).
Statement of Expenditures: Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full documentation, except for items of
expenditures under contracts and purchase orders for (a) goods contracts costing less than the equivalent of US$100,000; (b) civil
works contracts costing less than the equivalent of US$200,000; 0 consultant services contracts for firms costing less than the
equivalent of US$100,000 and individual contracts for US$50,000 equivalent; (d) all force account works; (e) all local training;
and (f) all incremental operating costs would be based on statements of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for
SOEs should be retained by the borrower for IDA review.
Special Account: To facilitate disbursements a Special Account in US dollars would be established and operated at the Bank of
Tanzania or at a commercial Bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Upon project effectiveness, a sum of
US$750,000 would be deposited by IDA into this account. Further deposits by IDA into this account would be made against
withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.
Audit: The project accounts, SOEs and the Special Accounts would be audited each year by the Controller and Auditor General
of Tanzania or by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The auditors' reports and certificates in respect of each of these three
statements of accounts would be furnished to IDA within four months of the close of each fiscal year.
Accounting and Financial Management: Under the phase I project namely the National Agricultural and Livestock Research
Project (NALRP-Cr. 1970-TA) the project financial management was improved ,and a satisfactory accounting and financial
system is in place. The audit reports for NALRP were unqualified and the management report does not indicate any major
accounting issues. The proposed TARP II is a follow on project from NALRP. As a part of the process of improving financial
management and reporting to equip managers with the information for improved project implementation a financial management
study, funded by a bilateral donor, was completed. This study has made numerous recommendations in several areas which
include rationalization of research centers; revision of management structures and personnel matters; funding and disbursement;
fmancial autonomy and control at the zonal level; staffing; financial reporting; and, audit. In addition a draft financial accounting
manual has been prepared. During appraisal the report and its recommendations were reviewed in detail by the mission and
actions were agreed upon. Dates have been established in the implementation plan and an interim report on progress made in
implementing the agreements has been received from the Government. The progress report was discussed during negotiations
and it was agreed that this progress will continue be monitored by IDA during project supervisions; and a financial management
specialist would be included in IDA supervision missions. Besides monitoring the implementation of the agreements these
missions would follow up on the work of upgrading the manual system; make appropriate inputs on the staff training programs;
and follow through on the consultancy to develop the computerized finance and accounting system, and to provide technical
backstopping on financial management.
