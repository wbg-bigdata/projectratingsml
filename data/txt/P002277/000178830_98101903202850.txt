CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for expanding rainfed and swamp
rice production in the Sedhiou District of the Casamance region of Senegal.
The project consists of the strengthening of extension and credit services
needed to expand the area under rainfed rice by 9,500 ha and, through the
construction of necessary water control works, the area under swamp rice by
2,000 ha. About 5,000 farms with some 37,000 ha of rotationally cropped
land would be involved. The project would include the installation of rice
mills and storage needed to handle project production, and the improvement
of roads and tracks in the project area. The project is based upon the
experience obtained from seven pilot rice development schemes that are
operating in the Casamance, financed by the Caisse Centrale of France
(CCCE), the European Development Fund (FED) and USAID.
ii.       The economy of Senegal is very heavily dependent upon the groundnut
crop, which accounts for about 75% of the country's total exports and,
through levies and taxes, for about 10% of Government's current budget reve-
nue. At the same time, Senegal imports an increasing amount of rice each
year (170,000 tons in 1969), while local production remains virtually stag-
nant.
iii.      The project would be carried out by a Project Organization estab-
lished for this purpose within the Ministry of Rural Development. Experienced
consultants would be employed for certain key posts, and their role would be
both to direct certain project operations and to train Senegalese counterparts
to take over from them. During the project development period the Project
Organization would work closely with the Sedhiou District extension service
so as to ensure a smooth take over of project operations by the latter once
project development is complete.
lv.       Project costs are estimated at US$4.9 million during the project
development period -- 1972 through 1976 -- including about US$2.2 million
for extension services of which US$1.6 million is personnel costs; about
US$1.1 million for incremental seasonal and medium-term credits to project
participants; about US$600,000 for road improvements, and about US$350,000
for irrigation and drainage works and rice mills. A further US$1.34 million
would be required in the period 1977 through 1981, to complete development,
and this cost would be met by Government. An IDA credit of US$3.7 million
is proposed which would finance approximately 75% of project costs during
the period 1972-1976, representing an estimated foreign exchange component
of US$2.1 million and US$1.6 million of local costs. The proposed IDA credit
represents 59% of the overall 10-year project cost. The cash contribution
of project farmers would be small, about 2% of project costs, since the bulk
of their contribution would be labor and self-provided materials. Project
farmers now receive very low cash incomes, and are unable to make a larger
contribution.



- ii -
v.        All vehicles, land clearing, crop spraying, and rice milling ma-
chinery, estimated to cost about US$250,000 would be procured through in-
ternational competitive bidding. Ox-drawn equipment would be purchased
locally as annual requirements would be small, and the equipment is either
manufactured or assembled locally. Mills, buildings, stores and houses
would be built by local contractors after competitive bidding. Such works
would be small in cost and widely scattered, and would not attract foreign
contractors. Contracts for road improvements would be treated in the same
way.
vi.       The project would generate a net foreign exchange gain of about
US$2.3 million a year at maturity, mainly from replacing imported with
domestically grown rice but also from exports of groundnuts. The latter crop
would be increased on project farms through additional land being brought
under cultivation, the use of fertilizers, and better cultural practices.
The economic rate of return from investment in the project is estimated at
18.5%
vii.      At maturity of the project, farmers' annual net cash incomes are
expected to rise to between about US$400 and US$550; these are about four to
five times current levels.
viii.     The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$3.7 million, pro--
vided assurances are obtained and steps taken as set out in the recommenda-
tions.

CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In December 1969, the Government of Senegal requested a credit
for the production of rice in Casamance region. The project was identi-
fied by the FAO/IBRT) Cooperative Program in February 1970 and subsequently
prepared by the Program during July and August 1970.
1.02      Senegal's rice imports are increasing each year while local
production is more or less stagnant. Consequently, rice development has
high priority in the Government's third four-year plan. Rice growing is
traditional in much of the Casamance region, where soils and rainfall are
suitable. A number of pilot rice development schemes are operating in the
area, and their results indicate that good yields can be obtained and that
farmers are responsive to such schemes. The proposed project would be based
on experienced gained under these schemes which have been developed with
FED, USAID. and French assistance.
1.03      The project would be the third Bank Group operation in the agri-
cultural sector in Senegal. In February 1969, a US$6.0 million IDA credit
and US$3.5 million Bank loan were approved to help finance a groundnut and
millet improvement program which had been started in 1964 with the assist-
ance of the European Economic Community (EEC). Progress of this project
has been unsatisfactory; groundnut production has fallen in the project area,
due to a combination of factors: poor weather, doubtful quality of seeds,
low yield response to fertilizers, low producer prices, and poor project
administration and coordination. As a consequence of these developments,
most farmers are heavily indebted and have lost confidence in Government
policies. Measures have been taken to correct the situation; in August 1970,
cash payments on delivery of groundnuts by farmers were reintroduced. More
recently, in early April, Government announced an increase in the producer
price for groundnuts and is now reorganizing project administration. Although
it is too early to assess the impact of these measures, they are steps in
the right direction. In the project described in this report, account has
been taken of the problems whlich have arisen in the first Bank Group
operation and measures incorporated to ensure that project extension,
credit and marketing services would operate efficiently although the two
latter would be those involved in the groundnut and millet program. Impor-
tantly, due to its location the project would not be subject to the vagaries
of weather that have beset the groundnut program. In September 1970 IDA
appraised a small settlement project, its second agricultural operation,
the Terres Neuves Resettlement Project, this project is now being processed.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission during
November 1970, composed of Mlessrs. D. J. Parsons, A.J.H. Otten, A.A. Meimaris
and R. Rosseels. The mission was assisted in Senegal by Mr. A. Delon (FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Program), co-author of the project preparation report.

II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      The Republic 2f Senegal, on the western coast of Africa, has a
land area of 197,000 km and a population of 3.7 million. Population growth
is around 2.2% annually, ranging from less than 1% in rural areas to about
6% in the larger towns, reflecting internal migration. With manufacturing
and construction contributing about 17% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
Senegal has a relatively advanced industrial sector compared to other West
African countries. The internal market is limited, however, and industrial
production has not been able to expand in recent years. Agriculture is
still the mainstay of the economy, producing one-third of GDP and occupying
some 75% of the total labor force. There has been a decline in recent
years in the production of groundnuts, the country's main cash crop, and
with stagnating production in the industrial sector, per capita GDP, if
increasing at all, is doing so very slowly.
Agricultural Sector
2.02      The main physical limitation on agricultural production is
rainfall. In the north, rainfall is highly erratic and averages around
400 mm annually, allowing cropping only where irrigation is practiced.
Towards the south, rainfall is more regular, reaching a maximum of about
1,500 mm near the Guinea border.
2.03      Only 15% of the total land area of Senegal is cultivated, mostly
in a zone within 200 miles from the coast and particularly in the hinterland
of Dakar, the so-called "Groundnut Basin". Farms vary between 5 and 15-ha,
according to family size. Groundnuts account for about 50% of the total
value of agricultural production and the bulk of farmers' monetary income.
They also account for almost 75% of Senegal's exports and -- through indirect
levies and export taxes -- for 10% of Government's current budget revenue.
Groundnut production declined from 840,000 tons marketed in 1967/68 to an
estimated marketable surplus of some 400,000 tons for the 1970/71 season.
This has severely strained the country's balance of payments position, and
has raised questions about the efficiency of Government institutions dealing
with agricultural production (see para 2.06). Government's development
strategy is aimed at crop diversification, in particular increases in rice
and cotton production, and the planned development of unexploited land of
good agricultural potential. The first step in this latter direction is the
Project.
Rice Production
2.04      In order to reduce Senegal's excessive dependence on groundnuts
and to save foreign exchange, Government places high priority on rice produc-
tion. After millet, rice has become the most important foodgrain. Rice
consumption has increased steadily and reached about 245,000 tons in 1969,
or 65 kg per capita, which is high compared to other African countries. On
the other hand, domestic production of rice has been stagnant for some time



- 3 -
at about 75,000 tons. The deficit has been covered by imports, which reached
a level of 170,000 tons in 1969, making Senegal the biggest rice importing
country in West Africa.
2.05      About 80% of domestically produced rice is grown in the Casamance
Region of southern Senegal, where it is traditionally cultivated in swampy
valleys as a subsistence crop. Most of the remaining 20% of domestic rice
production comes from the Delta Region of the Senegal River in the north,
where embankments have been constructed and the protected areas are being
irrigated, settled and developed by state companies.
Institutions
2.06      Government activity in the agricultural sector is extensive.
Since independence in 1960, Government has created about 1,800 cooperatives
mainly for groundnut farmers, through which it channels provisions for credit,
farm inputs, and extension services, and monopolizes groundnut marketing.
Overall responsibility for agricultural development in Senegal rests with
the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), but numerous autonomous agencies
are operating in the fields of production, extension and marketing for
specific crops or in specific areas over which the Ministry has very little
direct control. Poor organization and high operating costs of most of these
agencies, coupled with recurring changes in internal pricing and subsidy
policies, have lowered farmers' confidence and have led to serious disincen-
tives for groundnut production. Two years of drought (1968 and 1970) have
aggravated the problem and resulted in a considerable decline in output
(see para 2.03).
2.07      In the case of rice, five autonomous state corporations are in
charge of separate geographical areas with practically no coordination among
them nor any common supervision. Four of these agencies are exclusively
concerned with settlement schemes and the development of rice production in
Senegal's Delta Region, whereas the fifth, the "Societe pour le Developpement
Agricole et Industriel de la Casamance" (SODAICA), operates a settlement
scheme in the Casamance where rainfed rice is produced in rotation with
other crops.
2.08      While there are cases where the creation of autonomous state
corporations are justified (settlement projects would be such), in many
cases there are dangers in these autonomous agencies engaging in general ex-
tension activity. Firstly, the coordination of national policy becomes
difficult, and secondly, the corporations usually have priority in staff
and finance. As a consequence, the corporations tend to operate in restricted
areas, leaving the majority of farmers with inadequate assistance from a
poorly staffed and financed national extension service. In other cases,
individual farmers often receive advice from a number of different agencies
and services which is often confusing. The need in Senegal is to upgrade
the general standards of the national extension service, and the proposed
project would attempt to do this.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The project would be carried out in Sedhiou District in the
Casamance region of Senegal (Map 1). Within Sedhiou District, the develop-
ment of rice production would be concentrated in five separate areas (Map 2).
Rice Development Projects
3.02      Seven pilot rice development schemes, started between 1967 and
1970, are in operation in the Casamance region. In each of them, the ap-
proach has been to introduce higher yielding varieties of paddy, to improve
cultivation methods and to promote the use of draft oxen by means of a field
extension service. In addition, in the case of swamp rice, drainage im-
provement works are being carried out. Together, these projects cover an
area of about 3,000 ha of paddy (see Annex 1). Experience shows that the
improvement of swamp rice does not require expensive civil works, that farm-
ers respond well to advice on rainfed rice growing; that they readily adopt
ox-drawn cultivation techniques; and that substantial yield increases can
be obtained in a short time with efficient extension advice.
Climate, Soils and Topography
3.03      Climate and soils are satisfactory for the efficient production of
a wide range of crops. Climate is characterized by a single rainy season,
from June to October, followed by a long dry season, from November to May.
The mean annual rainfall varies from 1,800 mm in the coastal area to 1,000
mn in the northeast. In the project area, the mean annual rainfall is 1,387
mm at Sedhiou (from 30 years of records) with a probability of receiving at
least 1,200 mm in four years out of five. Rain intensity is high, often over
120 mm per hour, and soil conservation measures are necessary.
3.04      The region is one of broad swampy valleys dividing a gently rolling
countryside with plateau elevations not exceeding 50 m above sea level.
Plateau soils are red or beige sandy soils suitable for rainfed rice, pro-
vided planting is carried out at the correct time. The ochre soils found
on the slopes are also suitable for rice provided soil conservation measures
are carried out, but the grey soils on the swam? fringes are suitable for
rice only where water table levels are high enough to supply the crop with
moisture when rainfall is lacking. Swamp soils with their higher clay and
organic matter contents are especially suitable for rice growing during the
rains, or with irrigation. Importantly, continuous cropping with rice is
possible on these soils.
Population
3.05      Population of the Casamance totals about 460,000, of whom about
200,000 live in Sedhiou District where population density is moderate, aver-
aging 27/km . The people live in villages, of which there are almost 800



- 5 -
in the District. The average family comprises seven people equivalent to
four adult workers.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.06      Farm size is determined by the labor force available to the family,
which on average cultivates about 4.0 ha, including about 0.4 ha of rice
cultivated in the swamps by women; this is large enough to provide subsist-
ence and a small cash income. Many farmers own cattle which are herded com-
munally, and some have used draft oxen for many years. More are becoming
interested in using draft animals and consequently are cultivating larger
areas, between 6 and 10 ha annually, through the use of one or two pairs of
oxen.
3.07      There is no individual ownership of land in Casamance.  Land
is not in short supply and its usufruct is allocated to families by the
traditional authorities (see Annex 2, para 13).
Farming Systems
3.08      Within the area farmed by the family, fields are cultivated for
up to five years, after which fertility declines and they are allowed
to revert to bush fallow for periods of between 2-10 years while an
equivalent area of uncultivated land is opened up. In some areas of
high population density where unallocated land is available only at some
distance from the family holding, continuous cultivation persists on the
same fields for up to 30 years. On such land soils deteriorate physically
and even fertilizers are unable to generate satisfactory yields.
3.09      Within this system of cultivation, wghile the cropping period may
vary considerably, cropping patterns are well defined. The men usually
grow equal areas of groundnuts, bullrush millet, and sorghum on upland
fields, while the women cultivate the rice grown in the swamps. Cassava
and maize with some vegetables and fruits are grown in fields near the
villages. Only one crop a year can be grown because of the short duration
of the rainy season -- June to November. Food crop yields are low, averaging
only 0.8 ton/ha of millet. Groundnut yields are moderately good, averaging
1.0 ton/ha of unshelled nuts. Further details of the agriculture of
Casamance are given in Annex 2.
3.10      Swamp rice is grown on small plots of 0.1 to 0.2 ha.  It is sown
at the beginning of the rainy season and is submerged during flood periods
(August-September), benefitting finally from the slowly receding flood
waters during October-December. Because of the total absence of water
control, yields vary widely. Long stem local varieties with a six-month
growing season are grown, usually without fertilizers. Approximately one-
half of the area is transplanted. In view of good soil fertility and water
availability, substantial ihecreases in yields can be achieved with simple
water control works and improved cultivation techniques.



- 6-
Irrigation, Drainage and Swamp Rice
3.11      With the exception of a few small pilot projects established
during 1969-1970 (see Annex 1), there has been no irrigation or drainage
development in Sedhiou District. Under traditional practice, swamp rice
is cultivated in the upper parts of small valleys with perennial or
intermittent water flows; lower areas are avoided because of excessively
deep water during floods and, in certain cases, the encroachment of saline
waters from tidal rivers. There is no control of the water flowing in the
valley, either to facilitate irrigation, drainage, or flood protection.
Communications
3.12      Casamance is linked to Northern Senegal by the all-weather trans-
Gambian road which crosses the Gambia River by means of ferries. Use of
the road and ferries by Senegalese is governed by an agreement between
Senegal and Gambia. Adequate all-weather gravel roads serve the area's
main towns. Maintenance of these roads, for which the Department of Public
Works (PWD) is responsible, is presently unsatisfactory but will be im-
proved with the proceeds of a recently approved IDA credit (SE-198). How-
ever, secondary roads and earth tracks, which serve most of the villages
in the project area, are inadequate and badly maintained and are frequently
impassable during the wet season; these would be improved under the pro-
posed project.
Marketing, Credit and Storage
3.13      Groundnuts are the only crop now marketed through official chan-
nels in the area. Rice is sold on local markets in the Casamance, but the
quantities are not more than 500 tons even in good rainfall years. Rice
milling and storage facilities can handle 3,000 tons of rice annually and
consequently are underutilized (see para 4.09). The demand for rice is met
by some 9,000 tons of imported rice sold each year to wholesalers in
Casamance by the Office de Commercialisation Agricole du Senegal (OCAS).
3.14      Short- and medium-term loans for farm inputs and machinery are
made by the National Development Bank of Senegal (BNDS) through farmers'
cooperatives.  Such loans amounted to CFAF 43 million in Casamance in
1968/69, less than 10% of total BNDS lending to cooperatives in Senegal.
At present loans are made largely for groundnut production and each
cooperative's capacity to incur new loans is based on the value of its
groundnut sales.
3.15      The present arrangements for providing credit are complex.  BNDS'
functions are limited to the supply of funds to the Office National de Coop-
eration et d'Assistance au Developpement (ONCAD). ONCAD is responsible for
buying and delivering to farmers inputs in line with cooperative require-
ments, which are established through a census made by MRD about six months
in advance of the planting season. ONCAD deducts repayments of credits from
the proceeds obtained by the cooperatives by the sale of their members'
groundnuts to ONCAD. Each cooperative handles the accounts of its members.



- 7 -
The credit administration is clumsy, and while credit repayments are better
than in other parts of Senegal (about 90% compared with a nationwide average
of 75% in 1969), reorganization would be needed to cope with the consider-
able expansion in credit needs which would result from the proposed rice
development project, consequently, changes in organizational arrangements
would have to be made to ensure the effective provision of credit (see
paras 6.10 to 6.12).
Agricultural Research and Seed Production
3.16      Agricultural research in Senegal is carried out on a commodity
basis by various French agencies on long-term cost sharing contracts. In
the project area, the Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales et des
Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT) started to work on swamp rice in 1961 at its
Sefa station, situated within a few miles of Sedhiou town. In 1966, the
station began to concentrate on research into rainfed rice, and also started
trials of irrigated rice in Ziguinchor District, adjacent to Sedhiou. The
Sefa station works under the direction of IRAT's Senegal Research Head-
quarters at Bambev, undertakes work on other food crops and groundnuts,
and carries out rotational trials and work on farming systems applicable
to the Casamance.
3.17      Improved seeds approved by the research institutes are multiplied
by selected larger farmers under the supervision of MRD. Seed is
repurchased from these selected farmers at a premium. Seed production
programs in the project area are concerned mostly with groundnut seed, the
aim being to provide each farmer with a new issue once in five years. Other
crop seeds are multiplied on an ad hoc basis. An improved program for rice
seed multiplication and distribution would be established under the
project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project would bring about the cultivation of 9,500 ha of
rainfed rice, which would be grown mostly in rotation with groundnuts and
food crops on about 32,000 ha of cultivated land by some 5,000 farm
families. It would also involve, through provision of water control works,
the improvement of about 2,000 ha of existing swamp rice land; and in
addition the provision of necessary rice milling and storage facilities.
The project would be completed in a period of ten years, but the bulk of
development would be finished within five years. For the purpose of the
disbursement of IDA funds the project development period is taken as 1972
through 1976. A longer disbursement period is considered undesirable in
view of the small capital investment required post-1976 (see para 5.03).
The project would consist of:



-8-
(a) establishing a Project Organization within MRD
reinforced by qualified and experienced specialists
and provided with vehicles, housing, and offices.
The Project Organization would be responsible for
carrying out the project and providing extension
services to project farmers;
(b) constructing irrigation and drainage works for 2,000 ha
of swamps;
(c) constructing and operating 24 rice mills and associated
storage;
(d) clearing 9,500 ha of land, including procuring land clearing
winches and crop sprayers for loan to project farmers;
(e) improving project area roads; and
(f) providing seasonal and medium-term credit to project
farmers through co-operatives controlled by the Project
Organization and arranging for marketing of project
production.
B. Detailed Features
Project Organization
4.02      The Project Organization would be established in time to manage
the project as from the beginning of 1972. A detailed description of the
specialist services required is given in Annex 3. Organizational arrangements
as a whole are described in Chapter 6 and Annex 4. A total of 15 houses
and one office would be constructed for project staff, and 18 pickup trucks
and small cars, and 14 motorcycles and 100 bicycles would be purchased to
meet transportation needs.
4.03      The Project Organization would be established in Sedhiou and
would consist principally of ten Senegalese professional officers with
supporting staff, 12 technical agents and 100 field agents. In addition,
four specialists, probably recruited from outside Senegal, would be employed
to help operate the project in the initial stages and to train the Senegalese
staff to take over responsibility for the project on a properly planned
schedule (Annex 3).
Irrigation and Drainage Works
.04      The proposed works would cover about 1,000 ha of the 2,000 ha that
would be improved or developed for swamp rice production, and would secure
paitial control of the wet season natural flow. The remaining 1,000 ha
-ould not need such works. Depending on topography, they would consist of



either the clearing and subsequent regulation of the natural drainageway
with noncrete structures, or the construction of small diversion dams,
canals and drainage ditches with regulators and distribution checks. It is
assumed that about 500 ha would be served by simple drainage works with
regulators, and the remainder with more complex works involving small dams
and canals. The individual rice plots would be surrounded by low dikes and
spot land levelling would be carried out as needed.
4.05      The works would be constructed by force account with the Project
Organization bearing the cost of materials, skilled labor and hand tools. The
farmers would supply all labor for earthworks free of charge. This system
has been used successfully under ongoing schemes in Sedhiou District.
The works would be carried out over the five-year project development
period at a rate of about 200 ha annually. Details, design criteria, and
costs are given at Annex 5.
4.06      A further refinement in the few valleys with perennial flows could
be the construction of irrigation works capable of permitting cultivation
of a second rice crop during the dry season. However, Government is pre-
sently giving priority to establishing banana projects 1/ in such valleys,
and available data show no sizable water surplus. When a final decision is
reached on the location of the banana plantations and a better knowledge
of water availability is obtained, the project could carry out pilot trials
of double-cropping with minimal additional expenditures. Project benefits
calculations assume single cropping only.
4.07      Although hydrological data are scarce, studies by consultants
show that the natural flow available during the yet season in selected
swamp valleys with catchment areas of over 30 km is substantially in ex-
cess of the supplemental irrigation requirements of wet season rice over the
proposed area of 30-50 ha per valley. Water quality is also excellent;
project fields would be located on the upper reaches of the valleys above the
influence of salinity intrusion. The relevant hydrological data are
presented in Annex 6.
4.08      Annex 7 gives an analysis of climatic conditions in the project
area, and the water requirements of rainfed rice. This analysis shows that
rainfall in most years is adequate for rainfed rice provided it is planted
at the correct time. Ensuring planting at the correct time would be a major
task of the project's extension workers.
Rice Mills and Storage Facilities
4.09      With the expected increase in paddy production, additional pro-
cessing and storage capacity would become necessary. Existing rice mills
can handle about 3,000 tons of paddy from farmers located in the mills'
vicinity. In the remaining project area, about 24 small rice mills with
1/   Projects financed by the European Development Fund (FED) with ILACO
as consultants.



- 10 -
an average annual milling capacity of 500 tons (storage capacity 275 tons)
would be set up during 1972 through 1976. These would provide adequate
milling capacity for project production in this period. The experience
of a Chinese technical assistance project shows that the installation of
such small rice miills would provide the most economic means of processing,
largely because of lower overheads. The location of these mills throughout
the production area would enable producers to deliver paddy to the mills
and to use the mills' by-products for animal feed without incurring high
transport costs. A description of the mills and their operating costs is
given in Annex 8.
Land Clearing and Crop Spraying Equipment
4.10      The area to be cleared annually would be about one-third of the
area to be planted to rice each year. It is not possible to demarcate these
areas accurately in advance, as the area to be cleared will be chosen accord-
irig to the location of the farmers who agree to join the project each year.
However, farmers usually agree to cooperate on a village basis, and clearing
would normally be carried out by groups of neighboring farmers in blocks
adjacent to their existing cultivation. The bush cover on the plateau land
ranges from fairly dense woodland (900 trees/ha) to light bush (200 small
trees/ha), with trees ranging from 5 to 50 cm in diameter. Clearing the
grey soil areas would entail the removal of the wild oilpalms that dominate
the vegetation.
4.11      Each field agent would be issued a hand winch and would organize
a team of eight farmers for clearing work in his area. This team would
be supplied with saws, axes, picks and shovels and would selectively clear
about 6 ha annually between May and December. The availability of farm
labor for clearing is demonstrated in Annex 9.
4.12      Knapsack sprayers would be purchased under the project on the
basis of one sprayer for 10 ha. These would be maintained by the Project
Organization in the same manner as the winches for land clearing and uti-
lized by farmers under the direction of the village agents for pest control
on groundnuts and rice.
Improvement of Roads
4.13      The projected development of rice and other crops in the project
area would require the improvement of about 244 km of feeder roads not
covered by IDA Credit 198-SE. The works would be carried out by contract
under the supervision of the Project Organization during the 1973 dry season.
A construction period of five to six months is considered adequate. Main-
tenance would be carried out by PWD by force account, which is adequately
equipped and staffed to do so. Assurances were obtained during negoti-
ations that the improved feeder roads would be adequately maintained by PWD.
A description of the proposed improvements and maintenance is given in Annex
10; location is shown in Map 3.



- 11 -
Credit
4.14      Each farmer who adopts ox cultivation under tht' proj)ect L wulud 1b
supplied in the first year with medium-term credit for a seeder and a multi-
purpose toolbar with attachments. One cart would be purchased among four
farmers in their fourth year of development. Over a five-year period, 2,500
toolbars, 625 carts and 5,000 oxen would be supplied under such credit.
Short-term credit would be supplied for 13,500 tons of fertilizer, and 80,000
liters of insecticide. Proposed arrangements for the distribution of these
credits are described in paragraphs 6.10 to 6.12.
Ecoloy
4.15      A small area of forest would be cleared under the project, but
this would be in a number of small blocks and adequate soil conservation
measures would be practiced on all cultivated land (para 6.08). Some insec-
ticide use on rice and groundnuts would be encouraged, but this would be
under control of the extension services. The rotational cropping system
that the farmers in the project would be encouraged to adopt could make
shifting cultivation unnecessary. It would therefore slow down the present
pace of deforestation. The effect of the irrigation and drainage works
would be to delay run-off from the swamps to the main rivers, and thus
to diminish flood levels during the main rainy season and prolong dry
season flows.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
Cost Estimates
5.01      Project costs during the five-year period 1972 through 1976 (see
para 4.01) are estimated at CFAF 1.3 billion (US$4.8 million), of which
the foreign exchange component is about CFAF 0.6 billion (US$2.2 million)
or 44%. Detailed cost cstimates are at Annex 11 and are summarized in
the following table:

5.02       Cost estimates for extension service personnel are based on
salary levels presently paid for expatriates, and for Senegalese staff on
similar rice development projects in the Casamance. Incremental seasonal
inputs include fertilizer requirements calculated at their full cost. Both
groundnut and rice fertilizers are subsidized, see para 7.05 and 7.06.
Road improvement costs are derived from preliminary contractor's estimates
and supported by PEWD data. A cumulative 3% per annum has been allowed
for price increases in equipment and construction material and for increases
for Senegalese staff salaries. Irrigation and drainage works include a
30% contingency since the extent of these works cannot be determined until
final designs are produced. Contingencies ranging from 10% to 25% have
also been added to remaining project costs to cover unforeseen expenditures.
5.03       Additional capital investments would be needed for five years
beyond 1976, for rice mills and the incremental farm inputs for farms whose
development would not be complete by the end of 1976. These are estimated
at about CFAF 373 million (US$1.34 million). These additional funds would be
provided by Government and appropriate assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations.
Financing
5.04       It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$3.70 million (CFAF 1,027.5
million) be made on standard terms to Government to cover approximately
76% of project costs from 1972 through 1976. During that period the credit
would cover the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project, US$2.14
million (44% of project costs) and 57% of local costs or US$1.56 million
(32% of project costs). The IDA credit would represent 59% of the 10-year
project cost.
5.05       From 1972 through 1976 Government would contribute 22% of project
costs or US$1.10 million (CFAF 305.3 million), which includes subsidies on
fertilizer used by project farmers, amounting to CFAF 78.3 million (US$0.29
million). Except for road Improvements, which would be carried out by
contractors, project costs are estimated free of sales taxes and import
duties. During negotiations Government stated that project purchases would
be taxable and gave assurance that it would provide additional funds to
meet them. Assurances were also obtained that the required funds would be
made available in advance on the basis of quarterly estimates prepared by
the Project Director. From 1976 to 1981 Government would contribute another
US$1.34 million (CFAF 373.2 million) to project costs and its overall
contribution would represent 40% of the 10-year project cost.
5.06      US$0.73 million (CFAF 202.7 million) of the 1972-1976 Government
contribution would be channelled through BNDS and be used to provide medium-
and short-term loans to project farmers for farm inputs - "La Caisse Centrale
de Cooperation Economique" (CCCE) from France is considering financing part
of these credit operations. A subsidiary credit agreement between
Government and BNDS, satisfactory to IDA, would specify BNDS obligations
under the project (see para 6.12).



- 14 -
5.07      Farmers would provide US$0.10 million (CFAF 26.4 million),
representing 2% of project costs; this contribution would comprise mainly
the 20% cash payment required as a condition for utilizing the credit for
the purchase of draft oxen and farm implements. No account has been taken
of farmer's labor and self-procured materials. The overall financing plan
is summarized in the following table:

- 15 -
Procurement and Contracts
5.08      Procurement of vehicles, clearing and spraying equipment, and
rice milling equipment would be by international competitive bidding. In
the case of road construction and improvement, contracts involving about
US$0.6 million, would be unlikely to attract bidders not established in West
Africa and tenders for contracts would be advertised locally. At present,
five firms of qualified contractors with adequate up-to-date equipment
operate from Dakar, and the competition among them should ensure competitive
bidding and realistic prices. Contracts for the construction of houses and
rice milling and storage facilities valued at a total of US$0.5 million
would be let through tender to local competitive bidding.
5.09      Irrigation and drainage works would be constructed on force
account by the Project Organization. Animal-drawn implements for partici-
pating farmers would be purchased annually by project cooperatives through
ONCAD on the basis of farmers applications collected by the Project Organi-
zation (see para 6.11). The demand for implements would develop gradually
and would not lend itself to international procurement. ONCAD normally places
orders with SISCOMA, the only firm which manufactures and assembles such
implements locally. SISCOMA has repair facilities for its products throughout
the country. Current ONCAD procurement procedures are satisfactory and would
be used for the project.
Disbursement
5.10      Taking into account the taxes imposed on IDA financed items (see
para 5.05), the proposed IDA credit of US$3.7 million would be disbursed
as follows:
(a)  100% of the CIF cost of vehicles, clearing and spraying
equipment, and rice million equipment, or 70% of the value
of these items if purchased locally, about US$0.26 million;
(b)  82% of the cost of irrigation and drainage works, buildings,
road construction and improvement, about US$1.07 million;
(c)  100% of the costs of expert services and of organization
staff; about US$1.58 million;
(d)  75% of Organization operating costs, excluding expensed under
(c) above, about US$0.19 million; and
(e)  an unallocated amount of US$0.60 million representing contin-
gencies on the above categories, and transferrable to them as
recuired.
Applications for disbursement would be supported by contracts, shipping
documents and certified records of expenditure. A schedule of estimated
disbursement by quarters is at Annex 12. It is proposed that any excess
funds remaining in the credit account should be cancelled.



- 16 -
Accounts and Audits
5.11      The Project Organization, being under MRD, would be subject to
annual audits by the Office of the Accountant General, in accordance with
procedures that apply to all Government ministries. The project financial
analyst and accountant, however, would establish separate project accounts
and introduce an analytical accounting system, with a breakdown of all expenses
according to their purpose (extension services, drainage and irrigation works,
rice milling and storage) and function (consultants services, personnel costs,
transportation, operation and maintenance of equipment and buildings). In
addition, the Project Organization would maintain individual accounts for
participating farmers in order to control the supply of farm implements and
inputs on credit as well as subsequent repayments, see para 6.10 to 6.12.
Copies of audited accounts and the auditor's report would be submitted to
IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year. Assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiations.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Poect Organization and Staffing
6.01      Government would set up within MRD a Project organization with
headquarters at Sedhiou to be responsible for the execution of the proposed
project. The Project Director would report directly to the Minister of Rural
Development. The following key personnel would assist the Director: an
Agronomist and two assistants in charge of the project extension service; a
Training Officer and assistant in charge of training field staff and farmers;
a Rural Engineer and two assistants in charge of the project road program,
the construction and operation of rice mills, and the irrigation and drainage
works; a Cooperative Inspector and five assistants, seconded from ONCAD, in
charge of controlling project cooperatives (see para 6.09); and a Financial
Analyst assisted on one hand by an assistant to set up and keep all project
and cooperative accounts and, on the other, by an agricultural economist in
charge of analyzing economic results of the project. In addition a Planning
Officer and an Administrative Officer posted at project headquarters would
assist in project administration. During negotiations, Government gave
assurances that such personnel and required supporting staff as detailed in
Annex 3 would be provided and that appointees to the posts of Project Director,
Planning Officer, Administrative Officer, Cooperative Inspector, and Account-
ant, Financial Analyst, would be acceptable to IDA. Initial appointments
to these posts would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
6.02      In view of the present shortage of qualified and experienced
Senegalese staff, the Government intends to recruit consultants acceptable to
IDA to fill the posts of Agronomist, Rural Engineer, Training Officer and
Financial Analyst. These consultants would operate on the clear understanding
that one of their functions, from the commencement of the project, would
be on-the-job training of their Senegalese assistants, and that, at the



- 17 -
end of their period of engagement, Project Organization staff should
be adequately trained to continue operation of the project without further
consultant assistance. Assurances to these effects were obtained during
negotiations. It has been agreed with Government that the Organization would
help to strengthen the Sedhiou District branch of MRD by training and trans-
ferring staff to that branch to take over the functions of the Project Organi-
zation after project completion. During negotiations, Government gave
assurances that liaison between the Project Organization and other Government
services in the project area would be secured through the membership of the
Project Director in the Development Committees for the Sedhiou District and
the Casamance Region, which are chaired by the District Prefect and the
Regional Governor respectively. These Committees will assist the Project
Organization by providing services and advice as required.
Extension Services
6.03      The Project Organization would operate within the development areas
shown in Map 2. Technical agents (see para 6.04) would be stationed within
these development areas and field agents would live as close as possible to
the farming communities they serve.  Officers at project headquarters would
be provided with transport, and full camp equipment so that they would spend
a major proportion of their time in the field. Technical agents would each
be issued motorcycles and field agents with bicycles. Field agents would
have access to up-to-date extension aids and would be trained in their use,
in the use of winches, and in methods of ox-training, irrigation, and soil
conservation. Under the guidance of professional staff they would also
establish and supervise a program for the multiplication and distribution of
improved rice varieties. Each agent would be responsible ultimately for
supervising 50 farmers. Farmers would be organized in cooperative groups
and more specialized assistance would be available to them from the more
highly qualified technical agents, of whom there would be one for 500 farmers.
B. Project Technical Operations
Staff Training
6.04      Technical agents would be selected from those who have obtained
diplomas from the Agricultural Secondary School in Ziguinchor. Special
courses oriented to specific project requirements would be organized for
these people, who would each ultimately be responsible for about 8 to 10
field agents in their area of operations.
6.05      Field agents would be chosen from staff already employed by the
Ministry of Rural Development, and augmented as necessary by selections from
the output of the local schools and young people from the families of more
progressive farmers. Training courses would be organized by the training
officer at project headquarters in the use of land-clearing winches and ex-
tension techniques in ox-training and in the use of ox-drawn equipment.



- 18 -
Ox-drawn Equipment Program
6.06      It is expected that about half of the farmers entering the project
each year would be able and willing to adopt ox cultivation, either by
utilizing oxen and equipment already owned, or by purchasing a pair of oxen
and equipment on credit. The remainder would not have oxen available, or
would be unwilling to commit themselves to the additional expense and the
departure from tradition involved, during the early years of development.
Field agents would be responsible for teaching farmers to train their oxen
and use their ox equipment efficiently.
6.07      There is an adequate supply of 3-to-4 year-old steers available
locally to meet the demand for oxen arising from the project. During nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained from Government that a veterinary officer
with sufficient staff and an adequate supply of drugs and medicines at his
disposal would be posted to work in Sedhiou District.
Soil Conservation
6.08      Due to the high intensity of rainfall experienced in the
Casamance, soil erosion can be serious on the plateau soils when large
fields are opened to cultivation without adequate conservation measures.
In all cases where land is cultivated under the project on these plateau
soils, and also more importantly on the ochre slope soils where gradients
are greater, farmers would cultivate their land in strips not exceeding
30 m in width. Between these strips a grass wash-stop at least 3 m wide
would be left uncultivated. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that farmers not carrying out effective soil conservation measures would be
excluded from participation in the project.
C. Farmers' Selection, Cooperatives, Credit and Marketing
Project Cooperatives
6.09      Farmers who wish to participate in the project would apply to the
Organization. The main criteria for their selection, detailed in Annex 3,
would be creditworthiness, availability of suitable land and sufficient
family labor. Farmers participating in the project either must join new
cooperative societies or special sections of established societies. The
new societies and special sections (termed project cooperatives) would
be under the full control of the Project Organization.
Agricultural Inputs and Credit
6.10      Project cooperative members would apply to their cooperatives for
short-term loans (one year at 5-1/2% interest) to purchase annual inputs
Ifertilizer, insecticides and improved seeds). Members wishing to use draft
-.Li.als would apply for medium-term loans (five years at 5% interest) to



purchase draft oxen and animal-drawn implements. The proposed rates are
standard in Senegal, and similar to those emnloyed in len.ding ^or agricul-
ture in other countries in the BCEA:GL zone.  Loan an lications grom individual
members for rice and groundnut opsrations ~-_uld be assembled a; the coopera-
tive level with the assistance of organization staff.  The  jn.ect Organiza-
tion would appraise each farmer's financLal poSiti on and technical compe-
tence and present recommended applications to ENDS for approvwl.  Inputs
financed by BNDS would be purchased by ON>AD and delAvcred to G-CAD stores
in the project area for subsequent distribution to prolect cooperatives and
their members under Organization supenrision.  indi-1dual b.on ;czounts for
each cooperative me-mber would be kept by the Organization, and project coop-
eratives would be notified of the indebtedness of each societ7 and each of
its members.
6.11      Farmers would procure inputs from CNCAD on the auth'zrity o`f vouchers
issued by the Project Organization.  Draft Dxen Cwould be               by the
Project Organization and be issued to farmers agairnst oredit vonchers.  T he
ONCAD retail network in Casamance is sufficient to cope wizt, pKa.sent needs,
but during negotiations assurances were obtained that ONCAD r:etail stores in
the project area would be expanded in line w'th the demand for -arm inputs,
that orders would be placed for such inpuLs on the basis of estimates sub-
mitted six months in advance of the cropping season by thn .r,ect Director,
and that individual stores would be stocked in line vith a schedule prepared
by the Project Director.  These arrangements shoutld ensture the timely supply
of inputs to farmers. One of the problems of the ongoing groundnut and mil-
let project has been the late delivery of input s.
6.12      Credit repayments would be through deductions from fa.rmers' sales
proceeds for rice and groundnuts delivered to their cooperatives. The
project Organization would control these transactions to ensure that approp-
riate deeductions were made, and that farmers would receive no cash until
at least 60% of their debts had been repaid.  DurIng negotiations assurances
were obtained that the Project Organization would be entrusted wwith the
powers and the means to carry out the above credit operations and that
ONCAD would fully cooperate. In addition, assurances were obtained from
Government tlhat an agreement satisfactory to IDA would be signed between
BNDS and Government which would set out in detail project credit arrangements.
Signature of such an agreement would be a condition of effectiveness.
VII.  PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS, AND PRICES, FARM
INCOMES AND GOVERNMENT REVENUES
Production
7.01      Project farmers are expected to obtain average paddy yields
of 2.5 and 3.0 tons per ha respectively from swamp rice and rainfed rice
grown on grey soils after five years, and yields of 2.0 tons per ha from
rainfed rice on upland soils after seven years (see Annex 13). Yields
in these ranges have already been obtained in Casamance after appreciably



- 20 -
shorter development periods. Total project rice production would
amount to about 24,000 tons of paddy annually at maturity from 2,000 ha
of irrigated, 1,500 ha of grey soil and 8,000 ha of upland rice. Groundnut
production is estimated to increase by more than 5,000 tons through better
cultivation and use of fertilizers, and the production of food crops by
500 tons as a result of the residual effects of fertilizer applied to rice
and groundnuts in the crop rotation. Details of production estimated to be
generated by the project are given in Annex 14.
Ilarket Prospects and Prices
7.02      After reaching full development in 1983, the project would produce
about 17,000 tons of rice and about 14,000 tons of groundnuts for market.
By 1983, domestic demand for rice in Senegal is estimated to rise to
about 320,000 tons, an increase of 75,000 tons over current consumption,
assuming population growth continues at the current rate and the maintenance
of present per capita consumption levels. If other rice development projects
Nwhich are ongoing or in preparation prove successful, domestic production
by 1983 could meet about 50% of estimated demand, thereby allowing stabili-
zation of rice imports at about 160,000 tons. On the basis of the above
assumptions no difficulties are foreseen in disposing of project-produced
rice on the domestic market. Groundnut production induced by the project
would be insignificant in comparison to total Senegal production and no
export marketing problems are foreseen.
7.03      Most rice consumed in Senegal is imported under Government
contracts. Quality is low--over 50% broken grain. Contract prices for
deliveries in 1971 average about CFAF 24,000 (US$87) per ton FOB Bangkok;
but the Banks' Econtomics Department forecasts a declining price reaching
US$80 FOB Bangkok in 1980, equivalent to US$103 (CFAF 28,000) per ton CIF
Dakar. This latter price has been used in calculating the projects economic
rate of return. OCAS, the state trading agency, has a monopoly for rice
imports and fixes retail and wholesale prices. The current Dakar wholesale
price of CFAF 3d,000 (US$136) per ton is about 30% above the import cost.
The retail price in Dakar is now CFAF 41,000 (US$148) per ton and higher
elsewhere In the country to allow for transport costs. The producer price
for paddy is fixed by Government at CFAF 21000 (US$76) per ton.  On the
basis of current exchange rates the real value of such paddy is close to
CFAF 17,500 per ton and should world prices fall, as predicted by the Bank,
its value would drop to about CFAF 15,500. Consequently, the current paddy
price of CFAF 21,000 appears to involve a substantial subsidy to growers.
However, two factors must be taken into account in considering the apparent
subsidy. First, Senegal's currency may be overvalued by as much as 20%.
If this is so, the va1ue of paddy in 1971 would be about CFAF 20,600/ton
and in 1980 "FAF 19,000/ton instead of CFAF 17,500 and CFAF 15,500 res-
pectively. Second, locally produced paddy could be milled to higher quality
grades than the very low quality rice now imported and suclh quality imorove-
ment could increase the value of paddy by about another 10%. Tr.e foregoing
indicates that the current producer price does not entall. nn undue ,iinid i -
zation of rice growers. Government has stated that It :Lntends to maintain
the current producer price of CFAF 21,000 in the interest of stimulating



- 21 -
domestic rice production and consequently of conserving foreign exchange.
This course of action appears justified and in the farm budgets at para
7.07 and Annex 16, a producer price of CFAF 21,000 per ton has been used.
7.04      Groundnut prices have increased sharply on Senegal's main export
markets in response to the drop in supplies (from CFAF 35,000 per ton in
1968 to CFAF 49,000 per ton unshelled FOB Dakar in 1971). The Commodity
Division of the Bank's Economics Department, however, forecasts a decline
to CFAF 28,600 per ton in 1975 and onwards, with a return to normal supply
conditions. Thus, while present farmgate prices of CFAF 17.6 per kg of
groundnuts could be increased substantially, a reduction would be necessary
subsequently if the Bank's forecast obtains. In report calculations it is
assumed that this reduction in world market prices will take place and,
therefore, the current producer price of CFAF 17.6 per kg has been retained.
Details of international groundnut price forecasts and allocations of
proceeds from exports are given in Annex 15, Table 2.
Fertilizer Subsidies
7.05      Project farmers would benefit from subsidies on groundnut and rice
fertilizers, and on rock phosphate. The cost per ha, based on recommended
usage, now amount to CFAF 6,400 (US$23) for groundnuts, and CFAF 3,500
(US$13) for rice. These subsidies, financed originally by FED in the case
of groundnuts, are available to all farmers in Senegal and are designed to
encourage fertilizer use. The cost of groundnut fertilizer and rock phos-
phate subsidies are covered several times by taxation on groundnuts exports,
and the margin earned by the Governnent in its groundnut marketing operations.
Whether groundnut production would be better stimulated by higher producer
prices and removal or reduction o the fertilizer subsidies is a matter of
conjecture. Higher producer prices would result almost certainly in the
cultivation of a larger area of groundnut, while a reduced subsidy would
cause a drop in fertilizer use and a commensurate decline in productivity.
Government has the groundnut price/fertilizer subsidy issue under review,
and IDA is following developments, since they will be of critical importance
to the groundnut/millet project. It would be impractical to introduce
special arrangements for project farmers growing groundnuts, and the project
would be too small to be used as a lever to change the nationwide subsidy
structure even if the most effective relationship had been established
between producer price and fertilizer subsidy. Consequently, it is assumed
that the present subsidy arrangements will continue, and that while changes
may be made in future, they would not be to the detriment of groundnut pro-
duction.
7.06      The rice fertilizer subsidy is enjoyed by very few farmers at
present, but this subsidy is an essential incentive for introducing the use
of fertilizer on a crop which itself is new and the future of which is
dependent upon farmers obtaining high yields and incomes per ha. The farm
budgets indicate that in time rice growers shall be able to bear an in-
creasing share of fertilizer costs, and during negotiations assurances were
obtained that the rice fertilizer subsidies wqould be reviewed annually with
IDA with the objective of their elimination by 1980.



- 22 -
Farmers' Benefits
7.07      In the farm budgets presented in Annex 16, farmgate prices at
full agricultural development are projected on the basis of present producer
price levels. Under these conditions, cash income 1/ at full development
for a farm without oxen would rise to CFAF 110,030 (TTS$400) per annum,
and for a farm employing ox-drawn cultivation to CFAF 152,000 (US$547) per
annum, compared to CFAF 27,350 (US$100) per annum without the project.
This would provide farmers with annual incremental cash incomes of CFAF
82,680 (US$300), and CFAF 124,710 (US$450) respectively as a result of
project implementation.
Government Revenues
7.08      The distribution of income generated by the project would be
closely related to the Government rice pricing policies and fertilizer
subsidy arrangements described above and which are now aimed at encouraging
domestic rice cultivation and saving foreign exchange outlays on rice imports.
At the same time, the monopoly on rice imports enables Government to gene-
rate revenue by imposing a margin that raises the import price of rice to
the level of the domestic wholesale prices that it fixes. If present price
and subsidy arrangements are maintained, farmers' cash incomes under the
project would be maintained about one-third above the income levels that
would be obtained were producer prices based on world market prices for rice,
fertilizers unsubsidized, and the present exchange rate of the CFA franc
retained. The present arrangements for fixing high wholesale and retail
rice prices result in appreciable Government revenues (CFAF 9,800 million,
or US$3.6 million, in 1969). The Project, while leading to a net gain in
foreign exchange of US$2.3 million per annum (US$1.8 million of savings on
rice imports plus US$0.5 million of earnings on groundnut exports), would
result in potential OCAS revenues being lower, through import substitution,
than were the project not carried out. On the other hand, since demand for
rice is growing, OCAS revenues should not fall below their present level as
a consequence of the project.
Recovery of Costs
7.09      Direct investments in the project that would be recovered from
project farmers are estimated at CFAF 1,178 million (US$4.3 million).
This amount excludes: (a) credits for seasonal inputs and for draft oxen
and implements since these would be repaid during the project period; and
(b) investments in rice mills, which would be recovered through processing
charges, which are not directly recoverable from farmers. It includes all
expenditures on the extension service up to project year 10, after which
a substantially less intensive service would be required. In addition to
the direct investment of CFAF 1,178 million, the maintenance of roads, and
irrigation and drainage works would cost about CFAF 9 million (US$32,000)
annually from 1974 onwards.
1/   Cash income is equal to gross value of production less family subsistence
allowance, hired labor and other production costs, with management and
family labor costed at zero.



- 23 -
7.10      The recovery of these direct investment and maintenance costs
would be achieved through the imposition of a levy on milled rice processed
by project rice mills. The rice mills to be constructed under the project
would be owned eventually by farmers' cooperatives. These project
mills would be able to operate with substantially lower processing
costs than the larger mills now operating in Senegal which are utilized
below capacity and are capable of producing a higher quality rice than the
market desires. The rice producing cooperatives would be able to pay
producers at fixed paddy prices, meet all processing costs, deliver to whole-
salers at the current fixed whiolesale price, and generate a surplus of
CFAF 4.5 per kg (see Annex 15, Table 1). In order to recover project in-
vestments, Government would impose a levy of about CFAF 4 per kg on all sales
of milled rice ex-project mills, leaving a margin of CFAF 0.5 per kg to
be distributed to cooperative members. A levy of CFAF 4 per kg would be
adequate to recover all project investments at 5% interest over a 30-year
period. This levy however is contingent on the current wholesale price of
CFAF 42/kg in the Casamance Region being maintained. This price is higher
than the wholesale price in Dakar (CFAF 38/kg) because the bulk of rice
consumed in Senegal is imported through Dakar and transported up country.
During the first seven to ten years of project life, it is expected that
rice production in Casamance will simply replace imported rice now consumed
in that region. However, if Government succeeds in increasing domestic rice
production signifcantly, price structures would require amendment. During
negotiations Government gave assurances that the wholesale price for project
rice would not be inferior to the price fixed by OCAS for imported rice
sold in Casamance and that Government would charge a levy on rice processed
in the Casamance Region sufficient to recover the project costs mentioned
above, or arrange with IDA approval for other ways of recovering project
cost. The project cash flow at Annex 17 shows that Government revenues
from the project would exceed expenditures from 1982 through 1990 but only
by small amounts.  The cumulative deficit, including small deficits arising
from 1991 onwards would total CFAF 196.1 million (US$0.7 million) in 1995.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project's principal economic benefit would be the incremental
production of rice, groundnuts and food crops resulting in net foreign
exchange earnings. At project maturity these would amount to about
CFAF 472 million annually. The project would have important secondary
benefits: the cultural techniques practiced could be extended to other
suitable areas in Senegal; a cheaper system of rice milling would be
introduced; a means of improving the national extension service would be
demonstrated; and the increase in farmers' incomes and in the volume of
crops marketed should pave the way for the development of secondary
economic activities in the project area. Although not quantifiable, these
factors would enhance the project's economic justification.



- 24 -
8.02      On the basis of yields, incremental production and prices given
in Chapter VII, of costs given in Chapter V and Annex 11, and assuming a
project life of 25 years, the rate of return to the economy from investment
in the project is estimated at 18.5% (see Annex 18). Family labor is
excluded from project costs since alternative employment opportunities
are negligible; however, the costs of labor hired at harvest time are
included at current rates.
8.03      Tests have been carried out on the most sensitive parameters:
the assumed increase in yields of crops produced under the project; the
numbers of farmers that would participate; and the acreage of land to be
cleared. Even if yield assumptions for all crops were reduced by 20%,
while at the same time 10% less land were cleared and 10% less farners were
to participate in the project, the rate of return to the economy, assuming
no commensurate reduction in project costs, would still be 9.7% as shown
in Annex 18, Table 2. As a main benefit of the project arises from foreign
exchange savings, the economic rate of return has been tested against a
20% decrease in the CFAF rate of exchange; the economic rate of return
would then increase to 21%.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Government that:
(a) the staff of the Project Organization, as laid out in
Annex 4, would be appointed according to the scheduled
development of the project (paras 6.01 and 9.02(a));
(b) the officers to be appointed as Project Director, Planning
Officer, Administrative Officer, Cooperative Inspector and
Accountant would be selected with the agreement of the
Association (para 6.01);
(c) Government would engage the services of consultants
to fill the posts of Agronomist, Rural Engineer, Training
Officer, and Financial Analyst to assist the Project
Organization in operating the project (paras 6.02 and 9.02(b));
(d) according to the terms of an agreemen. between BNDS
and the Government, acceptable to IDA, BNDS
would be provided with the funds required for the
seasonal and medium-term credits for on-lending to
Project cooperatives crops (para 6.12);
(e) project mills would sell their rice at prices no less than
ruling OCAS wholesale prices (para 7.10); and



- 25 -
(f)  the rice fertilizer subsidy would be reviewed annually
with IDA (para 7.06).
9.02      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the credit:
(a) that the appointment in the field of all Project Organization
staff, including the Project Director necessary for the
efficient operation of the project during the first
year as shown at Annex 3, had been completed (para 6.01);
(b) that consultants to assist the Project Organization in
project operation had been engaged on terms agreeable to
IDA (para 6.02); and
(c) an agreement between BNDS and Government, acceptable
to IDA, had been signed (para 6.12).
9.03   The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$3.7 million.

ANNEX 2
Page 1
SENEGAL
CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
AGRICULTURE
General
1.        The Casamance Region of Senegal lies between the equatorial rain
forests of West Africa to the south, and the desert lands of the Sahara to
the north and east. Eighty percent of the average annual rainfall of about
1,400 mm in the project area falls during July, August and September, the
remainder in June and October. The seven months from November to May normal-
ly record no effective rainfall. The mean monthly rainfall distribution for
three stations in Casamance is given in Table I to this Annex.
2.        The low rolling countryside is divided by broad, flat-bottomed
valleys. These valleys have clay soils, and are grassy and swampy. The
grey soils of the swamp fringes are often covered with dense groves of wild
oilpalms. The dryland areas support a natural climax vegetation of mixed
woodland which, when cleared, reverts to grassland with a slow regrowth of
the natural tree species.
Crops
3.        Farmers presently grow grounidnuts as a cash crop and bullrush
millet, Pennisetum typhoideum, and sorghum as major food crops. As the
population is largely Muslim, these grains are not often used for brewing
beer in Senegal, and are therefore mainly sweet varieties for consumption.
Maize is grown as a food and cash crop, the surplus being sold in local
markets, and some cassava and cow peas, Vigna senensis, are also grown for
consumption. Rice is traditionally grown in the swamps by women, who are
entirely responsible for the husbandry of the crop. The grain is for
family consumption, being preferred to millet, and a small surplus is sold
in local markets. Work on the dryland crops is shared by men and women.
A few vegetables and fruit trees are also cultivated. Groundnut varieties
are mainly virginia bunch types, but some spreading varieties and Spanish
varieties are also grown. Maturation periods vary from 90 to 125 days.
Rosette disease is not severe in the Casamance. Most of the common varieties
are strongly dormant; that is, they do not germinate until some time after
harvest. All the millet and sorghum grown are tall, long-term varieties.
Livestock
4.        There are about 350,000 head of cattle in the Casamance.  Some
farmers have for many years utilized their stock for draft purposes, but
organized beef and milk markets do not exist in the area. Farmers also
commonly own sheep, goats and chickens, and a few pigs are kept. Cattle



ANNEX 2
Page 2
form an important social asset in Senegal as in other parts of Africa, and
are usually herded communally away from the cultivated areas. Most of
the cattle in Sedhiou are of the "Ndama" breed. These are small hardy
beasts of the humpless Bos Taurus race, maturing in about 5-6 years at 300
kg liveweight, and ar-e resistant, though not imune to trypanosomiasis,
which is carried by the two species of tsetse fly common throughout the Casa-
mance.
5.        The main diseases in the area in addition to trypanosomiasis are
contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia and hemorrhagic septicemia, which are
endemic. Rinderpest is held under control by vaccinating all stock along
the border with Guinea. Working oxen are said to be more susceptible to
trypanosomiasis, possibly due to debilitation caused by poor nutrition
during the working season. Pleuro-pneumonia is, however, the most serious
challenge to stock and can be controlled with timely treatment.
Rice Development
6.        The existing rice development projects in the Casamance (see
Annex 1) are concerned with swamp rice and rainfed upland rice production.
Improvements in the traditional swamp rice have been achieved by irrigation
and drainage, by the use of improved varieties, and by improved seedbed care,
improved cultural practices and the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
Both Taiwan and IRRI varieties have been introduced, and up to 600 kg/ha
of fertilizers have been applied (see para 17).
7.        Rainfed upland rice has never been grown traditionally in Senegal,
and farmers' experience of this crop is limited to production over the last
two years under the existing bilateral aid projects, which show that it can
be grown successfully (see para 3.02 of the main report). On upland soils,
the time of planting becomes critical. Experience also shows that soils
degraded by long cultivation without fallow periods often fail to produce
satisfactory yields of paddy even with applied fertilizers. When planted
at the correct time and properly maintained and fertilized, varieties such
as I Kung Pao and the Taiwan variety 63-83 have yielded well. Excluding the
Chinese development from which figures are not available, almost 4,000
farmers have taken part in rainfed projects to date.
8.        Apart from stem borer damage, the incidence of pests and diseases
is light. One or two applications of Carbonil insecticide are used to
control stem borer damage. Bird damage to in-season rice is surprisingly
small, but irrigated rice grown out of season suffers large losses from birds
unless adequately protected. The irrigation and drainage developments are
described in Ainex 5.
Yields of Rainfed Rice
9.        Rainfed rice is not at present grown on a large scale except
on the grey soils bordering the swamps. Yields on these soils are
estimated at about 1.2 tons/ha of paddy, although local opinion is that
the yield is often higher than that of the swamp fields. Experience with



ANNEX 2
a,c 3
rice on these soils within the present projects operating in the Casamance
shows that it is possible to get higher yields on the grey soils with a
high water table than on any other category of land because of lack of
water control in the swamps. Yields had averaged between 5 and 6 tons/ha
of paddy at Marsassoum. Many areas were seen where yields had been between
3 and L tons/ha on these grey soils. Projected maximum yields of 3 tons/ha
of paddy grown on grey soils after five years would therefore seem to be
fully justified. On the rainfed rice on upland soils being grown in the
SATEC project areas, yields on farmers' fields varied between 1.1 tons/ha of
paddy on fields that had been continuously cultivated for many years, to
2.6 tons/ha over 15 ha on newly cleared land. Individual farmers' fields
in various areas had yielded up to 4 tons, and yields of up to 4.5 tons/ha
on small plots (1/4 ha) have been recorded at Sefa experiiAnt station.
Larger-scale trials at Sefa have averaged 2.7 tons/ha and 3.5 tons/ha.
A maximum average of 2 tons/ha of paddy grown on upland soils is projected
from year 7.
10.       In order that these yields may be sustained, farmers would adopt
a four-course rotation on newly opened land, including a fallow period,
and they would apply fertilizers to their rice and groundnut crops grown
in rotation with their food crops of millet, sorghum and maize. An in-
crease in yields of these crops is also therefore projected. Groundnut
yields would increase from 1 ton/ha to 1.8 tons/ha of kernels over seven
years and grain crop yields would increase from 0.8 ton/ha to 2 tons/ha over
a reduced area over seven years. Details of crop yields by years are given
in Annex 13. The ability of the proposed rotation to sustain fertility and
yields has not been thoroughly tested. At worst, however, rotational crop-
ping would slow down the shifting cultivation process.
Yields of Swamp Rice
11.       Existing yields average 1.2 tons of paddy for swamp grown rice
and the projected yield increases to 2.5 tons and 3 tons/ha of paddy over
five years for rice grown in the project with improved cultivation practices
but without drainage, and with both improved practices and drainage, respec-
tively, can be fully justified from experience with the existing projects
in the area.
Area Cultivated and Family Size
12.       Among farmers using draft oxen up to 10 ha are cultivated
annually by large families with two ox teams. A single ox team with family
labor can cultivate up to 7.5 ha, but in both cases it is usual to employ
labor at harvest time. Families without oxen cultivate up to 4.5 ha annual-
ly. The average family in Sedhiou District is assumed to number 7 with
4 adult equivalent working units.
Land Tenure
13.       There is no individual ownership of land in the project area, and,
as there is no shortage of land, the traditional land authorities composed



ANNEX 2
Page 4
of chiefs and elders allocate usufructory rights as required. These rights
persist over short periods of fallow, but once a field is abandoned to a
long period of regeneration under bush, it reverts to communal land to be
reallocated in due course.
Cropping Pattern and Farming System
14.       A form of shifting cultivation is still practiced in the project
area. Under this system, farmers cultivate their land for an indefinite
number of years until falling yields force them to abandon cultivation and
clear new land. In this way land is cultivated for about 2-5 years before
being allowed to revert to bush for about 3-5 years, after which it is
cleared for cultivation once more. In some areas, where population pressures
are locally more intense, cultivation of the same area has continued for up
to 30 years. In these fields, yields of crops are low even with fertilizers.
The main factor affecting yields under these conditions is probably the
very low moisture-retaining capacity of the soil due to the breakdown of
soil structure following continuous and prolonged cultivation. It is
probably for this reason that grain crops and groundnuts can be grown
successfully, but upland rice, whose water requirements are more critical,
cannot be grown satisfactorily.
15.       The first crop grown following land clearing is almost always
groundnuts. This is followed by millet in the next year, and possibly
maize and sorghum in the third year of cropping. Crop rotations are not
clearly defined, however, and land outside the main fields is used for
fruit and vegetables and for growing cassava and pulse crops. Swamp rice
is grown by the women in small plots adjoining the village, and the same
field is planted year after year. No fodder or forage crops are planted,
but trials with pasture grasses, sorghum and maize, and silage production
have been initiated by the research stations. Cattle are grazed on communal
land and are allowed onto cultivated areas only during the dry season when
harvesting is completed and there is a sufficient regrowth of the stubbles
or natural grass to make it worthwhile.
Farm Implements
16.       Farmers who do not use ox draft cultivate and weed their fields
with hand hoes. Axes are used for clearing land and sickles and knives
for harvesting grain. Farmers with draft oxen are now using ploughs and
harrows for land preparation and hoes for weeding and lifting groundnuts.
Tool bars, to which various implements can be attached, and carts and seeders
made locally, are popular. Ox carts are also utilized.
Fertilizers
17.       Groundnuts were the only crop receiving fertilizer before the
advent of rainfed rice production. The rates recommended in Casamance are
40 kg of sulphate of ammonia, 700 kg of tricalcic phosphate and 50 kg of
muriate of potash. It is recommended that the phosphate be applied to the
fallow in the year before groundnuts are grown. Research results show that



ANNEX 2
Page 5
for rainfed and swamp rice an application of 200 kg/ha of a compound 6:20:10
to the seedbed followed by a top dressing of 100 kg/ha of urea is optimal.
Family Size and Labor Requirements
18.       Only the larger farmers hire labor for harvest.  Normally, farmers
cultivate an area that can be managed entirely by the family. The average
family in Sedhiou District numbers 7 with 4 working units. Labor require-
ments and distribution are shown in Table 1 of this Annex. The cost of hiring
labor for harvesting rice varies with the variety. For traditional varieties,
2 men are hired to cut 1/4 ha for FCFA 500; for the variety I Kun Pao they
are paid FCFA 600.
Soils and Cultivation
19.       The distribution of soils in the project area is linked to
topography. Basically, the soils are:
--   ferruginous and ferrolitic leached red and beige
tropical soils, located on the plateau;
-- mixed colluvial ochre soils on the slopes;
-- hydromorphic soils in the valleys.
All the Casamance soils originate from the "Continental Terminal Era". In
general the chemical fertility of these soils is low, but they have a good
physical structure and are deep. Main features are:
--   Red and beige plateau soils have an upper sandy layer
(20 cm), but clay content increases in the middle and
deeper layers.
--   Ochre soils on slopes are similar but with more sand,
especially in the upper layers.
-- Hlydromorphic soils on the valley fringes are sandy grey but
the swamp bottoms are composed of soils with up to 50-60%
clay and with a high organic matter content.
20.       An important feature of the plateau and slope soils is their
high sensitivity to erosion, not so much because of their texture and
structure as because of the high intensity of rainfall (up to over 100
mm per hour). Hence correct soil management and conservation are essential.
The rain index (related to kinetic energy and rain intensity) is among the
highest in the world, being between 600 and 2,500 tons/ha comparing with 150
to 800 tons/ha in Southwestern USA. Erosion damage is at a maximum in
July and September; consequently, early soil preparation and sowing is of
great importance, so that the soil can be covered with vegetation before
the onset of the high-intensity rains. This has been demonstrated by an



ASI  2
Page *
experiment with groundnuts at SEFA in 1965: erosion from a field planted
on June 17 was 2.28 tons of soill/ha and 4.77 tnsl/ha from a field planted
two weeks later.

B. Specialist Services
2.        Four specialists would be required by the Organization and would
probably be recruited outside Senegal.
3.        The specialist Financial Analyst would be responsible for setting
up accounting procedures for the project within the existing Government sys-
tem. This should enable the project accounts to be kept separately and in
such a manner as to satisfy all IDA requirements with respect to disburse-



ANNEX 3
Page 2
ment and supervision of the project, and auditing. The Financial Analyst
would be responsible for all accounting procedures during his appointment,
but would at all times ensure that his Senegalese counterpart Accountant
would work together with him in the day-to-day operation of the accounts
and receive on-the-job training needed to enable him to assume full respon-
sibility after the specialist's departure. He would also set up a data
collecting system and organize a monitoring cell with a view to quantifying
the economic benefits arising from the project. As from project year three,
he would be assisted in this task by a Senegalese Agricultural Economist.
During the fifth year of the project, his duties would be taken over by his
Senegalese counterparts with the specialist acting in an advisory capacity.
4.        The specialist Rural Engineer (Genie Rural) would be engaged for
the five years of the project disbursement period to initiate and supervise
the swamp drainage and water control works, and, from years two through
four, to be responsible for the building and operation of the rice mills.
He would also prepare tenders and draw up contracts for building construction
and road improvement and supervise these works and ensure, by on-the-job
training, that his counterpart engineer would be fully capable of supervising
the maintenance of roads, buildings, and irrigation works after his departure.
During year five, he would assume an advisory role to his counterpart
engineer whom he would have trained to take over his duties.
5.        The specialist Agronomist would be engaged for the whole five-
year period and would be responsible for all the agricultural extension
work under the project and for the improvement of the seed multiplication
program in Sedhiou. He would work in the very closest liaison with his two
counterpart agronomists in the selection and education of farmers in the
techniques of rainfed rice and other crops in rotation, as well as in
swamp rice production, in land clearing and soil conservation, and in the
adoption of ox cultivation. By year four of the project, he would assume
an advisory role.
6.        The specialist Training Officer, who should be an agronomist by
training, would be responsible for all field staff training necessary
under the project. He would set up the appropriate Lralning programs and
take part in their operation together with his counterpart Training Officer.
By year three, at the end of which his counterpart would assume full res-
ponsibility and the consultant would complete his assignment, he should
have organized short-term annual refresher courses for all project staff,
and have ensured that his counterpart would be fully competent to continue
the training program.
C. Selection of Project Participants
7.        Farmers wishing to participate in the project would apply to field
agents of the Project Organization who would ensure that applicants;



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(a) are full-time farmers achieving good agricultural results,
and able to muster an average of 100 man-days of family
labor per month;
(b) have the use of land suitable for rice cultivation in a
location convenient for project operations;
(c) be a member of a Project Cooperative, have no arrears of
debts with cooperatives, ONCAD, BNDS or other official
agencies and are prepared to accept the project's credit
procedures; and
(d) are prepared to maintain satisfactorily any project irri-
gation works from which they benefit; carry out soil con-
servation works as deemed necessary by project staff
and follow their cultivation directives.
D. Cooperatives
8.        Farmers participating in the project will be regrouped either in
new cooperatives or in new sections of already established and financially
sound cooperatives (called "Project Cooperatives"). These project coopera-
tives will be placed under the control of the Project Organization which
would be in charge of ensuring specifically the following:
(a) keep cooperative accounts at the Organization headquarters
and at cooperative levels with individual loan accounts for
each member;
(b) assess credit needs of each project cooperative and each
member from the technical and financial point of view;
(c) collect all credit needs of project cooperatives and present
them to BNDS for approval;
(d) distribute farm inputs delivered at ONCAD stores to project
cooperatives and to the members;
(e) obtain funds required for the marketing of crops produced
by the project cooperative members; and
(f) deduct the appropriate amount for debt service from member
sale proceeds.
9.        ONCAD would purchase paddy and groundnuts from project coopera-
tives, market the groundnuts through its traditional channels, process the
paddy at the Organization-operated rice mills and sell the rice through its
own channel.

CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE WORKS
Selection of Swamp Valleys
1.        Based on aerial photo interpretation 1/ and ground reconnaissance
by SATEC engineers, some 20 valleys have been selected for possible devel-
opment totalling about 3,000 ha of swamp rice. Priority was given to val-
leys with from 30 to 100 km2 watersheds, and with over 30 ha of cropped
area. Suitable topography and good accessibility were additional criteria.
2.        Of these 3,000 ha, the project proposes to develop 1,000 ha by
introducing better cropping methods and, in addition, 1,000 ha where simple
drainage and/or irrigation works would be constructed to partially control
the wet season natural flow. This Annex deals with the proposed irrigation
and drainage works.
Objectives
3.        The objectives of these control works would be:
(a) the distribution of early rains runoff in June-July;
(b) the speedy evacuation of flood waters during August-
September; and
(c) the retention of the receding low flow during October-
December.
This control would enable farmers to achieve earlier transplanting, sup-
plemental irrigation during the short periods of deficient rainfall, and
drainage and flood protection. It would also enable short-stem high-
yielding varieties of rice, presently excluded because of the high levels
of water, to be grown.
Type of Works
4.        Depending on the topography of the valley, two types of works
would be implemented:
(a) on narrow valleys of up to 150 m wide, the works would
consist of clearing the natural drainage ways and in-

of Paris, October 1969.

stalling concrete regulators on the main drains at
intervals determined by the slope; and
(b)  on wider valleys, the works would include small diver-
sion cai.h dams with earth canals and drains with
adequate regulation and distribution structures.
In both cases, the rice plots would be surrounded by low dykes (0.2-0.3 m)
and spot land levelling would be carried out by hand.
5.        Indicative estimates of the range of quantities of work involved,
based on projects already executed in the Sedhiou District and on prelimi-
nary studies by SATEC, are:
--   Concrete structures ........    ............... 1.5-2.5 m 3/ha
--   Earthworks (including levelling) .... ...... 450-800 m3/ha
Design and Construction
6.        The topographical survey and design for each valley would be car-
ried out by the Project Engineer and his staff after an initial agreement
with the farmers involved had been reached. Depending on the size of the
area to be cropped, the construction would be implemented during one or two
dry seasons. The structures would be constructed by force account by the
Project Organization, which would bear the cost of skilled labor, materials
and hand tools. The farmers, under the direct supervision of the engineer
and his technical assistants, would supply the required hand labor for all
earthworks, free of charge. For the family plot of 0.2 to 0.4 ha, between
150 to 250 man-days' work would be needed. The required small quantities
of skilled labor and materials are available locally.
Cost Estimates
7.        Based on actual costs for similar projects constructed in the
Casamance Region and preliminary studies by SATEC, the average cost per ha
is estimated at about CFAF 21,700 (or US$80) of which about 40% for skilled
labor and 60% for materials and tools. The total cost for 1,000 ha would be
CFAF 21.7 million (or US$79,500), of which the foreign exchange component is
estimated at 30%, or US$23,800.
Operation and Maintenance
8.        Works operation and maintenance would be carried out by the farm-
ers under the direct supervision of the extension workers residing in the
village, who would receive specific training from the Project Engineer.
After the initial stage of successful project operation, and depending on
the farmers' response, the works may be extended to cover the whole area of
rice in the valley.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Second Cropping of Rice
9.        Water flow measurement carried out in the valleys during the
project life would determine the availability of low water flow and would
permit, without any additional expenditure, the conduction of pilot trials
for second-cropping of rice.
Future Development
10.       The proposed irrigation development would be far from exhausting
the available surface water supplies and the largely unknown but possibly
substantial ground water potential of the area. However, it would be a
valuable introduction to the farmers of the practices of water control and
irrigation and would be the necessary prerequisite to any further large-
scale, more costly development. Valuable suggestions and data for such
developments are included in the GERCA Study 1/ which is available to
the Government.

CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR SWAMP RICE
1.        The lower reaches of the Casamance River, where it flows through
Sedhiou District and its tributary, the Songrougrou River, have highly sa-
line waters, unsuitable for irrigation at all seasons, due to flat topogra-
phy 1/ and the vicinity of the ocean. Salt intrusion from this source also
affects the lower parts of the swamp valleys draining into these rivers.
In order to avoid salinity problems, the project areas would be located in
the upper reaches of the valleys. Three meters elevation over M.S.L. is
considered as a safe limit.
2.        Measurements, carried out by ORSTOM 2/ in selected watersheds,
over one year only, indicate that the runoff to be expected in an average
year varies from 50 to 200 mm depending on the area and the forest cover
of the watershed. This is ample to provide the supplemental irrigation re-
quirements in the wet season of rice grown on the 30-50 ha per valley
which would be developed under the project.
3.        There are very few flood records in Casamance, and the delaying
effect on water flow of the submerged area of grass in the valleys appears
to be considerable. The following indicative figures have been given by
ORSTOM 2/ and may be used for design purposes:
Watershed Area         Maximum Flood
in km2               m3/secfkm2
3                    3-4

30                   0.15
100                   0.10
4.        Some of the valleys, especially in the southern part of the
District where the drainage is deeper, have a perennial flow which is fed
during the dry season from the groundwater table and which could support
the double cropping of rice. Base flow measurements carried out by ILACO,
SATEC and ORSTOM during 1970 in the main valleys 3/ indicated a total sup-
ply of about 500 1/sec. Since most of this water would be needed by a
banana plantation development to which Government gives high priority,
second-cropping of rice is not proposed under the project.

1.5 m.

WATER REQUIREMENTS FOR RAINFED RICE
Rainfall
1.        Mean annual rainfall in the project area is about 1,400 mm with
fluctuations from 900 to 1,700 mm. From available data, calculations for
the project area show that the minimum rainfall for Sefa 4 years in 5 (80%
probability) amounts to 1,173 mm, while for Sedhiou (15 km north of Sefa)
the comparable figure is 1,151 mm. Monithly cumulative results at 802 prob-
ability levels give the following distribution:

2.        The Penman formula applied to Sedhiou conditions gives the follow-
ing figures:

Evapotranspiration in mm    165    136    127        120         124      120
Physical Soil Characteristics
3.        The plateau soils, which constitute the greatest part of the soils
selected for rainfed rice, have a clay content of about 30% below 10-20 cm.
The moisture content at field capacity (pF 4.2) is about 17%, while at
wilting point (at pF 2.5) it is about 11%; available moisture is, therefore,
about 6%. Assuming a root zone depth for rice of 400 mm and a mean density
of 1.5, up to 34 mm or 340 n3 of usable water per hectare is available in
top 40 cm of soil.
Soil Water Balance for Rainfed Rice
4.        The Sefa 1963 rainfall of 1,306 mm shows that there are practical-
ly no monthly soil moisture deficiencies for rice between the first of July



ANNEX 7
Page 2
and the end of October (see Table 2). Using the 80% probability rainfall
of 1,173 mm, the monthly balance still shows no global monthly deficit.
However, from analyses of the 80% rainfall made by SATEC, deficits in ten-
day periods appear and show that rainfall is less than evapotranspiration
in about one year out of three in July, August, and September. This does
not take into account the water-holding capacity of the soil, however, and
from the data available, it appears that there are unlikely to be any soil
water deficiencies for rainfed rice in the Sedhiou area in at least four
years out of five.

CASAMANCEE RICE PROJECT
RICE MILLS
Equipment
1.        The equipment to be used in the project area would be:
(a) a diesel engine of 10-13 hp;
(b) a pre-cleaner;
(c) a paddy huller;
(d) a rice polisher; and
(e) a weighing scale.
Output per hour is about 500 kg paddy with a rice to paddy ratio of 68%.
Buildings
2.        Assuming a peak storage of 175 tons of paddy with adequate manage-
ment of paddy supply to the mill, and taking into account a density of paddy
in bags of 0.50, net storage volume would be 350 m3. With a mean stacking
height of 2.75 m, net storage area needed would be 127 m2. A 20% allowance
for spacing would increase this total to 152 m2.
3.        The clean rice produced would normally be sold to wholesalers
weekly. Based on an output of 350 kg/hour of rice and 50 kg/hour of bran
for sale to farmers, the weekly output would be 24 tons. Storing of 24 tons
of the finished product with 0.75 density would require 32 m3 with a height
of 3 meters. With a 10% allowance for spacing, a total of 20 mi2 would be
required. With an additional 20 m2 for mill machinery, the total building
area would be 185 m2.
4.        The cost estimate of such a building is based on the following:
(a)  Floor:  cement concrete;
(b)  Frame:  imported metallic structure;
(c)  Roof:  corrugated sheets (metal or cement-asbestos);
(d) Walls: either brick walls or mixed brick and corrugated
sheet wall; and



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(e) Door: sliding metallic.
With these specifications, the cost of construction per m is estimated to
be US$50.00. Thus the total cost of the building would be about CFAF 2.5
million (US$9,250).
5.        The operating costs of the mills to be provided are detailed in

CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
LABOR REQUIREMENTS
Land Clearing
1.        Farmers will clear land during the first year of their participa-
tion in the project. It has been estimated that about one-third of the new
rainfed rice land will have to be cleared from forest. The clearing re-
quired per farm is thus estimated at 0.66 ha for farms with ox-drawn equip-
ment and 0.4 ha for the farms without ox-drawn equipment. Forest clearing
will require an average of 300 man-days per ha, or 200 man-days for farms
with ox-drawn equipment and 120 man-days for the remainder. The following
Tables 1 and 2 are based on a total labor availability per farm of 100
man-days per month and show that during year one, sufficient labor would be
available for clearing over and above that required for crop production.
Cultivation
2.        The figures given in Tables 1 and 2 of the Annex for the labor
requirements for crops grown under the project were obtained from an ana-
lysis of a number of studies carried out in the project area and in other
parts of West Africa under similar conditions. They show that adequate
labor would be available at full development for the size of farm proposed
under the project.

CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
Present Situation
1.        Sedhiou District is adequately served by roads (0.05 km/km ) 1/,
but their maintenance standard is very low because of insufficient funds.
With the exception of the paved, single lane, national road to Dakar that
crosses the northeastern part of the District, Sedhiou is connected by gravel
roads to Ziguinchor and the other provincial towns. The villages are mostly
served by a network of earth tracks (approximately 1,000 km) that are fre-
quently impassable during the wet season. A 50-ton capacity ferry crosses
the Songrougrou River at Marsassoum. The ferry that connects Sedhiou to the
south shore of the Casamance River is under repair but will be put into oper-
ation in 1971.
2.        Road construction is carried out through local private contractors
under the supervision of the Department of Public Works (PWD). PWD is res-
ponsible also for the maintenance of national and district roads and classi-
fied tracks; such maintenance is done by force account. An IDA credit
(198-SE) for a highway project was signed in June 1970 in the amount of
US$2.1 million. The project consists of:
(a) construction of 78 km of feeder roads serving groundnut
areas;
(b) consultant services for the preparation of a study on road
improvement and maintenance; and
(c) procurement of road maintenance equipment (US$1 million)
to provide for improved maintenance of the national roads.
Proposed Feeder Road Program
3.        The anticipated increase in agricultural production in the project
area would cause serious transportation problems as more than half of the
hauling distance of the incremental production would be over the type of
earth tracks described in paragraph 1. At present, some 30,000 tons of
groundnuts are produced in the project area and the volume of agricultural
commodities to be transported at full development of the project (1980) is
expected to reach 90,000 tons. Other transportation requirements would in-
clude all-weather access to fertilizers and travel of extension workers to
project villages.
1/   360 km over 7,300 km2 total area.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
4.        To support the development efforts and maintain transportation
costs at acceptable levels 1/, the most important tracks, involving some
244 km, would be improved under the project.  These tracks have been se-
lected on the basis of the anticipated development in specific zones of the
project area and are shown on Map 3 and tabulated by location in Table 1 to
this Annex. The following improvement program would be carried out:
(a) improvement of 79 km of main tracks with 5 km of swamp
crossings; and
(b) improvement of 154 km of secondary tracks with 6 km of
swamp crossings.
5.        Improvement works on these feeder roads would entail:
(a) surface clearing of 15 m 2/m;
(b) grading and compacting over 6 m 2/m;
(c) gravelling with 15 cm laterite over 6 m i/m on selected
parts (50% of total length of main tracks and 20% of
secondary tracks);
(d) opening side ditches over 60% of the total length on
both sides of the tracks; and
(e) filling over the swamp crossings with 4-4.5 m 3/m, gravel-
ling with 15 cm laterite and the use of culverts for
drainage.
6.        The project manager would be responsible for the implementation
of the program under the project. He would be assisted by the project
engineer. The project engineer would prepare detailed engineering and
tender documents, with the assistance of PWD, and would supervise the
construction works. The construction contract would be awarded after
competitive bidding. There are several large contractors currently active
in Senegal for road construction or improvement. Construction work would
start in 1972 and last about 6 months. The experience gained during the
CCE operation (1969-1971) with respect to the project development areas
would permit a more refined selection of the tracks requiring improvement.
7.        The total cost of the feeder-road program was calculated on the
basis of current unit prices slightly exceeding the prices obtained on IDA
financed contract bids during December 1970. They include mobilization and
overhead costs of 25%. Details are given below:
1/   On improved tracks ONCAD hauling charges per km/ton are CFAF 17 against
CFAF 40 for poor surface tracks.

Maintenance
8.        The maintenance of project feeder roads would include grading by
motor graders before and after the wet season, and some spot gravelling on
the main tracks. The work would be carried out by PWD by force account.
9.        The annual cost of maintenance is estimated at FCFA 50,000 per km
for the main tracks and FCFA 20,000 per km for the secondary ones. The an-
nual cost involved would be approximately FCFA 7 million or US$25,700 and
this is included as a project cost during years 3 to 5.

ANNEX 18
SENEGAL
CASAMANCE RICE PROJECT
CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.        The following assumptions have been used in calculating the eco-
nomic rate of return, as shown in the attached Table 1:
(a) a 7-year period would be required to develop the rotation plan
and to increase the yields as expected; accordingly, the last
participating farmers would reach full development in year 11
after project commencement;
(b) the economic life of benefits resulting from the project would
be 25 years,
(c) family labor has been costed at zero but hired labor, necessary
at harvest time, has been included at wages currently paid in
the area; and
(d) proceeds from export taxes on project-produced groundnuits and
the net proceeds of the groundnut stabilization fund have been
included as benefits. Thev result from the fact that ground-
nut prices to the farmer are lower than net earnings to the eco-
nomy from groundnut exports, even while excluding all returns to
the oil milling industry.
2.        Sensitivity tests have been carried out (a) on yield increases
assumed to be obtained during the development period; (b) on the extent of
newly cleared land; (c) on the number of farmers that would participate
under the project. The results of changes in these parameters are shown
in the attached Table 2 and summarized below:
--   a reduction of 10% on yields for upland paddy would reduce
the rate of return by 1.8g;
--   a flat reduction of 10% on yields for all crops to be produced
under the project would reduce the rate of return by 3.3%;
--   a lower acreage of newly cleared land would reduce the cultivated
area per farm; a smaller number of farmers participating would
also reduce the project's cultivated area. A reduction of 10%
in one of them would lower the rate of return by 1.7'";
--   a combined reduction of 20% on yields of all crops and of 10%
on area cultivated would reduce the rate of return to 9. d
