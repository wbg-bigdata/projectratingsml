MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$ 200.0 million is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, including five
years of grace, with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. Except
for approximately one percent of the loan that would finance institutional
development in the national Ministry of Economy, all proceeds of the Bank loan
would be onlent to participating provinces, with each province's revenue
sharing serving as a guarantee for repayment of subsidiary loans. The terms
and conditions for subsidiary loans would be essentially the same as the Bank
loan, including the foreign exchange risk, as well as the costs of (a) the
Financial Agent and (b) the Central Execution Unit's expenditures financed
under the project, in order to ensure that provincial project components would
not result in a fiscal burden for the Central Government.
2.          Cofinancing with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is
proposed. Although cofinancing would be on a parallel basis, the Government
and both Banks have agreed on project objectives and operational procedures.
The IDB's Executive Directors are expected to consider its proposed loan at
approximately the same time as the Bank's Executive Directors.
3.          Background.  Reducing the public sector deficit is of fundamental
importance for success of Argentina's medium-term adjustment program, and to
address the underlying structural problems and sources of instability in its
economy. There have been three major sources of this deficit: the Central
Government itself; public enterprises; and provincial governments. For
example, the total fiscal deficit of the provinces in 1986 before transfers
from the Central Government was 6.2 percent of GDP (about US$4 billion), much
higher than the public sector enterprises and social security combined.
4.          Provincial governments increasingly are important in overall
efforts to improve the efficiency and equity of Argentina's public sector.
Over the 1985-89 period, total provincial government expenditures averaged
US$7.6 billion, including an average of US$1.5 billion for real investments
(respectively, 11 percent and 2 percent of GDP). Implementation of the
Central Government's policy to decentralize the public sector should increase
substantially this importance. Significant social sector service delivery
responsibilities have been decentralized to provinces, and many infrastructure
areas are following this pattern. This has profound implications for Bank
assistance to Argentina: if the Bank is to support these measures, it must
develop new ways to design and supervise projects. The proposed project is a
significant step in this direction, as it represents the Bank's first effort
to support strengthening of provincial governments on a national scale and
across sectors.
5.          It is clear that financing of provincial expenditures,
increasingly important for national economic stability and growth, cannot
continue to depend on large, ad hoc transfers from the Central Government and



- 2 -
rediscounts and overdrafts of provincial bank accounts with the Central Bank,
as was the case during most of the 1980s. The adjustment program requires
that provinces substitute these undisciplined sources of financing for their
investments with current account surpluses and responsible borrowing.
6.          The proposed project builds on the operational experience gained
through the ongoing implementation of the Argentina: Municipal Development
Project (Loan No. 2920-AR, approved by the Board on March 22, 1988, providing
a US$ 120 million Bank loan for partial financing of US$ 240 million of total
eligible costs), as well as the sector work resulting in the "Argentina:
Provincial Government Finance Study" (PGFS, Report No. 8176-AR, distributed to
the Board on April 16, 1990). Project preparation has benefitted frot Project
Preparation Facility Advances approved January 4, 1990 (P-145-AR) and
September 27, 1990 (P-161-AR).
7.          The Municipal Development Project's disbursements have been
severely hindered by the periods of hyperinflation (mid 1989 and early 1990)
when practically all LCB procurement was halted because suppliers and
contractors refused to make bids. Despite this difficulty, however, political
and institutional commitment to the project (with fiscal discipline objectives
similar to the proposed project) has remained high. The project's successful
implementation is accelerating as progress toward price stabilization is
achieved and maintained. The 1990 Investment Plans approved by the Bank for
the participating provinces (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, La Pampa, Neuquen and
Santa Fe) provide for 221 sub-projects with about US$ 40 million total costs.
By mid-1990, about 77 sub-projects, representing approximately US$ 18 million
in total costs, had been completed, were being executed or were at an advanced
stage of the procurement process.
8.          As for the PGFS, the Government has taken concrete measures to
implement the report's recommendations, including substantial progress in
implementing the Provincial Financial Management Information System and
through modification of the criteria for allocation of discretionary transfers
among provinces, so that these transfers serve as an incentive for improved
provincial financial management. Thus, the Government already is implementing
strong measures consistent with recommendations of the PGFS and with the
objectives of the proposed project. However, in order to sustain these
efforts, it is necessary to broaden these reforms. speed their implementation.
and to suRport adequate intergovernmental coordination in implementation of
macroeconomic Rolicies.
9.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government has requested
broad Bank support for implementation of its adjustment program, including
assistance for reforms of the national public sector as a whole, including
national public enterprises, and the proposed Provincial Development Project.
As part of this support, the proposed Bank loan would substitute for the
inflation tax, given the short-term provincial investment and financing needs.
This is because provincial governments have no access to alternative foreign
or domestic credit (save for arrears to domestic suppliers and contractors)
other than provincial banks, whose deficits until 1988 were routinely covered
by the Central Bank, but which currently are under tighter Central Bank
control. As inflation falls to desirable levels, increased availability of



- 3 -
foreign resources could permit additions to planned investment up to the full
foreign amount without adding to inflationary pressure.
10.         The Bank's involvement in the proposed project would provide
critical support to the overall adjustment and growth program, primarily
through (a) promoting adequate intergovernmental coordination in
implementation of macroeconomic policies (e.g., intergovernmental fiscal
policies, discipline of provincial banks, financial sustainability of
provincial development policies, including direct and indirect cost recovery),
and (b) stimulation of cofinancing support when appropriate. The project also
would provide international assistance needed for broad provincial
institutional development as a prerequisite for complementary Bank support for
proposed sector-specific operations at the provincial level.
11.         Proiect Obiectives.  The overall objective would be to provide
financial support and incentives for provinces to undertake their own
adjustment programs (own-source revenue enhancement and expenditure control)
consistent with the national adjustment program. This would be achieved
through providing Bank financing only to provinces that meet strict financial
and other eligibility criteria (see paras. 15-16). Specific project
objectives are to: (a) implement appropriate financial management reforms that
will transform provincial governments from generators of excessive public
sector deficits to generators of surpluses chat may finance public
infrastructure and services necessary to promote economic development; (b)
strengthen provincial governments' capacity to plan, program, finance, execute
and monitor expenditure programs that are economically efficient, financially
sustainable, institutionally manageable, and environmentally sound; and (c)
provide financing for institutional development and physical investments that
are consistent with the national adjustment program and that will promote
economic development.
12.         These objectives should be understood as supporting the first
stage of a longer term strategy for adjustment in the financial relationships
between the Central and Provincial Governments. The project would assist the
Government in moving from having a substantial proportion of provincial
investments financed with national resources resulting in excessive fiscal and
quasi-fiscal deficits to the financing of provincial investments with
provincial savings and official borrowing under the proposed project.
However, as (a) the economy stabilizes and resumes growth, (b) the financial
sector is strengthened, and (c) provincial financial management is improved,
the strategy seeks at its final stage to have provincial investments entirely
financed with provincial savings and competitive borrowing through the
financial sector.
13.         Project Descrivtion.  The proposed operation would finance civil
works, goods and consultants, to be proposed by provinces and approved by the
Central Government's Ministry of Economy and the Bank. Thus, the project
would finance a "time-slice' of eligible provincial expenditures, and its
components would be detailed during project implementation.
14.         The project would have three main components: (a)  Institutional
Development, (about 10 percent of total project costs) including technical
assistance, training and equipment to attain the project's objectives at both
the Central and Provincial Government levels; (b) Project Administration,



- 4 -
(about 9 percent of total project costs) for recurrent costs of project
implementation at the national and provincial levels; and (c) Physical
Investments, (about 81 percent of total project costs) encompassing public
infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, irrigation and drainage), and facilities
(e.g., s<n,hls, health posts, bus terminals). These investments would include
maintenanze programs, rehabilitation of existing works, completion of
unfinished works, and new investments. It is estimated that maintenance and
rehabilitation would be by far the largest part financed by this component.
15.         Proiect Implementation.  The project would be implemented at the
national level by the Central Execution Unit (CEU), Ministry of Economy, and
at the provincial level by Provincial Execution Units (PEUs). All operational
procedures (including provincial financial performance criteria, expenditures
eligible for financing, procurement, disbursement and audit guidelines) would
be specified in the Project Operations Manual (POM), proposed by the CEU,
agreed with the Bank and incorporated into the legal documents. The POM also
would provide detailed guidelines to the provinces for preparation of their
Financial Action and Investment Plans (FAIPs). Each province's FAIP would
determine if, and for what purposes, it may participate in the project.
Approval by the CEU and the Bank of a province's FAIP would be required for
any project support to the province. The FAIP would provide, inter alia: (a)
an analysis of the province's financial status, including current account
surplus or deficit, off-budget debt, ratio of total debt service to current
revenues, and net variation in short term assets and liabilities; (b) the
province's proposals to maintain and/or to improve its financial management
status and capacity; and (c) the province's proposals for financing
expenditures for institutional development (primarily to implement financial
management improvements proposed under (b) above), and in some cases for
physical investments.
16.         After a province's FAIP has been approved by the CEU and the Bank,
the Government and the province would enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement,
acceptable to the Bank. This Agreement would stipulate that only sub-projects
that are part of an approved FAIP would be eligible for subsidiary loans.
Provinces with a current account surplus would be eligible to receive
financing for any physical investment that complies with the economic,
financial, technical and environmental appraisal guidelines specified in the
PO. Provinces with a current account deficit would not be eligible to
receive financing for new investments, and project financing for maintenance,
rehabilitation and completion of unfinished works would be conditioned
strictly to each component's tangible contribution to moving the province from
a current account deficit to a surplus according to financial performance
targets and timetables approved in the FAIP. The Government, through the CEU,
would monitor each province's financial performance on a quarterly basis,
including meeting the project's financial management criteria and the specific
targets and timetables of the approved FAIP. If a province fails to maintain
its financial performance (e.g., current account surplus and debt service
limitations) and/or if it fails to implement the financial reforms laid out in
its FAIP, then uncommitted subsidiary loans for that province would be
canceled, and it would not be eligible for further project financial support
unless a new FAIP is prepared and approved.



17.         The project is estimated to take six years to implement, at a
total cost of US$ 575.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$ 245.5 million (43.1 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group
operations in Argentina are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
also is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9053-AR dated November 21,
1990, is being distributed separately.
18.         Agreed Actions.  The Government's policy is to provide equal.
potential access for all provinces to international assistance, and it has
proposed that the Bank loan be allocated to each province according to its
"quota" in the secondary distribution of the revenue sharing law.  It was
agreed that provinces that have current account surpluses and are within total
debt service limitations laid out in the POM would be eligible for their full
quotas, while provinces that do not satisfy fully these criteria would be
eligible fox half their quotas. Initially unallocated funds would form a
"pool" to be allocated on a "first come, first served" basis for provinces
that fully commit their initial quotas and have current account surpluses.
Initial allocations not committed during the first two years (giving the
poorer provinces some time for fiscal improvement) would go to the pool for
allocation in accord with fiscal performance. Furthermore, unsatisfactory
implementation of the FAIP by any province would result in cancellation of all
uncommitted quota funds, with the balance transferred to the pool.
19.         Because of the increasing importance of provinces in providing
infrastructure and services, agreement was reached regarding the 2roper
coordination and policy consistency of the proposed project with other
potential sector-specific operations at the provincial level. To ensure that
the Bank does not provide potentially competitive and conflicting financing to
provinces and that sectoral policies are adequately coordinated, the following
was agreed:
(a)    When there exists an effective, sector-specific project with Bank
financing (e.g., water, health, education, transport) with
uncommitted funds for potentially eligible provinces, then those
provinces would not receive financing for that sector under the
proposed project (ensuring compliance with sectoral policies
agreed by the Ministry of Economy and the Bank).
(b)    All provincial, sector-specific projects would provide financing
only to provinces with FAIPs acceptable to the Ministry of Economy
and the Bank when the sectoral project would require provincial
counterpart financing (including guarantees) of any kind (to
ensure that the fiscal objectives of the proposed project are
sustained).
20.         The following agreements also were reached at negotiations: (a)
the project would be carried out in accordance with the POM, satisfactory to
the Bank, and it would not be amended without the Bank's prior consent; (b)
the CEU would be designated and adequately staffed and otherwise supported in
the implementation of its responsibility under the project; (c) the



establishment and adequate staffing of the PEU would be a condition of
disbursement in respect of each province; and (d) the CEU and PEUs would carry
out environmental protection measures, as provided in the PON in a manner
consistent with Bank environmental policy.
21.         Benefits.  There are three main benefit areas: (a) fiscal, as the
project provides incentives to improve provincial financial performance and
contributes significantly to the adjustment program; (b) institutional, with
improved capacity of provinces to plan, program, implement and monitor
resource mobilization and allocation; and (c) socio-economic, resulting from
improved infrastructure and service delivery, as well as the creation of about
110,000 person years of low-skilled construction employment, especially
important during the difficult adjustment period.
22.         Risks.  Delays in implementation could result from weak
institutional implementation capacity and changing political priorities. This
would be mitigated by the large number of potential implementation entities
(with allocation of funding based on performance). It is significant to note
that at negotiations, the Bank received copies of Development Policy Letters
from all 23 Provinces and the Municipality of Buenos Aires. These Letters
include the provincial government's agreement with project objectives,
eligibility criteria and other operational procedures. This broad support for
the project indicates that implementation delays in some provinces may be
compensated by a broader participation of other provinces.
23.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
