SJRALAYA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.1       Indonesia is fortunate in having a large base of primary en. -gy
resources that can meet not only the domestic energy requirements, but can
also provide sizeable earnings through the export of oil, LNG and coal.
Exports of oil and LNG provided a revenue of about US$10.9 billion in 1991/92,
amounting to about 36 percent of the total exports. Export of coal is also
being developed and Indonesia could become a significant coal exporter in the
coming years. In 1991, coal exports reached about 6.0 million tons and an
export capability of about 20 million tons is expected by 1994.
1.2       Indonesia's domestic energy consumption has been increasing rapidly.
The domestic energy consumption grew from 166.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent (boe) in 1985 to about 231.5 million boe in 1990, a compound rate
of 6.8 percent per annum. With the rapid growth of the economy that is
projected for the coming years, the domestic energy ccnsumption is expected to
continue to grow.
Sector Overview
Oil
1.3       Indonesia has proven oil reserves estimated at 11 billion barrels,
and produced 533.7 million barrels of crude and condensate in 1990. In order
to maintain the current production level of about 1.4 million barrels per day,
continued exploration is required to compensate for diminishing production.
During 1984-89, 743 wells were drilled, and in 1990, 127 wells were drilled.
A total of about 100 blocks are currently under production sharing contract,
57 having been signed since 1987.
1.4       The Bank has not participated in the development of the oil sector
except through its dialogue on energy pricing issues. Consequent to price
adjustments in July 1991, the average price of the basket of petroleum
products in Indonesia is such as to provide a breakeven with the offshore
prices at a crude oil price of about US$18 per barrel. To the extent that the
crude oil price exceeds US$18 per bbl, a net subsidy in the price results.
The domestic prices of kerosene and industrial diesel oil are respectively
about 40 percent and 20 percent below the international price levels, while
those of residual fuel oil is close to the international price level and
gasoline is above.

Natural Gae
1.5       Indonesia's natural gas resources are estimated at about 106
trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which about 91 TCF is proven.  Ae proven
reserves are in Sumatra (19 TCF), Java (9.2 TCF), Kalimantan (23 TCF), Natuna
in the South China Sea (40 TCF), Sulawesi (0.4 TCF) and Irian Jaya (0.2 TCF).
About 90 percent of these reserves are non-associated and can be developed
independently of oil. The current gross natural gas production is about
2.16 TCF (390 million boe). Since 1980, natural gas output has increased at
an annual average rate of about 7.5 percent. Indonesia's large gas reserves
suggest a continued growth in natural gas production, which is projected to
outpace production of crude oil in the coming decade. GOI estimates gas
production to i.Lrease to 2.8 TCF (490 million boe) by 1995. The domestic
consumption of gas was about 20 percent of the total production; Table 1.1
shows gas usage in 1990.

1.6       Indonesia is a major exporter of LNG.  In 1991/92, the LNG exports
were valued at about US$3.8 billion (about 1.0 trillion BTUs or about 19.0
million tons), mainly from Bontang in East Kalimantan and Arun in North
Sumatra. In addition to the expansion of these LNG plants, Indonesia plans to
establish an LNG facility on Natuna Island, Riau. LNG demand in Japan, Korea
and Taiwan is projected to expand in the 1990s by about 30-40 million tons per
year and Irionesia expects to have a significant share of that market.
1.7       Notwithstanding trta actual and projected growth of the LNG export
markets, use of Indonesiai's large surjplus gas reserves for domestic energy
consumption is becoming more economically Pttractive. In particular, the
large offshore and onshore reserves in Java xnd Sumatra readily lend
themselves to development as fuel sources in view of their accessibility to
the major economic and industrial centers. Natural gas is the most economical
fuel for power generation, as well as for some manufacturing industries in the
geographical areas where it is available. Domestic consumption for gas is
expected to increase from 300 BCF (billions of cubic feet) in 1990 to 740 BCF
in 1995 and to over 1,000 BCF by the year 2000.

1.8       GOI's strategy to promote the use of non-tradeable indigenous
natural gas involves coordinated pursuit of three courses of action:
(a) expansion of gas supply in Java and S'matra through efficiently designed
and phased infrastructure projects; (b) building '. institutions and upgrading
of Indonesian expertise in gas technology; and (c, review and formulation of a
gas pricing policv that would attract invertors to further explore and develop
gas resources, as well as encourage energy consumers to substitute gas for
liquid petroleum products, wherever ecornomical. The Bank has recently
completed a "Natural Gas Development Planning Study" for an in dept-
assessment of the issues and expects to discuss its findings with the
Government in June 1992. Bank loans are also helping to finance Gas
Distribution (Loan 2690-IND) and Gas Utilization (Loan 3290-IND) projects.
Coal
1.9       Indonesia's coal reserves aro believed to be as hiah as 28 billion
tons, mostly located in Sumatra (20 billion tons) and Kalimantan (6.0 billion
tons). In 1981, GOI entered into a number of production-sharing agreements
with private, foreign and Indonesian joint-venture companies for the
exploitation of coal reserves in Kalimantan. Coal reserves alr ady defined by
these contractors and expected to be economically recoverable amount to about
700 million Zons. The coal production in the country has increased from about
600,000 tons in 1983 to over 10.0 million tons in 1990. The South Sumatra and
Kalimantan coals have the potential for sustaining a large program of coal-
fired power generation in the country and also provide for exports, currently
targeted at over 30 million tons/year by 1995. The total coal productiorn in
the country has a potential for reaching 50 million tons per year by the end
of the century.
Geothermal
1.10      The geothermal reserves of Indonesia are estimated at 10,000 MW. of
which 5,500 MW is on Java. The first geothermal power plant with a capacity
of 30 MW was built in 1976 at Kamojang near Bandung. The expansion of this
plant to 140 MW was funded by the Bank Loan 2214-IND. This geothermal field
has potential for further expansion by 55 MW.
1.11      Three more geothermal sites on Java bave been explored and proven.
These are Gunung Salak, Drajat and Dieng, each having a potential of about 100
MW. PLN has already entered into contracts for the development of Salak and
Drajat stations. For both these locations, which were explored by foreign oil
companies, the Goverr *nt has determined a steam price of Rp 49.28 (US cents
2.47) per kWh. Gunur, Salak and Drajat power stations are being constructed
by PLN with financial assistance from the Italian Government and the ADB
respectively.
1.12      The main issue in the exploitation of geothermal potontial is to
locate sites that can be developed at costs competitive with o'..ar options.
In Java, where the electricity grid is well developed and where PLN is able to
achieve economies of scale by constructing large coal-fired or combined cycle
gas-fired stations, the geothermal option is not competitive at the current
fuel prices. However, in the outer islands, where the cost of the



-4-
alternatives are high, geothermal development would have greater
justification. PLN and GOI have, therefore, directed their priorities to
developing Veotherma' sites outside Java.
Hvdropower
1.13      Indonesia has considerable hydroelectric resources, estimated at
about 32,000 MW (out of a theoretical potential of about 75,000 MW), but their
development to date has been limited by their geographic distribution relat .ve
to the load centers where there is demand for electricity. The greatest
potential (over 35 percent) lies in :rian Jaya, which hlas less than one
percent of total electricity demand, while Java, which accounts for 80 percent
of current electricity consumption, has less thar 10 porcent of the total
potential. In Java, about 2,000 MW of hydro potential has been already
developed, including two major projects viz. Saguling "150 MW) and Cirata (500
MW) funded by Bank Loans 1950-IND and 2300-IND. Plans have been made to
increase the hydro capacity by about 1,000 MW by the year 2000. Hydroelectric
plants outside Java totalling about 2,000 MW are also currently under either
planning or implementation.
Nuclear
1.14      Development of nuclear power in Indonesia has a lower priority
comparec. to power generation using natural gas and coal. However, in the
long-term, when coal usage for power generation becomes large enough to cause
environmental concerns and when suitable sites for locating coal-fired plants
become difficult to find, nuclear technology could provide a viable
alternative. The need for a nuclear power plant is not envisaged until year
2005.   The Government has recently commissioned a feasibility study for a
nuclear plant. This study will determine the opportune timing for the first
nuclear power plant and also recommend an appropriate technology.
Environment
1.15      Environmental issues in the energy sector arise out of coal mining
and power generation from coal fired, oil fired, geothermal and hydroelectric
plants. It has been customary to prepare detailed environmental impact
studies for all projects funded by the Bank loarn. However, energy projects
funded by different agencies do not follow a uniform policy in respect of
environmental standards. The Indonesian standards are not fully developed and
the capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy for preparing such
standards is limited. Also, the Ministry doee not have trained manpower or
equipment to monitor and enforce environmental regulations in operating
facilities. In order to overcome this shortcoming, technical assistance is in
progress under Loan 3098-IND (Paiton Thermal Power Project) to strengthen the
capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy on environmental management,
through technology transfer.
1.16      On the global front, Indonesia's energy sector is a small
contributor to the global environment. With about 3 percent of the World's
population; Indonesia consumes only about 0.3 percent of the total energy.



- 5 -
The economic progress of the cour.cry will require continued growth in energy
consumption in the foreseeable future.
1.17      In the electricity sector, the Government's policy of substituting
the use of oil by hydro, geothermal, gas and coal-based energy is resulting in
a mix with a higher percentage of generation by these means. In 1991, the
Java system, which accounts for about 80 percent of the total demand, had a
generation mix of 41 percent oil, 31 percent hydro, 25 percent coal, 2 percent
geothermal and 1 percent gas. In the year 2000, it would have a generation
mix of 10 percent oLl, 17 percent hydro, 2 percent geothermal, 22 percent gas
and 49 percent coa3. The total consumption of coal for power generation in
the year 2000 will be about 20 mLllion tons per year. For comparison, the
current annual coal consumption for power generation is about 500 million tons
in the USA, 230 million tons in Europe, 200 million tons in China and 90
million tons in India.
Poverty Alleviation
1.18      The role of the energy sector in poverty alleviation is largely
indirect except for the specific government interventions through its pricing
policies, involvino subsiCy for kerosene, low life-line rates for use of
electricity by small households and industries, and a uniform price structure
for electricity throughout the country. The rural electrification program is
the most direct intervention of the sector in the poverty alleviation effort.
The Government, through PLN, is investing considerable resources to spread
electricity supply to the villages. There is little doubt that provisions of
electricity to the rural areas results in the enhancement of the quality of
life and, to the extent that such service is provided at a subsidized rate,
permits the poor to have access to a servica they value highly. While the
economic and social rationale of the rural electzification program is quite
strong, measures to reduce costs and promote local participation require
special attention. In the Bank's sector report (Indonesia: Rural
Electrification Review, Report 6144-IND of November 1986), recommendations for
such improvements were made, .,ich are being pursued through the Rural
Electrification Project (Loen 3180-IND).
The Government's Obiectives and StrateQy
1.19      The GOI's main objectives for the sector are:
(a)  the e-onomic (efficiency) objective:  to meet the country's energy
requirements in a least cost way, and conserve exportable petrolerm
reserves, principally by encouraging the domestic market to
substitute oil consumption by alternative, more economical fuels,
such as natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal.
(b)  the resource mobilization (fiacal and financial) objective:  to
maximize the country's foreign exchange earnings and budgetary
revenues from the sector, mainly through the export of tradeable
energy resources, including oil, gas and coal, and to enable
producers of energy to recover their costs and obtain sufficient
resources to finance their growth and development.



-6-
(c) the social (equality and fairness) objective: to promote a
regionally balanced development of the country and to enable the
majority of the people to afford the basic services provided by
electricity (lighting, cooking, transportation).
(d) the environmental objective: to promote the production and
utilization of energy resources in a manner that will ensure
sustainable development and help conserve the environment for future
generations.
1.20      Key elements of the GOI's strategy for the pursuit of the above
objectives may be summarized as follows:
(a)  petroleum Product prices:  The GOI accepts the principle of
maintaining the average price of petroleum products at international
parity, while cross-subsidizing the prices of diesel and kerosene
with taxes on gasoline and fuel oil through the operation of the BBM
(petroleum products) Fund.
(b) fiscal resource mobilization: The GOI has, since 1986, levied a
10 percent value added tax (VAT) on the consumption of petroleum
products.
(c) electricity tariff: As a consequence of its social objectives, the
OI maintains electricity rates at low levels for small residential,
small industrial and social consumers, who account for about one-
third of PLN's sales. Periodic adjustments in the average sale
price (the latest adjustment of 20 percent was effective August 1,
1991) have maintained the financial performance of PLN at
satisfactory level and the average price close to the long-run
marginal cost of supply.
(d)  private sector participation:  While the public sector is expected
to continue to play a leading role in the supply of petroleum, gas
and electricity, there is scope for increased private investment to
take advantage of the additional resources and implementation
capacity. As initial steps towards enhancing private participation
in the power sector, the GOI has established a Private Power Teaz. to
formulate a regulatory framework for private investment in power
generation, and to implement specific power generation projects on
build, own and operate (BOO) basis (para. 2.11).
(e)  protecting the poor:  To enable the majority of the people to afford
the basic services provided by energy (lighting, cooking, public
transport), the GOI has subsidized (i) the prices of diesel oil and
kerosene, and (ii) the consumption of electricity by small
residential, small industrial and social customers. Although the
price subsidies represent a relatively inefficient approach to
assist the poor, the social and political implications of the change
have not permitted rapid progress towards their elimination.



- 7-
(f) regionally balanced developmentt To promote a regionally balanced
R'evelopment of the country, the GOl has (i) maintained a uniform
price structure for petroleum products and electricity in all parts
of the country, and (ii) extended the supply of petroleum products
and electricity uniformly to all parts of the country. These
policies entail the cross-subsidization rf energy supplies to remote
areas through net revenues earned in the major urban areas.
(g) environmental protection: The GOI has put in place an institutional
framework for the management of the environmental impacts of energy
production, including the creation of a Central Commission for
Environment in the Ministry of Mines and Energy to review
Environmental Impact Assessments for all investment projects, the
drafting of appropriate regulations, and the strengthening of
monitoring and enforcement capabilities within the local
governments. Under the Paiton Thermal Power Project (Loan 3098-IND)
the Bank has provided technical assistance to strengthen the
capability of the commission.
Institutions in the Energy Sector
1.21      The principal agency responsible for implementing Government
policies in the energy sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). MME
coordinates all activities in the energy sector and supervises the state
enterprises in the sector: Pertamina (oil, gas and geothermal), P.T. Bukit
Asam (coal), PGN (gas distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries
and agencies are also involved in the sector, for example, the Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for hydropower resource surveys and the operation
of multipurpose hydro plants and the National Atomic Energy Commission is
responsible for nuclear development. An inter-ministerial National Energy
Board (BAXOREN) coordinates energy policies and development with those of
other sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a Technical Committee (PTE) consisting
of senior officials of different departments, chaired by the Director General
of Electric Power and New Energy (DGEP). The organization chart of the MME is
shown in Annex 1.1.

Ir. ELECTRIC POWER
The Electricity Subsector
2.1       The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework
for electricity subsector. The subsector comprises: (i) PLN, the State
Electricity Corporation; (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for
their own use; (iii) a small number of Government-sponsored rural electric
cooperatives, and (iv) a large number of informal microenterprises providing
electricity to clusters of customers in rural villages not served by PLN. The
regulation of the subsector is the responsibility of the Minister of Mines and
Energy, who is assisted by the Director General of Electric Power (DGEP).
DGEP is the chairman of the Supervisory Board which oversees PLN's operations
and reviews PLN's investment plans, budgets and tariffs. The Electricity Act
also permits establishment of private power producers, distributors and
licensees.
The Market
2.2       During the 1970s and 1980s, the power sector of Indonesia has grown
rapidly. The installed capacity of PLN, grew from 0.5 GW in 1970 to 2.5 GW in
1980 and 9.1 GW in 1991, as its sales grew from 1.6 TWh in 1970/71 to 6.5 TWh
in 1980/81 and 27.7 TWh in 1990/91. This achievement is impressive,
particularly considering the expanse and archipelagic nature of the country.
Even so, the proportion of electrified households in Indonesia of 28 percent,
is low by regional standards. PLN is currently able to serve only about
62 percent of urban households and 16 percent of rural households, whereas it
is estimated that at least 90 percent of urban households and two thirds of
those in rural areas can afford to purchase electricity. Annex 2.1 shows the
growth in PLN's consumers and sales.
2.3       In spite of its rapid development, PLN accounts for just over half
of the installed generating capacity, with the rest comprising captive
generation facilities operated by industrial plants. The rapid emergence of
captive generation in the 1970s and its continued growth in the 1980s, bridged
the shortfall in electricity supply. Total installed capacity of captive
generation is about 6,800 MW, of which about 1,900 MW are connected to PLN and
operate on a standby basis, and 4,900 MW operate in isolation. Annex 2.2
shows the growth in captive plants in Indonesia.
The Demand for Electricity
2.4       Several studies have shown that the potential demand for electricity
is large and that there is promise for rapid growth in PLN's sales as supply
capacity expands. This is supported by the fact that even though PLN's sales
grew by 15 percent per annum during the 1980s, electricity demand growth could
only be supported by expanding use of captive generation by industry, and the
proliferation of informal microenterprises in rural areas. The rapid growth



-9-
in PLN's sales originates from three sources, viz. (a) growth in consumption
by existing customers as a result of rising output and income; (b) extension
of supply to new areas for residential and other users; and (c) gradual
replacement of diesel-based captive generation.
2.5       It is estimated that the electricity demand will continue to grow
rapidly, due to the rapid economic growth led by export-oriented industries.
The expectations of GDP growth range from 6 to 8 percent per annum for the
current decade, with the industrial GDP growing at 10 to 14 percent per annum.
PLN has prepared three sets of sales projections for its Java-Bali system
where the proposed project is located. These could be characterized as low,
medium and high growth scenarios, with the following assumptions:
(a) Low Growth. This was the scenario on which REPELITA V (1989/90 -
1993/94) was based. It assumed the average GDP growth rate of
5.4 percent per annum and the growth in the industrial GDP at
7.0 percent per annum. Since the growth assumptions have been
surpassed, PLN currently faces capacity constraints.
(b) Medium Growth. This scenario assumes an average GDP growth of
7.2 percent per annum until 2003/04. The growth of industrial GDP
is assumed at 10.5 percent per annum. The target ratio for the
electricafication of the households is 76% and PLN's share of
industrial demand is assumed to reach 69%.
(c) High Growth. This scenario also assumed an average GDP growth of
7.2 percent per annum until 2003/04. However, the growth of
industrial GDP is assumed to average 13.0 percent per annum. It
targets the ratio for the electrification of households at 97.6% and
PLN's share of industrial demand is assumed to reach 90%.
The projections of sales for the Java-Bali interconnected system under these
scenarios are shown in Table 2.1.
2.6       The low growth scenario is considered toi conservative.  The current
discussion is centered around the selection of a projection from the medium
and the high scenarios, to facilitate the planning of the generating capacity
additions for REPELITA VI (1993/94 to 1998/99). All scenarios show a low
growth in sales in 1991/92 due to supply constraints.
2.7       The investment program is currently under review taking into account
factors such as (a) the most likely scenario of the growth in total GDP and
its subcomponents, such as manufacturing GDP; (b) targets for extension of
PLN's supply areas, and rural electrification; (c) strategy for captive
takeover; and (d) private sector participation through BOO projects. The Bank
has recommended that PLN and GOI use the medium scenario to identify a core
investment plan for REPELITA VI, for which investment decisions will need to
be taken during the next two to three years, and define a variable plan which
can be enlarged or reduced based on annual reviews of economic growth,
availability of finance and implementation capacity. The discussions on this
subject between the Bank and GOI will continue through 1992, when the draft
REPELITA will be finalized. The proposed project is justified under all the

demand scenarios and is a part of the core investment program of PLN.
Generating Capacity
2.8       The expansion plan would be based on the use of hydro, geotherm4l
and gas-fired gene,ating capacity to the maximum extent feasible. Current
indications are u.hat about 1,100 MW of hydro, 330 MW of geothermal and 5,200
MW of combined cycle gas-fired generating capacity could be added during 1991-
2003 on the basis of known prospects to date. The balance of tl  capacity
would need to come from coal-fired generating plants. The composition of the
generating capacity in the Java-Bali system in 1998/99 compared to that in
1990/91 is expcted to be as follows (details in Annex 2.3):
Power Investment Program
2.9       Based on the demand projection and knowledge of feasible projects
available for implementation, PLN has prepared a least cost generation
expansion plan for the Java-Bali interconnected system and its 11 regions
outside Java. Annex 2.3 summarizes the generation expan, on plan for the
Java-Bali system up to the year 2003/04 and Annex 2.4 provides the
consolidated information regarding the generation expansioi. plan for the Outer
Islands. The plans up to about 1998/99 are based on reasonably precise
information. The plans for the outer years are less firm.
2.10      Based on the generation plans and sales composition, the investment
requirements for transmission and distribution facilities are estimated.
Since the development of the transmission and distribution network is closely
linked with the spatial distribution of demand, precise plans for them can
only be formulated 3-4 years ahead of the need. They are subject to detailed
annual reviews.
2.11      The issues associated with the power investment plan are of two
types. One, the determination of the appropriate size of the investment plan

consistent with the country's overall economic development plans, resource
availability and implementation capacity. This issue will be resolved in the
context of the formulation of REPELITA VI, the five-year national development
plan for 1993/94 - 1998/99. The Bank has recently presented a report to the
Government (Indonesia: A Strategy for Infrastructure Development, Report No.
9672-IND of June 1991) that deals with the issues and options confronting the
Government. The second set of issues pertains to the optimum strategy for
funding the investment program. In addition to PLN, the Government intends to
seek a more active role from private investors. It has earmarked six
generation projects from the expansion plan for construction on "Build, Own
and Operate" (BOO) basis. The total cost of these projects is estimated to be
about US$5.0 billion. Institutional and regulatory arrangements for this
initiative are currently being designed [para. 1.20(d)]. The Bank is closely
involved in this effort and will work with the Government to expand the scope
of private participation in the power subsector, and is providing technical
assistance to the Private Power Team in the Ministry of Mines and Energy,
under the Infrastructure TA Loan (3385-IND).
2.12      A significant part of the proposed investment program will still
need to be implemented through PLN. Annexes 2.5 and 2.6 provide estimates of
PLN's annual requirements of investments up to year 2001/02, expressed in
constant 1991 US dollar equivalent. The requirements for the period 1991/92
to 1998/99 (end of REPELITA VI) are shown in Table 2.3.
2.13      The strategy for financing PLN's investment program has been a
subject of intensive dialogue between GOI and the Bank. The Bank has
advocated the following principles to the Government:

(a) With a combination of measures, including efficiency improvement and
tariff adjustments, PLN should maintain a self-financing ratio above
30 percent. Periodic tariff adjustments will be needed to permit
this.
(b) The Government's contribution to PLN's investment requirements
should be gradually reduced and ultimately limited to that required
for supporting socially directed programs such as rural
electrification. Also, the financial losses incurred by PLN due to
the Government policy of uniform tariff throughout the country and
life line rates for small residential and industrial consumers,
should be compensated on the basis of a transparent mechanism.
(c) An optimal capital structure for PLN should be determined with an
appropriate mix of debt and equity. PLN should be prepared to
borrow in local and international markets.
2.14      The Government is receptive to the above strategy and expects to
pursue it through the discussion of PLN's five-year corporate plan, with the
Bank (para. 6.21). Also, a study for periodic formula-based tariff adjustment
is being finalized and will be reviewed by the Government. The study proposes
formula-based tariff adjustments to compensate for the variations in the cost
of fuel and exchange rate, and inflation (para. 6.8).
2.15      The Government has requested a detailed study on the various issues
involved in the long term strategy for financing of the investment program.
The Bank has agreed to provide technical assistance to the Bureau of National
Planning (BAPPENAS), using the funds from the Technical Assistance Project for
Public and Private Provision of Infrastructure (Loan 3385-IND) (para. 6.21).
2.16      To ensure continued soundness of the development program, the Bank
agreed with the GOI and PLN under the Power Transmission Project (Loan
3349-IND), that: (a) each year, PLN and GOI will review with the Bank PLN's
investment program so that the Bank can express its views on the priorities
and the balance among generation, transmission and distribution investments;
and (b) the GOI will ensure that PLN has access to sufficient funds to finance
its capital expenditures as reviewed and agreed with the Bank. These



- 13 -
covenants are currently being observed and were also agreed under the proposed
project.
Demand Management
2.17      PLN and GOI are conscious of the need for load management and
conservation in the electricity sector. The electricity tariff is designed to
reflect the long-run marginal cost of supply for industrial and commercial
consumers for capacity as well as energy charges. The energy charges are
suitably divide.d into peak and off-peak rates for industrial and commercial
consumers. Eftorts are also underway to encourage cogeneration by industries.
Technical assistance to PLN is provided in a recent Asian Development Bank
Loan (Power XXI Project of May 1991), to assist in developing load management
and energy conservation measures. A USAID funded study on demand side
management that is currently in progress, is expected to identify areas where
priority action is desirable.

ROLE AND STRATEGY IN THE SECTOR
The Bank's ExDerience with Past Lending
3.1        Since 1969, the Bank group has provided about $3.6 billion for the
power subsector, through three IDA Credits, 16 loans and one supplemental
loan. A complete list is given in Table 3.1.

/A  Ongoing project.
3.2        Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) and Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) on the first eleven projects have been issued. Also, the PCRs
for the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Power Projects are being finalized.
The PPARs have concluded that the projects reviewed so far achieved the
objectives set out at the time of appraisal. Specifically, these projects and
the concomitant technical assistance programs, enhanced PLN's institutional
capabilities in many areas of utilities operation and management, particularly
in the area of project implementation, and helped P'N meet critical demands
for electricity (para. 3.6). The last PPAR (No. 7902 of June 26, 1989)
concludes that the Bank has made a positive contribution towards the
development of the Indonesian power sector over the past 20 years. It
attributes this to the facts that: (a) the.-e was a long-term vision for the
development of the subsector and this vision was shared between the Bank,
Government and PLN; (b) the perspective was translated into a long-term



- 15 -
strategy which was resolutely .pursued, while remaining flexible in the
designing and implementation of individual measures that fitted into this
strategy and complemented each other; and (c) a reasonable balance was struck
between the physical and the institutional development components of the
projects. These conclusions drawn from the experience in Indonesia are
consistent with the Bankwide experience reviewed in OED's report of 1990,
entitled "Issues in World Bank Lending Over Two Decades." This report
evaluated the outcome of 180 Pank-financed power projects from 1974 to 1988
and suggested that sustainability of these projects was highly influenced by
institutional and country economic conditions as well as by technical and
policy factors.
3.3       In broad terms, the Bank's involvement with the power subsector in
Indonesia can be distinguished in three phases. In the initial phase (1968
until the mid-1970s), the Bank concentrated on creating a national entity,
PLN, to deal with sectoral problems and helped put in place procedures and
systems to manage and improve its initially small-scale c.perations. In the
second phase, (from 1975 to 1985), the primary thrust of the Bank's work was
to assist in a rapid expansion of the electricity supply infrastructure. In
the current phase, the focus has shifted towards strengthening the financial
position and strategic capabilities of PLN and also towards tile restructuring
of the regulatory framework. Specific aspects of the Bank's involvement and
experience in the Indonesian power subsector are described below.
3.4       Initial Phase.  In the late 1960s, when the Bank became involved in
the power subsector in Indonesia, PLN was in an exceedingly poor organiza-
tional and financial state. The first power project (FY70) helped at once to
identify PLN's weaknesses, as well as approaches to overcoming them. Under a
second operation in 1972, a long-term power development study for Java was
carried out that defined the objectives and components of the power system
development on which to base the Bank's involvement in most of the work under
the second phase. Another result of the first phase of the Bank's involvement
was the promulgation of Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that provided
PLN with a higher, albeit Lill limited, degree of auconomy, including
responsibility for procurement and construction of most of its facilities.
This first phase also resulted in a new accounting system and a comprehensive
training program.
3.5       CaDacitv Expansion.  During the second phase (from 1975 until 19a5)
of capacity expansion, the Bank approved about one project every year. The
infrastructure components of this series of projects helped PLN expand its
generation capacity of thermal, coal-fired, hydroelectric and geothermal power
plants, and transmission and distribution facilities. These projects also
supported the Government's objective of diversifying domestic energy
consumption away from oil by the use of coal, hydropower and geothermal. At
the beginning of this decade, PLN's installed capacity had grown to more than
10 times what it was at the beginning of the 1970., and to more than 2.5 times
what it was at the beginning of the 1980s8 Bank-financed projects had made
substantial contributions to adding 3,800 MW of the approximately 6,000 Mw of
generating capacity operating in Java in 1990.



- 16 -
3.6       Institutional Development.  The first major effort at institutional
development at PLN took place with Bank assistance in the mid-1970s, through
the implementation of a comprehensive Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) which took
into account all aspects of PLN's administration and operations. As part of
the FRP and subsequently through a long series of loans, technical assistance
was provided to improve PLN's skills in diverse areas including system
planning, demand forecasting, system operation, design of generation and
transmission facilities, operation and maintenance of power plants, project
management, personnel management, management information system and
accounting. As a consequence, PLN has made significant progress in improving
the efficiency of its operations (Annex 4.2). In particular, its transmission
and distribution losses decreased from 20.8 percent in 1983/84 to 15.6 percent
in 1990/91. The operation of the 1,600 MW coal-fired thermal power plant at
Suralaya in West Java (funded by four Bank loans), supplied about 40 percent
of the electricity needs of Java. The station achieved an availability factor
of 93 percent in 1991/92, which is comparable to the best in developed
countries. Overall, PLN's capacity for implementation, as well as for
operation and maintenance, has grown substantially during its asso^iation with
the Bank. It now carries out on average an investment program of over $1
billion per year and connects over one million new consumers annually. The
rapid expansion has strained PLN's ability to improve its quality of service
in terms of interruptions and voltage stability. The Bank's dialogue on
institutional development is now focused on providing PLN with a stable
financial environment, greater delegation and decentralization among its
various regions stronger strategic planning, clearly defined accountability,
and improvement in distribution management and transmission reliability.
3.7       Financial Performance.  The objective of the Financial Recovery Plan
for PLN to achieve the full operating cost recovery was met in 1975/76.
Thereafter, a self-financing ratio (SFR) covenant was adopted in 1978 under
the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND). The agreed SFR target was 30
percent for 1985/86 with indicative targets for intervening years. While the
indicative targets for the self-financing ratio were met, the rate of return
on assets remained negative. Therefore, a rate of return (ROR) covenant was
adopted under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) in 1984. The ROR
covenant was modified in 1987 under the Power Transmission and Distribution
Project (Loan 2778-IND), to provide for separate financial performance targets
for PLN's operations in Java (ROR of no less than 8 percent) and outside-Java
(financial breakeven situation), in view of their different operational
characteristics. Projections showed that PLN would be able to achieve a self-
financing level of 25-30 percent with these covenants. However, the
government did not permit the corresponding tariff adjustment in 1987/89.
Consequently, although project preparation continued, the Bank did not approve
further loans in 1987 and 1988, pending the Government's required action on
tariff. The Government increased tariff by about 25 percent effective April
1, 1989 and again by 20% from August 1, 1991. As a result, PLN's financial
performance has been satisfactory. In order to institutionalize the
adjustment of tariff and provide financial stability to PLN's operations, the
emphasis of the Bank's dialogue on electricity pricing is being shifted
towards designing a mechanism that would permit periodic and formula-based
adjustment of electricity price to take account of variations in fuel prices
and exchange rate, and inflation (para. 2.14 and 6.8).



- 17 -
3.8       Fuel Price Subsidies.  The Bank has had a continuous dialogue with
GOI on the petroleum products prices. Until 1979, the level of domestic fuel
oil prices was about one third of the international level. In 1980, in the
context of the Ninth Power Project (Loan 1872-IND), the GOI agreed in
principle to the elimination of subsidies, which were implemented during
1980-84. The average price for a basket of petroleum products was raised to
an international price equivalent, and has been maintained roughly near
international prices by subsequent adjustments.
3.9       Implementation.  Problems with the implementation of power projects
ar- caused by delays in three major areas: (i) selection and appointment of
consultants, (ii) procurement of equipment and goods, and (iii) acquisition of
land and the right of way for the construction of transmission and
distribution facilities. At times, rigid budgetary procedures, scarcity of
local funds, unsatisfactory performance of local contractors, and shortage of
trained personnel within PLN, have delayed the implementation of previous
projects. These problems are not specific to the power subsector but are
germane to the implementation of projects in most sectors in Indonesia. In
response to this experience, the Government has become conscious of the need
for improvement and has been taking corrective steps, such as dismantling the
organization for centralized control on procurement in 1988.
Bank Role and Strategy
3.10      Despite the accomplishments discussed above, there are several
important constraints in the power subsector that need to be addressed. These
are as follows:
(a)  Reducing the large unmet electricity demand against the backdrop of
a continued rapid economic expansion has three major implications:
(i) PLN's financing requirements will be large (estimated at $30
billion for the current decade); hence a medium to long-term
financing plan will need to be worked out by GOI/PLN; (ii) the
institutional and implementation capacity of PLN will need to be
strengthened further if it is to construct, operate and maintain the
growing electricity network; and (iii) private participation in the
subsector will need to be promoted to help reduce the financial and
managerial burden of the GOI, which requires a suitable regulatory
framework and adequate safeguards to ensure efficiency and fairness;
(b) Given the magnitude of the financing requirements, there is need for
(i) a long term commitment by GOI on its financial contribution,
based on the resources required for the expansion of socially
directed activities; (ii) improvement in PLN's internal cash
generation capacity, through the establishment of a mechanism for
periodic adjustments of the electricity tariff reflecting changes in
factors beyond the control of PLN (such as fuel prices, domestic
inflation and exchange rate); and (iii) a strategy for promoting
PLN's access to domestic and international markets for borrowing
and, eventually, for equity participation;



- 18 -
(c) In order to make further progress in improving the efficiency of
PLN's operations, there is need for streamlining the regulatory
framework to increase the autonomy and accountability of PLN through
a transparent system of financial support for socially directed
programs, and simplification of budgetary and procurement controls;
and strengthening the institutional framework through the
enhancement of the corporate planning process, decentralization of
authority and enfcrcing accountability throughout the organization.
This should lead to a reduction of operating costs, especially
through improvements in fuel efficiency, fuel substitution and
reduction in transmission and distribution los18s. There is also a
need to focus on improving di.1tributlon management and supply
reliability; and
(d) As domestic oil consumption is projected to increase, the objective
of energy resource diversification will need to be pursued more
vigorously, to avoid Indonesia becoming a net importer of petroleum
products. The current subsidy on diesel and kerosene prices favors
the consumption of these products in lieu of other, more economical
fuels, such as natural gas and coal, with which Indonesia is
abundantly endowed. Adoption of efficiency prices as the basis for
the determination of domestic prices of these products will help
achieve the goal of energy resource diversification.
The Bank's ongoing projects and the proposed project provide technical
assistance to the GOI and PLN to address most of these issues. The Bank wil'
also continue to focus on these issues in its dialogue with the GOI.

IV. THE BENEFICIARY
4.1       The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Indonesia.  The
proceeds of the proposed loan would be onlent to PLN (para. 5.34), which is
responsible for the implementation of the proposed project. PLN, the sole
government-owned national power utility, has been the beneficiary of Bank
Group lending to the power sector in Indonesia since 1969 (para. 3.1).
PLN's Oraanization and Management
4.2       PLN was established as a public corporation (Perum) under Government
Regulation No. 18 of 1972, with responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity, and the planning, construction
and operation of electricity supply facilities. That governing Regulation
No. 18 was amended by Government Regulation No. 54 of 1981, and superseded by
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990. PLN is managed by a Board of Directors
headed by a President Director, who is appointed by the President and is
accountable to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The President Director has
authority for all operations of PLN. The Board currently includes five other
directors with functional responsibility, respectively, for planning,
construction, operations, finance and administration. Operational
responsibility devolves upon 17 regions, and responsibility for major
construction upon 13 project managers. Also reporting to the Board are
several staff units responsible for power research, education and training,
management services, an internal audit unit called the Corporation
Inspectorate, the Java-Bali system operation and control unit, and an
Engineering Services Center (PPE). PLN's organization chart is shown in
Annex 4.1. PLN's management consists of dedicated professional staff of
proven competence. Most of the managerial staff have many years of experience
in various facets of the company's operations. The staff morale is generally
high and the turnover low.
Institutional Development
4.3       PLN has grown rapidly in the past decade (para. 2.2).  Since
1977/78, it has connected new consumers at an increasing rate, from about
370,000 in 1978/79 to about 1,147,000 in 1990/91. The rapid expansion of
supply facilities, which is expected to continue over the next several years,
involves increasingly complex technical and managerial tasks, for which PLN
will need to continue to strengthen its institutional capacity. Areas that
need strengthening have been recognized, and actions and programs are either
already underway or planned, in many cases with assistance from the Bank.
These include corporate and financial planning, qeneral accounting, inventory
management, distribution management, consumer administration, transmission
reliability and manpower development.
4.4       In the area of operations, the main emphasis rests on improving the
planning, operation, maintenance and management of distribution facilities.
PLN's distribution management functions are being strengthened through
technical assistance being provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project
(Loan 3097-IND). Technical assistance provided under the Rural



- 20 -
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) will help improve the planning of
rural electrification subsector development. Also, PLN's corporate planning
and financial planning functions are being developed further with technical
assistance provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).
Annex 4.2 shows some of the performance indicators for PLN for the years
1980/81 to 1989/90; they indicate .significant achievements in several areas.
Specifically, manpower productivity improved from a sale of 223 MWh per
employee in 1983/84 to 525 MWh per employee in 1990/91, operating ratio
improved from 102 to 90, and transmission and distribution losses reduced from
20.8 percent to 15.6 percent, in the same period. Efforts are continuing to
achieve further improvements. Under the Power Transmission and Distribution
Project (Loan 2778-IND) and the Power Sector Efficiency, Paiton Thermal Power
and the Rural Electrification Projects (Loans 3097-IND, 3098-IND, and 3180-
IND), PLN agreed to carry out an action plan for efficiency improvements,
which is under implementation. The mpjor components of this action plan are:
(i) efficiency improvement in distribucion including improvement in
reliability; (ii) improving corporate and financial planning and accounting;
(iii) improvements in the operation of major thermal power plants;
(iv) improvements in the operation and maintenance of diesel power plants,
incluJing their relocation and rehabilitation; and (v) renovation of small
hydro plants.
4.5       To provide a broader framework and longer-term perspective for the
institutional development of the power sector, the Bank carried out a Power
Sector Institutional Development Review (Report No. 7929-IND, dated December
20, 1989). The objective of the review was to identify the regulatory and
institutional conditions under which the continued rapid expansion of the
sector could be carried out with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness.
The results of the review suggest that the principal condition is the creation
of an environment within which PLN and the other participants in the sector
will be motivated to apply their initiative and creativity to reduce costs and
improve service in the course of achieving the targeted expansion. As a
general direction, the creation of such an environment will require a shift
towards greater reliance on guidance through incentives rather than
administrative intervention and on decentralized decision-makiug rather than
centralized control, while also taking advantage of the pressures created
through competitive comparison. Based on the recommendations of the study,
several issues relating to PLN's finances are being pursued through the
proposed project and the Bank's ongoing dialogue with the GOI. These issues
include (a) electricity tariff, including its periodic adjustment (paras. 2.14
and 6.8); (b) financing of investment program (para. 2.15); and a move to
bearing of full cost of capital by PLN (para. 6.22). In addition, PLN has
conducted a study to define the organizational changes necessary to enable it
to manage the future operations more efficiently and develop a plan of action.
The main elements of the plan consist of (a) providing greater autonomy to the
regions; (b) strengthening regional organizations for planning and consumer
administration, and improving customer relations and billing; (c) modifying
budgetary procedures to enable the budget to be a management tool;
(d) introducing the concept of cost per kWh sold as a primary measure of
performance; (e) combining generation and transmission functions in Java under
one manager; 'f) providing semi-autonomous status to the four Distribution



- 21 -
Units in Java; (g) simplifying and decentralizing procurement; and
(h) implementing a manpower development program. Detailed proposals on the
actions required to implement these initiatives will be and submitted to the
Bank for review and comment. The entire program is expected to be implemented
in about three years. Highest priority will te given to actions (e) and
(f), for their completion by December 31, 1994. The proposed project provides
for technical assistance to PLN in implementing the proposed actions (para.
5.29). During the negotiations of the proposed loan an agreement was reached
that PLN shall, not later than December 31, 1992, adopt and thereafter
implement an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, aimed at enhancing its
institutional efficiency.
Staff Development and Training
4.6       As of March 31, 1991, PLN had 52,812 employees, of whom 41,027 are
permanent staff. PLN has no difficulty in recruiting staff educated at levels
up to technical high school, but faces constraints in recruiting those with
higher academic qualifications. Less than 5 percent of its staff have
university degrees, which is low by utility standards. To address its
training needs, PLN has a separate training department that plays an important
role in PLN's efforts to upgrade the skills of its technical and
administrative staff. These efforts have been largely successful. In
1990/91, about 9,580 staff received training-about 9,460 received training
domestically and about 120 abroad.
4.7       The Bank has been supporting PLN's training activities and human
resources development efforts, including the establishment of several training
centers. Current efforts being supported by the Bank include training in the
areas of diesel/thermal plant operations, distribution management, corporate
and financial planning, general accounting and cash management, as well as
specific training activities in the rural electrification area. The proposed
project provides for training of PLN's staff in public utility practices
(para. 5.30).
Accountina and Budretinz
4.8       PLN's accounting system, installed in the early 19709, follows
generally accepted accounting principles, and normal utility practices, but it
needs upgrading to keep pace with the growing complexity and volume of
accounting transactions. There is need for improvement with respect to the
completeness and accuracy of fixed asset accounting, depreciation, inventory
accounting and accounts receivables. The accounting system needs to produce
more accurate information in a timely manner for decision-making purposes.
Also, PLN's internal procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual
expenditures need to be strengthened through better coordination among and
participation by the various functional directorates and regional offices in
the process, to enhance the budget's value as a management tool.
4.9       A major constraint to PLN's accounting has been a lack of trained
senior accountants and uniform accounting procedures. Since 1987, PLN has
been implementing an action plan to improve its accounting practices and
functions by (i) establishing a uniform accounting system, (ii) improving



- 22 -
related support systems, (iii) sensitizing concerned nonfinancial managers and
staff to the importance of timely and accurate accounting, (iv) upgrading the
skills of the accounting staff through in-house and external training courses,
and (v) computerizing the accounting process. PLN is also attempting to
improve coordination between its departments and its regional offices in the
areas of budget preparation, and monitoring and evaluation of performance.
Technical assistance provided under the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan
3097-IND) is ongoing to improve the accounting system. The Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 3180-IND) provides technical assistance to
continue to enhance the system for the segregation of PLN's accounting of its
RE operations.
Billing and Collections
4.10      PLN's bills are computerized and prepared monthly at the Jakarta
headquarters. Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The
receivables position of general consumer accounts has been good, as it has
been kept at about one and one-half months of the yearly billing. The
overdues from government users (including the Armed Forces and local
governments), which account for about 10 percent of PLN's total sales, have
also been maintained to under two months, billing.
Audit and Internal Control
4.11      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Government auditors. The audits are carried out following generally accepted
accounting practices and standards. The audit reports in recent years had
received qualified opinions from the auditors, most recently with respect to
the inventory accounts. PLN has made substantial improvements in the areas
commented upon by the auditors. As a result, in the reports for 1989/90 and
1990/91 there were no qualifications. PLN makes special efforts to expedite
the closing of accounts and has succeeded in completing them usually within
six months after the close of the fiscal year, as stipulated by Government for
all public corporations. While the unaudited accounts are generally finalized
and received in time, there have been delays in the auditing of accounts.
Remedial action has been taken; the audited accounts for 1990/91 were received
in time. The audit covenant under Loan 3349-IND, which requires PLN to submit
to the Bank its audited financial statements and the report of such audits no
later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year, was also agreed
under the proposed project. In addition, PLN would furnish to the Bank (i) a
copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever they are sent to the auditors;
and (ii) its segregated financial and operating information on rural
activities, all within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
4.12      PLN has an effective internal audit group which reports to the
President Director for various special investigations, in addition to keeping
general and project accounting matters under review.
Insurance
4.13      PLN currently carries transit and marine insurance on equipment and
materials in transit. Projects under construction are covered by the



- 23 -
contractor's all risk and erection insurance. Fire and other hazards on most
of the assets in operation are self-insured. In view of the geographical
spread of PLN's assets, any single loss would be relatively small by
comparison with total assets and operations, and this policy has been
considered satisfactory by the Bank. However, with some very large projects
having been completed in recent years and others now under implementation,
there would be a greater concentration of assets in certain locations than in
the past. An understanding was reached under Loans 3097-IND and 3098-IND that
major works, plant and equipment at large power projects would be insured with
outside agencies. Accordingly, PLN is currently carrying commercial insurance
for major operating plants and equipment at several large power projects
totalling about 4,900 MW, in and outside Java. PLN is also considering
proposals for creating a fund for self-insurance of the remaining assets.

V. THE PROJECT
Backaround
5.1       The power sector in Indonesia has continued to grow rapidly, with
PLN's sales growth exceeding 15 percent a year. As discussed in Chapter III,
the Bank has been closely associated with the review of PLN's expansion plans
to ensure the implementation of a least-cost and economically vi ble program.
In August 1987, the Bank completed an Energy Options Review (Report No. 6583-
IND) for Indonesia, which concluded that the options for power generation in
the 1990-2010 time frame would involve a balance between the use of natural
gas, to the extent it was available, and coal. This conclusion is still
valid.
5.2       The Bank supported the construction of the first coal-fired power
plant in Indonesia at Suralaya through the Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth and the
Fourteenth Power Projects (Loans 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 2214-IND, and 2243-IND).
The site for the Suralaya power plant was developed to accommodate seven units
with a total installed capacity of 3,100 KW. The power station now has 4 x
400 MW generating units in commercial operation, totaling a capacity of 1,600
MW. Recent studies have established that the size of the last three units can
be increased from the earlier planned 500 MW to 600 MW each, which will
increase the station capacity to 3,400 MW. The proposed loan will provide for
the construction of the three 600 MW units (nos. 5, 6 and 7) at Suralaya, to
complete the station to its ultimate capacity.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.3       As discussed in para. 5.2, the Bank has been closely involved in the
development of the Suralaya Project. Project implementation would benefit
from the Bank's continued association through technical advice and financial
support. The proposed project is an integral part of the Bank's strategy to
promote the development of PLN into a modern, commercially oriented utility,
capable of meeting the electricity needs of Indonesia in a reliable and
efficient manner. The Bank's presence ini this project has enabled a
satisfactory financing plan to be pat together for this very large investment.
In addition, to support the rapid pace of development of PLN, and to promote
an overall improvement in efficacy, the Bank would pursue various policy and
institutional measures in the sector through this project, as discussed in
paras. 4.3 through 4.7. The Bank has also remained involved in promoting
private participation in the power sector that will lead to private investment
in power generation and the implementation of specific power generation
projects on build, own and operate basis. Additionally, through a technical
assistance program, the Bank has helped enhance the environmental management
capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy.

Proiect Obiectives
5.4       The objectives of the project are to:  (a) expand PLN's generating
capacity in Java; (b) promote economic use of coal for electricity generation;
(c) develop PLN's institutional capacity to operate and maintain thermal power
plants; and (d) strengthen its financial position. To achieve these
objectives, the proposed project will improve PLN's institutional capability
by greater decentralization and delegation, eliminate subsidy in the Bank
funds onlent by GOI to PLN, and enhance dialogue on the appropriate investment
program in the sector, related financing strategy and a mechanism for periodic
formula-based adjustment of electricity price.
Prolect DescriDtion
5.5       The project comprises the construction of 3 x 600 MW coal-fired
generating units (Nos. 5, 6 and 7) of the Suralaya Thermal Power Plant and the
construction of 500 kV transmission line from Cilegon to Cibinong, with
associated substations, to enable transmission of power to the demand centers
in Java. Technical assiatance components include:  (a) consulting services
2or engineering, design, and construction supervision of the proposed units;
(b) engineering and design of a thermal power plant at Banjarmasin in South
Kalimantan; (c) feasibility study for a high voltage submarine cable link
between Java and Sumatra; (d) consulting services for the institutional
development; and (e) training of PLN's staff in public utility practices.
5.6       Suralaya is located about 100 km west of Jakarta, built initially
with an infrastructure to support the installation of seven power generating
units. Units 1 and 2 were built in 1984 and 1985, units 3 and 4 in 1988 and
1989 respectively. The proposed additional units will receive coal, oil and
supply of goods by ship across the Sunda Strait. The coal will be pulverized
and burned in the steam generators to produce steam at high pressure and
temperature to run the turbine generators. The exhaust steam will be
condensed into water in the condensers, and pumped back into the boiler
through a series of feed water heaters. The cooling system will be of once-
through design, drawing water from and returning it to the Sunda Strait.
Electrostatic precipitators will capture the fly ash produced from burning the
pulverized coal. A dense-phase fly ash collection system will be used to
evacuate the ash from the electrostatic precipitators and boiler dust hoppers.
5.7       The plant will supply power to the 500 kV transmission grid linking
all major power plants in Java. Existing 500 kV transmission network will
need augmentation to enable the evacuation of the additional 1,800 MW
generation from Suralaya to the demand centers. Load flow, short circuit and
stability studies were carried out for determining the necessary expansiot.
These studies indicated the need to construct double circuit 500 kV
transmission lines from Suralaya to Cilegon and a single circuit 500 kV
transmission line from Cilegon to Cibinong, including the atigmentation of the
substations at Cilegon and Cibinong. The 500 kV lines between Suralaya and
Cilegon will be constructed by using PLN's own funds, since they are required
to permit increAsed power supply to Krakatau Steel. Construction of these
lines is scheduAled to be completed by December 31, 1993. The proposed project
will finance one additional 500 kV line between Cilegon and Cibinong, and the



- 26 -
expansion of the associated substations at Cilegon and Cibinong. The salient
design features of the project are given in Annex 5.1.
Status of Implementation
5.8       Eneineerina and Design.  The feasibility study for the expansion of
the Suralaya Thermal Power Plant was conducted by PLN, with the assistance of
its Engineers (Monenco Overseas of UK), then working on Suralaya Units 3 and
4. The engineering and design of the proposed expansion of the Suralaya
Thermal Power Project is being carried out by Black and Veatch International
of USA (BVI), who have been selected as Consultants, following Bank
guidelines. The preliminary engineering and design effort, leading up to the
preparation of major bid documents, such as for the steam generators and the
turbine generators, is being financed under the Power Transmission Project
(Loan 3349-IND). Also, PLN's staff will be trained in the areas of plant
operation, maintenance and management, with the assistance of the Consultants
and suppliers of plant equipment. PLN's engineers have already been exposed
to similar training under the Twelfth and Fourteenth Power Projects (Loans
2214-IND and 2443-IND), including classroom training at PLN's training
institute at Suralaya, aided by hands-on training on a simulator. It is
expected that further training on 600 MW units through the proposed project
will take PLN another step forward toward self sufficiency in many areas of
power plant engineering, design, construction, and operation and maintenance
management.
5.9       Post-engineering coordination, including the balance of engineering,
design, procurement and interface activities with suppliers and contractors,
will be performed in Indonesia jointly by PLN's Engineering Services Center
(PPE) and the Consultants. A special Project Management office (Proyek Induk)
will be established for the project for efficient coordination and implementa-
tion of the proposed expansion. In addition, PLN will assign a full-time
senior level manager, to coordinate the project implementation. The project
island concept, where engineers of all disciplines will be in close proximity
to each other, along with the Consultants, will ensure utmost expedition of
interface activities and information exchange that are vital to the successful
management of project implementation strategies. PLN will also establish a
Construction Management organization at the site, supported by the
Consultants' site personnel. PLN has already acquired commendable experience
through the implementation of Suralaya units I through 4. Construction
management will include, inter alia, expediting functions, manufacturing
surveillance and quality assurance during the fabrication of major equipment,
as well as during actual construction, and such other measures as would assure
compliance with specifications.
Coal SuPplY
5.10      While coal usage for the existing Suralaya power station is about 4
million tons per year, delivered from the Bukit Asam coal mines in South
Sumatra, another 5 million tons of coal per year will be required for the
proposed expansion. An additional coal jetty will be constructed to handle
the required supply of coal. The average heating value of the coal will be
around 5,000 kcal/kg, the sulfur content below 0.5 percent, and ash around
10 percent.



_ 27 -
5.11      The domestic coal industry in Indonesia has in recent years
developed significantly (para. 1.9). Most of the mines are located in South
Sumatra and Kalimantan. The aggregate production of coal in Indonesia is
expected to grow rapidly, as indicated in Table 5.1.
Table 5.1: ESTIMATES OF COAL PRODUCTION IN INDONESIA
Year              Million tons
1990              10.6  (Actual)
1991              15.0
1992              27.0
1993              31.0
1994              34.0
1995              37.0
2000              50.0
5.12      Under a current Ministerial decree, PLN has freedom to select and
enter into contracts with any suppliers in Indonesia for the procurement of
coal for its power stations. During the negotiations of the proposed loan, an
agreement was reached that coal procurement for Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7 will
be carried out by PLN using competitive bidding procedures, satisfactory to
the Bank, primarily through domestic coal producers in South Sumatra and
Kalimantan. Under the Paiton Thermal Power Project (Loan 3098-IND), technical
assistance is provided to help PLN procure coal on a competitive basis and
negotiate commercial contracts with potential coal suppliers, as well as
manage coal transportation logistics in an efficient manner.
5.13      Coal will be transported by barges or ships with capacities from
10,000 tons to 40,000 tons to the Suralaya unloading facilities. A separate
coal jetty will enhance the coal handling capability of the plant. The design
of the coal receiving facilities will also permit meeting of the coal
requirements of Suralaya by import. The boiler design and the arrangement of
the coal handling system at Suralaya is based on the characteristics of a
range of coals that could be procured for the plant from the mines in
Kalimantan, South Sumatra, or from Australia.
Environmental Aspects
5.14      The three additional 600 MW units proposed to be built at Suralaya,
will be coal-fired. They will enhance the capacity of the power plant from
1,600 MW to 3,400 MW. The combustion gases emitted from the boiler stacks
will be dispersed over a wide area. Several modeling techniques are available
to simulate emissions from power plant stacks based on which ground level
concentrations of noxious emissions can be predicted. PLN's earlier
consultants, MONENCO, had used the MSTACKS screening model; the results of
such modeling indicated that ground level concentrations of SO2 and NO. would
remain within regulatory limits prescribed by the GOI as well as the



- 28 -
guidelines of the Bank, with stack heights of 250 meters and maximum sulphur
content of coal of 0.7Z. The project with these design features was approved
for implementation by the Central Commission for Environment, Ministry of
Mines and Energy. Subsequently, the studies were reviewed by PLN's current
Consultants, Black & Veatch (BVI), of USA. The results of the BVI study,
using Complex I model, indicate that in order to meet the GOI regulations and
the Bank guidelines, it would be necessary to increase the stack height to 275
meters and reduce the average sulfur content of the coal to 0.38 percent. In
this context, it may be noted that there is a greater degree of conservatism
built into this model, which is estimated to range from 1.3 to 2.0. The
Consultants have also studied the plume dispersion with 0.5 percent average
sulfur in coal. The studies show that with such sulphur content of coal, the
Bank guidelines for ambient SO2 concentration can be met; however, the GOI
regulatory limits could be exceeded at seven elevated locations, at heights
above 300/350 meters from the sea level. It is estimated that the periods for
which such excesses take place could be about 10 days during October-March
(rainy season), provided all seven units (3,400 MW) of the plant are in
operation at full load for 100 percent of the time. Considering that:
(a) the Complex I model has a higher degree of conservatism; (b) the Monenco
studies indicate compliance; and (c) the operation of all seven units at full
load during the rainy season is highly unlikely, it is considered acceptable
to specify coal sulfur content of 0.5 percent average (rather than
0.38 percent) with the stack height of 275 meters. In addition, as a matter
of extra caution, an agreement was reached that by December 31, 1995,
monitoring arrangements will be made at not less than two of the locations
identified by the model studies to be critical in terms of SO2 pollution, to
confirm that the GOI regulations are not violated. It was confirmed by GOI
during the negotiations of the proposed loan that the project with all seven
units in operation, will comply with the GOI regulations and the World Bank
guidelines in respect of the ambient air quality. It was also confirmed by
GOI that the Central Commission for Environment has approved the above changes
in the design of the project. The receipt of a document indicating approval
of the project witi; the proposed changes will be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan.
5.15      With electrostatic precipitators (ESP) having a design collection
efficiency of 99.5?, the solid particulate emission will also remain within
permissible limits. Since the coal proposed to be used at Suralaya will have
an average ash content of 10;, the three proposed units with a combined
generating capacity of 1,800 MW will produce approximately 950 tons of fly ash
per day at 70Z load factor, at least 945 tons of which will be removed by the
ESPs, thereby minimizing pollution of the environment.
5.16      A permanent weather monitoring station has already been set up at
the plant site to record meteorological data on an hourly basis which will
facilitate necessary correlation with the environmental data. PLN will submit
the results of the environmental monitoring to the Bank, in its quarterly
progress reports.
5.17      Coal for the proposed project will be procured from coal mines in
Indonesia that are already operating in Kalimantan and South Sumatra (para.
5.11). The environmen:al management of the mining industry follows the
environmental clearance procedure (AMDAL) of the GOI as enunciated in Law no.



- 29 -
4 of 1982, according to which every mining activity that results in a
significant impact must have an environmental impact analysis and must be
cleared through the AMDAL process. Government Regulation No. 29 of 1986
assigns legal validity to this prccess. The project proponent is required to
prepare an environmental assessment report, including the environmental
management and monitoring plans, and submit it to the Central Commission in
the Ministry of Mines and Energy for AMDAL clearance. The owner of the
project is required to do the monitoring and has to submit the reports every
three months to the Directorate General of Mines for review. An existing
mining inspection unit in the Directorate General of Mines, Ministry of Mines
and Energy will oversee compliance with these regulations.
5.18      The power plant uses sea water from the Sunda Strait for cooling
purposes and returns it to the strait. In the process of cooling, the water
temperature is elevated in the condensers by about 7.50 C at full load.
However, by the time the discharge water reaches the strait through a long
open channel, and as the water mixes with the huge mass of the sea water, the
resultant temperature rise in the sea water will be no more than 1-20 C. At
some distance from the discharge mouth of the power plant, this body of water
will regain its normal temperature of 28-300 C. PLN had commissioned the
Gajah Mada University in Indonesia to study the effects of this thermal
gradient by simulation methods. Their mathematical modeling has indicted
that: (a) the area and the body of water affected by the higher temperature
is relatively small; (b) the addition of the proposed units will not result in
spreading this body of water further out; and (c) while the fish population
may perhaps decrease slightly in the immediate vicinity of the discharge,
there could be an increase in the fish production in other regions as warmet
water can attract more fish. There will be minimal effect on marine organisms
and coral reefs in the immediate vicinity. There are no mangroves at the
project site which is already developed with marine protection along the shore
lne.  The effect on the fish population is likely to be so marginal that the
loss of income, if at all, to the fishing community in the area would be
insignificant. Therefore, the proposed design to discharge the cooling water
in the open sea is considered acceptable.
5.19      Liquid effluents generated by the water treat'   t plant, the
desalination plant and the demineralizer plant will be t- ited in a waste
water treatment facility to be constructed as a part of the proposed project.
Each contaminant in the liquid effluents, including metallic wastes, if any,
will be analyzed for its cumulative and synergistic effects on the marine
ecosystem, and treated as necessary. The coal pile leachate and runoff as
well as the ash disposal area runoff will be collected in respecti'e
neutralizing basins. The liquid wastes will be neutralized to a pH oL 6 to 9
and made harmless before being discharged into the storm drains to confolm to
the effluent quality standards.
5.20      The ash disposal yard at the Suralaya Thermal Power Station is being
upgraded to continue compliance with environmental standards. As a part of
the project design, the existing ash disposal facilities, will be reviewed and
a disposal system satisfactory for seven units will be implemented. During
the negotiations of the proposed loan it was agreed that, by December 31,
1993, PLN shall prepare, and thereafter implement an action plan satisfactory
to the Bank, for improving the existing coal receiving, ash disposal and dust



- 30 -
control facilities at Suralaya. Project consultants have started to prepare
proposals for the upgrading of ash disposal and coal handling facilities.
5.21      PLN/GOI have carried out consultation with the affected communities
on the implementation and environmental aspects of the project. The main
comments and concerns expressed by the people related to expediting
electrification of villages in the vicinity of the project, employment of
local labor during the construction of the project and fair compensation for
the land acquisition. During the negotiations of the proposed loan, GOI and
PLN confirmed their commitment to implement these suggestions. None of the
suggestions involve any change in the project design and implementation. GOI
and PLN propose to continue such consultations, during the project
implementation.
5.22      The economic benefits of the project, already derived in the
Suralaya area, are significant. Since the construction of the power plant,
there has been considerable increase in the economic activities in this area.
New roads have been constructed, many small business enterprises have been
established, sea beaches have been made more inviting, and the hotel and
tourist industry is expanding steadily.
5.23      The 500 kV transmission line proposed to be constructed between
Cilegon and Cibinong is not expected to pose any significant u4nvironmental
issues. A preliminary survey of the right-of-way has been ccmpleted and the
routing of the transmission line has been selected to avoid cisruption of
human settlements, agricultural land and forest areas. Only the land required
for tower locations will be acquired by PLN. No resettlement: as a result of
such acquisition is expected. No additional land is required for the
expansion of the substations. An Environmental Assessment Summzary that
provides more detailed discussion of the environmental aspects, is attached
(Annex 5.2)
5.24      Some resettlement and rehabilitation is, however, involved in that
PLN will need to acquire some 15 ha of land adjacent to the power station to
provide for the required laydown area during construction. The land is owned
by about 60 families, six of whom currently live on the land. During the
negotiations of the proposed project, an agreement was reached that plans for
the compensation and rehabilitation of the families that will be affected will
be prepared by December 31, 1992 for the laydown area and by September 30,
1993 for the transmission line, and that such plans will be implemented
thereafter. It was also agreed that all action for the acquisition of land
will be completed by December 31, 1993. Also, an understanding was reached
that the resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected families would be
based on the principle that such families should be provided with the means to
improve or at least restore their former living standards and earning
capacity. For this purpose, information and statistics on the sociological
and economic aspects of the affected people will be compiled, to enable a
proper understanding of their existing conditions. It is likely that the
affected people will fall under three categories viz. (i) those who own and
live on the land to be acquired; (ii) those who own the land (including under
Adat Law) but live elsewhere; and (iii) those whose primary source of income
is derived from their work on the land or reside on it but do not own it. The
compensation will be based on the valuation of the lost assets at their



- 31 -
replacement value. In addition, the affected families will be offered a
choice for resettlement under suitable transmigration schemes. The workers
under the third category who do not accept the transmigration option, will be
provided with work opportunities by PLN.
Technical Assistance
5.25      As a component of the Suralaya Thermal Power Project, technical
assistance (TA) will be provided for: (a) the engineering, design and
construction supervision of units 5, 6 and 7 at S-ralaya; (b) design and
engineering (First Phase) for the Banjarmasin Thermal Power Project in South
Kalimantan; (c) feasibility study for a high voltage submarine link between
Java and Sumatra; (d) consulting services for institutional development; and
(e) training of PLN's staff in public utility practices.
5.26      The engineering and design services for the Suralaya units 5, 6 and
7 will include all engineering studies, preparation of tender specifications
for the various contracts, bid evaluation, contract finalization with the
successful bidders, manufacturing surveillance, expediting, quality assurance,
as well as construction management services, leading up to the commissioning
and performance testing of the 600 MW units. Under the continuing transfer of
technology objective, the engineers of PLN will be associated with the
Consultants in all of the above activities.
5.27      Technical assistance for a proposed 90 MW coal/lignite-fired steam
power plant (first phase) at Banjarmasin, in South Kalimantan, with an
associated 150 kV transmission system, will comprise validation of the
selected site at Nuara Asem Asem and its recommended development strategy to
reconfirm the conclusions reached in a feasibility study completed in 1991.
Subject to this reconfirmation, the first phase of this TA component would
include developing a complete project implementation plan, including
performing detailed engineering and design for the power plant and the
associated transmission system leading to the preparation of major tender
documents, final environmental assessment report, detailed project cost
estimate, an implementation schedule, project management and procurement
plans, etc. Annex 5.11 provides details of the terms of reference for this TA
component.
5.28      The objective of the proposed TA for a high voltage submarine link
between Java and Sumatra is to examine the technical and economic feasibility
of connecting the two islands that would facilitate supply of power to the
Tanjung Karang area in Sumatra with the power available in Java. This link
could be used for limited power exchanges between Java and Sumatra. Annex
5.10 details the terms of reference for the proposed feasibility study.
5.29      The technical assistance for institutional development consists of
two components, viz. one aimed at strengthening PLN's organization (para. 4.5)
and the other relating to the human resource development plans and the
training of PLN's staff. Consultants will be engaged to help PLN accomplish
these objectives in an organized manner. An understanding was reached that
the contracts for the consulting services will be finalized no later than
November 30, 1993.

5.30      Under the proposed training scheme, PLN managers and engineers will
receive advanced training in utilities and manufacturer's works to further
develop their expertise in efficient utility management practices, including
in the areas of power plant engineering and design, as well as operation and
maintenance aspects of large, modern steam power plants. Also, proposals are
being formulated to train engineering degree students in local universities
selected by PLN for employment, in utility practices along with classtoom
training. Some US universities are also being contacted to create special
"sandwich" courFas for selected students. These students will be trained at
selected utilities and manufacturing works, along with classroom training.

Cost Estimates
5.31      Table 5.3 summarizes the project cost estimate.  The cost estimate
has been developed on the basi of current experience on 600 MW units,
available with the Consultants in their data base, as also vendor quotes on
similar equipment, escalated to 1991 prices. For the calculation of the price
contingencies, the annual inflation factors used are 3.7 percent for foreign
costs, and 6.0 percent for local costs respectively for 1992 and beyond.
Physical contingencies average about 6 percent, ranging from 5 percent for
equipment to 12-15 percent for works. The costs are inclusive of taxes and
duties. Local costs include VAT (Value Added Tax) on each local and foreign
contract at 10 percent, amounting to a total of about US$183.5 million.
Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 5.3.
5.32      The proposed Bank loan will help finance the following contract
packages.
(a) Marine Works
(b) Steelwork and Cladding
(c) Stacks
(d) Mechanical and Electrical Works
(e) Substations and Transformers
(f) Engineering and Construction Management for Suralaya, and

Financint Plan
5.33       The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 5.4.
5.34       The proposed Bank loan together with the earlier provision in Loan
3349-IND will finance about 27.2 percent of the foreign cost of the project
(excluding the IDC), or 18.4 percent of the project financing requirement.
The proceeds of the proposed Banl loan will be onlent by GOI to PLN for 20
years, inclusive of a grace period of 5 years. The signing of a subsidiary
loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of loan
effectiveness. The onlending rate from GOI to PLN would be the Bank's
variable interest rate plus a fee (defined in para. 6.22). The foreign
exchange risk will be borne by the Government. The Asian Development Bank
proposes to cofinance the project to the extent of US$350 million which will
be used to finance the turbine generators and ancillaries contract and a part
of the civil works. Also, cofinancing from Germany of about US$70.0 million
is expected for the construction of 500 kV transmission line and associated
substations. Export credits for the steam generators and ancillaries are
being arranged through a competitive bidding process. An agreement was

will be effective by September 30, 1993, and that the cofinancing for the
construction of the 500 kV transmission line and associated substations will
be effective by December 31, 1993. The effectiveness of the proposed ADB loan
will be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed Bank loan.
Contract Packazing
5.35      The contract strategy divides the secope of work on an island basis
for the boilers and the turbine generators, including their respective
ancillaries. In addition, there will be 10 international and 1 local contract
packages. A detailed description of the contract packages, is given in Annex
5.4.
Procurement
5.36      All goods, services and works financed under the proposed Bank loan
will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB), in
accordance with the Bank'o procurement guidelines. The Bank-financed
contracts are listed in para. 5.32. Procurement arrangements are suna-rized
in Table 5.5. In the ICB procedures for the procurement of equipment,
domestic manufacturer. would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of
15 percent of the CIF price or the actual import duty, whichever is less.
Also, in the ICB procedures for the procurement of civil works, domestic
contractors would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of
7.5 percent. Procurement of goods, as well as works financed by the proposed
Bank loan, estimated to cost over US$1,000,000 equivalent will be subject to
the Bank'a prior review of bidding documents, which is expected to cover all

contracts. For consulting services, the consultants will be selected and
engaged in accordance with Beak guidelines.
5.37        Annex 5.5 details the changes in the internal procurement procedures
of PLN, which are expected to improve the efficiency of the process. These
will be implemented as a part of the project. Blaed on this, a schedule of
contract av rds is indicated in Annex 5.6. In addition, PLN will assign a
senior level manager, to coordinate all aspects of the implementation of
Suralaya Units 5, 6 and 7 and the transmission system. He will be designated
as the Special Assistant to the Director of Construction and will have full
authority to interface with the PLN Board, as well as with the concerned

Government agencies. During the negotiations of the proposed project, an
understanding was reached on the terms of reference of the Special Assistant
to the Director of Construction, and it was agreed that he will be appointed
by October 31, 1992. It was also agreed that by December 31, 1992 PLN will
adopt and thereafter implement a schedule, satisfactory to the Bank, for the
award of contracts for goods, works and consultants' services under the
project.
Imnlementation Schedule
5.38      Annex 5.7 gives the implementation schedule for the proposed
Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7. Unit 5 will be built and placed in commercial
operation by March 1997, Unit 6 by September 1997 and Unit 7 by March 1998.
Consultants for the project (Black and Veatch International) have already been
selected and their services are being funded from the Loan 3349-IND for a part
of the engineering design and procurement activities. Bids have been invited
for the two major contracts, viz., the boiler island and the turbine generator
island in January 1992 and April 1992, respectively.
5.39      The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1999 and the
closing date for the loan will be September 30, 1999. The implementation
schedule for the proposed Suralaya units is based on the contracts for the
boiler and turbine generator islands being awarded no later than April 1,
1993. For the balance of the contracts to be awarded on schedule,
specifications for piling and circulating water channel, main civil works, and
mechanical and electrical works are required to be finalized, based on the
technical data to be obtained from the boiler and turbine island bids, as soon
as possible after the required information is available. Some key
construction milestone dates are given in Annex 5.8.
Allocation of the Loan Proceeds
5.40      Table 5.6 shows the allocation of the amounts of the proposed Loan
to each Category and the percentage of expenditures for items so to be
financed in each Category.
Disbursement
5.41      The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is given in
Annex 5.9, which also gives the disbursement profile for Bank-financed power
projects in Asis. The disbursements against the loan will be somewhat slower
than the profile since the two major front-end contracts are not being
financed through the Bank loan. To the extent practicable, withdrawal
applications will be aggregated in amounts of US$100,000 equivalent or more,
prior to submission to the Bank. In view of the large size of the contracts
involving direct payments, there is no need for special accounts or the use of
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures.
Monitorina and Renortina
5.42      Satisfactory procedures for progress reporting on the project have
been agreed upon during appraisal. The arrangements will provide for the
submission by PLN to the Bank of monthly progress reports in the earlier
phases of the project; such progress reports will be sent to the Bank within
ten days after the conclusion of each calendar month. After the procurement

6.2        Prior to 1985/86, in the absence of ROR targets from the
international lending institutions, the Government's policy on electricity
tariff permitted PLN's operations to function at or near financial break-even.
The Government provided substantial equity contribution towards PLN's sizeable
capital investment during this period. In 1986/87, PLY achieved a positive
rate of return (3.4 percent) on net revalued assets and its annual self-
financing ratio (SFR) was 23.0 percent. However, in 1987/88, PLN's financial
performance deteriorated substantially (ROR of -0.2 percent and SFR of
7 percent). This result was due mainly to the devaluation of the Indonesian
currency in September 1986, price escalation, and substantial increases in the



- 39 -
proportion of oil-based generation in 1987/88 because of the drought of 1987.
PLN's financial performance showed only marginal improvement in 1988/89. An
average increase of about 25 percent in the electricity rates approved by the
Government, effective April 1, 1989, restored and improved PLN's profitability
in 1989/90 and 1990/91.
6.3       PLN's operating performance varies considerably at regional levels.
PLN's Java operations, which supply electricity through an interconnected
system, are largely commercially-oriented and profitable. PLN's outside-Java
operations, which are mainly small-scale and dispersed over a large number of
islands, are mostly unprofitable, and have a negative impact on PLN's overall
finances. The selected 1989/90-1990/91 financial indicators for PLN's Java
and outside-Java operations are presented in Table 6.2.

6.4       In 1989/90, FLN's Java operations generated an operating profit of
Rp 691 billion, with an ROR of about 10.6 percent. The outside-Java
operations, however, incurred an operating loss of Rp 128 billion with an ROR
of about -5.3 percent, and thereby reduced PLN's overall operating profit to
Rp 563 billion, with an ROR of 6.3 percent. In 1990/91, the operating loss
incurred by the outside-Java operations increased to about Rp 248 billion,
with an ROR of -8.4 rt'cent, whereas the Java operations produced an operating
profit of Rp 562 billion with an ROR of 7.5 percent. PLN's financial
performance in 1990/91 was adversely affected by domestic fuel price increases
in Nay 1990 averaging about 15 percent, which were not passed through until



- 40 -
August 1991, when tariff adjustments were made to enable the Java operations
to achieve the covenanted ROR target in 1991/92 (para. 6.8). The May 1990
increases in fuel prices impacted more severely on the outside-Java operations
than the Java operations, as most generation outside Java is oil-based, and
the diesel oil prices were increased by 22.5 percent.
Financial Objectives
6.5       Under the Power Transmission Project (Loan 3349-IND signed August 8,
1991), PLN is required to: (a) realize for its Java operations, in 1991/92
and each fiscal year thereafter, an annual ROR of not less than 8 percent on
the average net revalued fixed assets in operation in Java, and (b) for its
outside-Java operations, achieve a break-even situation in each of its fiscal
years beginning with fiscal year 1993/94, i.e., total revenues equivalent to
no less than the sum of their (i) total operating expenses, and (ii) the
amount by which debt service requirements exceed the provision for
depreciation. These revenue covenants were also agreed under the proposed
preject.
6.6       The principal financial objectives underlying the revenue covenant
discussed above are that PLN should cover its operating expenses, realize
positive annual rates of return, meet its debt service requirements, maintain
adequate liquidity, self-finance about 30-35 percent of its annual capital
expenditures, and rely mostly on borrowings to finance the balance, confining
the Government's contributions to programs that involve the socially directed
activities such as rural electrification, mainly outside Java.
Present and Future Performance
6.7       PLN's financial performance for 1990/91, the estimate for 1991/92
and projections through 1998/99 and related income statements for its Java and
outside-Java operations are summarized in Table 6.3. (Details are given in
Annex 6.1; notes and assumptions underlying the projections are given in
Annex 6.2). In the projections, for the Java and non-Java operations the
sales growth is based on PLN's demand projections and generation expansion
plans (para. 2.9), and the investment requirements are based on the proposed
investment program to be implemented by PLN and exclude that proposed to be
implemented by private investors (paras. 2.11 and 2.12)
6.8       To enable PLN to achieve for its Java operations, the covenanted ROR
target in 1991/92 (para. 6.5), GOI approved increases in electricity tariffs
by an average vf about 20 percent effective August 1, 1991. To ensure the
continued achievement by PLN of its financial objectives in subsequent years,
the Government is committed to periodic tariff adjustments and is considering
proposals for introducing a mechanism for periodic formula-based adjustment of
the tariff to take into account, inter alia, variations in fuel prices and
exchange rate, and inflation. A tariff adjustment mechaniam report that was
prepared and submitted in June 1991, to the concerned GOI agencies is being
revised since the methodoloby contained therein was found to be too
theoretical for implementation. During the negotiations of the proposed loan
an agreement was r6ached that, by September 30, 1993, GOI will furnish to the
Bank for its review and comments, proposals for a revised adjustment mechanism

and an action plan to implement such a mechanism. Towards this end, the
revised report is expected to be finalized for approval by the PLN's Board of
Supervisors and submission to the Minister of Mines and Energy by September
30, 1992.
6.9              The financial projections show that PLN's overall profitability
would improve substantially with its overall annual rate of return rising from
about 3.0 percent in 1990/91 to 4.5 percent in 1991/92, and about 9.8 percent
in 1993/94, the last as a result of a tariff increase of about 25 percent
required for PLN's outside-Java operations to achieve the covenanted financial



- 42 -
break-even situation. Thereafter, the annual rates of return would be around
8-9 percent and the annual tariff increases required would be mainly to
compensate for the variation in the input costs, e.g., fuel, exchange rates
and inflation. The capital structure would remain satisfactory; the debt as a
percentage of debt plus equity (excluding revaluation surplus) would rise from
about 34 percent in 1990/91 to about 47 percent in 1994/95, and would
thereafter remain in the 44-47 percent range. PLN's debt service coverage
ratio would be in excess of 2.0 throughout the projection period. An axisting
covenant under Loan 3349-IND requires that PLN may not incur any additional
debt unless a reasonable forecast of its net revenues after expenditures for
each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5
times its projected debt service requirements. This covenant was also agreed
under the proposed project. PLN's current ratio is expected to be in the
range of 1.1 to 1.4 through most of the projection period; this would provide
adequate liquidity.
6.10      The financial projjctions show that during the forecast period,
FLN's operations outside Java would show substantial improvement from 1991/92
onwards, with the operating ratio declining from 135 percent in 1990/91 to
125 percent in 1992/93, and to 99 percent in 1993/94, with the electricity
tariff increased by about 25 percent to achieve the covenanted break-even in
that year (paras. 6.5 and 6.9). The profitability of PLN's Java operations
would also improve substantially, with the operating ratio declining and the
annual ROR rising, respectively, from the estimated 78 percent and 7.5 percent
in .990/91 to 67 percent and 14 percent in 1993/94. Thereafter, while the
operating ratio will remain around 65 percent, the annual RORs would be about
9-13 percent. Consequently, during the forecast period the Java operations
would exceed substantially the minimum ROR target of the revenue covenant
(para. 6.5), the result of the policy of maintaining uniform tariff and the
requirement to achieve the financial breakeven for PLN's outside Java
operations.
6.11      In the financial projections, PLN's capital expenditures (including
interest during construction) projected for 1991/92-1998/99 are derived from
the investment requirements shown in Annexes 2.5 and 2.6, and total about
Rp 59,890 billion ($30,065 million) in current prices; they exclude the
capital expenditures for generation projects proposed to be implemented by
private investors (para. 2.11). The Bank financial projections assume that
for the proposed investment program to be implemented by PLN, the financing
strategy will follow the principles discussed in para. 2.13. The financing
plans assumed in the financial projections for the REPELITA V (1989/90-
1993/94) and REPELITA VI (1994/95-1998/99) are presented and compared to that
for the REPELITA IV (1984/85-1988/89) in Table 6.4. Details are given in
Annex 6.1.
6.12      In the projected financing plan for the REPELITA V (1989/90-
1993/94), the Government's contribution is estimated to be about 26 percent,
compared to about 40 percent for the REPELITA IV period, with the annual
contribution declining to about 21 percent in 1992193, and to about 10 percent
in 1993/94. PLN's own contribution from its internal sources is projected to
increase from about 13 percent during REPELITA IV to about 26 percent during
REPELITA V, with annual SFR declining from 31 percent in 1990/91 to about

Borrowings w-ould need to cover about 48 percent of the financial requirements
during the REPELITA V, compared to about 46 percent in the REPELITA IV.
During REPELITA VI, PLN's own contribution would increase to about 50 percent
and that of the Government would decrease to about 18 percent, with borrowings
covering about 32 percent of the requirements. Assuming that private
investors would construct on a "Build, Own and Operate" (BOO) basis 2,400 MM
(4 x 600 MW coal-fired units) of generating capacity to be available in Java
in 1997/98 - 1998/99 (para. 2.11) and would supply energy at Rp 115/kWh (in
1991/92 prices) instead of at the Rp 80/kWh (in 1991/92 prices) assumed in the
financial proj ctions, then, PLN's operating expenses would increase by an
average of Rp 600 billion per year during 1997/98 - 1998/99. In order to
maintain rL'-.sls ROR performance in those year at the levels shown in the
financial projections, PLN's average tariff would need to increase in 1997/98
by about 5 percent over the level forecast for that year, to absorb the power
purchase cost.
Performance Monitorina
6.13      For monitoring the financial performance under the revenue covenants
discussed in para. 6.5 for PLN's Java and outside-Java operations, PLN has
been providing the Bank with separate historical financial results (beginning
with its fiscal year 1986/87) and forecasts on a proforma basis, but not
separate audited financial statements. Accounting for PLN's Java and outside-
Java operations is separate except for overhead expenses, for which regional
accounts are not maintained.
Tariffs
6.14      PLN's tariff schedules, which became effective August 1, 1991,
comprise 24 consumer categories. For medium and large industrial consumers,
large commercial consumers, large social institutions, and for large office
buildings, time-of-day pricing is in effect. The 1991 and earlier tariff
schedules are shown in Annex 6.3.



- 44 -
6.15      Under th3 Power Transmission Project (Loan 3349-IND) it was
covenanted that (a) PLN will periodically review its long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) and tariff structure, and discuss the results of the review with the
Government and the Bank, and (b) before December 31 in each year, PLN will
review the adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirements of the revenue
covenants (para. 6.5). Such a review will take into account the results of
the review of the LRMC-based structure. These covenants were also agreed
under the proposed project.
6.16      In April 1990, PLN completed a study of its LRMC of supply in Java,
which was reviewed by the Bank. The study indicated that PLN's average revenue
in 1989/90 would have been Rp 132.2/kWh, if the tariff of each consumer
category was set at the estimated LRMC of supply in Java. PLN's actual
average revenue in 1989/90 was Rp 114.1/kWh. With the average tariff increase
of about 20 percent implemented effective August 1, 1991 (para. 6.8), PLN's
average revenue in 1991/92 would be about Rp 134.5/kWh on an annualized basis.
This calculation of the average revenue does not include the connection fees
paid by consumers. The level of the electricity tariff is close to or above
the LRMC of supply for all categories of consumers except small social
institutions, small residential and small industrial consumers. For consumers
supplied at medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV), the structure of the
electricity tariff is consistent with the LRMC of supply. For consumers
supplied at low voltage (LV), a large proportion of the cost is being
recovered through the energy charge rather than the capacity (demand) charge,
which is usually the practice in most power utilities. The LRMC study is
currently being updated.
Taxes
6.17      In accordance with the prevailing tax legislation effective since
1984, PLN is s.bject to a 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) and to corporate
income tax. The Government currently bears the VAT on the foreign contracts,
and PLN bears it on the local contracts; this policy is assumed to continue
throughout the projection period. With respect to corporate income tax, the
current Indonesian tax code permits the use of accelerated depreciation of
assets in operation, instead of the straight-line method used by PLN in its
financial accounting. As a result, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate
income tax for its fiscal year 1990/91, and during the projection period. In
calculating the rate of return, however, any income tax payments will be taken
into account.
Overall DeveloDment Fund
6.18      Under Government Regulation No. 18 of 1972, that established PLN
(para. 1.10), the provisions relating to the disposal of PLN's annual net
profit after corporate income tax require that 55 percent of such profit be
set aside for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta" (DPS), or the Overall Development
Fund for which the required payment should be made to the state treasury.
Regulation No. 18/1972 also provided that the Minister of Finance may directly
reinvest in PLN for the expansion of its facilities the DPS funds payable by
PLN. So far, PLN has retained such DPS funds for financing its investment
requirements and has made no payments to the treasury in this regard. A



- 45 -
Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990 has superseded PLN's governing Regulation
No. 18 of 1972, and the earlier provision that allowed the Minister of Finance
to reinvest in PLN the proceeds of the DPS funds payable by PLN is no longer
applicable. During the negotiations of the loan for the Power Transmission
Project in March 1991, the Bank noted that PLN had a sizeable investment
program that was expected to grow substantially over the next several years
and expressed the concern that any large payments by PLN to DPS (as required
under Government Regulation No. 17 of 1990) would significantly reduce its
self-financing capability. Recognizing the need to ensure that PLN would have
sufficient funds available to carry out its investment program, the GOI
indicated that its equity contributions in the past had accounted for a large
share of PLN's investments and that it would continue to make its best efforts
to provide funding to ensure that PLN would be able to implement its
investment program. During the negotiations of the proposed loan, an
agreement was reached with GOI that it will take all such actions as shall be
necessary to ensure that any transfer of profits from PLN to the DPS shall not
prevent PLN from implementing its agreed investment program (para. 2.16).
With respect to the about Rp 70 billion payable by PLN to the DPS, for the
period up to 1989/90 based on the provisions of Governmant Regulation No. 18
of 1972, the Government has agreed for PLN to pay that amount in ten equal
annual installments starting in 1991/92.
Financing Policy
6.19      PLN formulates its long-term investment program spanning a ten-year-
horizon, which is updated periodically. The plan is reviewed by the GOI and a
five-year time-slice of it is incorporated in the country's development plan,
the latest of which (REPELITA V) commenced on April 1, 1989. Based on the
approved framework of the five-year plan, PLN prepares an annual plan and a
budget, which is approved by the Government. In recent years, the Government
has shown a strong commitment towards these plans and has taken steps to
enable PLN to implement them. During REPELITA IV, the Government's
contribution amounted to about 40 percent of PLN's investment expenditures,
whereas PLN's own contribution was only 13.6 percent with the balance of about
46 percent being financed by borrowings (paras. 6.11-6.12). The level of
PLN's own contribution was low because it was not permitted any upward
adjustment in its tariff during the REPELITA IV period.
6.20      An existing covenant (Loan 3349-IND) relating to the long-term
aspects of PLN's financial planning was also agreed under the proposed
project. This covenant requires that, as part oi its ongoing annual planning
activities, PLN should prepare a ten-year financial forecast based on its
proposed development plan, and also prepare for the first five years of the
forecast period a financing plan that should indicate the amount of external
financing and the appropriate mix of equity and debt, and if possible the
potential sources of financing. The covenant also requires that PLN's
development plan, and related financial forecast and financing plan will be
reviewed and adopted by its Board, and that these plans and the forecast will
be submitted to and discussed with the Government and the Bank. Technical
assistance is being provided under the Power Se:tor Efficiency Project (Loan
3097-IND) to help develop further the financial planning capability in PLN
(para. 4.4).



- 46 -
6.21      The Government proposes to continue to finance PLN's investment from
three sources, namely, PLN's internal funds, borrowings and Government
contributi - .  In view of the large and rapidly growing investment
requirement& of the sector, there is a need to develop a strategy for the
long-term financing requirements of PLN. Also, there is need to develop a
suitable framework that will allow PLN to reasonably formulate and implement
investment plans in a predictable financial environment. As a step towards
developing such a framework, PLN is drafting a five-year corporate plan for
1992/93-1996/97 that would include a financing plan for the five-year period
and specify targets for PLN's self-financing, GOI contributions and
borrowiugs. There would be a need to define the strategy for PLN's
borrowings, including access to local capital markets. During the negotiation
of the proposed loan, an understanding was reached that for PLN's Five-Year
Corporate Plan (RENSALITA) for 1992/93-1996/97 that was under preparation and
expected to be finalized by September 30, 1992, ;.he various planning
assumptions to be used for the preparation of the RENSALITA are discussed and
agreed to by the concerned Government agencies such as the office of the
Coordinating Minister for Economic and Industrial Affairs and Development
Supervision (EKUIN & WASBANG), the Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS so that
PLN's corporate plan is consistent with the macroeconomic prospects and
resource availability. A GOI interdepartmental group has been established for
this purpose with the coordinating responsibility vested in the Director
General of Electricity and New Energy, Ministry of Mines and Energy. While
the five-year corporate plan of PLN would outline the investment program and a
notional financing plan, a clear strategy for financing the investment program
in the power sector remains to be defined. Towards this end, the GOI intends
to obtain soon technical assistance, using funds under the Technical
Assistance Project for Public and Private Provision of Infrastructure (Loar
3385-IND), for a detailed study of this subject for which draft terms of
reference have been prepared.
6.22      PLN is authorized by its charter to borrow from local and foreign
lenders and to issue its own obligations. However, in line with its policy
for all State Corporations, the Government secures all foreign borroslngs on
behalf of PLN and bears the foreign exchange risk. Until the Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2778-IND) approved in January 1987, the onlending
rate included a banking fee of only 0.25 percent over the Bank's standard
variable interest rate to cover the administrative charges. In line with the
Bank's objective of gradually adjusting the onlending rate to a level
comparable to one that would apply if the loan was made directly to PLN, fees
were increased to 3.5 percent under the Power Transmission Project (Loan
3349-IND) approved in June 1991. For the proposed project, the Government has
agreed to onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to PLN for 20 years
including a grace period of 5 years, at an interest rate equal to the sum of
(a) the Bank's standard variable interest rate, (b) a variable fee equal to
the average of the annual rate of the change in the value of the Rupiah
against the US dollar, during the previous three years, and (c) a service
charge of 1.0 percent per annum. The onlending interest rate would be applied
to the principal amount outstanding under the proposed subsidiary loan (para.
5.34), expressed as the aggregate of the Rupiah equivalent, determined as of
the respective dates of withdrawal, of the value of the currency or currencies
deemed to have been relent to PLN. This arrangement will ensure that PLN



- 47 -
compensates the Government for the foreign exchange risk that will be borne by
the Government.
Asset Revaluation
6.23      PLN's assets have been revalued periodically.  The last detailed
revaluation was done in 1979 as required of all public corporations under
instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The revaluation was recorded in the
books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired after March 31,
1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September
1986, the Government issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dazed October 2, 1986,
providing for the revaluation of assets of businesses and public corporations,
acquired through September 12, 1986. The Regulation specifies the annual
revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting the asset values
as of January 1, 1987. For purposes of monitoring the revenue covenants
(para. 6.5) PLN has prepared a revaluation of its assets for 1979/80-1986/87
based on the Regulation. The methodology used by PLN for asset revaluation is
satisfactory to the Bank. A. covenant, under Loan 3349-IND, that requires PLN
to revalue annually its fixed assets (including work in progress and
consumers' contributions) and accumulated depreciation for the pu.rposes of the
rate of return and break-even calculations under the revenue covenant
(para. 6.5), was also agreed under the proposed project.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.1       Indonesia has faced in the past significant shortages in
electricity supply. Over the last year, in particular, the situation has
worsened: power curtailment by rotation has been enforced in the Java-Bali
system for industrial users, thereby limiting their operation to only four to
five days a week and causing considerable under-utilization of plant
facilities and manpower. The reduction of 350 NW at peak load from October
1991 to December 1991, was caused by an extended drought which reduced the
hydropower production. In addition, since December 1990, PLN is carrying a
backlog of 1,899 new connections totaling an estimated load of 3,840 MW. The
proposed project, as part of the least-cost generation plan of the Java-Bali
system, will assist in maintaining a balance between the demand and supply.
7.2       The Suralaya site was developed to accommodate seven generating
units, for a total capacity of 3,100 MW which was later revised to 3,400 MW as
confirmed by a feasibility study. The first four units of 400 MW each are
coal-fired units, already in commercial operation.  The major infrastructure
of the power plant including the cooling system and some of the common
services, have been developed for the ultimate plant capacity.
Demand Growth and Proiect Needs
7.3       Over the past decade, the sales of PLN in the Java-Bali system,
which accounts for approximately 80 percent of PLN's total electricity sales,
iricreased from 5.1 TWh to 22.4 TWh at an annual rate of 15.9 percent. This
high rate of growth can be attributed to: (a) the extension of supply to new
consumers; (b) growth in consumption by existing customers; and (c) the
gradual take-over of supply to industries previously utilizing their own
captive plants. Despite this substantial increase in supply, PLN has not been
able to meet the overall electricity demand, and captive generation facilities
continued to grow at a sustained rate of over 10 percent per annum. A summary
of the actual and projected annual growth of electricity sales by sector for
the period 1980-2000 is presented in Table 7.1 be'.ow.

Energy sold                       15.9                         12.3
7.4       To meet the projected demand growth, new generating capacity is
required to be added to the system. The plants under various stages of
implementation are: (a) Gresik Combined Cycle - 1,580 MW; (b) Muara Karang
Combined Cycle - 450 MW; (c) Priok Combined Cycle - 1,200 MW, and (d) Paiton
coal fired units I and 2 - 800 MW. The Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7 (1,800 MW)
constitute the next step in the least cost development plan. They are a part
of the core investment plan that is justified under all the demand scenarios
(para 2.7).
Least Cost Plan
7.5       The main focus of Indonesia's energy policy is to move away from
the use of oil by a balanced utilization of gas in combined-cycle plants to
the extont it is available, coal in steam-power plants, and, given resource
constraints and economic viability, hydro and geothermal power plants. In a
recent study by PLN that compared the costs of generation of different sources
of power, the costs of alternate energy sources such as coal, combined-cycle,
geothermal and nuclear were analyzed (Annex 7.1). The combined-cycle plant
was proven to be the most economical, followed by the coal-fired power plant,
with the latter costing approximately 5 percent more per kilowatt hour
produced. The geothermal and nuclear power plants were significantly more
expensive, with 43 percent and 56 percent higher costs per kilowatt hour
produced. In the least-cost plan, PLN has provided for about 5,200 KW of
combined-cycle gas-fired generating capacity to be commissioned by the year
2000, based on the known availability of gas in Java.
Economic Rate of Return
7.6       It is not feasible to calculate a rate of return for an individual
generation project, as benefits are contingent upon complementary investments
in transmission and distribution and upon the coordinated operation of the
project within PLN's power generation system. Hence, an internal economic
rate of return has been calculated on the basis of incremental costs and sales
resulting from the implementation of the least-cost expansion plan for the



- so -
Java-Bali system for the period 1991/92 - 1997/98, of which the proposed
project  as a part.
7.7       The investments in generation and transmission and distribution
have been converted by applying shadow price factors of (a) 0.8 for
domestically-procured equipment and materials (about 20 percent of the total
investment); and (b) 0.65 for unskilled labor (approximately 10 percent of the
total investment). Incremental fuel costs are based on the results of an
operation simulation model, and on Bank-defined scenarios of international
prices (Annex 7.2).
7.8       The benefits from the proposed investment program have been
estimated by revenue from the sale of electricity, and on the basis of
"willingness to pay" of industrial and residential consumers.
7.9       The willingness to pay for industrial consumers is estimated to
equal the cost of electricity provided by captive diesel plants, in the range
of 152 Rp/kWh to 377 Rp/kWh, equivalent to 1.3 to 2.7 times PLN's average
revenues from industrial consumers, depending upon the utilization rate and
the size of the plant. For the present analysis, a conservative factor of 1.5
has been used.
7.10      The willingness to pay for residential consumers has been estimated
by two components: the incremental consumers' surplus on the diverted market
(resource cost saving resulting from the substitution of electricity for
kerosene), and the incremental consumers' surplus in the new market (the
increased value due to the lower cost of electricity). In order not to over-
estimate the willingness to pay, the analysis has assumed that the consumer
surplus accrues to half the difference between the cost of private generation,
kerosene lighting, and consumer's prevailing tariff. This implies that at
present levels of demand, consumers have a price elasticity of -1.0. 1/
This is equivalent to an estimate of the willingness to pay of Rp 165 kWh,
i.e., 1.6 times the prevailing tariff.2/
7.11      The internal rate of return of PLN's investment program n Java for
1991/92-1997/98 works out to 20 percent at the prevailing tariffs, taking into
account the higher willingness to pay, as discussed above. When the
willingness to pay is not taken into account, the economic rate of return is
11 percent (Annex 7.3).
I/   There is ample evidence that in Indonesia the price elasticity at lcw
levels of consumption is in the range of -0.2 to -0.45, implying that
consumers are relatively insensitive to price and therefore more than
half would be prepared to pay the costs of private supply. "Analysis and

7.12      The economic rate of return decreases to 18 percent if all the
investments in generation and transmission/distribution increase by
10 percent, or if the sales decrease by 10 percent. With benefits calculated
as revenue at prevailing tariff, the rate of return for these changes would
reduce to about 9 percent.
Rlisks
7.13      The Suralaya Thermal Power Project is similar to the four coal-
fired units constructed earlier at the same site, and the two coal-fired units
being built at Paiton, except for higher capacity rating of the proposed
units. The experience gained by the management and staff of PLN will ensure
alleviation of technical risks associated with the proposed project. There is
a risk of delay in project Implementation for two reasonst first, PLN will
need to award the contracts on schedule; and second, there could be
inefficiency in implementation. The first would be reduced by the agreement
reached with PLN and 001 on a time schedule for contract awards. The second
is reduced by developing a satisfactory project implementation plan, with
milestone dates for major events in the procurement, construction and
comissioning activities, to be coordinated by a senior-level manager in the
PLN organization, appointed for this specific purpose, as agreed under the
project (pare. 5.37).

SURALAYA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Design Features
General
1.        Suralaya Thermal Power Project comprises expansion of an existing
coal-fired power station at Suralaya from its present installed capacity of
1,600 MW (4 x 400 MW units) to its ultimate capacity of 3,400 MW by insralling
three additional 600 MW units. The scheduled dates of commercial operation of
the proposed units are as follows:
Unit 5              March 1997
Unit 6              September 1997
Unit 7              March 1998
2.        The existing power plant uses about 4 million tons of coal per year,
procured from the Bukit Asam coal mines located in South Sumatra.
Approximately another 5 million tons of coal per year will be required for the
three new units, which will be procured through open tendering from Kalimantan
or South Sumatra at competitive prices. A new coal jetty will be built to
facilitate unloading of coal from mechanized ship unloaders.
3.        The steam parameters of the 600 MW turbine generator sets will be
the same as for the existing 400 MW units, with throttle steam pressure of 169
kg/cm2, and final superheat and reheat temperatures of 5380 C. The condenser
back pressure will be 56 mm Hg, based on a cooling water design inlet
temperature of 30 C.
Turbine Generator
4.        Units 5, 6 and 7 will have a nominal capacity of 600 MW each.  Many
units in this size ra..ge are in satisfactory operation the world over. Each
turbine generator will have two low pressure turbines, complete with double
shell, double pass condensers, eight stage feed water heating and deaerating
train, generator cooling systems, excitation system and other ancillary
equipment. The main boiler fee pumps will be steam turbine driven.
5.        The design will include a turbine bypass system consisting of a
high- pressure turbine bypass and a low-pressure turbine bypass to facilitate
continued operation of the boiler and turbine after loss of export load
without having to trip mills. This allows the load to be reestablished
rapidly so. n after system restoration. The turbines will also be capable of
variable pressure operation. The generators will be hydrogen cooled, with
water-cooled stator windings.

Steam Generator
6.        The steam generators will be of the single reheat, drum type, each
rated to produce 1,850,000 kg of steam per hour at the steam conditions given
in para.3 above. Seven coal pulverizers per unit will be provided to ensure
design capability of the boiler when burning the worst coal. There will be
two trains of draft fans per boiler, along with two separate air heaters.
Light fuel oil will be used for start-up. The steam generators will be
capable of operating up to 30 percent load at full pressure on light fuel oil
only. Fuel oil will also be used for flame stabilization when burning
excessively wet coal and/or at low loads.
Coal Handling
7.        Coal will be delivered to the power plant by ocean-going ships.
With a multiple-sourcing policy implemented through an open-tendering process,
and the likelihood that vessels other than self-unloading types may need to be
used, a new coal jetty will be built, equipped with ship-unloaders. The coal,
after being unloaded by mechanical means, will be transported to the boiler
bunkers by belt conveyors, or diverted to the coal yard for later reclamation,
for which additional yard stocking out and reclaim facilities will be
provided.
Circulating Water System
8.        Sewater from the Sunda Strait is the source of cooling water for the
power station. The cooling water system supplies seawater from an intake
canal via a screening and pumping station to the condensers and other
equipment, returning it to the sea via a discharge channel. The pumping
station also supplies sea water to the desalination units to provide high
quality fresh water for the plant. A demineralizer plant will further
condition the water to condensate quality for use in the boilers. The
existing, open-flume circulating water intake and discharge system are sized
adequately to support the proposed ultimate station capacity of 3,400 MW. The
pump house structure will contain a bar grill, with powered trash rack, drum-
type screens and vertical mixed-flow type circulating water pumps. The
structure will also contain auxiliary water pumps primarily used to supply
cooling water for the various plant equipment through the closed cooling water
system heat exchangers. The condensers will have titanium tubes and titanium
tube sheets. Each condenser will have a continuous ball-type tube cleaning
system.
Ash Handling
9.        A dense-phase fly ash collection system will be used to evacuate the
electrostatic precipitators and other boiler dust hoppers of ash into
designated eilos, the fine ash from the precipitators being collected in one
silo and the coarser ash from other dust hoppers in a separate silo. The fly
ash from the silos will then be conveyed, after conditioning, over a belt
conveyor to the ash disposal yard. Because of its pozzolanic properties, fly
ash can be used commercially as an admixture with cement up to as much as

Page 3
25-30 percent without impairing the strength of concrete. There is
provision, therefore, to load ash into trucks for sale.
Instrumentation and Controls
10.       A micro-processor based distributed control systemtt will be used.
Display of plant-specific equipment status and operating parameters on CRT's
installed in the main control room will provide real-time interface between
operators and plant systems. CRT's'will also provide facilities for retrieval
of plant operating data, as desired. Data loggers and sequence of events
recorders will automatically record plant performance on a periodic basis, and
display opercting problems as they occur on a first-out basis.
Transmission Lines and Substations
11.       The 500 kV substation at Suralaya is currently being developed by
the addition of three more bays, providing two outgoing circuits to Cilegon,
plus the addition of a second 250 MVA interbus transformer. The 150 kV
substation at Suralaya is also currently being developed by the addition of
three more bays, with an off-load connection to the existing 150 kV
substation. The substation will be further expanded under the project to
accommodate the connections with units 5, 6 and 7. The 150 kV substation will
also be expanded to include one more bay with connections to the two new
station service transformers, to be installed for the proposed units. A
single-circuit 500 kV transmission line (about 125 km) between Cilegon and
Cibinong with associated substatior,, will be constructed under the proposed
project to augment power evacuation  _:: the Suralaya plant, while enhancing
reliability of the transmission _ys  .
Environmental Issues
12.       Annex 5.2 serves to provide details of the environmental assessment
and issues associated with the proposed project.

SURALAYA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Environmental Assessment Summary
1.        The proposed project entails the expansion of the Suralaya Steam
Power Station in West Java, 'by constructing three additional coal-fired units
of 600 MW each. The Engineering Department of PLN (the State Electricity
Corporation), in association with their Consulting Engineers, has conducted a
feasibility study and prepared a pre3iminary design report on the proposed
expansion. Earlier Bank loans have already supported the installation of four
coal-fired generating units, 400 MW each, at this site (Loans 1708-IND, 1872-
IND, 2214-IND and 2443-IND under the Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth and Fourteenth
Power Projects respectively). An environmental assessment for the project,
conducted in 1980 when Units 1 and 2 were built, concluded that the Suralaya
site could accommodate up to 3,100 MW in generating capacity. This report,
upd&ced in 1984 as a part of Suralaya Units 3 and 4 development, reached the
ssme conclusion. The feasibility study for the proposed units was conducted
to address the likely environmental impacts of the power plant, including:
(a) determination of the number of generating units the site could optimally
accommodatel and (b) the ultimate plant capacity that could be built at this
site. The conclusion is that the site could accommodate seven units, with the
capacity of the last three units being 600 MW each, resulting in an ultimate
plant capacity of 3,400 MW.
Current Status
2.        At present, the Suralaya Steam Power Station has four coal-fired
units of 400 MW each, all in commercial operation. The power generated at
this plant is conveyed to the main load center in Jakarta over 500 kV double-
circuit transmission lines. Coal for the power plant is mined at Bukit Asam,
situated across the Sunda Strait in South Sumatra. The present consumption of
coal is about 4 million tons per year, the coal being transported to the site
in self-unloading ships and barges. The ash generated after combustion of the
coal, is conveyed to an ash disposal area.
Pro1ect Descrigtion
3.        The proposed project, with three additional coal-fired generating
units of 600 MW each, wi ' increase the capacity of the Suralaya Plant to its
ultimate potential of 3,400 MW, as determined by the feasibility study. The
boilers will use pulverized coal as the primary fuel, using light oil mainly
for startup purposes. Steam generated in the boiler at high pressure and
temperature, will drive a multi-stage steam turbine coupled to a generator to
produce electricity. The steam exhausts into a condenser, where it ias
condensed back into water (condensate) and pumped through a number of feed
water heaters back into the boiler. Sea water is pumped through the condenser
to help condense the steam into water. Tne condenser circulating water system
will remain as an open flume arrangement. Fresh water for the plant will be

produced by desalination and makeup water by demineralization.  The liquid
effluent generated from the water treatment process will be treated and
neutralized in a waste water treatment plant. The plant instrumentatica and
control system will deploy state-of-the-art, microprocessor-based technology.
The existing 500 kV substation will be expanded to accommodate connections
from the new units. Additional 500 kV circuits will also be built to augment
the transmiesion system capacity.
The Existinx Site
4.        The power station, situated about 100 km vast of Jakarta, was built
initially with an infrastructure to support the installation of seven power
generating units. Unit I was built in 1984, unit 2 in 19C5, unit 3 in 1988
and unit 4 in 1989. Common facilities, such as the cooling water system, coal
handling, ash disposal, the electrical switchyard and social support
facilities for the permanent staff, were however designed to suit the
initially assessed ultimate station capacity.
5.        The plant site is located at the center of a one-kilometer long
horseshoe-shaped lowland adjacent to the coast. The lowland is surrounded by
volcanic hills with a maximum height of 375 m. Soils throughout most of the
project area are basic volcanic deposits, interspersed with some alluvial
soil, consisting of complex mixtures of sand, silt, clay and organic matter.
Cultivation of paddy on these soils is common. The beach is composed of
comparatively recent marine, sandy deposits. The surrounding hills include
medium to fine textured residual soils. The total area of natural forest
around the site is 5.1 hectares, mostly comprising teak and mangroves. There
are a number of fish species around the plant area. There is also an
abundance of plankton species in the strait, high in the rainy season and low
in the dry season. The local populace lives on agriculture and fishing, while
a few are engaged as labor by the power plant and local industries, consisting
of metal and chemical plants, plywood, construction material, handicraft and
other medium and small scale industries.
6.        The existing plant, with four units in commercial operation, has
been working satisfactorily without causing any adverse impacts on the
environment. The gaseous emissions from the plant, as a matter of fact, are
lower than those predicted through modeling studies conducted before
appraisal.
Imnacts and Mitigation
7.        The pollutants from the plant are: (a) stack emissions of
particulate matter (fly ash), SO2, NO., and CO2; (b) thermal pollution caused
by the circulating water discharged into the sea at an elevated temperature;
(e) liquid effluents Comprising coal pile area leachate and runoff, ash
disposal area leachate and runoff, water treatuant plant area wastes,
demineralizer plant effluents, intermittent effluents generated by boiler
chemical cleaning operations, air preheater wash, etc., and other
miscellaneous waste waters; (d) solid wastes comprising bottom ash, fly ash,
fugitive dusts from coal, ash and other chemicals used in the water treatment
plant.

8.        Air Ouality:
An air quality modeling was initially done based on the
meteorological data collected over a period of more than one year in and
around the plant site. The existing ground level concentrations of pollutanto
were established and a prediction of the expected ground level air quality wes
made, with four generating units in operation. Air quality impacts have been
subsequently investigated through a review of climatic conditions in the site
area, aralysis of more than one year of detailed on-site meteorological
measurements at two different locations,l/ and application of a sequential
hour-by-hour air quality dispersion model. Besides, monitoring for S02 and
N0 was conducted with portable analyzers at nine other locations. PLNs'
Consultants, Monenco, had used the MSTACKS screening model to determine the
ground level concentrations of the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen to be
expected from the Suralaya Thermal Power Station, assuming all seven units in
operation at full load of 3,400 MW. The analysis was carried out to delineate
the likely impacts of the expanded plant, and to provide inputs for the
determination of an optimal stack height, pollution control requirements, and
other design factors.   The computer model utilized the collected data to
predict 24-hour maximum pollutant concentrations, as well as annual average
concentrations in the regions surrounding the plant. The results of such
modeling indicated that ground level concentrations of S02 and NO, will remain
within regulatory limits prescribed by the GOI as well as the guidelines of
the Bank, using a stack height of 250 meters and average sulfur in coal of
0.7 percent.
Particulate Matter - Assuming the coal to have an average ash
content of 10 per cent, the three units with a combined generating capacity of
1,800 MW, will produce approximately 950 tons of fly ash per day at 70 per
cent load factor. Electrostatic Precipitators, to be installed at the back
end of the boilers with a particulate removal efficiency of 99.5 percent, will
remove at least 945 tons of flv ash from the stack gas to prevent pollution of
the environment.
Ss Emission - Sulfurous oxides are produced by chemical reaction
during the combustion process between the inherent sulfur present in the coal
and oxygen in the air used for combustion. This emission can be controlled by
the procurement of low-sulfur coal or by installing stack gas scrubbers (flue
gas desulfurization) to remove the S02. In case of Suralaya, this emission
will be basically controlled by the procurement of low-sulfur coal. The Bukit
Asam coal that is now being burned at the existing plant has an average sulfur
content of 0.3Z (worst coal 0.67X). The coal for the proposed additional
units at Suralays will be obtained from coal mines in Kalimantan, having
sulfur content of less than 0.5 percent. Also, the Bank StandcVrds specify the
allowable limit for SO2 emission as 500 tons pe- day (TPD) for unpolluted or
moderately polluted background. It is estimated that the maximum SO2 emission
for the 3,400 NW power plant, burning the worst coal with 0.67X sulfur and at
70X plant factor, will be around 345 TPD.

Le  For unpolluted or moderately polluted background.
With new Consultants on board (Black and Veatch International), it
was decided to review the above conclusion. The results of the BVI study,
using Complex I model, indicate that in order to meet the GOI regulations and
the Bank guidelines, it vould be necessary to increase the stack height to 275
meters and reduce the average sulfur content of the coal to 0.38 percent. In
this context, it may be noted that there is a greater degree of conservatism
built into this stack plume dispersion model, which is estimated to range from
1.3 to 2.0.
The Consultants have also studied the plume dispersion with
0.5 percent average sulfur in coal. The studies show that the Bank guidelines
for ambient SO2 concentration can be met; however, the 001 regulatory limits
could be exceeded at seven elevated locations, at heights above 300/350
meters. It is estimated that the periods for which such excesses take place
could be about 10 days during October-March (rainy season), provided all seven
units (3,400 MW) of the plant are in operation at full load for 100 percent of
the time. Considering that: (a) the US model has a higher degree of
conservatism; (b) the Monenco studies indicate compliance; and (c) the
operation of all seven units at full load during the rainy season is highly
unlikely, it is considered acceptable to specify coal sulfur content of
0.5 percent average (rather than 0.38 percent) with the stack height of 275
meters. In addition, as a matter of extra caution, monitoring arrangements
will be made at critical locations identified by the model studies, during the
operation of the plant to confirm that the GOI regulations are not violated.
-x- levels - NOx is generated by the interaction of inherent
nitrogen in the fuel, as well as nitrogen in the air, during combustion at
elevated temperatures. The higher the combustion temperature, and the higher
the total quantity of air used for combustion, the more the production of NOz.
This pollutant in a pulverized coal-fired boiler can be basically controlled
by properly designed burners that use a low excess-air combustion system.

9.        Thermal Pollution:
The condenser cooling water is drawn from the sea through a
eubmerged irtake, and after circulating through the condenser, is discharged
through an open flume, approximately 1.7 km away from the intake. The average
ambient sea water temperature varies between 28 C and 300 C.  The rise in the
temperature of this water, after cooling the turbine exhaust steam, will be
around 7.5 C; however, as the water flows over the open discharge flume and
meets t},e huge volume of sea water at the outfall, the heat is quickly
dissipated. The temperature rise in the sea water at the outfall as a result
of mixing with the circulating water is expected to be no more than 1-2e C,
ihich is expected to have no detrimental effect oll marine life. According to
recent studies conducted by tho Center for Ocaarological Research and
Development of Indonesia, the known species have shown good tolerance to such
increased temperature and water discharged at the outfall.
A cooling water dispersion measurement was conducted earlier by the
Gajah Mada University of Indonesia based on the 3,100 MW plant. This study
has been updated by the same university for the 3,400 MW plant. The report,
reviewed by the Bank, confirms the earlier findings.
The circulating water will also be chlorinated in order to prevent
organic growths from building up in the condenser. Experience with
chlorination in the running plant has establiched that continuous presence of
chlorine at relatively low concentrations is sufficient for this purpose.
Success has been achieved with chlorine concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm and
this has had no detrimental effect on the marine life. The chlorination
system for the proposed plant will also be designed on similar lines.
10.       Liauid Effluents:
The liquid effluents can be listed as: (a) those iischarged from the
desalination and the water treatment plants; (b) sanitary waste water;
(c) power plant miscellaneoue drains; (d) air preheater wash water and boiler
chemical cleaning wastes; (e) coal pile leachate and runoff; and (f) ash
disposal area leachate and runoff.
(a)  The process of desalination does not produce any harmful effluent,
except that it is sea water concentrated by a factor of 1.1 at an
approximate temperature of 39.5 C. This effluent will be
discharged into the discharge channel. As the desalination plant
effluent flow rate is very small (about 0.5 m3/s) compared to the
circulating water flow rate (about 140 m3/s), it is not expected to
cause any significant impact. Liquid chemical effluents from the
water treatment plant will be controlled by the use of a properly
designed waste water treatment system. Each contaminant, including
metallic wastes, will be studied by its cumulative and synergistic
effects on the marine ecosystem, and treatwd as necessary. These
treating facilities will be incorporated as part of the plant

design. The treated liquid wastes will be neutralized to a pH 2/
of between 6 and 9, and made harmless before discharging into the
circulating water discharge channel where they will be rapidly
diluted prior to entering the sea.
(b) Sanitary waste water will be treated in the Sewage Treatment Plant,
the capacity of which will be enhanced. The performance of the
existing plant, using proven technology, has been satisfactory.
(c) Power plant surface drains, comprising storm water, roof drains,
etc., will be piped to the site drainage ditches or to the discharge
channel. Other miscellaneous drains will be led into the waste
water treatment plant where the effluents will be treated and
neutralized before being discharged into the discharge channel.
Three stage gravity oil interceptors will treat the drains that
might be potentially contaminated by oil and remove the trapped oil.
The capacity of each separation chamber will be sufficient to accept
the total oil content of one generator transformer plus three
minutes of flow from the transformer fire protection system. Also,
appropriate treatment for the water phase of the oily effluent will
be provided to reduce the oil content of the emulsion within
acceptable limits.
(d) The air preheaters would need to be washed with water from time to
time. The boilers would also need to be chemically cleaned during
commissioning and, possibly, at periodic intervals thereafter.
These wastes will be neutralized and treated in accordance with
environmental acceptance criteria. Especially, any metallic wastes,
such as chromium and molybdenum, trap-ed in the effluents will be
removed.
(e) Water drains from the coal yard are likely to contain coal fines.
Also, because of the presence of sulfur in coal, the water
leaches through the coal pile will rend to be acidic in nature. It
might also contain metal wastes. The leachate, as well as the
runoff from the coal pile, will be led into a settling basin, where
the fines will precipitate and the effluent will be neutralized and
treated before being discharged into the sea. The settling basin
will be lined with clay.   Instrumentation will monitor the quality
of the solution on a continuous basis and adjust chemical dosages
accordingly for neutrallzation. Any deviation from the control
settings will be alarmed in the Control Room for immediate attention
by the Plant Operators.
(f) Leachate and runoff from the ash disposal yard will be taken to a
settling basir. The leachate will be analyzed for any metal wastes,
2/   pH is an index of the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a liquid,
measured on a scale of 1 through 14. A liquid having a pH of 7 is
considered as neutral; anything below 7 is acidic, above 7 is alkaline.

and, if present, will be treated appropriately before the clean
water is drawn off and discharged to the sea.
11.       Solid Wastea:
The solid wastes are: (a) fly ash; (b) bottom ash; and (c) dust in
the coal handling plant, ash handlitg plant and water treatment plant
facilities.
(a) To ensure minimal water usage, and consequently minimal water
discharge, the fly ash is collected and discharged almost in a dry
state. Fly ash will be collected under a dense-phase system and
conveyed to an intermediate fly ash silo. From the silo, the ash
can be collected in trucks for utilization in the cement or building
industries, or as landfill, or transported by conveyor to the ash
disposal area. The ash will be compacted and the land will
eventually be used for revegetation.
The existing ash disposal area will be capable of accepting ash from
all seven units of the power plant for the next 18.5 years, assuming
that there will be 35 percent utilization of the fly ash, as
discussed above. In the event there is no ash utilization, the ash
disposal area will last for 12 years. Construction of an ash lagoon
is, therefore, being considered for the future as a new ash disposal
area near the power plant. The ash lagoon will be bunded such that
it can contain all the ash discharged into it without causing any
environmental hazard.
(b) Ash falling into the bottom ash hopper of the boiler (bottom ash)
will be removed by a mechanical drag bar system using sea waver.
The ash will move up an incline and get dewatered by gravity. The
water will return to the hopper. Thus, no waste water will be
produced.
(c) Dust containment and suppression methods will be used in the coal
handling, ash disposal and water treatment plant facilities. Bag
filters and water sprays, mixed with chemical wetting agents, will
help minimize dust nuisance in the coal, ash, lime, and alum
handling areas   The coal handling plant will be fitted with exhaust
fans and cyclone or bag filters to eliminate the dust from exhaust
air.
Implementation of all of the above measures for air quality, liquid effluents
and solid wastes will be ensured. GOI/PLN have already held consultations in
the proposed project area with local residents and representatives of
different organizations where the specifies of the project and its impact were
explained.

Flora. Fauna and Marine Biology
12.       A survey of the flora and fauna was carried out in October 1990.
The survey also l-acluded interviewing the local population in an effort to
identify if the present power plant had brought about any significant change
in the flora and fauna present in the area. The survey was used to inventory
all species existing in the study area that included forest areas, settlement
areas as well as recreational areas. The results of the survey reveal no
significant impacts on the flora, fauna, and marine biology.
13.       At the productive coral reef present near the site, temperatures are
not expected to increase 2 C beyond the ambient. Although these reefs
support the local fishermen, no impacts are anticipated from the circulating
water discharges from the power plant. Regarding entrainment and impingement
of marine biota, it is expected that very low average intake velocities (0.15
mi/sec approx.) will minimize entrainment of marine biota.  However,        %
entrainment of fish eggs and larvae will occur and they will be subject to
mechanical, chemical and thermal stresses. The economic impact of the above
on marine life is expected to be negligible.
500 kV Transmission Lines
14.       The project will require the construction of two, 500 kV
transmission lines between Suralaya and Cilegon, and an additional 500 kV
transmission line from Cilegon to Cibinong to augment the power transmission
capacity and enhance reliability of the transmission network. The
construction of these lines is not expected to pose any major environmental
problems. The routing of the transmission lines will be so selected as to
avoid disruption to human settlements, agricultural land or forest areas.
Only the land required for tower footings will be acquired by PLN. No major
resettlement component as a result of such acquisition is expected. A
preliminary survey of the routes and the tower spotting studies indicate that
the implications of the proposed transmission line construction fre not
significant.
Risk Assessment
15.       Using both the World Bank guidelines and the GOI guidelines, the
Suralaya Steam Power Project can be classified as being of low hazard. The
significant potential risks are identified below:
(a) If the quality of coal should deteriorate in the future, stack
emissions may approach permissible limito. In such an event,
retrofitting actions could be taken to reduce the SO2 emission.
Howiver, excellent qualities of coal are available within Indonesia.
It should be possible to buy coal from any source within Indonesia
that can supply the fuel to given specifications.
(b)  Failure of the Chlorination Plant could cause uncontrolled discharge
of chlorine into the circulating water, thereby jeopardizing marine
life. Appropriate persL.mel training, with the Chlorinator
featuring an automatic shutoff, should be able to contain this risk.

Plant personnel are already used to handling this hazardous chemical
in their existing plant section.
(c) Hydrochloric acid and caustic soda are used in the demineralizer
plant. The bulk chemical storage tanks will be located in bund
enclosures. Any spillage will be contained and neutralized. Safety
features in the design, coupled with appropriate personnel training,
are usually adequate for this purpose. The plant personnel are
already trained in the handling of these chemicals.
(d) The capacity of the existing hydrogen plant to produce commercial
quality hydrogen, required for the cooling of the generators, will
be enhanced. Besides the fact that the plant personnel are already
adept at running this plant, fail safe features in the design of the
plant ensure automatic shutdown in the event of equipment
malfunction or maloperation.
onitorin=  and Sumervision
16.       Short-term monitoring which is required for the construction phase
of the project include: dust, noise, odor, ground water, traffic, and effect.
on other underground services. The control of these will be the prime
responsibility of the Engineers and site management. Complaints from the
public would be recorded by site staff and public health officers and would be
used to identify appropriate changes in the site practices aimed at reducing
the nuisances.
17.       Some disruption to road traffic flow is expected during the
construction phase. The Engineers and site management, with help from the
police department, will manage traffic problems that may arise during the
work.
18.       Long-term monitoring will include air quality measurements to ensure
that ambient air quality guidelines are not violated. In order to facilitate
this monitoring, measuring instruments will be provided at selected locations
to monitor the ambient air quality.  The Environmental Unit in the c1fice of
the Director General, Electric Power and New Energy, under the Miniscry of
Mines and Energy, will exercise oversight functions on these activities.
Through technical assistance provided under the Paiton Thermal Power Project
(Loan 3098-lND), environmental management and monitoring capabilities of this
department are being strengthened.

Procurement Efficiency
Optimization of the procurement cycle and promotion of interest
among intending bidders to facilitate utmost competition, will be a primary
objective of the procurement strategy under the proposed project. The measures
will include the following:
(a) The tender validity period will be no more than 150 days except for
highly complex tenders. Bid evaluation and award decisions would be
completed in a period of about 90 days.
(b) Provision for a price escalation formula will be made in every bid
document where the period from the date of bid opening to completion
of the contract is expected to exceed 12 months, to permit the
bidders to quote more realistic prices.
(c) The Letter of Intent will be modified such that it constitutes a
contractual commitment by PLN, subject only to the clarifications
and conditions stipulated in the Letter of Intent, to permit the
Suppliers to commit the delivery period from the date of issue of
the Letter. A sample Letter of Intent follows this text.
(d) The practice of holding "contract negotiations" after the issue of
the Letter of Intent will be eliminated, and the discussions will be
confined only to clarifications of items stipulated in the Letter of
intent. In particular, there will be no negotiations to maximize the
indigenous content of a contract, nor will there be any change in
the subcontractors after bid opening for the same purpose.
(e) Contracts will be finalized within about 30/60 days after the issue
of the Letter of Intent.
(f) Approval of the signed contracts by agencies external to PLN will be
secured expeditiously, say, within about 30 days of the contract
signing.
(g)  The Letter of Credit will be established within 60 days of con.:act
signing.
(il; PLN will, in addition, complete the preparation of standard bidding
documents, comprising the Invitation for Bids, Instructions to
Bidders, General Conditions of Contract and other commercial
conditions, including the Bid Form, Bid Security Form, Performance
Security Form, the Letter of Intent, etc., for the procurement of
Goods and Works, in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. These standards will then be followed for all
procurements to be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan.

Feasibility Study of a
HV Submarine Link Between Java and Sumatra
Terms of Reference
I. Backaround
In the past decade, the Southern Lampung area (especially Tanjung
Karang system) has experienced high load growths, annual rates around
15 percent, and similar growth rates are expected for short- and medium-term.
In the medium-term, the ongoing generation plans show little
possibilities for base-load generation in Lampung areat the Bukit Asam Coal-
fired Power Station (4 x 65 HW installed capacity, final stage) due to be
connected to Lempung system by the end of 1992, should be just sufficient to
satisfy South Sumatra demand by 1998/99 (mainly Palembeag, Lahat, Batutaja
load centers)  Another option under consideration is the Tarahan Coal-fired
Power Station, for Southern Lampung area. The main other options for the
region are the Basai hydropower station (90 MW) and, the Musi hydropower
scheme (111 MW),
A planning study of Sumatra was performed in 1984 (Long-Range
Sumatra Development Plan by SOFRELEC), and a Feasibility Study on
Interconnection of Regions I, II, III, IV in Sumatra, performed by EPS French
Engineering Consultantsis is ongoing. The latter may suggest interconnection
strategies that might provide solutions for the Southern Lampung area for the
mettum- and long-term.
The main supply option for the long term in Southern Sumatra is the
Banko Mine Mouth Coal-fired Power Station, and probably various other coal-
fired power plants using coal reserves throughout Sumatra. This option was
studied in 1987 (Java-Sumatra Interconnection by SOGELFRC, using the results
of the 1982 "Feasibility Study in Sunda Strait Seabed" bx Shawinigan - PT.
RMI). It discussed the feasibility of building a 2,400 LW coal-fired Mine-
mouth power station which would supply Java through a UVDC link (overhead line
+ submarine cables) with a 2,000 MW capacity at * 400 kV. The conclusions
depended on the cost and availability of coal in the area; this aspect is
currently under study.
On Java side, the ongoing generation projects expected for the
short- and medium-term are likely to create adequate generting capacity.
There is a possibility of supplying Southern Sumatra from Java through a SW
submarine link. From the planning point of view, it is thus necessary to
examine short- and medium-term options involving Sumatra and medium- and long-
term options ivolving Sumatra and Java, to determine an optional development
strategy.

I'. Oblectives
The objective of the proposed study is to exercise the technical and
economic feasibility of a RV submarine cable link between Java and Sumatra
expected to operate at 150 kV or 220 kV, which would supply the Tanjung Karang
area with powar available in Java in the medium-term. This link might be
able, in the longer-term, to be used for limited power exchanges between Java
and Sumatra, thus the benefit of interconnection between South Sumatra and
Java will be investigated in terms of cost of generation, economies of scale
and sharing of capacity as reserve system.
This solution must be compared with the possibility of building
thermal power stations burning coal in Tarahan or any other economic
generation expansion in Southern Sumatra area (e.g. gas based).
The time horizon for the study should be about 20 years. In this
time frame, the possible solutions aad alternative projects should be examined
and a least cost development plan determined.
III. Scope of Works
A. Review of load forecast. gower generation and transmission Rlannina in
LamiDunR Area.
The consultants will examine the latest available load forecasts in
the concerned areas, for medium- and long-term and update them if necessary.
Special attention will be paid to the current supply condition in Lampung and
to the evolution of industrial demand in the same area. Review of Generation
and Transmission Plan in Lampung area, and determination of Long-Term Marginal
cost of supply from the local sources.
Review of cost and benefit of the interconnection with Java, using
PLN's least cost development plAn for Java.
B. Definition of the various alternatives of supplying power in Lamoung Area
According to the power needs in South Lampung, various alternatives
for supplying power in Lampung area will be studied, including the following:
1.   HV submarine link from Java, connected to Sumatra network.
2.   Development of a coal-fired power station in South Lampung (Tarahan
project).
3.   Reinforcement of the ongoing interconnected 150 kV Network of
Southern Sumatra.
4.   Installation of gas turbines/diesels in Tanjung Karang.
The main characteristics, of the RV link with Java will be
dezermined to include the operating voltage, transfer capability and number of
circuits.



- 90 -
ANN$x 5.10
Page 3
The reliability of each alternative will be estimated by the LOLP
evaluation. It is assumed that the transmission alternatives would be in AC,
in the firec stage.
Among the various options to be studied for the submarine link vill
be the possibility of dimensioning the submarine cable for conversion, into a
D.C. link, capable of bulk transfer of 1,000 - 2,000 MW. The technical
feasibility and the costs of such conversion should be estimated.
At this stage of the study, the consultant will present a concept
report, proposing the recommended development strategy and outlining proposals
for further detailed work, to be carried out in the optional work described
below.
C.   Studies for the HV Submarine Link
For the most economical scheme, the following studies will be
undertaken:
Analysis of submarine cable laying and embedding conditions
according to the latest available surveys. This analysis should
take into account earlier study of the Sunda sea bed and the
experiences in recent projects, such as the 2,000 MW France-England
HVDC interconnection Ct 270 kV).
D.   Determination of a nrice and imnlementation schedule for the cable link
The consultant will prepare budget cost estimate for the main
scheme, based on prevailing international prices and elaborate on:
(a) the organization and techniques to be adapted for cable laying.
(b) proposed specification of the cable(s) to be installed.
(c) breakdown into material and installation costs.
(d) breakdown into local and foreign currency.
(e) tentative schedule.
(f) operating and maintenance cost estimate.
E.   Technical Characteristics
The selected scheme will be examined from the point of view of
interconnected network operation of Java with South Sumatra. The studies will
inclades:
*    Power flow analysis under maximum load and minimum load condition,
*    Fault studies
*    Stability and short circuit analysis.
*    Reliability analysis
Simulations of the transient network situation on the ENV level in
Java will be examined using suitable computer models. The consultant will
define the voltage compensation and protection schemes. The consultant will

Page 4
also recomend the necesseary telecommunication facilities to ensure
satisfactory operation of the interconnected systems.
Economic Anal_sis
Economic analysis of the recommended alternative will be carried
out. The consultant will also perform sensitivity analysis for the following
parameter:
*    Discount rate
*    Construction costs
*    Marginal costs of kWh in Java and Sumatra
*    Cost of coal at Tarahan site end at Suralaya
*    Adopted seenario(s) for long-torm, in particular with or without
Sumatra-Java HVDC link for bulk supply.

Enaineering and Design (First Phase) of Baniarmasin Thermal Power Proiect
Terms of Reference for Consulting Enaineerina Services
Background
The demand forecast for the Outer Islands power system indicate the
need for constructing additional generating capacity in the island of
Kalimantan. At the present time, there are several small, captive diesel
power plants operating in the island, with isolated power transmission
networks. Subject to the proposed site being confirmed as the one to provide
the least-cost development program, the recommended mine-mouth thermal power
plant at Muara Asem Asem, in south Kalimantan, will use indigenous lignite,
and will have an initial capacity of 90 MW, comprising 2 x 45 MW units, and a
double-circuit 150 kV transmission line to the Barito system. Interconnection
of the Barito system with two reasonably large, adjacent systems (Benua Lima
and Kuala Kapuas systems) by one 150 kV transmission line, is also envisaged
under the proposed project.   Over the long-term, this initial development
will be followed by further enhancement of generating capacity by installing
additional 2 x 45 MW and 4 x 66 MW units by approximately year 2008. A
feasibility study for the proposed power plant has been carried out by PLN,
with the assistance of their Consultants, Ewbank Preece Ltd., in association
with P.T. Indra Karya. However, some questions about the proposed site still
remain to be answered.
The Muara Asem Asem site is located on the south-east coast of
Kalimantan, at a distance of about 120 km by road from Banjarmasin. The site
is typical of the area, being flat and having an average level 1-2 m above
mean sea level. It is covered with grass with some trees and bushes, and
situated near Sungai Nayah, a tributary of river Asem Asem. Because of
limited availability of water from this tributary, the proposed plant will use
closed-circuit cooling, using cooling towers.
Obiective
The proposed consulting services will be rendered in two phases.
The objective of the first phase of consulting services is to provide
assistarce to PLN in confirming the recommended site at Muara Asem Asem, as
well as the proposed development strategy. In the event the conclusion of
this investigation would not support the development at Muara Asem Asem, other
sites evaluated in the feasibility study will need to be reconsidered and a
selection that offers the least-cost solution, shall be made. Given a
satisfactory resolution of the above requirement, the fist phase would include
developing a complete project implementation strategy, including performing
preliminary engineering and design for the power plant and the associated
transmission systems, leading to the preparation of the major tender
documents; confirmation of the environmental impact assessment report prepared
by the Consultants, along with the management and monitoring plans to ensure
compliance with regulations; preparation of a detailed project cost estimate,

an implementation schedule; expected disbursement profile; a contracting
strategy to sult a convenlent financing plan; and project management,
construction supervision, and quality assurance plan, including transfer of
knowledge to PLN staff.
One of the important elements of the services will be early
completion of engineering specifications and bidding documents that are
required for the long lead items of procurement, such as the boilers and the
turbine generators.
Scope of Services for Phase I
The engineering services to be provided by the consulting
engineering firm shall include, but not be limited to the following:
First Phase
a.   Confirmation of Site Selection
Availability of sufficient cooling water, feasibility of obtaining
coal economically from the lignite mine, integration of the
transmission systems serving the area are important considerations
to be taken into account for making a judgement with regard to the
proposed site.
b.   EnRineering Design and Tender Documents
Assist PLN in the design and engineering of the proposed power
plant, leading to the preparation of tender documents for the major
contracts packages, comprising the boiler island and the turbine
generator island.
c.   Contract Strategv
Identify and prepare a definition of all contract packages and a
convenient contracting strategy for the successful implementation of
the project.
d.   Cost Estimate
Prepare a detailed cost estimate for the proposed power plant,
including associated transmission and distribution systems, showing
projected expenditures in local and foreign currencies. Based on
the duration of the project, inflation factors to be used in
developing the cost estimate are those contained in the latest

Indonesia. The estimate should be net of taxes and duties for the
imported items, since PLN is exempt from them. Local costs should
include VAT (PPN) and other taxes, an estimate of which should also
be shown separately for each contract package, for ease of
identification. Indirect foreign costs of local contracts should be
identified and shown separately, and added to the Foreign Costs.

Prolect Supervisiin Arranxements
1.        PLN's Supervision Arrafements:  PLN will appoint a senior level
officer as Project Coordinator to coordinate and monitor implementation of the
project, and provide quarterly reports to the Bank on the physical progress of
the project. The Project Coordinator wil report directly to the President
Director of PLN. He will have authority to make decisions and interface, as
necessary, with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, as well as with EKUIN, on
the status of project engineering, procurement, environmental aspects,
construction and disbursement. The report wil highlight project performance
as measured against the schedule, analyze delays and difficulties, and discuss
mitigating measures. PLN's Directorate of Construction and the Engineering
Services Center (PPE) will have major roles to play in the engineering and
construction management aspects of the project, while ensuring its timely
implementation.  The other technical components of the proje,t will be managed
by the PPE, who will be supervising the work of the Consultants.
2.        Bank Supervision Inputs: During the initial phase of .roject
implementation, Bank supervision wil involve close monitoring o. the
procurement and technical assistance activities. The engineering and design
effort will be monitored very closely to ensure that bottlenecks and
impediments are removed as quickly as possible. To this end, the Bank will
provide the necessary advice to PLN.
3.        The Bank resources to supervise the project would be about 20 staff
weeks in the first year and 15 staff weeks in the second year, mainly to
review and clear the procurement documents. About three supervision missions
will be planned during each year. Thereafter, Bank resource requirements
would decline gradually to about six staff weeks per year and two supervision
missions a year.
