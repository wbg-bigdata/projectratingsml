P RE FA C E
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Mangoky
Agricultural Development Project in Madagascar, for which IDA Credit 0881-
HAG in the amount of USS 12.0 millton and IFAD Loan 11-MG in the amount of
SDR 5.0 million were approved in March 1979. The IDA Credit and IFAD Loan
were closed in August 1986. The last disbursements were made in April 1987
and an unutilized balance of US$ 1,165,000 was cancelled in June 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the Africa
Region, South Central and Indian Ocean Department and is based on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement, internal Bank memoranda and the
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on January 5, 1990, for comments by
February 23, 1990, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MADAGASCAR
MANGORY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 881-MAG AND IFAD Loan 11-HG)
EVALUATION SUMHARY
Origin
i.        The Mangoky Agricultural Development Project was the third Bank
credit for agriculture in Madagascar, with a credit amount of US$ 12.0
million. IFAD participated jointly with the Bank in the funding of the
Project with a loan amount of SDR 5.0 million. The Project was designed to
improve and extend existing irrigation systems so as to increase rice and
cotton production. This was intended to complete the first phase of the
irrigation system under development since the early 1960s, financed by FED
and PAC. as part of a long-term master plan aimed ultimately at bringing
about 100,000 ha of land into production. Preparation of the project took
place between 1976 and 1977. The credit wias approved in March 1979.
Initial Components
ii.       The 5-year project, costing US$29.5 million, comprised the
following components: a) development of primary and secondary irrigation
and drainage networks serving 3,700 ha, and road infrastructure (US$5.1
million); b) land clearing and levelling, and development of tertiary and
quaternary irrigation systems serving about 3,300 ha, including
construction of concrete canals (US$9.5 million); c)   detailed der.igns..
and supervision of civil works (US$0.5 million); d) incremental
agricultural inputs (US$2.7 million); e) social infrastructure (six new
primary schools) (US$0.5 million); f) applied research, training,
monitoring and evaluation and studies to prepare future projects (US$3.4
million).
Implementation
iii.      SAMANGOKY, a parastatal founded in 1961 to conduct the
development of the Lower Mangoky valley, was responsible for the
implementation and overall coordination of the Project.
iv.       Social and political problems, lack of local funds, inability of
SAMANGOKY to execute works on force account and to coordinate the
Project,hampered the project implementation from the outset and led to
important delays. In 1983, through an amendment of the Joint Project
Agreement, the initial target was scaled down and modified as follows : (a)
development of 1,500 ha of land instead of 3,700 ha, (b) execution of
urgent works for the rehabilitation of the existing irrigation



- V  -
infrastructure, and (c) provision of technical assistance, equipment and
vehicles for SAMANGOKY. Corrective actions were also taken to concentrate
SAMANGOKY's role and activities in the maintenance and operation of the
scheme, extension services and input supply. A financial recovery
programme of the agency was concurrently funded by the Government. These
measures came too late to restore SAMANGOKY and the project to a healthier
situation.
Results
v.        Out of the additional 3,700 ha originally envisaged to be
developed under the project, about 2,800 ha had been equipped by the
closing date (1986). Total cultivated area fell from 4,800 ha without the
project (1979-80) to an average of 3,500 ha during the 5-year
implementation period (1981-85), with a record 5,700 ha cultivated in 1986.
Cultivation intensity did not improve and was less than 80? during project
execution, against 180? estimated at appraisal. Crop yields decreased
steadily during project implementation, from pre-project (1971 to 1979)
averages of 2.5 t/ha and 3.8 t/ha for cotton and paddy respectively, to
about 1.2 tlha and 3.1 tlha between 1980 and 1987 while SAR estimates were
2.8 tJha and 3.5 t/ha (double cropping). At project completion, about
3,900 farm families were cultivating land under the irrigation scheme,
almost half of the estimated appraisal target. Cropped plots per family '
are small, averaging about 0.8 ha cropped per year, and income levels,
given the low yields and producer prices, are about US$190, almost 25Z of
SAR estimates. SAMANGOKY's financial situation has remained precarious
with substantial operating losses during project implementation despite a
stringent reduction of staff and Government's periodic subsidies.
vi.       The Economic Rate of Return was estimated at 182 at appraisal,
but, at the level of operation (5,000 ha) at project completion, the
project is yielding a negative rate of return, since incremental benefits
are non-existent and operation and maintenance costs are higher than
estimated.
Sustainability
vii.      The drastic lack of motivated farmers, qualified staff, adequate
equipment prevailing in the region during project implementation were the
major aspects which contributed to the project's failure. A highly
sophisticated, capital intensive and technologically demanding project,
requiring high operational and maintenance standards, an efficient
production system, a sound political- economic environment cannot be
sustainable and must not be replicable in isolated areas sitl.lar to the
lower Hangoky region. The risks were obvious, well known, openly debated
and alternatives considered on the technical, organizational and political
fronts. The decision was to proceed nonetheless because the Bank was
hopeful that its involvement would provide a vehicle for addressing the
real sector problems that were intrinsic in all these risks. There were
few other opportunities for the Bank's assistance and involvement in the
sector.  Mangoky did provide an important foothold at a critical moment in



- vi -
the late 1970s when the objective of opening the dialogue on the
agricultural sector was central and specific. The willingness to coneider
Mangoky in the midst of difficult country relations and a clearly
deteriorating sector and country situation did give the Bank an entree and
some credibility deriving from direct field experience that proved
beneficial.
Findings and lessons
vii.      The main lessons learned from this experience are the following:
(a)   it should have been recognized at appraisal that the trend in
country conditions raised serious questions about the suitability
of the technical and managerial design of the existing and
proposed Mangoky project. The irrigation construction featured a
capital intensive and sophisticated technology calling for nigh 0
& M standards, an efficient production and marketing system and
motivated and qualified farmers; it also required extremely good
management skills, which in Madagascar had been already proven to
be a rare commodity. Also, the project was based on the
perception that the settlement process was stabilized, whereas
this was not the cases economic and political conditions were
precarious and incentives for farmers to move to the area hardly
existed.
(b)   an enclave project has little chance for success in a situation
where sector policies and the political environment are as
difficult as it was in Madagascar.
(c) supervision, although highlighting the main problems, failed to
follow-up on crucial measures towards redressement of.the
situation, pointing once more to severe staff and budget
constraints compared to the needs to properly follow up such a
difficult and complicated project.
(d)   Government policies should have been much more closely followed
with a view to assess whether it was still useful to continue
project execution with any chance of success. Notably, pricing
policies and political interference in project's internal
matters such as staff reduction, land allocation, cost recovery,
had strong adverse effects on any chances to complete the
project successfully. Drastic actions could then have been
taken to stop or to comprehensively reappraise the project when
it was still time.
viii.     Looking to the future, the main issues to be addressed to
restore the project's sustainibility, are the following:
(a)   opening up the area by rehabilitating the Toliara-Tanandava
and Tanadava-Morombe roads and the Morombe port;



- vii -
(b)   management approach by attracting the private sector and using
foreign and local private capital as well as loanot
(c)   0 & H system to be managed by private sector and Water Users
Associations:
(d)   diversified crops as alternative to rice.
In the context of t"eE ongoing Madagascar Irrigation Sub-sector
Review, a thorough assessment of the future of the Mangoky Project will be
done, with main focus on the above aspects.

MANGOKY AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 881-HAG and IFAD Loan 11-KG)
I - BACKGROUND
1.        Madagascar is predominantly an agricultural country, with about
852 of its population living in the rutal areas, the agricultural sector
contributing about 402 to GDP and accounting for more than 802 of total
export earnings. Following the political transition in the 1970s, growth
in agricultural production failed to keep pace with demand and consequently
imports of food, mainly rice and edible oils, increased dramatically. The
country is nevertheless relatively well endowed with natural resources and
the potential for agricultural development is considerable. With the
introduction of appropriate policies and adequate external financial
assistance. medium and long-term prospects for the economy were judged
favourable at the time of loan approval (1979).
2.        The broad objectives of the Government's long-term strategy for
the period 1978-2000 were (i) to attain self-sufficiency in food and to
develop basic industries, largely supplied by the agricultural sector; (ii)
to decentralize economic activities, with the Government playing a more
active and direct role in the economj, and (iii) to narrow the gap in
income distribution and redress regional imbalances. As part of the
establishment of a socialist regime, the Government intended to assume
control of cultivated land on large farms and newly developed areas,
through the creation of socialist cooperatives, and to monopolize
agricultural marketing and processing activities.
3.        Given the high pressure on the land in the developed cer-tral
area of the country, future agricultural growth was naturally seen in the
development of the isolated and sparsely populated lovwer Mangoky valley
where hitherto cattle-raising had been the main activity. The climate in
this region is favourable, the soils are relatively good and, with
irrigation ihere necessary, suitable for most main crops. Irrigation water
could be provided by tapping the Mangoky river which offers abundant
hydaulic resources. With this excellent potential for agricultural
development, the Mangoky delta was expected to permit low cost production
of a number of crops and to encourage migration from the highlands. This
vision conferred an image o' bread basket and population escape valve on
the Mangoky project, with a huge impact on the whole southwestern region, if
not on the entire country. These aspects made the project an interesting
pilot undertaking and explained the continuing participation of various
donors.

4.        Development action in the lower Mangoky valley began in the
1950 with the creation of an experimental station and the preparation of a
master plan for the development of over 100,000 ha of land. In 1961. the
first phase of 10,000 ha of this development plan started, mainly for
cotton. Eighteen years later, at the time of project appraisal, about
5,200 ha only had been developed, of which about 4,800 ha were cultivated,
3,200 ha devoted to the cultivation of cotton and the rest mainly to rice.
Only 5,000 families were settled in the project area.
5.        A parastatal company, Samangoky, was founded in 1961 as the
development agency for the Mangoky Valley. with responsibility for (i)
infrastructure and force account works, particularly land development; (ii)
operation and management of the irrigation and drainage schemes, and (iii)
operations related to cultivation of the developed area, together with the
associated farmers. A special partnership contract between Samangoky and
the associated farmers stated that the company should provide for
mechanized land preparation, pesticide spraying, inputs, extension and
marketing services, in exchange for which it would receive a portion of the
production, collectable in kind for rice and as a price deduction for
cotton. At appraisal, in the late 1970s, Samangoky was perceived as a very
efficient agency, with good managerial capabilities and a sound financial
position. In that respect, it was a "star case among Madagascar's
troubled public institutions.
6.        Up to that period, the project had received substantial
financial support, initially from FAC (Fonds d'aide et de cooperation) of
the French Government, and latterly from the European Development Fund
(FED), which helped to sustain the momentum of progress in civil works up
to 1981. The French Textile Company (CFDT) also played an important role
in promoting cotton production in the area, providing extension, input
supply and marketing and processing facilities. Once the third part of the
10,000 ha first phase development programme was nearing conclusion, FED
announced the end of its commitment. The Government then applied for an
IDA credit and an IFAD loan.
7.        The Bank group had previously financed two irrigation projects
in Madagascart the Lake Alaotra Irrigation Project approved in 1970 and
completed in 1976, and the Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development
Project, which was experiencing serious organizational, technical and
financial problems at the time of the Mangoky project appraisal. Like the
Mangoky project, these projects were designed to improve and extend
existing irrigation systems and increase crop production.
II - PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
8.        Objectives.  The project aimed at developing about 3,700 ha in
the Lower Mangoky Valley for production of rice on heavy soils and cotton
on lighter soils, to be farmed by about 3,200 families. This was intended
to complete the first phase of the irrigation system under development
since the early 19609, as part of a long-term master plan aimed ultimately
at bringing about 100,000 ha of land into production.



-3-
9.        Components.  The 5-year project, costing US$29.5 million,
comprised the following components:
i) development of primary and secondary irrigation and drainage
networks serving 3,700 ha, and road infrastructure
(US$S.l million);
ii)   land clearing and levelling, and development of tertiary and
quaternary irrigation systems serving about 3,300 ha, including
construction of concrete canals (US$9.5 million);
iii)   detailed designs and supervision of civil works (US$0.5
million);
iv)   incremental agricultural inputs (US$2.7 million);
v)   social infrastructure (six new primary schools) (US$0.5
million);
vi)   applied agricultural research, research and trials on
operating problems, overseas study trips and training courses,
monitorin, and evaluation and studies to prepare future projects
(US$3.4 million).
10.       In 1983, through an amendment of the Joint Project Agreement,
the initial target was modified as follows : (i) development of 1,500 ha of
land instead of 3,700 ha, (ii) execution of urgent works for the
rehabilitation of the existing irrigation infrastructure, and (iii)
provision of technical assistance, equipment and vehicles for Samangoky.
III - PROJECT DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
11.       Although there was a clear conceptual foundation for the
project, as a continuation of a reasonably successful development
prograum, some design features were vulnerable to a high element of risk,
particularly the capital intensive sophisticated technology, with gross
costs of US$8,000 per ha (1). To be profitable, the project would have
required high operational and maintenance standards and a very efficient
production system. A sufficient number of capable managers and technicians
with executive and planning abilities would have been necessary, as well as
motivated and qualified farmers and the unrestricted iLccess to all required
materials, inputs and other imported resources. These conditions, though
only barely guaranteed at the time of the project's appraisal, became more
difficult to fulfil soon after because of political disruptions, foreign
exchange constraints, senior staff shortages and a dramatic deterioration
of the infrastructure and equipment.

water level control systems, mechanized agricultural operations, aerial
spraying, etc.



-4-
12.       With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that the timing
of project appraisal (early 1978) was unfortunate since only a few months
later, significant political changes (para. 14 and 16) took place which
considerably affected the project set-up. It was quite impossible, at
appraisal, to clearly evaluate the political and sociological environment
and to foresee the risks which were to occur to the project. It was then
difficult for the Bank to cancel the credit or to suspend disbursement on
this basis.
13.       Also, production and financial results of the 1978 and 1979
campaigns revealed serious problems (para. 19) which, if knovn, would have
certainly led to a different project design and scope. Moreover, some
aspects of project design were inapproprate, such as ti) drainage to
control salinization was not adequate in some areas, (ii) agricultural
machinery and maintenance equipment for the extended area were not
included, (iii) the proposed social infrastructure was insufficient, and
(iv) there were no provisions for technical assistance. More specific
provision for these matters would have given the project a greater chance
of success, since lack of them led to serious problems during
implementation.
14.       At appraisal, it was difficult to impose permanent land tenure
rights as a prerequisite for proceeding with the Project.  Therefore,
arrangements were agreed with Goveroment, defining roles and
responsibilities of Samangoky in this matter. But fundamental changes were
to occur later which could not have been foreseen. Samangoky, which was
expected to be in charge of execution of most of the project's activities,
had full authority in allocating land to 'associated farmers' and imposing
discipline in cropping activities. However, during the first project year,
the impact of national decentralization policies on the Samangoky area
increased markedly, shifting the land allocation decision from Samangoky to
political-administrative authorities elected in the region ('Fokonolonas').
As a result, Samangoky was deprived of one of its most important
instruments in imposing discipline on farmers to ensure appropriate
cropping and systems' maintenance. Although, in principle, the
democratization measure appeared sound, it did not in practice improve the
equity in the land allocation process. A recent survey on farmers'
reactions revealed general dissatisfaction with land allocation procedures
which adversely affected the project's productivity and cost recovery
because farmrs who were not fulfilling their obligations could no longer
be penalized.
15.       Until 1985, Samangoky executed all mechanized works for land
preparation and infrastucture maintenance, provided inputs and water,
ensured the marketing of agricultural products, and assumed applied
research and extension activities. Divesting these activities to farmers,
private sector or national services would alleviate Samangoky's role, but
Madagascar was not ripe enough - nor the Bank - for restructuring its
parasatals (1). Farmers performed manual activities such as weeding and
harvesting. The rationale on which was founded the partnership arrangement
(1)     The Public Sector Adjustment Credit under which the Bank started
the restructuring of Malagasy parastatals became effective only in
1988.



-5
between Samangoky and its associated farmers became undermined since the
latter had virtually assumed the status of tenants vithout any inheritance
rig ts to their plots, and were therefore not interested in the proper
conservation or maintenance of the quaternary canals and drains. Moreover,
the cost recovery system offered no incentives to increase productivity in
cotton and was not adjustable in relation to the quality or timeliness of
services provided by Samangoky (1). Once Samangoky had lost its
disciplinary role and was unable to provide adequate agricultural services,
productivity fell dramatically, and so did cost recovery, leading Samangoky
into its subsequent precarious financial situation.
16.       During the first project year (1980), political and social
unrest among Samangoky's own personnel led to an extended strike and
eventually to the resignation of the General Manager. Since the
enterprise's efficiency wq founded in large part in his managerial
capabilities and dynamism, and recruitment of capable senior staff to work
in the project area was very difficult, Samangoky's future performance was
seriously affected.
17.       In retrospect, it seems that a capital intensive and
technologically demanding project was not manageable at that time, given
the country's political-economic conditions and the existing human
resources. Overestimation of Samangoky's strength and capabilities and
insufficient attention paid to productivity trends (para. 27), production
organization and operation and maintenance problems were also major aspects
which contributed to the project's eventual failure. The risks were
obvious, well known, openly debated and alternatives considered on the
technical, organizational and political fronts. The decision was to
proceed nonetheless because the Bank was hopeful that Mangoky's isolation
might allow it to continue to function as an enclave, and that the Bank's
involvement would provide a vehicle for addressing the real sector problems
that were intrinsic in all these risks. There were few other opportunities
for the Bank's assistance and involvement in the sector: Mangoky did
provide an important foothold at a critical moment. The dialogue on the
project was a major element in the opening of the dialogue on rice
marketing and pricing and on the cotton sector in the late 1970s. It was
the first occasion on which the Bank was able to join an effective dialogue
on these topics, which eventually helped to complement the work under the
Agricultural Institutions Technical Assistance Project, the Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Credit, the Public Sector Adjustment Credit, etc...  The
objective of opening the dialogue was central and specific. The
(1) Global charges, comrrising all services, were fixed uniformly and
collected from users as a price deduction for cotton (from 50 X of the
price in 1979 to 66S in 1984) and as in-kind payment for paddy (1 t/ha,
when all services were provided, 0.4 t/ha when land preparation was done
manually). However, given the declining yields and unfavourable product
input prices' evolution, charges fell below Samangoky's costs and
collection rates were too low (between 50 to 70Z). In 1985, individual
accounts were introduced, services and inputs were charged at cost and a
fixed water charge was established.



-6-
willingness to consider Mangoky in the midst of difficult country relations
and a clearly deteriorating sector and country situation did give the Bank
an entree and some credibility deriving from direct field experience that
proved beneficial.
IV - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
18.       Despite social and political problems which hampered project
implementation from the outset, and delays in construction works due to
lack of local funds and Government slowness in fulfilling fonmalities for
loan effectiveness, construction of the main irrigation and drainage
networks contracted to a private enterprise was nevertheless concluded four
months ahead of schedule. Conversely, development works (land clearing,
levelling and quaternary drains and canals) on force account with Samangoky
fell behind schedule owing to shortages of spare parts and cement and the
hopeless state of the canal factory (producing concrete canal sections),
partly attributable to foreign exchange constraints, and partly to
weaknesses in Samangoky's management. When cost overruns became excessive
and Samangoky was incapable of completing development works, the contract
was cancelled, scaled down and eventually awarded to a local enterprise
under the project reformulation agreement (para. 21).  Despite their
importance for project success, some other components, such as applied '
agricultural research and construction of social infrastructures were never
fully executed because of ill-defined institutional roles and
responsibilities.
19.       By far the most important factor adversely affecting project
implementation was Samangoky's managerial weakness and its accumulated
financial losses. One of the main reasons f6r this was that for many years
the highest technical positions in the works and agriculture departments
were not filled due to lack of qualified candidates interested in working
in such an isolated location, and senior managers spent most of their time
in the central office in the capital. The accounting and auditing services
were deficient and planning for operation and maintunance was insufficient.
Samangoky began to experience financial losses in 1978/79, and by April
1981, they had already accumulated to about FMG610 million (US$2.3
million). All reserves were used up and the enterprise's liquidity
situation became precarious, the company relying for its operations mostly
on bank overdrafts and Government advances. By that time, construction
equipment and agricultural machinery were old and insufficient to execute
the normally required works, and the factory fabricating canals was
practically unutilizable. Consequently, Samangoky had no operational
capacities to provide for the scheme's operation and maintenance or to
carry out land preparation. As the production system was no longer
operative, yields decreased and consequently farmers failed to pay their
service charges, thus worsening still further Samangoky's financial
situation. Although Samangoky's management capabilities were seen at
appraisal as the main source of risks, no provisions were made to improve
its operational and planning systems nor to revise its accounting
procedures.



-7-
20.       Project risks appear to have been underestimated at the time of
appraisal, particularly those associated with yield decreases. Starting in
1976, there were already signs of a declining trend in cotton yields which,
combined with increased insect attacks and deficiency in cropping
practices, led to the early deterioration of cotton productivity (para. 27)
and thence to the project's economic and financial debacle.
21.       An attempt to redress the project's disappointing perfomance was
made in 1983 when, under an amendment to the Joint Project Agreement, the
following corrective actions were proposeds
i)  Samangoky should undergo reorganization, abandoning its
construction activities and reducing the scope of agricultural
services provided to farmers, and concentrating on the scheme's
maintenance and operation, extension services and input supply.
The agency would also have to improve its operational and
managerial capacities and reduce its redundant personnel. To
achieve these objectives, Samangoky would benefit from technical
assistance to be provided under the project. Concurrently, the
Government would fund a financial recovery programmee;
ii)  unfinished works in the extension areas should be scaled
down and contracts tendered to private contractors;
iii)   urgent rehabilitation works to the existing scheme should be
executed under the project; and
iv)   financing be provided for the replacement of part of
Samangoky's equipment and machinery.
22.       Other actions/decisions eventually taken to restore project'
production levels included: (i) modification of the cost-recovery system,
introducing individual accounts for inputs and services provided to
farmers; (i') more flexibility in cropping patterns, a decision which
entailed a rapid conversion to rice and the introduction of other crops;
(iii) allocation of medium-size plots to private farmers and enterprises to
encourage higher land occupancy.
23.       Most of the decisions and actions taken during implementation
were well conceived but directed to solving only specific problems.
However, successive supervision missions (para. 36) failed to comprehend
the growing severity of the project's diminishing viability. The 1983
project reformulation was a concerted attempt to limit losses, as was the
subsequent inclusion of a Mangoky component in the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project (para. 35). These measures came too late and
neither of them had the necessary impact to restore Samangoky to a
healthier financial position and give the project a chance of
sustainability. In retrospect, it appears that it would have been wiser to
stop the project right after the 1980 crisis, when Samangoky's financial
losses became critical. At that stage, perhaps the situation could have
been salvaged had the project been redesigned. reappraised and, if its
eventual profitability could have been demonstrated and the Government
commltment to support Samangoky's rehabilitation secured, additional
resources poured intc it.



24.       A major lesson learned from the experience of this project is
that when projects perform poorly within a deteriorating environment they
should be stopped and comprehensively reappraised at the earliest possible
moment or instance, as soon as one element of the risk analysis has reached
a threshold level or if an unforeseen factor appears to affect project
economic or financial viability. (1)
V - PROJECT RESULTS
25.       The proj6ct has not only failed to achieve the objectives
established at appraisal but also those of the rehabilitation plan proposed
in the 1983 amendment of the financing agreement. Out of the additional
3,700 ha originally envisaged to be developed under the project, about
2,800 ha had been equipped by the closing date (1986), although some 320
ha of these were never fully completed. The total equipped area in the
perimeter had, by that time, reached 7,000 ha, of which about 2,000,
however, were classified as unexploitable due to soil restrictions
(salinity, or sandy soils inappropriate for rice cultivation) or drainage
and levelling problems.
26.       Total cultivated area fell from 4,800 ha without the project
(1979-80) to an average of 3,500 ha during the 5-year implementation period
(1981-85); a record 5,700 ha was cultivated in 1986, only to fall again th6
following year to 4,900 ha. Cultivation intensity did not improve and was
less than 0S during project execution. against 1802 estimated at appraisal
(2).
27.       Crop yields decreased steadily during project implementation,
from pre-project (1971 to 1979) averages of 2.5 t/ha and 3.8 tlha for
cotton and paddy respectively, to about 1.2 tlha and 3.1 t/ha between
1980 and 1987 (1). SAR estimates were 2.8 t/ha and 3.5 t/ha (double
cropping) for cotton and paddy respectively. Among the factors
contributing to decreasing cotton yields weres (i) Samangoky's incapacity
to provide timely land preparation and to plan and supervise agricultural
operations; (ii) the absence of incentives to obtain higher yields, since
farmers had to pay the same portion of their production regardless of the
amount and quality of services received; (iii) farmers' outlook discouraged
by poor income prospects, farmers neglected their plots or even abandoned
them; (iv) inadequate land levelling and deterioration of irrigation
conditions, and (iv) inadequate extension services and input supply to cope
with technological problems, particularly insect infestation.
(1)    In this particular case, when cotton yields fell below 2.0 t/ha
Samangoky's losses became beyond control. A declining trend in cotton
yields was already evident before project appraisal, being 2.8, 2.4, 2. 0
and 1.7 t/ha in 1971, 1976, 1978 and 1979 respectively.
(2) The cropping pattern shifted from predominantly single cropping cotton
cultivation to double cropping rice, in early 1987 after the sharp increase
in paddy price when liberalization of rice pricing and marketing took
place. There is now a great demand for land for rice cultivation from the
High Plateau individual farmers, mostly the Betsileos from the Fianarantsoa
province.



28.       At project completion (1986), about 3,900 farm families were
cultivating land under the irrigation scheme, fewer than before the project
(about 5,000 in 1980) and almost half of the estimated appraisal target
(1). Cropped plots per family are small, averaging about 0.8 ha cropped
per year, and income levels, given the low yields and producer prices, are
about US$190, almost 252 of SAR estimates.
29.       In an attempt to increase land occupation, three large companies
were allocated land in 1984 to grow cotton, but all of them went into
liquidation after the 1984-85 catastrophic campaign, when their cotton
yields averaged 0.9 t/ha (202 less than those of small farmers).  A number
of medium-scale farmers started cultivating under the irrigation scheme in
1985; presently there are about 140 of them, each cropping an average of 15
ha. While they are supposed to be more efficient producers, yields recorded
up to now are often lower than those obtained by peasant producers, hence
the future prospects of their entrepreneurial activities are not bright.
Most of these medium-scale farmers are local traders, public officials or
Samangoky employees, lacking practical experience, capital and depending
highly on the scarce peasant labour.
30.       The Samangoky audited accounts for 1985 show an operating loss
of PMG664 million (US$0.9 million equivalent) in itu overall Income
Statements, while losses of FMG114 million and FKG410 million are reported
for 1986 and 1987 respectively. Despite Government subsidies (FMG1,198
million support for the financial balance of the company in 1985) and
periodic contributions to maintenance works, Samangokys' financial
situation remains critical. Even if cost recovery were to improve from its
disappointing 502 to 602 level, and if the agency were to adopt more
stringent austerity policies (its staff has already been reduced from 850
in 1979 to 300 in 1986), its financial future would continue to be
precarious as long as land occupation in the irrigation scheme remains at
the current low level.
31.       The Economic Rate of Return was -ttimated at 18? at appraisal,
but at the present level of operation (5,000 ha) the project is yielding a
negative rate of return, since incremental benefits are non-existent and
operation and maintenance costs are higheJr. It was difficult to determine
project benefits, because despite the expansion onto new land under the
project, the cultivated area remains almost the same as it was before the
project. Iloreover, the degradation of the irrigation infrastructure is
such that unless considerable rehabilitation works are undertaken the
future of the scheme is bleak. For the time being, operation and
maintenance costs will continue to be very high and exceed Samangoky's
financial capacity.
(1) Between 1982 and 1985, about 2,200 producers left the project after
Samangoky decided not to allocate my more land to cotton growers with
yields under 1.5 t/ha or to rice producers with outstanding debts.



- 10 -
32.       SAR estimated profitability thresholds for cotton and rice
cultivation (under mechanized cultivation) are yields of about 2.0 t and
2.3 t per hectare for cotton and paddy respectively. However, average
yields during implementation were significantly lower for cotton (1.2 t/ha)
and in respect of paddy cultivation, which has become the main crop in
1987. the labour intensive technology adopted by peasant farmers resulted
in a yield of only about 2.7 t/ha, which represents a net return to labour
of little more than US$1.0 per day (more or less the equivalent of the
official minimum wage). Production on the average 0.8 ha of peasant farm
is estimated at 2.2 t of paddy per year, which just about cover family
consumption, thus generating a meagre cash income. The financial viability
of these farms is therefore uncertain.
33.       The financial viability of medium-scale farms is even worse,
since their yield levels are no better than those of the peasant farms, and
operational costs for mechanized land preparation, inputs and hired labour
are significantly higher.
34.       Declining international prices for cotton and the instability of
institutional prices for paddy have certainly contributed to the low
production performance, along with the deteriorating physical condition of
the hydraulic infrastructure and the road to Toliara (1) and the lack of
efficient marketing channels. Though the increased official prices for
paddy in 1986 were instrumental in boosting production that year, the very'
low 1987 prices were decisive in undermining the following harvests.
VI - PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
35.       With the drastic lack of qualified staff, motivated farmers and
adequate equipment prevailing in the region during project implementation,
there is little hope that the project could improve. The whole scheme soon
started suffering from water shortages and bad drainage because of
improper management and insufficient maintenance. Soils are salinized due
to poor drainage in some areas; farmers abandoned the region. Highly
sophisticated hydraulic infrastructure, especially with canals carried
above ground cannot be sustainable and must not be replicable in areas
similar to the lower Hangoky region.
VII - BANK PERFORMANCE
36.       Since the project was confronted with serious problems from the
outset, it required higher than usual supervision inputs. However, the
Bank's supervision efforts were not sufficient: supervision missions were
fielded twice a year, but they often had to deal with several projects at
the same time and there was little staff continuity between missions.
During the critical period when project reformulation was to be implemented
(1983-84), missions were curtailed because of staff-constraints. The
project was given a lower priority at a time when major attention and
iitensive efforts were concentrated in addressing sector policy and
management issues with the Government.

When practicable, the journey requires 6 hours.

37.       The lank failed to take decisive actions aimed at correcting
emerging problems, particularly at the early stages of project
implementation. The amendment to the Joint Project Agreement was made
without an exhaustive analysis of the project's viability.
VIII - BORROWER PERFORMANCE
38.       Borrower's performance during project implementation was less
than satisfactory. The lack of managerial capabilities, the shortage of
qualified and motivated staff and the declining commitment of the borrower
towards the project hampered the achievement of the project's development
goals.
39.       Project reporting was poor during the first years but improved
notably afterwards, owing mainly to technical assistance which appeared
necessary due to insufficient local qualified staff. Three positions were
filled with expatriates which provided support of mixed quality in planning
and organizing Samangoky's agricultural services, workshop and maintenance
works. The achievements of locally recruited assistance to improve the
accounting system were not totally satisfactory since there are still
serious gaps in cost accounting procedures. A monitoring and evaluation
system, which was supposed to be designed and established during the first
years of the project, was never implemented. Finally the project
experienced substantial non compliances with credit covenants (see Table
9) .
IX - CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
40.       The main lessons learned from this experience are the following:
ii)   it should have been recognized at appraisal that the trend in
country conditions raised serious questions about the suitability
of the technical and managerial design of the existing and
proposed Mangoky project. The irrigation construction featured a
capital intensive and sophisticated technology calling for high 0
& X standards, an efficient production and marketing system and
motivated and qualified farmers; it also required extremely good
management skills, which in Madagascar had been already proven to
be a rare commodity. Also, the project was based on the
perception that the settlement process was stabilized, whereas
this was not the cases economic and political conditions were
precarious and incentives for farmers to move to the area hardly
existed.
(ii)   an enclave project has little chance for success in a situation
where sector policies and the political environment are as
difficult as it was in Madagascar.
(iii)   supervision, although highlighting the main problems, failed to
-   follow-up on crucial measures towards redressement of the
situation, pointing once more to severe staff and budget
constraints compared to the needs to properly follow up such a
difficult and complicated project.



__12 .
(iv) Government policies should have been much more closely followed
with a view to assess whether it was still useful to continue
project oxecutiot with any chance of success. Notably, pricing
policies and politlcal interference in project's internal
matters such as staff reduction, land allocation, cost recovery,
had strong adverse effects on any chances to complete the
project successfully. Drastic actions could then have been
taken to stop or to comprehensively reappraise the project when
it was still time.
41.       Looking to the future, the main issues to be addressed to restore
project sustainability, are the followings
ti)   opening up the area by rehabilitating the ToliaLa-Tanandava
road and the Morombd port;
(ii)  managemont approach by atti.acting th, private sector and using
foreign and local private capital as well as loans;
(iii) 0 & H system to be managed by private sector and Water Users
Associations;
(iv)  diversified crops as alternative to rice.
In the context of the ongoing Madagascar Irrigation Sub-sector
Review, a thorough assessment of the future of the Mangoky Project will be
done, with main focus on the above aspects.

a/ The project was identified by the Government in the 1960s, as the first
phase of a long-term masterplan for the development of the Lower Mangoky
Valley. Developments efforts started in the 1950Os and at the time of
appraisal some 5,200 ha had been developed with financial support from
FAC and FED.
b/ Project preparation was dcoe by the Government, Sauangoky and consulting
engineers (SOGREAR/SOMEAH).
c/ Main issues raised at appraisal and board presentation related to
disappointing experiences and impleme..tations difficulties with on-going
agricultural projects in Madagascar- fears of consequences of low
producer prices and pricing policies, the cost recovery issue and its
relatior. to land tenure arruzgements. Technical issues related to
drainage and water managements were also raised.
d/ The project was co-financed by IFAD (Joint Project Agreement dated 17
May 1987 as its first operations in Madagascar (Loan HAG-11). IFAD
negotiations, which had to be preceeded by the Government's applications
to IFAD membership, delayed board presentation.
el A first amendment concerned Schedule 2 of the Joint Project Agreement.
to increase disbursement percentages for foreisn expenditures (Cat. 2
and 3). The second amendment scaled down land development objectives to
1,500 ha and modified the disbursement schedule, introducing new
categories for rehabilitation works, technical assistance and equipment
and vehicles for Samangoky.
