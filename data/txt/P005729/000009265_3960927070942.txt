MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ENTREPRISE TUNISIENNE D'ACTIVITES PETROLIERES (ETAP)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed IBRD loan
to the Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit6s Petrolieres (ETAP), with the
guarantee of the Government of Tunisia, for US$5.5 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be at the standard variable interest rate
with 5 years of grace and 17 years maturity and would help finance a Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project.
Backaround
2.       Although modest by global standards, oil production is an important
part of Tunisia's economy: it accounted for 92 of GDP and 202 of export
earnings in 1987. Commercially recoverable oil reserves are estimated at
440 million barrels (about 64 million tons), enough to provide another 10 to
12 years of production at current rates. However, most reserves are located
in relatively old oil fields, with about 882 of production coming from two of
these: El Borma and Ashtart. Production at these fields is entering its
decline phase, despite efficient secondary recovery programs. There is also
gas production at El Borma (0.5 million toe) which, since it is associated
with oil, will decline in parallel with oil production. Total oil production
has decreased at an average annual rate of 3.21 since 1984 and this rate of
decline is expected to continue in the short term. The anticipated outcome of
reduced petroleum production combined with the expected 5.41 per year average
growth in domestic oil demand is that Tunisia could become a net oil importer
in 1991-92.
3.       With concerted action to maximize the output from fields which
already have been discovered and to prove reserves in other fields, the
decline in domestic oil production can be slowed, resulting in major
macroeconomic benefits. In the short term, the national oil company ETAP, and
some of the international oil companies (IOCs) operating in the country are
beginning to explore the possibility of bringing on stream small fields which
have displayed the greatest prospects for success. However, for a sustained
improvement in domestic oil production, increased exploration activity is also
needed to identify and evaluate reserves in other small existing fields.
Recent changes in the Tunisian petroleum law (March 1987), which provide
special incentives for small field development as well as a more liberal tax
regime, have enhanced the attractiveness of these marginal fields to IOCs.

Project Obiectives
4.       The main objective of the proposed project is to provide the basis
for increasing the rate of discovery and development of Tunisia's hydrocarbon
resources through: (i) attracting further private sector participation in
exploration of prospective open areas; (ii) strengthening ETAP's technical
capabilities to assess hydrocarbon potential; and (iii) providing, through
state-of-the art exploration data acquisition techniques, "leads" which would
induce IOC activity in open areas currently left unexplored. The Government
of Tunisia (GOT) has requested Bank assistance to attain the above objective,
given the Bank's past experience with similar promotional activities in other
developing countries. Exploration work will be carried out in compliance with
the country's environmental protection requirements and sound practices of the
oil industry. These objectives fit well within the Gc"ernment's overall
policy for oil exploration which is to rely primarily on private risk capital
for the financing of exploration and development with its own role being
essentially one of promotion and regulation. This policy is fully supported
by the Bank.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.       The Bank has been directly involved in Tunisia's energy sector
through lending operations in power and gas that were satisfactorily
implemented. The Bank assisted also ETAP in formulating Tunisia's new
petroleum legislation and in petroleum exploration planning under the
multisectorial Technical Assistance Loan (Loan 2197-TUN). The proposed
project would be a timely follow-up to this loan and would allow the Bank to
continue its active, cooperative role to assist the GOT and ETAP in addressing
energy policy and strategy issues in the petroleum subsector. The Bank plans
to follow this operation with a more comprehensive energy project to help
assess and implement energy policies in the post-oil era. The present loan
will provide part of the groundwork for this larger project.
6.       Through continued financial and technical support, the Bank can help
ETAP to become a technically efficient partner of the oil companies and to
attract participation of IOCs, thereby providing additional risk capital for
developing the petroleum sector. ETAP could use its enhanced data base to
facilitate the operations of IOCs, especially newcomers, and to help them
determine further exploration investments. ETAP would also provide a number
of technical services not available elsewhere in the country which would
permit more precise evaluations to assist GOT in its policy decision making.
This is already the case in the simulation of Ashtart reservoir, conducted in
cooperation with international services firm specialists under the previous
Bank financed project.
Project Description
7.       The proposed project consists of three components:  (i) exploration
promotion technical assistance and training; (ii) geological and geophysical
data acquisition, processing and reprocessing; and (iii) procurement of
laboratory equipment and material. The components are summarized as follows:



(a) Exploration Promotion Technical Assistance. Joint preparatory work
has led to the identification of six specific areas which are of
potential interest to IOC's. These six geologic provinces will be
promoted in accordance with the preparedness and progress of the
studies related to each province. ETAP will be assisted by highly
specialized, external experts to prepare quality promotion packages
meeting oil industry standards. The country's hydrocarbon prospects
are to be presented to the oil industry in a series of meetings held
in one or two major oil capitals, such as Houston and London,
followed by a third presentation in Tunis. After the last
presentation, the blocks will be opened for bids from interested
IOC's. The first bid round will cover as a priority the Gulfs of
Vamtanet and Gabes offshore areas, where adequate data already is
available. This round is planned to take place before April 1990.
The promotional work on the other areas is expected to be completed
by end 1992. A Project Unit established in ETAP will supervise the
Implementation and progress of the promotion activities.
(b) Data Acquisition, Processing and Reprocessing. This component
includes new seismic data acquisition, processing and reprocessing on
a limited basis. Acquisition of new data and their processing using
modern techniques will fill in gaps and contribute to the solution of
complicated geological and geophysical problems. An airmag survey
will be conducted in the north, where data are non-existant. The
project will provide a specialized consultant to define the
objectives and modality of the airmag survey, and to interpret the
data. The project will also use new techniques to clean and
reprocess old and incomplete seismic data for more reliable
interpretation.
(c) Equipment and Material. The project includes acquisition of:
(i) geochemistry laboratory equipment; (ii) computer hardware; and
(iii) software packages for reservoir engineering and log
processing. Procurement of all goods and services, as well as hiring
of consultants financed under the Bank loan would be in accordance
with Bank guidelines (see schedule B). An implementation schedule
and map are attached to the Technical Annex. Some of the equipment
will complement data base software purchased under T.A. Bank Loan No.
2197.
Proiect Cost Estimates
8.       The total project cost is estimated at about US$9.0 million, of
which US$2.5 million are in local costs and US$6.5 million in foreign costs
(722). The proposed loan of US$5.5 million will finance 612 of the project
cost. A detailed breakdown of the project's cost estimate is given in
Annex A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Annex B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Tunisia are given
in Annexes C and D respectively. The Technical Annex and a map are also
attached. The proposed loan would cover 852 of the project foreign cost and
would allow for retroactive financing of US$500,000 (82 of the loan amount)
for hiring a system analyst specialist and acquiring additional software
packages. All of the local costs (US$2.5 million) and US$1.0 million of the
foreign cost would be financed by ETAP's internal funds.



-4-
Agreed Actions
9.       ETAP has agreed to the following actions: (a) establish and staff a
Project Unit (PU). The Unit will serve as the principal focal point for
ensuring effective project implementation and will have the delegated
authority to act on all project matters to liaise with and use the services of
all ETA* divisions; (b) procure all services, equipment and software needed in
accordance with Bank guidelines; and (c) organize an airmag survey team for
the northern part of the country prior to preparation of the data package.
Benefits
10.      Development of small fields plus new discoveries would allow Tunisia
to extend the life span of its total oil reserves and improve its
reservelproduction ratio (currently estimated at 12 years). During the past
two years, the level of exploration activities has shown a certain stability
(10 to 13 wells per year) despite the enormous slowdown in the worldwide oil
industry; many of these wells were drilled because of previous commitments.
Seismic activity in Tunisia decreased by about 372 between 1986 and 1987 and
this level will probably remain unchanged in 1988. There has been a downward
trend in perm!t relinquishments since 1984. Attracting new companies would
help reverse tais downward trend. It would not be unreasonable to expect in
the short term that additional exploration investments would commit at least
US$30 million in new areas following the promotional activities, although
given the inherent nature of the project, its full benefits are impossible to
quantify in advance.
11.      GOT is negotiating new exploration permits with IOCs, both newcomers
and already established companies. The newcomers are small- to medium-sized
European and American companies interested in expanding their field of
activity outside the US or the North Sea. However, due to the absence of a
systematic approach in granting exploration permits, negotiations are lengthy
and cumbersome. The project will provide technical advisory expertise to ETAP
that will help reduce the delays and ensure that equal information is provided
to all interested IOCs.
Risks
12.      The principal risk associated with this project, as with all
exploration promotion projects, is that oil industry response to the promotion
efforts would be weak due to an unfavorable international climate or poorer
than anticipated geology. This risk is considered acceptable; the alternative
is either that IOCs activity will be held back for lack of information or that
IOCs expenditure based on poor information may itself have negative results
with an even less desirable demonstration effect. The proposed course of
action is more appropriate than either of these alto-natives.



Recomoendation
13.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

L THE SETTING
Energy and the EconomO
1.       The evolution of the Tunisian economy is very sensitive to petroleum
production and prices. During the Sixth Plan (1982- 86) petroleum exports
accounted for an average 362 of total Government revenues. Tunisia now
confronts an adverse combination of declining hydrocarbon resources, lower
prices for oil exports and rising domestic energy demand. Despite these
trends, oil still accounts for about 9% of GDP and 201 of export earnings.
2.       The Seventh Plan (1987-91) aims for 41 annual growth in GDP which
implies inter alia 82 annual growth in non-oil exports. The implications of
these targets for the energy sector are numerous including particularly an
accelerated exploration program and the implementation of energy conservation
measures for the different segments of the energy market (Tunisia energy/GDP
elasticity at 1.4 is unusually high). Unless new discoveries are made and put
into production, Tunisia will become a net oil importer in the early 1990's,
which requires already at this stage a careful assessment of the energy supply
options, and the initiation of appropriate measures.
Energy Supply and Demand and Picing
a. Energy Supply
3.       Tunisia's indigenous resources comprise essentially crude oil and
natural gas. Other resources, such as lignite and hydro-power, are
insignificant. Among the non-conventional energy resources, Tunisia enjoys
good solar energy prospects and winds of fair velocity for a considerable part
of the year. However, these resources have just started to be exploited and
are not expected to play an important role in the foreseeable future.
4.       Tunisia's proven and probable oil reserves are estimated at 70
million tons, of which 64 million tons are recoverable. Most eserves are in
relatively old fields. Over 1976-83, production of crude oil increased
steadily from 4.8 to 5.5 million tons; production started to decline in 1984,
reaching only 5.0 million tons in 1987. The two main fields, Ashtart and El
Borma (see Map IBRD 21067), with a production of 4.3 million tons in 1987
accounted for 872 of domestic production; their output is expected to decline
to 3.6 million tons in 1991. Small fields discovered at Gremda, Ezzaouia and
Mahanes and reserves shared with Libya at El-Bouri, offshore of Gabes, may
eventually push output upwards marginally.
5.       Tunisia's gas reserves (proven and probable) are estimated at 93
billion cubic meters (80.5 million toe); the Miskar field, offshore of Gabes,
accounts for two thirds of these reserves (26 million toe proven and another
26 million probable). The development of this field discovered in 1974 will
involve technical challenges (complex geology, gas quality), 1/ as well as
economic ones (market size, competitiveness with alternate fuels). As a
result, although reserves are much greater than those of crude, the production
of gas was only 0.4 million toe in 1987, all of it associated El Borma gas).
1/ The gas is sour; nitrogen and carbon dioxide represent 1/3 of its
composition.

6.       Tunisia also has access to Algerian gas as the 2,500-km
Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline (TMP) which connects the Hassi R'Mel field in
Algeria with Italy across the Tunisian territory. The arrangements with
Algeria and Italy entitle Tunisia to royalty gas (a percentage of throughput)
and, for additional quantities, provide for Tunisian gas purchases under take
or pay type arrangements. The actual quantities of Algerian gas delivered to
Tunisia increased from 380 thousand toe in 1984 to 900 thousand toe in 1987;
as gas largely substitutes fuel oil, the actual intake essentially depends on
the relative prices of the two.
b. Energy Demand
7.       Tunisia's energy consumption has increased from 1.0 million toe in
1970 to 3.9 million toe in 1987 - an average annual growth of 102. Growth was
particularly high over 1970-80 (112), and tapered off over 1980-84 (52).
Tunisia's energy needs are met almost exclusively from hydrocarbons; in 1987,
petroleum products accounted for 681 of total demand and natural gas for
another 30X - hard coal, coke and hydropower accounted for the 21 balance.
8.       On a sectoral basis, industry represents the largest share of energy
use (421), followed by transport (281), households (151), agriculture (101)
and the tertiary sector (51). Since it became available in Northern Tunisia
in 1984 (para. 6 above), Algerian gas has been largely used to substitute fuel
oil, and to a smaller extent diesel oil in power generation. 1/ As the
economic prices of imported gas and fuel oil are very close, the consumption
of this gas can fluctuate considerably from one quarter to the next, the power
plants being dual fired and aiming at the use of the cheapest fuel at any
point in time.
9.       Despite the slowdown in energy consumption growth in the past few
years, energy demand is expected to grow rapidly during the Seventh Plan
period (1987-91) as shown in the demand forecast (Attachment lb). If no
energy conservation measures are taken, demand is anticipated to increase
during the Plan period by 5.41 annually to reach 4.6 million toe in 1991.
c. Energy Pricing
10.      Petroleum products, natural gas and electricity prices are fixed by
GOT, taking into account their economic cost and the Government's fiscal
requirements.
1/ Algerian gas is also used, although in much smaller quantities, as a fuel
oil substitute in industry, and as an LPG, and diesel oil substitute in
small industries, hotels and the commercial and residential sectors.

Heavy subsidies of most petroleum products were eliminated in 1987,
when the GOT raised retail prices in a major effort to generate revenues. The
drop in international prices during 1986 contributed to adjustments at the
ex-refinery level: gasoline and gasoil are now priced above their opportunity
costs. LPG remains subsidized at both the ex-refinery and retail levels. LPG
represents about 7.5% of Tunisia's consumption of petroleum products, and the
net subsidy (minus tax revenues from LPG sales) amounts to about US$8 million
annually.
12.      Regarding natural gas, a distinction has to be made between the South
of Tunisia which is supplied largely with El Borma associated gas and the
North which is supplied with imported Algerian gas, and the end use:
1.   For power generation in the South, gas is obtained by the utility
free of charge. Since this gas accounts for 302 of the primary fuel
requirements of the utility, the financial impact on the utility's
electricity production costs is significant. However, any economic
distortion is limited by the fact that electricity prices themselves
are generally in line with economic costs. In any event, the use of
this free gas will diminish substantially by mid 1990's when El Borma
production is itself anticipated to taper off. In the North,



- 16 -
Technical Annex
Page 5 of 18
the current policy is to price the gas at its fuel oil equivalent
(official price less lOS production tax from which the utility is
exempted).
2.   Regarding other uses (both in the North and in the South), the
informal policy until June 1987 had been to price natural gas at the
posted price of fuel oil to reflect its cost of supply and to
encourage substitution in the industrial market, while maintaining
tariffs already in effect for town gas to tertiary markets. A new
structure for gas prices decreed in 1987 provides for three tariffs
(high, medium and low pressure), a fixed charge, a capacity charge
(not applicable to low pressure customers), and an energy charge.
The structure is appropriate in that it separates the fixed and
variable costs of supplying gas to different consumer categories, and
prices are all above their opportunity costs to the economy.
13.      The electricity tariffs in effect in 1986 reflected long-run marginal
costs of supply (LRMC) at that time. This was the result of GOT decisions
taken to achieve this objective, combined with lower international oil prices
at that time. I/ Tariffs were increased by 5.22 in July 1987, enough to cover
STEG's fuel costs and financial obligations and still generate a positive cash
flow until 1989. Initial Bank estimates suggest that a tariff increase of at
least 32 will be necessary at that time to cover new generating and
transmission costs. Based on the findings of the ongoing interfuel
substitution study and fuel options retained for future power generating
units, LRMC will be calculated to allow for tariff level adjustments after
1989.
d. Supply Demand Balance
14.      By 1991, Tunisia's consumption of oil products and natural gas is
expected to reach 4.4-4.6 million toe (para. 9 above). Against this
background, and as shown in Attachment la, production of oil and gas
(including associated El Borma gas) will only be of the order of 4 million
tons. Tunisia will thus become a net energy importer. The main challenge for
the Government is to adapt the economy to this new environment including
particularly the implementation of measures aimed at encouraging non-oil
exports. Regarding the energy sector, on the supply side, the Government has
taken two main measures thus far: (i) an interfuel substitution study
supported by the Bank is presently underway which aims to define Tunisia's
future fuel options, including imported coal for power generation and the
industrial sector; and (ii) the implementation of new exploration legislation
aimed particularly at attracting oil industry interest, which is being
followed by a renewed promotional effort to be supported by the proposed
Project. On the demand side, a number of measures have already been taken
including: (i) the adoption of pricing policies aimed at discouraging the
v/ They were used to measure the fuel cost component of the marginal cost.

consumption of petroleum products (para. 11 above); (ii) the introduction of
energy conservation legislation and the establishment of an adequately staffed
and equipped energy conservation agency which is inter alia entrusted with the
enforcement of the conservation law; and (iii) an ESMAP supported energy
efficiency study for the household and tertiary sectors. All these measures
will help the Tunisian economy cope better with the status of a net petroleum
importer.
U. THE PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
Institutions
15.      The policy making body in the energy field in Tunisia is the Ministry
of Energy and Mines. It also oversees the activities of the public
enterprises in the sector. The main companies are as follows:
a.   ETAP (Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit6s Petrolieres) is the main
public enterprise in petroleum exploration and production. ETAP is
the designated national partner of all new exploration ventures in
Tunisia, commercializes the State's share in the producing
concessions and coordinates and arranges for imports of petroleum
products. As ETAP's would be the borrower under the proposed
Project, its operations are examined in Chapter III.
b.   STIR (Societe Tunisienne des Industries de Raffinage) owns and
operates the only refinery in the country located at Bizerte.
c. SNDP (Societ6 Nationale de Distribution des Petroles), distributes
petroleum products - its market share is of the order of 402. The
rest of the market is shared amongst 7 private distribution companies
which are linked with major international oil companies.
d.   STEG (Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et de Gaz) is responsible
for the generation and public supply of power as well as the
acquisition, transport and distribution of natural gas.
A 90X-owned subsidiary of ETAP is involved in drilling, 1/ and another one,
99.8S-owned, operates gas pipelines (Sotugat). In addition a relatively large
number of companies have been set up by the 4 companies above (together or
separately), with domestic banks and/or foreign entities to operate oil
11 CTF (Compagnie Tunisienne de Forage) owns and operates five drilling
rigs. Two rigs are essentially used in workover operations on Ashtart
(offshore) on a permanent basis, and the other three in workover
operations at El Borma, and occasionally in exploratory drilling. The
rigs are operated on a competitive basis with the private ones as there is
no obligation to use CTF's services.

fields 1/, to own the Tunisian portion of TIP, to own and operate white
products pipelines, to provide offshore support services, to recycle
lubricants etc.
16.      Exploration is essentially undertaken by foreign oil companies, and
largely by the bigger multinational ones, although there has been some
interest demonstrated by the smaller independents. Seven companies, mostly
affiliates of the majors, are involved in petroleum products distribution,
where they compete against each other and with SNDP. In addition, small,
privately owned Tunisian companies have been successful in the provision of
services notably for the offshore. In all, the policy framework in place has
promoted the coexistence of the private and public sectors, and the two
operate well together.
ExdloraLion and Produetion
17.      A new legal framework was introduced in Tunisia in March 1987 whose
main objective was to provide adequate incentives to industry for the
development of medium and small fields, particularly for gas deposits. The
financial terms were improved by accelerating the payback through a more
advantageous fiscal regime, gradually increasing royalties, lower custom
duties and taxes and a better regime for the taxation of resident
expatriates. In addition, simplified procedures were introduced to obtain
permits, and to seek extensions of old ones. ETAP's share is carried through
exploration - in the event of a commercial discovery it has the option to take
a share, usually of the order of 50-552. When this occurs, ETAP has to
reimburse its share of the exploration expenditures and finance on a pro rata
basis its share of development. The framework appears reasonable under
Tunisia's circumstances, as it offers better than average terms, and at the
same time, allows the Government, through ETAP, to monitor the activities in
the sector without investing in exploration.
18.      When exploration was at its peak, in 1980, areas under permit covered
165,000 km2; as of end-1987, the 23 exploration permits in effect covered an
area of only 86,000 kma. Similarly from an average of 14 exploration wells
drilled per annum over 1983-85, over the past two years, only 11.5 wells were
drilled on average. The decline reflects essentially the worldwide
consequences of the drop in oil prices in recent years. A history of
exploration activities in Tunisia is attached as Attachment 2.
Rerninl and SuIMly of Products
19.      The refinery at Bizerte is a simple hydroskimming facility with a
capacity of about 1.5 million tons. Overall, the refinery can satisfy about
60S of the domestic demand, so that the balance of products is imported.
Furthermore, fuel oil represented in 1987 about 302 of the domestic demand
against 402 of the refinery's output so that the refinery's excess fuel output

concession referred to as MLD.

is exported. In practice straight run low sulfur fuel oil is exported and
high-sulphur fuel oil is imported for domestic use. STIR Is proposing to
order a topping plant to increase the primary distillation capacity at Bizerte
to three million tons.
20.      Approximately 2.7 million toe of refined products are imported into
Tunisia annually. This task has been entrusted, since 1974, to ETAP. At a
monthly meeting, each distributor makes its requirements known, and ETAP
places orders accordingly, under the supervision of a Procurement Board. l1
These arrangements were established at a time when shortages prevailed, and
there were benefits in consolidating procurement through a Government
company. Furthermore, they still present the advantage of facilitating the
collection of taxes and duties on petroleum products. However, in today's oil
market it is not clear that these arrangements still represent the least cost
and a simplest way of ensuring the country's imported petroleum needs.
Consequently, the Government has set up a task force to examine alternative
institutional arrangements for oil products imports and the results of this
work are expected in early 1989.
SeetorStrategY and Role of the Bank
21.      In the short run, the most pressing priority is to accelerate oil
exploration. In this respect GOT's strategy is to attract risk capital from
international oil companies. Measures introduced so far include the adoption
of a new legal framework for petroleum exploration which has been reasonably
successful in maintaining industry interest, but additional efforts will be
required to bring back the exploration activity to the levels of the early
1980's. Complementary Government measures include diversifying the country's
export base and developing alternatives to oil for domestic energy
consumption. On the demand side, GOT has undertaken a series of measures
aimed at rationalizing energy use through both regulatory measures and a
program of energy conservation.
22.      The Bank has been directly involved in Tunisia's energy sector
through seven lending operations. Two loans were made for gas transport and
distribution; 2/ and four loans were made for power generation, transmission
and distribution. 3/ In general, project implementation has been
satisfactory. Difficulties were encountered mostly in compliance with
financial covenants; however GOT was able to comply with a broader covenant
requiring it to adjust the prices of the main petroleum products sold

Performance Audit Reports have been issued for the first three (Report
2521 of May 24, 1979; Report 4456 of April 22, 1983; Report 7326 of June
23, 1988). The last loan is still being disbursed.

domestically to international levels - this is an important achievement
considering the heavy subsidies which prevailed until the mid-1980's. More
recently, a loan was made towards energy conservation, 1/ whose implementation
is now progressing well after a slow start. Furthermore, a technical
assistance loan 2/ also benefited the energy sector, since it provided for
energy audits and computer facilities for ETAP.
23.      The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the Government in
carrying out future interfuel substitution studies of options and of the
potential for energy efficiency. Both these studies are being carried out
under the aegis of the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) (para. 14 above). Furthermore Bank staff has
advised the Government in the establishment of the legal and institutional
framework for energy conservation which is now being supported by the
conservation project referred to above.
24.      The proposed Project is the outcome of a dialogue, over the past two
years, between the Bank and the Government, which has resulted inter alia in a
new framework governing oil exploration. Through its involvement in this
Project, the Bank will be in a better position to assist ETAP in its petroleum
promotion efforts, a high priority activity, and to ensure that promotion
expenditures are limited to the minimum required to enhance the atractiveness
of the selected geological areas to the oil industry. Furthermore, the Bank
has initiated a dialogue with the Government on the institutional role of
ETAP, which aims particularly at weaning ETAP from Government subsidies and
converting it to a more autonomous petroleum company. In the coming years,
the Bank will continue to place priority on the restructuring of the sector,
with a special emphasis on the performance and accountability of the public
enterprises involved in petroleum exploration, refining and distribution.
D. THE BORROWER
Organization, Management and Staff 
25.      ETAP was established under Law 72-22 of March 10, 1972 complemented
subsequently by Decree 73-173 of April 16, 1973. It is subject to commercial
law and is empowered to enter into financial transactions with third parties.
Its initial mandate was (i) to carry out studies involving petroleum; (ii) to
train domestic petroleum personnel, and even foreign personnel coming to
Tunisia for this purpose; and (iii) enter into different kinds of transactions
related to the hydrocarbons sector. In practice, ETAP has been acting on the
Goverament's behalf whenever transactions of a commercial nature involving
hydrocarbons were taking place and conld not be carried out directly by a
Government Department.
26.      The main focus of ETAP's activities at present is petroleum
exploration and development. Within the policy framework laid down by the

Ministry of Energy and Mines and under the guidance of that Ministry, ETAP is
entrusted vith the negotiation of petroleum exploration agreements with IOCs.
Most of the agreements in effect, and all of those entered into since 1978,
provide that ETAP is carried through exploration and entitled to a share of
production under the joint venture agreements with oil companies. Therefore
ETAP participates ab initio in the joint venture operating committee as a full
non-operating, voting partner.
27.      Four of ETAP's ventures have lead to discoveries as follows:
ETAP - Main Producing Concessions
Production (thousand tons)
Area        ETAP (2)   Operator            1985      1986       1987

H. Guebiba    51S       ETAP /2             35.3      70.1       40.9
In 1987, these four concessions accounted for nearly 302 of Tunisia's oil
production.  Three concessions where ETAP holds shares are now being
developed:
ETAP - New Producing Areas
Area      ETAP (X)       Operator       Expected Production
Grenmda    51S           H.O.M.T. /3        50-60,000 tons
Esztouia  552            Marathon (US)   250-300,000 tons
Mahanes   50%            Total (France)    60-70,000 tons
1/   Makhrouga-Laarich-Debbech.
2/   During the first two years, the opertor was Tenneco.
3/ Houston Oil and Minerals of Tunisia, a Tenneco affiliate.
ETAP's involvement in exploration and development, and its exposure to
industry practices has enabled the company to develop a solid body of
knowledge and experience, so that it now operates one field (H. Guebiba), and
ETAP personnel on secondment assists foreign companies in carrying out their
programs. Therefore ETAP is strengthening its capability to carry out limited
petroleum operations on its own account. ETAP is focussing its initial
efforts on areas which do not present excessively complex problems and where
its efforts are likely to complement these of the IOCs. This may include
applying for concessions in the same manner as private companies, particularly
in areas with small fields (which are common in Tunisia) and gas proven areas
relinquished by IOCs. It may also include operating "sole risk" under the
terms of existing con essions where the IOC partner is unwilling to act as
operator for sole ris&c operations.

28.       In addition, ETAP is entrusted with the marketing of the
Government's share in the old discoveries (particularly El Borma crude) and
arranges for the importAtion of the national requirements in petroleum
products (para. 21 above). These activities entail no risk, being carried out
on a commission basis.
29.       ETAP is organized in six departments, three of which are of a
technical nature (exploration, production, and studies) and three are
non-technical (administration, commercial, and finance). An organization
chart of ETAP appears in Attachment 3. ETA? staff is about 320, of which 126
are engineers (about 30 engineers are on secondment with other oil
companies). The staff is competent and participates in technical activities
including geological survey, geophysical data acquisition, data
interpretation, and drilling monitoring.
Aecoilts and Audi
30.       ETAP maintains its books in accordance with the Tunisian accounting
code of 1968, which in general conforms to generally accepted accounting
practice. The exploration and development activities are separated from those
carried out on the Government's behalf; for the latter, ETAP acts essentially
so a broker and normally does not take possession of the products 1/.
Unfortunately, ETAP carries high levels of arrears on account of late payments
by STIR and SNDP, the public enterprises, which are financed by ETAP's
internal funds. In order to better assess the financial position and
prospects of the exploration and production activity, it will be necessary to
separate those accounts from those concerned with oil trading. As a result,
during negotiations assurances were obtained that from FY 1988 onwards, ETAP
will prepare on a Pro-forma basis distinct Income Statements, Balance Sheets
and Sources and Application of Funds Statements for the two activities.
ETAP's accounts are usually prepared within three months from the end of the
fiscal year, and, in accordance with Tunisian regulation, are subjected to an
independent external audit. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
ETAP will continue to have its accounts audited by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank, and submit those to the Dank within six months from
the end of the year under review; furthermore from FY 1988 onwards, the
auditors will formulate an opinion about the pro forma accounts of the two
activities referred to above.
31.       ETAP has a special unit in charge of internal audit and the audit of
the conecessions. It is staffed by two accountants assisted by fixed contract
staff. Considering that the external auditors, under Tunisian Law, are
required to carry out the audit on a permanent basis, the arrangements for
internal audit are satisfactory under the circumstances.
bcAne
32.       ETAP follows the policy of insuring its assets against all risks
(fire, earthquake, accidents etc.) and not only against fire as required under
1/  When the contractual arrangements so require, ETAP does acquire products,
but then, only for short periods. This is not speculative in any way
since ETAP only acquires products on the basis of the specific
requirements of the distributors.

Tunisian Law. Assets are insured in accordance with oil industry practices
agaist major hazards. When its joint venture partners prefer different
degrees of coverage, separate policies are entered into in accordance with
each party's share in the venture. The insurance policies are underwritten by
Tunisian firms (a requirement under the law), which reinsure themselves abroad
as appropriate. In addition, ETAP has other insurance policies covering
petroleum products trading, its buildings and personnel. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that ETAP will continue to maintain insurance
policies for its producing assets in accordance with industry i.ractice.

33.       The financial significance of ETAP's results is limited as, under
the present framework, the company has limited financial autonomy as follows:
(i)     all its cash surpluses are transferred to the Treasury twice per
month (and are treated as pre-paid dividends);
(ii)    its net profits (after depreciation) are also transferred to the
Treasury; and
(iii)   the Treasury makes funds available to ETAP in accordance with its
approved operating and investment budgets.
This financial framework is anchored in Government Instructions, a Five Year
Program Contract, the annual national budget, and the approved company budget.
34.       With these caveats in mind, ETAP's financial results over the past
three yeas can be sunm-rized as follows:

STAP's sales of crude from its concessions represent the bulk of its
revenues, the balance being a 0.5% commission levied on crude exports and
product imports carried out on the Government's behalf. The operating costs
of the four concessions account for most of its outlays; furthermore, it pays
large amounts of taxes (about 50-602 of its gross revenues). The loss in
1986 can largely be attributed to the large corporate income tax due, which
exceeded income before tax 1/. The loss had no material impact since
instead of paying dividends during that year, as explained above, it received
full compensation for the loss from the Government.

ETAP's balance sheet is strong with a high level of working capital and low
indebtedness 2/. Since the full profits are paid to the Government as
explained above, ETAP has no reserves. On the other hand, the Government
injects equity into ETAP on a regular basis as a compensation.
36.       Clearly, ETAP operates in an highly protected environment since:
Mi) it only "pays" exploration expenditures following a discovery, so that it
does not incur the high financial risks associated with oil exploration; (ii)
it is compensated for crude oil exports and product imports on a commission
basis irrespective of performance; and (iii) should it still incur a loss, as
was the case in 1986, it is compensated in full by the Government. Should
the present framework for ETAP's operations be maintained in the future, its
financial situation will remain satisfactory essentially because its
financial mode of operations resembles more to a Government Department than
to that of an oil company.
1/   Under Tunisian law, foreign exchange losses can only be deducted during
the period in which principal payments are made.
21   Long term debt is overstated to the extent that interest free Government
loans account for nearly 402 of the total.

37.      The financial framework for ETAP's operations was probably
appropriate at a time when the company had no income from operations and was
essentially fulfilling certain functions on the Government's behalf. Now that
ETAP has access to crude, this framework is difficult to justify, particularly
taking into account the urgency in accelerating oil exploration under the
present circumstances in Tunisia. Discussions hav. already taken place
between ETAP and the Government on the possibility of giving ETAP some degree
of financial autonomy for the concessions being developed (para. 28 above).
The Government is addressing these issues under an on-going overall review and
updating of the strategy and the structure of the energy sector. The findings
and recommendations of this review will be available in early 1989. It has
been agreed that the Bank will review these recommendations before they are
finalized.
IV. THE PROJECT
Obiectivs
38.      The main objectives of the proposed Project are: (i) to attract
private sector investments for exploration in Tunisia; and (ii) to strengthen
ETAP's technical capabilities in the management of the petroleum resources;
39.      The Project essentially involves in the first phase an evaluation of
the petroleum potential of the prospective areas in Tunisia based essentially
on the evaluation of geological and geophysical data. Most of the raw data
required for this phase already exist from past exploration activities, and
are available from ETAP; necessary additional geological and geophysical data
will also be acquired. The evaluation of the data will require laboratory
analyses, computer reprocessing of seismic tapes and data interpretation.
During the first phase, ETAP will have at its disposal: (i) compatible seismic
and isopach maps; (ii) geological and stratigraphic correlations and
sedimentology studies; (iii) structural setting and defined tectonic
framework; (iv) paleographic, facies, expansion maps and reservoir
characteristics; (v) geochemical data, source rocks analysis and, hydrocarbon
plays maturation, generation and migration. These data will be synthesized
and presented to the oil industry in a second phase in order to draw their
interest in negotiating exploration agreements in Tunisia.
40.      The main components of the Projects are as follows:
a. Seismic Studies: Since the existing seismic data was generated by
permit holders which subsequently relinquished those areas at various
points in time, the data are necessarily fragmented and of uneven
quality. Therefore, the main objective of the seismic program would
be to organize this fragmentary information into continuous and
composite exploration seismic coverage and to complete a regional
grid which would provide an underpinning for an overall geological
interpretation of the selected area. New seismic acquisition and
reprocessing techniques will test modern techniques to show possible
improvements in quality. This program specifically involves: (i) the



- 26 -
Technical Annex
Page 15 of 18
reprocessing of about 3,700 km of existing seismic lines to improve
their quality and obtain homogeneous results; (ii) the acquisition
and processing of about 1,000 km of new data to fill in the gaps in
the already existing grid; and (iii) possibly, the undertaking of
some detailed seismic surveys, using very recent seismic techniques
in the most difficult and complex areas of the country.
b. Gravity and Airmag Studies: in the complex northern part of the
country, geophysical data is nonexistent. The loose gravity grid
currently available will be complemented with gravity and airmag
surveys, which will be interpreted using modern techniques (modeling,
stripping, etc.). Specialized foreign consultants experienced in
airmag and gravity data interpretation will be required for this
task. Since ETAP lacks experience in this area, this component will
also include the services of an outside expert who will determine the
scope of work and will provide quality enhancement.
c. Geology and Geochemistry Studies: a comprehensive geological and
geochemical study of selected areas will be prepared by EiAP. The
implementation of this component requires additional equipment for
the recently built geochemical laboratories and about 20 man-months
of technical assistance.
d. ComPuter Software and Assistance: ETAP has recently acquired a VAX
11/780 computer and data base software. 1/ It needs additional
software for seismic data processing, and geological and engineering
studies. It also needs the assistance of a system analyst specialist
to help introduce use of new software packages in ETAP's day-to-day
activities.
e. Technical Assistance for Promotion: ETAP will have to compile a
promotional package based on the results of the studies. Services of
consultants will be required to: (i) produce reports according to oil
industry standards; (ii) organize promotion meetings in cities such
as Houston and London; and (iii) arrange contacts with potentially
interested companies.
f. Training. ETAP's technical staff will participate in (i)
specialized short-terms seminars (about 2 seminars per year),
organized at headquarters by external consultants, and (ii)
conferences abroad on advanced technologies in petroleum exploration.
Prohect inplementation
41.      The Project will be implemented by ETAP's Exploration Department in
which a Project Unit (PU) will be created and staffed by qualified personnel.
The PU will be headed by the manager of concessions, assisted by three senior
geologists/geophysicists and three junior geologists.
1/ The computer was financed under the Technical Assistance Project (Loan
2197-TUN in 1982).



- 27 -
Technical Annex
Page 16 of 18
Specifically the PU will: (i) hire, supervise and coordinate consultants;
(iU) control the quality, costs and schedules of services and goods; (iii)
supervise the preparation of promotional packages and data which will be made
available to the oil industry; (iv) coordinate and supervise studies on new
exploration leads and continue to evaluate risks related to these leads; and
(v) prepare the documentation required for disbursements under the Bank loan,
maintain the necessary project records, monitor progress and prepare periodic
status reports for review by the Bank. The Unit will be maintained throughout
the entire project as an independent group, but will liaise and use the
services of other Departments of ETAP as appropriate.
hImpementatio Schedhle
42.      The prospective territory has been divided (see Map IBRD 21067) into
six hydrocarbon provinces to be promoted. Each of them is homogeneous in its
geomorphic and geologic setting and its tectonic framework. In view of the
availability of sufficient data in the offshore and interest expressed by the
industry, the offshore areas E and F (Gulfs of Hammamet and Gabes) will be
promoted in the first bid round. Tentative timing for the first bid round is
mid-1990, followed by successive promotions in 1991 and 1992, depending on the
progress of the project and development of new exploration "playst. However,
the whole Tunisian territory will remain open to companies wishing to acquire
new permits. Each round will cover the region selected for promotion.
Proect Cost and Financing Plan
43.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$9.0 million
comp-ising US$6.5 million in foreign exchange of which US$5.5 million will be
funded by the Bank and US$1.0 million will be provided by ETAP along with
US$2.5 million in local expenditures. It can be broken down as follows:
Estimated Costs
Local      Foreimn       Total
(US '000)
Exploration Promotion
Technical Assistance and Training          100        1,400        1,500

Equipment and material                     -          2,000        2,000
Total Base Cost (1988US$)                2,100        5,300        7,400
Contingencies                              400        1,200        1,600
Total Cost (current US$)                 2QQ          L2Q          21M
Onshore seismic costs, inclusive of interpretation and processing have been
estimated at US$6,000/line-km for the difficult southern areas and between
US$3,000/line-km and US$6,000/line-km for the other more accessible areas.
The cost of foreign consultant's services has been estimated at US$20,000 per
man month (all inclusive) which is considered realistic taking into account
the prevailing rates for petroleum experts. Physical contingencies are at 10l
(for all components) and price contingencies for local and foreign costs are
at 32 for 1989 and 1990 and 42 for 1991 and 1992.

44.      The proposed Bank loan of US$5.5 million would cover 612 of the total
financing requirement, and 85S of the foreign exchange cost of the Project.
The loan would be made to ETAP for 17 years including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. Since ETAP would bear the foreign
exchange risk of the Loan, and since it is for exploration promotion, the
Government would not require a guarantee fee from ETAP. This is satisfactory
under the circumstances. The local costs would be financed by ETAP which, in
view of the amounts involved, should not cause particular problems (para.
36). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that sufficient funds will
be made available in a timely manner to carry out ETAP's activities under the
proposed project.
Pkoeurement, Disbursement and Retroactive FinaneinR
45.      The seismic survey and the processing and gravity airmag will be
procured through ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Studies and
consulting services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
consultant's guidelines. The specialized computer packages. laboratory and
computer facilities will be acquired through LIB given the degree of
specialization of these materials and equipments, and the limited number of
well established suppliers. Other specialized services will be procured under
the Bank's guidelines, and international shopping on the basis of comparison
of price quotations. All contracts above US$100,000 would be subject to prior
review by the Bank.
46.      The loan would be disbursed as follows: (a) 100 percent of
expenditures in foreign exchange and 80% of expenditures in local currency for
items procured locally for Technical Assistance, Consulting Services and
Training; and (b) 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 902 of
expenditures in local currency for items procured locally for
equipment/material. Disbursements would be supported by full documentation
except for contracts valued at less than US$100,000 for which disbursements
will be made against statement of expenditures with the supporting
documentation being retained by ETAP for subsequent review by Bank supervision
missions. The closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1993.
Environmental Aspects
47.      The Petroleum Law enacted by the Parliament in 1987 requires that all
the oil operating companies and service contractors observe the country's
environmental protection requirements. Exploration work will be carried out
in compliance with the above mentioned law and current regulations and the
sound practices of the oil industry particularly as stipulated in its
Article 12 "with regard to the conservation of natural resources, the
protection of the environment and the security of staff and plant".
ReportmX
48.      ETA" will maintain records to monitor pr-gress in project
implementation, and a routine quarterly progress report will be prepared by PU
both for ETAP's management and the Bank. A copy of consultants' progress and
final reports will be supplied to the Bank. Within six months after the



- 29-
Technical Annex
Page 18 of 18
closing date, ETAP will prepare a project completion report in accordance with
the Bank's format.  Assurances to that effect were obtained at negotiations.
Benefxts
49.      Unlike past efforts in exploration promotion in the country, the
proposed project will be a coordinated, comprehensive action program covering
the whole Tunisian territory. This project would enhance the quality and
level of exploration activity with the objective of bringing after appropriate
evaluation, new oil discoveries on stream more rapidly and systematically. It
is impossible to make any reliable quantitative estimates of the benefits that
may be expected from a Project of this nature. Based on experience elsewhere,
one could anticipate that the level of exploration investments by the oil
industry would increase by at least US$30-40 million as a result of the
Project. The Project would be of special interest to newcomers to Tunisia
which are now often small to middle-sized European and American companies
interested in expanding their field of activity outside the U.S. or the North
Sea; these companies generally require good technical information to carry out
their evaluation prior to taking a permit.
50.      The Project is also expected to improve the knowledge of the
country's hydrocarbon potential through the utilization of modern techniques
in data processing, laboratory, geological and geophysical studies.
Furthermore, the Project will provide ETAP with state-of-the art, synthetic
studies and exploration data acquisition techniques and would strengthen its
technical capabilities.
51.      The main risk of the Project is that oil industry response to the
promotion efforts would be weak due to an unfavorable international
exploration climate or poorer than anticipated geology. However, these risks
are considered small in view of the general attraction of Tunisia in the past
and its good geographical position. The main challenge of the Project will be
to unveil new prospects and/or to review old prospects: the geology of Tunisia
is such that this goal is attainable. Considering the amounts involved, the
risks of the Project are small and manageable, and in view of Tunisia's record
and the potential benefits, worth taking.

TUNISIA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
Brief History of Petroleum Exploration in Tunisia
1.       Oil exploration in Tunisia began as early as 1930 and the first
well was spud in 1932 by SEREPT. Since then and up today 400 exploration
wildcats were drilled onshore and offshore Tunisia, over an open total
acreage of about 200,000 km2. This represents a well density of one
exploratory well per 500 km2/or per 300 sq miles. Thus Tunisia can be
considered an underexplored country for its kind of geology. Over the past
50 years, exploration activities spurred in five phases which spanned each
a little over one decade.
2.       In the thirties exploration drilling was essentially executed on
the basis of surface geology i.e., on anticlines of surface expression, and
therefore, was limited to rugged areas with an average of about 1 well per
year. In the early forties that activity was reduced to almost zero
particularly during the second world was when Tunisia as most of North
Africa was a battlefield for numerous and large scaled military
confrontations between allied armies and their protagonists.
3.       In 1948, the first discovery was made in a high altitude anticline
in Cap-Bon, north-eastern Tunisia; it was natural gas. This discovery has
spurred interest in further exploration on surface anticline features all
over the country and particularly in north and north-west Tunisia, were
several oil seepages were and still are recorded. In the absence of
reliable geophysical surveys several of these wells were either too shallow
or encountered unpredicted tectonic and geological complications. By the
end of the fifties exploration has slowed down to about 3 wells per year
from an annual average of about 6 wells/year.
4.       In 1964, after the introduction in Tunisia of new geophysical
techniques particularly seismic, EI Borma field was discovered in Triassic
sandstone at a depth of about 2,400 m. This major find has drawn the
attention of oil companies on the stable saharian platform and other areas
structurally similar to it such as oriental onshore and offshore Tunisia.
Exploration activities resumed again at a pace of about 7 wells/year
targeting Triassic objectives in particular. Unfortunately there were no
repeat to El Borma major find during that phase a part from some small
accumulations of oil. The major difficulty in the area is lack of good
seismic resolution for defining the closure of structures; the presence of
a thick and hydrite section prevents seismic penetration. Exploration
slowed down again towards the end of the sixties.

5.       Early in the seventies, in 1971, Tunisia second major oil find was
made in offshore Sfax at Ashtart nunmulitic limestones of lower Eocene
age. The field of Sidi El Itayem was discovered in the same lower Eocene
reservoir. For several years this objective became oil companies favorite
onshore and offshore of Tunisia where nummulitic limestones extended at a
depth of a little over 2,000 m. Two marginal fields were further
discovered. As a consequence of this intense activity the depositional
trend of these limestones was relatively well defined but not exhausted.
However, in the mean time many other objectives were over looked. Indeed,
already in the middle of the seventies drilling in the Gulf of Gabes
revealed significant gas accumulations in upper Cretaceous carbonates at a
depth of about 4,200 m (Miskar field). Unfortunately, this new objective
being deep and in offshore did not attract enough interest from oil
companies and remained up to now easentially under axplored. Again
exploration slowed down at the end of the seventies.
6.       In 1976, oil was discovered in middle Miocene sands in the Gulf of
Hammamet. One year later oil gas concentrate were discovered in Ordovician
sandstones in southern Tunisia (Chott area). In the mean time more
flexibility was introduced in permit granting and acreage was opened up to
independent and smaller oil companies. On the other hand oil prices
reached their peak. All those factors brought exploration activities to an
all time record, with 32 wells drilled in 1981. Several discoveries were
made in the Gulf of Hammamet, of which Tazerka was put under production
since 1984 the others appear to be marginal although in many cases
delineation wells (3) did not provide a clear understanding of the
depositional mechanism of those sands. Their rapidly varying thickness and
extent seem to suggest that they may have been deposited in a very
complicated (anostomose) type of channel system. A more detailed effort
and closer look still have to be done on Miocene and Ordovician sand
reservoirs to comprehend their distribution and to pool their production in
a cluster development system appropriate to offshore environment for the
Gulf of Hammamet and to Saharian environment for the Chotts areas.
Unfortunately, the collapse of oil prices in 1986 did not help maintain
this effort and exploration, like any where else in the world, slowed down
dramatically.
7.       In late 1986 early 1987 oil was discovered in upper Cretaceous
carbonates and upper Jurassic sand in the Zarzis area. Test wells flowed
between 3,000 and 4,000 BOPD. This discovery came in time to confirm
Tunisia good hydrocarbon potential by adding for the first time, the
Jurassic and upper Cretaceous as serious potential targets for oil.
