3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
IDA's and Georgia's key priority during FY98-00 was stabilization support. Through adjustment
and related technical assistance credits, IDA, as a first priority, planned to promote improved revenue
performance and expenditure management, as well as provision of a limited range of public services. A
second priority was to strengthen and diversify the sources of growth by removing the remaining barriers



to private sector development. IDA's intervention was to support privatization, rehabilitate basic
infrastructure, put in place a regulatory framework that can attract substantial private investment, and
strengthen the legal and judiciary framework. A third priority was to assist the Government in introducing
the institutional and policy reforms needed to protect Georgia's environmental and natural resources.
The fourth and overarching priority was to address poverty issues within the context of a recovering
economy. To facilitate the timely implementation of structural reforms, the Government of Georgia
requested a program of technical assistance to support the design and implementation of the reform
measures in key areas. SATAC II aimed at addressing objectives one, two and four.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The primary objectives of SATAC II had remained largely unchanged; however, there were
considerable shifting of credit funding from one component to another.
3.3 Original Conmponients:
Component: Cost
JUDICIAL REFORM & ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVE; $700,000.00
This component was to finance TA for the design and establishment of new court administration,
financial and management systems, and carrying out of studies to assess the needs for future public
education campaigns about the role of the judiciary in a market economy. The Anti-corruption
sub-component was to focus on the anti-corruption working group and on strengthening public
expenditure management.
FINANCIAL SECTOR; $320,000.00
TA was to be provided to strengthen the Supervision and Regulations Department of the
National Bank of Georgia.
ENERGY SECTOR REFORM; $1,350,000.00
This component comprised assistance for auditing of power distribution companies, in facilitating
the privatization of power distribution companies, and in strengthening the Georgian National Energy
Regulatory Commission.
SOCIAL PROTECTION; $950,000.00
This component was to cover three primary activities: (a) establishing a monitoring system for
social protection;
(b) strengthening the capacity of the Statistics Department to carry out surveys; and (c) formulation of a
pension reform master plan.
HEALTH; $470,000.00
The TA was to be provided for (a) the preparation of a hospital master plan; and (b) merging
municipal health funds into regional branches of the State Medical Insurance Company.
RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; $780,000.00
This component was to strengthen the investigation and the enforcement departments of the
Customs and State Tax Service and to computerize the Anti-Monopoly Service.
PUBLIC INFORMATION; $375,000.0
The primary objective of this component was to increase the awareness of decision makers and
the population at large about the broad aspects of the economic reforms and the transition to a market
economy.
Most of these objectives built on the two previous technical assistance credits, the Institution
Building Credit (26410-GE) and SATAC I (28480GE). With the exception of the judicial reform and
- 2 -



anti-corruption component in SATAC II all other components support implementation of reforms covered
under the Structural Adjustment Credit II (Credit No. 29830-GE). In short, SATAC li was deemed
realistic and approprate for the perceived needs of the Government at the time.
3.4 Revised Components:
JUDICIAL REFORM & ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVE          $1,032,912.18
FINANCIAL SECTOR                                      $242,516.25
ENERGY                                                $913,326.80
SOCIAL PROTECTION                                     $243,214.20
HEALTH                                                $386,370.00
RESOURCE MOBILIZATION                                 $1,063,380.24
PUBLIC INFORMATION                                    $1,003,750.65
EXPENSES;                                             $141,200.00
3.5 Quality at Entry:
SATAC II was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy and with Government's expressed
needs. It was conceived on the assumption that the policy dialogue was well rooted and that targeted TA
interventions could be critical in sustaining ownership and implenfentation of the reform program. Assessed
against the broad policy initiatives agreed upon by the Government of Georgia and IDA, in such areas as
health and energy, SATAC II can be seen as providing a relevant, flexible and responsive assistance to
those policy initiatives. Flexibility was also seen as an important factor allowing for changes in the use of
the credit in response to evolving priorities of the recipient. If assessed, however, against institutional
development or capacity building objectives, SATAC II lacks coherence. The design failed to highlight at
least a few benchmarks against which progress can be measured. Flexibility is a desirable quality in any
project and, in particular, in technical assistance projects. However, if taken too far, flexibility could turn a
technical assistance project into a slush fund, and the demarcation line between the two should be guarded
carefully.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The credit played a critical role in assisting the government to implement the structural reforms
covered by SAC II, most notably in the financial sector, energy and health. It was, however, less effective
in other areas.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Part A: Judicial Reform and Anti-Corruption Initiative
The credit supported an assessment of the judicial reform agenda, which led to the approval of a
Judicial Reform Credit (Credit 32630-GE). With the help of technical assistance provided by the credit,
the government was able to move in several important areas, including attestation ofjudges and
promulgation of legislative changes to make the judiciary independent.
The credit also financed a print shop, electronic equipment and paper to enable the Ministry of
Justice to publish in the Official Gazette laws, decrees, presidential directives and supreme court decisions
for circulation to judges and the legal profession across the country. This was crucial for the system of
justice because unless all of the above were published in the Gazette they have no legal force. Court
-3-



Management Associates of the U.S. provided 18 months of consulting work, including assistance to the
Judicial Council to prepare an assessment of the areas where further assistance was needed. On the basis of
this assessment, the Judicial Reform Credit referred to above was approved.
In terms of training, 10 judges were selected for a program of "training of trainers" at the Judicial
Training Center in the U.S. Upon their return to Georgia, these judges have been providing training to other
judges in a similar training center established in Tbilisi with the assistance of SATAC II as well as USAID
and TACIS.
In short, significant steps have been taken to reform the judicial system. Much remains to be done,
however, for the judicial system cannot sustain these advances without progress in the other branches of
government as well. Judiciary represents one of the three branches of a democratic government and
therefore its performance is affected by the performance of the other two. Sustainability remains in doubt.
The anti-corruption and public expenditure reform are two separate activities. The anti-corruption
sub-component was subsequently covered by other sources of funding. The funds allocated for this activity
was utilized primarily to hire a consultant to the Minister of Finance. The consultant focused on two
activities: reorganizing the private office of the minister and introducing a recruitment system grounded on
the principles of transparency and competitiveness. The creation of a minister's private office was helpful in
establishing a gate-keeping mechanism to shield the minister from excessive outside contacts and, in
particular, from the many experts working in the ministry. The recruitment system, designed by the
consultant, worked only partially and for a short time. It was too much to expect that changing an
ingrained culture of cronyism and political favoritism could be reformed without a change in the conditions
which nourish corruption in government. This sub-component does not show evidence of sustainability.
Part B: Financial Sector
This component provided technical assistance to strengthen the Supervision and Regulations
Department in the National Bank of Georgia. As a result of this assistance, the department was
strengthened, consolidation of the bank sector was achieved and the capital ratios of banks were raised. The
Bank worked closely with the IMF on this component. The institution of a timetable for meeting prudential
requirements has strengthened the IMF approach of conferring a strong legal status on the National Bank
of Georgia.
IDA's assistance was recently supplemented by the IMF which placed an adviser in the department.
Technical assistance is also being provided by USAID. According to the IMF resident representative in
Tbilisi, the department, although lacking independence, has added professional staff, and has functioned at
a high level of competence, aided in its efforts by the computers financed by the IDA credit. There is
evidence of institutional development and sustainability is likely.
Part C: Energy Sector
The largest contract under SATAC II in the amount of $700,000 was awarded to Merrill Lynch to
assist in energy sector reforms, including the audit and valuation of power enterprises, which was
prerequisite for the preparation of a tender for privatization. The study submitted by Merrill Lynch set in
motion the privatization of the largest power distribution system in Tbilisi, the Telasi Company, which was
purchased in a bidding by AES for $25 million. AES has also committed an additional amount of $75
million to install new lines and new meters. According to GoG, this is the first power distribution system in
FSU to be privatized.

The Government of Georgia was dissatisfied with Merrill Lynch's pace, and the initial quality, of
work carried out in the company's office in London. The Bank was called upon to intervene to expedite the
work. Bank's intervention proved to be decisive in moving the process forward.
Despite delays, the privatization of Telasi is a reality and must be judged a big success. Power
supply in Tbilisi has improved and so has the collection rate.
Also in the energy sector, SATAC II provided technical assistance and equipment to the Georgian
national Energy Regulatory Commission. The Comnmission retains the services of 14 local consultants
comprising economists, engineers and lawyers whose efforts, aided by the supply of computers by SATAC
II, resulted in the design of a methodology for rate making which has been helpful in setting the rates for
the newly privatized Telasi company. Under USAID, the Commission has been receiving assistance and
training from Michigan State University. Capacity in rate making has been improved and sustainability is
likely.
Part D: Social Protection
This component focused on three principal activities, with decidedly mixed results. The first
activity comprised two objectives: first, the development of methodology for poverty monitoring and,
second, carrying out a household survey. Expatriate and local consultants were hired to carry out both
objectives. In addition, three senior officials attended a course on reforming social protection and pension
offered by Harvard Institute for International Development in Cambridge. The second activity entailed
assistance to the State Statistics Department, comprising $95,000 for consultants and $15,000 for
equipment. The Canadian Statistical Bureau was awarded the contract to introduce modern household
survey methodology and practice in Georgia. A training program was organized in Tbilisi, and at the
World Bank. The quality of statistics has improved and the improvements in the Statistics Department are
likely sustainable. The third activity, which was the largest of the three, was to produce a Pension Reform
Master Plan. A consultant was hired to prepare "Alternatives to Inprove the Pension Collection in
Georgia." The consultant's report, submitted in May 1998, underscored the fact that while every Georgian
was covered under the existing pension plan, only 1 million out of the 2.4 million covered by the plan
contribute to it. This was attributed to low collection capability as well as a widespread underdeclaration
of wages. The report has contributed, however, to raising awareness about illegal schemes in the private
pension domain, on the one hand, and the requirement to achieve financial sustainability for public
pensions, on the other hand.
Part E: Health Sector Reform
The credit financed the preparation of a National Hospital Restructuring Masterplan which was to
assist the government in reducing the excess capacity in the secondary and tertiary levels of health care and
optimize the national network of health facilities. The technical assistance was provided by Kaiser
Permanents and comprised (a) a computerized inventory of all hospitals and major health facilities in the
country, including the status of the physical infrastructure, medical equipment, and statistics on capacity
and utilization; (b) a proposed hospital masterplan for each region, based on project epidemiological and
demographic trends and changes in clinical practice; and (c) a proposed restructuring strategy for each
region, including a phased program of on-retrofitting, merging, and closing of secondary and tertiary health
facilities, taking into account patient access, political feasibility and efficiency. A separate plan is available
for each region and SATAC II funds were also used to hold workshops with regional health departments
and head doctors of hospitals to review the plans. The masterplan for Tbilisi, which calls for consolidating
- 5 -



more than 50 hospitals in the capital into approximately 12 publicly owned facilities, is currently being
implemented as part of the Structural Reform Support Project (Credit 32640-GE). the Kaiser contract was
also extended to perform a financial feasibility study for one of the hospitals that was intended to remain in
the public sector and be refurbished under the first health project to enure that under the proposed
restructuring scenario, the facility would be financially viable. The second proposed activity in health -
technical assistance for merging municipal health funds into regional branches of the State Medical
Insurance Company - was never procured because while the merger was encouraged under the SAC, it was
never carried out because the municipalities were unwilling to relinquish control of the funds at that time.
The sustainability of the first part of the health reform program is highly likely.
Part F: Resource Mobilization
This component was to provide technical assistance to four activities: a) customs department; (b)
state tax system; (c) state anti-monopoly service; and (d) debt management service.
(a) Customs Department: The Crown Agents signed a one-year contract to provide assistance on customs
modernization. Their advice covered a range of issues as recruitment and training of personnel,
warehousing and anti-smuggling. The Crown Agents, working through a senior consultant stationed in
Tbilisi, introduced Flexible Anti-smuggling Teams or FASTS and improved the intelligence gathering
capacity of the department. The FASTS system was recently discontinued, and Customs Departments has
remained inefficient with smuggling pervasive. Sustainability in this area is unlikely.
(b) State Tax system: IDA provided $400,000 for the purchase of computers to improve the linkage
between the center and the regions. There was no training or consulting services to go with the computers.
Tax collection in Georgia is almost non-existent, and the sustainability of this activity is highly unlikely.
(c) State Anti-Monopoly Service: IDA assistance, as in (b) above, was limited to providing computers to
agency headquarters and 12 regional offices whose primary function is to protect the consumer. Beyond
receiving the computers this service has not been successful on consumer protection rights, and the
sustainability of this activity should be judged uncertain.
(d) Debt Service Management: IDA financed the creation of a consulting office on debt management in the
Ministry of Finance. The office comprised 10 "local" consultants who, in effect, were civil servants who
took leave from the ministry for a year. While the local consultants have built up a reliable data system for
monitoring external debt, based on recommendations made by an expatriate firm, the principle of paying
civil servants to carry out what normally falls under their responsibility, is a questionable practice. In this
case, the local consultants received $51,600 for their service. Certainly no added capacity is expected
although their work would be rated as likely sustainable.
Part G: Public Information
The credit financed the consulting firm of Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associated from
Arlington, Virginia, to prepare a special communication plan to deliver information from the government to
the public on economic reforms. The consultants designed a special programs for TV, radio and newsprint
(in the form of a newspaper called Ecodigest). This particular newspaper has began as a weekly but has
become daily since May 15, 2000 with a circulation of about 2000. This component had grown from an
initial allocation of $375,000 to a little over $1 million. The program was designed to undertake a national
campaign to carry information on econornic reforms to the Georgian people in the face of what described as
"waning public support for the reform process." The contract with the consultants was revised upward to
- 6 -



$489,500 with five month extension.
This is a problematic activity for IDA to finance. While public information, if provided in a
transparent and objective manner, is essential to the creation of a civil society, and indeed an educated and
informed citizenry, the danger lies in using this type of government-fed information to enhance the political
fortunes of the regime. There is a fine line between public education and political propaganda in a country
where democracy has yet to strike deep roots. If a country is a democracy then, by definition, it has a free
press which can inform the public. If a country is not a democracy, and this is not to say that Georgia is
not, and has no free press, adding another government-sponsored paper, does not necessarily improve the
quality of information. The danger for IDA and, indeed for the World Bank Group, is that it could be
drawn into political controversy by appearing to taking sides in a legitimate political debate. A new'spaper
designed to transmit information to the public could also be used in a campaign against IDA if the reform
program falters.
The Government of Georgia, however, associates the support for Ecodigest with IDA's support
for the reform program, and considers an abrupt termination of IDA funding for the newspaper as
damaging to the reform efforts. A possible compromise is for the government to intensify its efforts to
privatize Ecodigest and for IDA to phase out its financial support within an agreed schedule that comes to
an end in approximately six-month.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
N.A.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N.A.
4.5 Instituitional development impact:
The credit lacked clear institutional strategy beyond what was considered essential to implement
policies initiated by SAC II. For this reason, the institutional impact of the credit was largely limited to few
activities but this cannot be substantiated due to the absence of benchmarks in the project design. Where
institutional changes were targeted, as in the case of health and energy sectors, institutional impact could
become sustainable.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implemenlting agencyv:
Two factors outside the control of government may have had impact on implementation. First,
because of language difficulties, the training of customs officers by the Crown Agents was not fully
effective; and second, the privatization process of Tilasi Company was delayed as a result of Merrill
Lynch's inability to complete its work on time. But neither factor has had a long-term negative impact.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Government's commitment and ownership are essential for the implementation of any project, and
technical assistance project, in particular. Based on the record, government's ownership and commitment
were evident throughout project implementation. The leadership provided by the Economic Adviser to the
-7 -



President was crucial in facilitating the work of the PIU and the timely implementation of the project. The
ready access to government officials, at the highest level, to Bank missions helped resolve problems
promptly and effectively. On the negative side, the government did not develop a systematic training
program for the effective utilization of the technology, primarily computers, made available by the credit
Moreover, most beneficiaries of IDA-financed equipment will have no budgetary resources at their
disposal in the immediate future to pay for repair or upkeep of much of the equipment purchased under
SATAC II.
5.3 Factors generally sutbject to implementing agency control:
The Economic Adviser to the President provided the political leadership, and the head of Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations provided the
administrative skills to help in project implementation effectively and on schedule. Government officials
were quite receptive to IDA's proposals to move implementation on course.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Measured by the three expenditure categories, actual expenditures were almost consistent with
scheduled expenditures listed in Schedule I of the Development Credit Agreement (dated September 15,
1997) in SDR:
Category of
Expenditures      Schedule I (project) Expenditures         Actual Ex enditures
(SDR)            ($equiv.)          (SDR)            ($equiv.)
1) Consultants
Services and          2,800,000         3,783,784         2,738,748          3,728,744
Training
2) Goods               860,000          1,162,162          851,882           1,163,817
3) Incremental
Operating Costs        40,000            54,054             78,103            106,402
The above figures indicate that, with the exception of the incremental costs which doubled, the two
remaining major categories of expenditures were broadly in line with Schedule 1. However, as already
indicated in par 4 G) there was a major shift of credit resources to finance the public information activities
in the Chancellery (some of it was spent under the headline of "National Image Campaign." This shift has
come principally at the expense of the social protection component of the credit where actual expenditures
were only $243,214 in lieu of the scheduled expenditure of $950,000. There is nothing on record in the
Bank to indicate whether this major shift of credit funding was discussed at the Bank and at what level.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is likely for the following reasons:
a. Though the project was not aimed at building institutions in a normative sense, and the components can
be considered as mostly substitution technical assistance, the project was designed to build ownership and
consensus around core reform challenges. This has been accomplished with a degree of success.
- 8 -



b. Although some components of the credit are not likely to lead to sustainable effort there are sufficient
elements that show promise of sustainability as in the case of health, energy and the National Bank of
Georgia. Additional investment by IDA will maintain the momentum for reform.
c. Georgia is richly endowed with human capital which is amenable to learning and absorbing modern
management techniques. The supply of computers to many departments under the credit will help build this
modem capacity.
6.2 Transition arranigement to regular operations:
SATAC II has led to:
Health Project: The objective of the Project is to support the health reform efforts initiated by the
Borrower to improve the health of the Borrower's population.
Judicial Reform Project: The objective of the Project is to assist in the development of an
independent and professional judiciary, committed to high standards of judicial ethics and capable of
efficient and effective dispute resolution.
Structural Reform Support Project: The main objective of the Project is to support the
implementation of key reform measures in the Borrower's economic reform program, including: (a)
improving the balance between public and private sectors through technical assistance to increase private
economic activities and to reform public sector entities and information systems; (b) improving the social
sustainability of economic reforms; and (c) supporting the implementation of the Hospital Restructuring
Program.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
SATAC II was appraised originally as part of Structural Adjustment Credit 11 (SAC 11) but the
two were separated shortly before going to the Board. For this reason, the review of the SATAC II
components can only make sense if examined within the context of the broader, larger, SAC 11.
Nevertheless, IDA should have been more meticulous in seeking to establish some institutional targets for a
technical assistance credit. One of the challenges in designing and implementing system reforms is to build
the capacities to effectively managing the process. The heavy reliance on a Project Implementation Unit is a
palliative, not a solution, to long-term institutional problems. On the whole, however, Bank's performance
was satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
SATAC 11 was on the front burner of the Country Department at all times. The same sector specialists
who participated in the identification, appraisal and supervision of the SAC 11, did so also for SATAC II.
This involved a multisectoral team with expertise in the key areas addressed by each of the seven
components of SATAC 11, and primarily in financial sector, judiciary, health and energy. Cordial working
relations were developed early between IDA and the Borrower. Project implementation problems were
identified early and addressed. Performance ratings were appropriate, credit covenants were enforced and
advice and guidance were given from Washington and the field on a whole range of issues.
-9-



7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank was determined to move SATAC II in lock and step with the broader objectives of the
Structural Adjustment Credit. This was of course commendable as evidenced by the fact that SATAC II
was completed only 6 months after the initial closing date. The motivation for speedy action may have
colored project management's judgment with regard to a number of activities which, in retrospect, should
have warranted greater and more thoughtful deliberations. The following are three examples:
First, the allocation of funds for public information and the "national image campaign." The Bank's
primary mission, particularly in an IDA country, is poverty alleviation, not "image campaign."
Second, the Bank gave its approval to the creation of a "Debt Management Unit" in the Ministry of
Finance, comprising ten senior Georgian officials from the same ministry who went on leave without pay
for a year (allowed by Georgian regulations). This type of activity did not contribute toward additional
capacity building in the Ministry of Finance but it cost the project $51,600 for one year. This type of
exercise to reward civil servants for functions they carry out in the line of their duty should be avoided.
Third, the Bank did not pay much attention to training under this project. It is true that Georgia is
fortunate in that it possess human capital of high order but there are gaps to be addressed as the country
moves from a socialist mode to a free market economy.
Overall, Bank's performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation.
The project was designed and prepared in consultation with the Government of Georgia which
appointed individual working groups to identify the needs in the various departments affected by SAC II.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The government implementation performance was generally satisfactory. Indeed, the government
moved quite swiftly on the consultants' recommendation concerning the health masterplan and the
privatization of Telasi. In other components, particularly those relating to social policy and resource
mobilization such as customs and state tax administration, government's performance was lethargic at
best.
7.6 Implemnenting Agency:
The implementation of the project was coordinated government-wide by the Project Implementation
Unit which has been extremely efficient. The head of the PIU has a letter of authorization from the Ministry
of Finance to sign withdrawal requests from the special account. The PIU is periodically audited by a
French firm. Its record keeping is reliable.
7. 7 Overall Borrower pertbrinance:
Measured against other governments' performance regarding similar projects, the Government of
Georgia's performance in this instance should he rated as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned
a. Most institution building projects, such as SATAC II, should include capacity indicators designed to
reflect some future desirable level of performance. A shared vision of the future and some defining purpose
and objectives of the capacity interventions are obviously critical. In this case, too little diagnostic effort
was made to assess the state of capacity development at the outset of the program and describing the
constraints to further improvement. To be effective, programs aimed at capacity development need some
sort of preferred future in mind. The partners, the borrower and the Bank/IDA, need to know what
"capacity development" (as opposed to project or program outcomes) would likely be at the end of a certain
investment of effort and resources. Projected capacities thus deal much more with improvements than they
do with descriptions. They focus on what people need to be able to do that will, in turn, lead to some
substantive developmental outcomes and impact.
b. Institutional reform in Georgia, as in many developing countries, is a gradual and lengthy process
marked by successive, incremental changes in the status quo. To force the pace of change is unrealistic, on
the other hand, to fail to chart a clear course for change would turn a technical assistance credit into an
instrument for temporary gap filling activities with no long-term benefits.
c. IDA should avoid financing a daily newspaper regardless of the professed objective needs. IDA is in the
business of alleviating poverty, not in the publishing business. If government's policies are successful they
do not need a government-sponsored newspaper. As the saying goes: deeds speak better than words. If the
policies are not successful no amount of public relations will remedy the situation. On the contrary, the
more one brandishes failed policies the greater is the amount of public cynicism.
d. The preparation of the ICR was hampered for lack of full documentation. No record, for example, was
made available on who took the decision to allow the transfer of large amount of money into the public
information campaign or what was the rationale for the decision. This calls for better record keeping for
lending operations to maintain institutional memory.
e. While the Bank has been of two minds with regard to the establishment of a Project Implementation
Unit the case of Georgia, a country burdened by both inexperience and language constraints, the
alternative to a PIU would have resulted in considerable delays in project implementation. Nevertheless,
perpetuating the dependence on a PIU for implementing projects in Georgia for indefinite time will only
postpone the day when the country is supposed to sit in the proverbial" driver's seat." It is never too early to
engage the government in a dialogue about an "exit strategy" for the PIU and the gradual transfer of direct
project implementation by government units.
