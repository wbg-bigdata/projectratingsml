KENYA
THIRD NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               The Republic of Kenya.
Implementing Agency    Nairobi City Commission (NCC).
and Beneficiary:
Credit Amount:          SDR 49.1 million (US$64.8 million equivalent).
Terms:                  Standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years.
On-Lending Terms:       As a loan to NCC at the IBRD interest rate (currently
7.65X) to be repaid over 21 years including 6 years of
grace.
Project Description:   The Project would expand Nairobi's water supply system to
cater for increased demand up to about 2003-5, improve
the basic needs provision and health conditions of the
urban poor, assist in maintaining the sanitation
standards in the city, preventing pollution in the
recipient rivers, and improving the efficiency of NCC's
Water and Sewerage Department (WSD) with the aim of
supporting its transition, at a later date, into an
autonomous body. The Project includes support for (a)
source works, including construction of a new dam and raw
water transmission tunnels and main; (b) extension of the
water supply system, including extension of a water
treatment plant, construction of treated water
transmission main, distribution system extensions,
instrumentation control and automation, and staff housing
and offices; (c) extension of the sewage treatment plant,
including provision of staff housing, offices and amenity
building; (d) improvement of water supply and waste
disposal facilities in low-income residential areas,
including construction of infill mains, public water
points, water selling kiosks, improvement to sanitation
facilities, and provision of vehicles, water meters and
other equipment; (e) consultancy services for
engineering, construction supervision and preparation of
a sewerage and sanitation master plan; and (f) technical
assistance for management staff support and
implementation of a training program, self-accounting
system and environmental action program.
Proiect Risks:          Based on NCC/WSD's performance in carrying out three
previous Bank and IDA-supported projects, the risks of
this Project are expected to be small. Delays in Project
start-up and implementation may result in cost overruns,
but technical assistance, training and management support



(iv)
would reduce this risk. NCC may continue to utilize the
Water Fund for payment of its expenditures, but
introduction of a new source of revenue would reduce this
risk and make it possible for NCC to repay its remaining
obligation to WSD. Introduction of tariff increases on a
regular annual basis may face political difficulties, but
in view of Government's commitment to the Project as
demonstrated by recent increases, this risk is expected
to be minimized. Monitoring WSD's performance in these
areas would be a focus of IDA supervision.

KENYA
THIRD NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Country Background
1.01     The Republic of Kenya, stretching inland from the Indian Ocean to
Lake Victoria, covers 583,000 km2 and straddles the equator. Along the
Indian Ocean coastline lies a narrow tropical belt, behind which an arid
plain extends to the north. Toward the northwest, the land rises to a high
plateau, the Kenya Highlands, at about 1,500 m with a temperate climate and
subtropical vegetation. The Highlands are bisected from north to south by
the Rift Valley.
1.02     Kenya's population is now nearly 21 million, with one of the
highest population growth rates (about 3.8% per annum) in the world. The
rural population is estimated at 18 million, while 3 million people live in
the rapidly growing urban areas. The capital city, Nairobi, has a
population of about 1.3 million. About 85% of the total population and the
majority of economic enterprises are concentrated on the Highlands plateau.
1.03     During the first half of the 1980's, Kenya's annual GDP growth
slowed to 2.4%, compared to 4.5% recorded during the period 1973-80. The
later period also included political disturbances (1982) and an
exceptionally severe drought (1984). The Government recognized the need
for stabilization of the economy to reverse the erosion of fiscal
discipline following the coffee boom of the late 1970's and the subsequent
deterioration in the external terms of trade arising from the second oil
shock in 1979. In 1982, a major devaluation restored the real effective
exchange rate to the level of 1976, and periodic adjustments have since
resulted in a real effective depreciation of more than 20%. Real interest
rates became positive, and real wages fell in the private and public
sectors. In agriculture, administered producer prices for maize and wheat
were raised substantially. The overall budget deficit was reduced from 10%
of GDP in 1981 to 4% in 1985, mainly through curtailment of development
expenditures. These measures resulted in a reduction in inflation from
more than 20% in 1981 to 10.5% in 1985. The current account deficit also
declined from 13% of GDP in 1981 to 4% in 1985, despite a 25% deterioration
in Kenya's terms of trade.
1.04     The stabilization effort was accompanied by a comprehensive
structural adjustment program supported by the Bank. Although less
successful than anticipated, important achievements included further
adjustments in agricultural producer prices, improvements in agricultural
extension, progress toward budget rationalization, a clearer system of
classifying imports for purposes of import licensing, and initial steps



- 2 -
toward a more uniform tariff structure. In other areas, including trade
liberalization, export promotion, and reform of agricultural marketing,
little progress was made. The Bank is continuing to support policy reforms
in these areas through ongoing and planned sector adjustment operations in
agriculture and industry.
1.05     Following the recovery in 1985, the economy grew by 5.7% in 1986,
aided by favorable weather, a major improvement in Kenya's terms of trade,
and improvements in the macroeconomic environment. The external current
account deficit as a share of GDP decreased to 2.7%. All key sectors of
the economy performed well, especially agriculture and industry, which grew
by 4.8 and 5.2%, respectively. Real income per capita increased by 7%
(adjusted for terms of trade effects ) -- the first real increase this
decade -- and inflation decreased further to 4.3%. Gross domestic
investment increased by about 27%, largely due to a large accumulation of
stocks and a rise in public investment.
1.06     Although most aspects of Kenya's economy appeared encouraging in
1986, the fiscal and monetary positions were deteriorating. In the two
fiscal years ending FY86, macroeconomic management was more expansionary in
order to assist in drought relief efforts. Rapid increases in public
expenditures led to rising budget deficits in these two years. There was
no crowding out of the private sector since the larger deficit was
accompanied by a major expansion in domestic credit, especially in FY86.
1.07     In 1987, the combination of previous expansionary policies and a
25% fall in Kenya's terms of trade, produced a substantial deterioration in
economic conditions. Financial policies in FY87 continued to be
expansionary. The budget deficit (including grants) increased to 8.1% of
GDP, while domestic credit and broad money expanded by 28 and 22%,
respectively. Inflation also increased, reaching 7.3% during the year.
Balance of payments pressures were exacerbated in 1987, with the current
account deficit rising fourfold. The Government reacted to the external
pressures by curtailing imports.
1.08     Kenya's foreign capital inflows have decreased substantially in
recent years. Net capital inflows (including grants), which averaged 7% of
GDP during 1980-81, fell to an average of 3% of GDP during 1982-86.
Inflows increased in 1987, but they were largely associated with commercial
financing of defense imports. Given Kenya's debt service ratio of 32%, the
Government should not consider borrowing from commercial sources to meet
future external financing needs. Bridging of projected financing gaps will
need to rely on increased levels of official development assistance. There
are good prospects that these would be forthcoming provided the Kenyan
Government takes the appropriate policy measures to address medium-term
adjustment issues and the long-term constraints to development.
Water Resources
1.09     Kenya experiences wide differences in climate caused mainly by
variations in altitude. Average rainfall is about 450 mm per annum, but
the actual distribution means that vast areas receive 250 mm or less per
annum. As a result of the rainfall pattern, stream-flows are highly
seasonal and vary widely. Perennial rivers are concentrated in the



- 3 -
Highlandc area (including Nairobi) and the coastal zones. Kenya's
groundwater potential, except in the eastern part of the country, appears
to be limited and inadequate for large scale water supply projects.
However, considerably more investigation is required to identify and
develop this potential source which may be significant for the water supply
of smaller communities in the rural areas. Unfortunately, in some areas,
groundwater is saline and in others, including Nairobi and the Rift Valley,
groundwater contains high levels of flourides.
Access to Water in Urban Areas
1.10     While most of the urban population in Kenya have access to piped
water, the urban population growth rate of about 7% strains the existing
capacity of the systems. At present, water is supplied through metered
individual connections to about 70% of the urban population and to about 8%
through communal water points or kiosks. The remaining 22% of the
population is not serviced directly and has only limited access to potable
water. Overall urban water usage (excluding Nairobi) ranges from 70
l.p.c.d. to about 160 l.p.c.d. (including industrial, commercial and
institutional consumption). Nairobi's average is about 180 l.p.c.d., which
is normal for this environment.
Access to Water in Rural Areas
1.11     Only 2.6 million people (about 15% of the rural population) are
supplied with safe drinking water. The rest of the rural population has to
carry water over considerable distances from natural sources which are
usually polluted, inadequate or dry for several weeks each year. Water
usage ranges from 50 l.p.c.d. for individual connections (about 47,000 to
serve 600,000 people) down to about 10 l.p.c.d. where water is carried.
Although a large number of water supply schemes have been and are being
constructed under the Rural Water Supply Programme, many with external
donor assistance, the level of operation and maintenance has been
inadequate and many schemes are in need of rehabilitation (see also para
1.19).
Sewerage and Sanitation
1.12     There are 22 public sewerage systems in Kenya, servicing about 6%
of the total population. Another 4% have septic tanks and 40% make use of
pit latrines.  The remaining 50% have no proper sanitation facilities.  In
Nairobi, about 60% of the population is served by public sewer systems, and
20% by septic tanks. The Ministry of Local Government and Physical
Planning (MLGPP) and the Ministry of Water Development (MWD) have
undertaken improvements in other municipalities and smaller towns.
Operation and maintenance by local authorities, except in Nairobi, are
often to very low standards.
Sector Legislation
1.13     The Water Act, revised in 1986, together with its subsidiary
legislation, covers the broad field of conservation, control, apportionment
and use of water resources. The Water Apportionment Board (WAB) is
responsible for issuing all water abstraction licences in Kenya. It is



able to vary and revoke awards of water permits. MWD provides the Board
with technical advice, manpower for the Board's Secretariat and water
bailiffs who are the Board's field workers. The chairman of WAB is
customarily the Minister of Water Development.
1.14     Complementary to the Water Act is the Public Health Act which
includes many provisions relating to water and sewerage from the health
point of view. The Local Government Act, Cap. 265, gives power to local
authorities in urban areas to undertake water supply, sewerage and drainage
works, to maintain waterworks and to make appropriate by-laws.
Sector Organization
1.15     Reflecting the growing importance which the Government attaches to
the water sector and to rural water supply in particular, over the past two
decades responsibility for water supplies has passed from the Ministry of
Works to the Ministry of Natural Resources, to the Ministry of Agriculture,
and finally to the MWD, which was established in 1974 to concentrate on the
development of the water sector. In addition, three river basin
development authorities under the Ministry of Energy and Regional
Development (the Tana and Athi Rivers, Lake Basin, and Kerio Valley) were
established as independent statutory bodies. They are responsible for
integrated, multi-disciplinary planning and implementation of development
projects and orderly water exploitation in their respective areas. Major
irrigation developments are the responsibility of the National Irrigation
Board under the Ministry of Regional Development.
1.16     Since its establishment, the MWD has concentrated on the rural
water sector by constructing and operating several hundred schemes under
the first four phases of its Rural Water Development Program with varying
degrees of success. In addition to these rural MWD schemes, other
ministries and bodies have made rural water investments. The County
Councils operate with limited success several hundred small schemes which
are scheduled to be gradually taken over by MWD as funding permits. The
Kenya Railways also operates about a hundred schemes which supply water to
adjacent villages in addition to their own requirements. The Ministry of
Lands and Settlement plans and finances water supply for new settlement
areas, usually with MWD's Water Department as the executing agency. The
Ministry of Culture and Social Services administers government grants to
the "self-help" schemes in rural areas, again with WD's technical
assistance.
1.17     In the urban sector, the Nairobi water supply and sanitation
system is owned and operated by the Nairobi City Commission (NCC); the
Mombasa and coastal province water supply system is owned and operated
directly by MWD, with bulk water supplied by the MWD-controlled Mombasa
Pipeline Board; and the five other major municipalities operate their own
water supply systems under the direction of MLGPP with technical guidance
from MWD.



-5-
Sector Development Program
1.18     Kenya's water sector objective is to supply water to its entire
population by the year 2000. In the early 1970's, Government launched a
Rural Water Supply Program to speed rural development, which is now in its
fourth phase. The Government also endorsed the targets of the
International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade and, in October
1980, created a National Action Committee to coordinate Decade planning.
Annual development expenditure by MWD in the water supply and sanitation
sector grew very rapidly in the 1970's, to about US$25 million by 1979.
Since then, actual expenditure has dropped below this figure due to
financial constraints, but emphasis is still given to the rural areas,
especially to those projects which have attracted substantial amounts of
concessional donor finance. Sewerage and sanitation development
expenditures amount to only 10% of sector expenditures.
1.19     The rural water sector has benefited substantially from both
grants and technical assistance provided by various international donor
agencies. Over 60% of MWD's Rural Water Supply Program has been financed
by the Nordic donor agencies (SIDA, NORAD, DANIDA and FINNIDA), the
Netherlands, CIDA and KFW. In the past, this funding was concentrated on
new projects to benefit the unserved rural population. While this program
was largely successful, because of rapid expansion MWD was unable to
provide the necessary back-up services and finance to operate and maintain
these new facilities. Recognizing these constraints, the donors are now
focussing their assistance on rehabilitation, strengthening of operations
and maintenance, and technical assistance for MWD. The recent trend in
rural water supply strategy focusses were on village based operations,
community participation and appropriate technology.
Development Constraints and Problem Areas
1.20     The country's deteriorating economic situation and financial
constraints have also effectively slowed and reduced the implementation of
the ambitious rural water supply development program. To conserve scarce
resources, overall financial control of development projects has been
assumed by the Ministry of Finance. The need to improve operational
efficiency and cost recovery, especially in the rural sector has been
recognized by the Government, together with the need for systematic
manpower development and training programs in the sector. To overcome some
of the perceived shortcomings, Government has introduced the "district
focus" concept to decentralize responsibility and authority for planning
and operations and to some extent also revenue generation to district
administration. To support this program in the rural water sector, MWD has
begun to post HQ staff to field locations.
Cost Recovery/Tariffs
1.21     Government policy on cost recovery is that, in rural areas, water
charges should cover operation and maintenance costs, and in urban centers
water charges should, in addition, contribute to capital costs. In most of
the rural schemes, water is supplied to the consumers through kiosks at a
rate of Ksh 2.50/m3. The tariff for unmetered connections is Ksh 15.0 per



- 6 -
month, while for metered connections the charge is Ksh 1.5/m3 for the first
9 m3 and Ksh 2.65/m3 for additional consum tion.  The tariffs in the urban
and town council schemes average Ksh 2.0/m , although variations are
substantial. In the Mombasa coastal region, which is operated by MWD, the
flat rate charge is Ksh 26.1 for the first 9 m3 and Ksh 5.75/m3 thereafter.
The Nairobi water tariffs are described in paras. 5.05 and 5.06.
1.22     Total revenues collected in the rural water schemes operated by
MWD (excluding Mombasa) are only about 20% of the operating and maintenance
cost of Ksh 120 million. The low level of cost recovery is due both to
inadequate tariff levels and to poor billing and collection practices. In
1983/84, SIDA financed the preparation of a Water Use Study, which
recommends that rural tariffs should be raised by about 30%, with cross-
subsidy among the various schemes. Government has not yet decided on rural
tariff changes, but the recently introduced 'district focus' concept is
designed to improve operation of the schemes and water revenue collection
at the district level.
Previous Bank Group Projects
1.23     The Bank has been involved in the urban and water sector since
1970. During this period the Bank has financed three urban projects and
five water supply projects. The Nairobi Sites and Services Project (Loan
1205-KE/Credit 543-KE) included funds for a substantial sanitation and
sewerage component to benefit the urban poor in Nairobi. The Second Urban
Project (Loan 1550-KE/Credit 791-KE) undertook to finance site and service
developments and urban upgrading in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. The
Secondary Towns Project (Loan 2319-KE/Credit 1390-KE) assisted the
development in Kitale, Eldoret, Nyeri, Thika and Nakuru, with the aim of
developing an integrated urban network to support economic growth in the
rural areas and improving the urban employment base of secondary towns.
The proposed Fourth Urban Project aimed at improving the management and
financial practices of local government authorities is presently under
preparation.
1.24     The Nairobi Water Supply Project (Loan 714-KE) implemented during
1972-76 assisted by the Bank was the first phase of a long-range program to
develop the Chania-Kimakia-Thika river system for the purpose of meeting
Nairobi's water supply requirements. This was followed by the Second
Nairobi Water Supply Project (Loan 1520-KE), implemented during 1978-84, to
provide the necessary extensions for Nairobi's water supply up to 1987-88.
The presently still ongoing Third Nairobi Water Supply Engineering Project
(Credit 1566-KE) has been assisting the Government and the Nairobi City
Commission (NCC) and its Water and Sewerage Department (WSD) in the
preparation of the next extension phase (proposed project) and to
strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of the implementing
agency (NCC/WSD). The Bank also financed the Mombasa and Coastal Water
Supply Project (Loan 1167-KE), which was implemented by MWD. These
projects have been physically completed successfully albeit with cost
overruns of varying degrees. The key lesson learned from these projects is
the need for strong autonomous organizations capable of making sound
economic decisions within an established policy framework acceptable to
Government.



1.25     The Bank has made one loan to the rural water sector, namely the
Rural Water Supply Project (Loan 1637-KE) in 1977. Due to the problems of
implementation and operation which MWD was experiencing with the Rural
Water Supply Programme, the Bank-financed project got off to a very slow
start. In 1983, the project was restructured and reduced at Government's
request. Since then, Government's continuing financial constraints have
adversely affected MWD's financial and physical capacity to absorb any
further responsibilities, and the project was finally cancelled on mutual
agreement in February, 1985.
1.26     The Bank Group supports Government's effort to achieve its targets
in water sector development by providing financial assistance for high
priority, long-term water supply projects with continuing assistance for
institution building, emphasizing manpower development and training and
improvement in administrative and financial management. To assist
Government focus on the development and issues of the water sector, both
rural and urban, the Bank financed the preparation of a water sector review
under the Rural Water Supply Project. Although this work remained
unfinished (due to cancellation of the project), the Bank will continue the
dialogue with Government on sectoral objectives and future policies in the
rural water supply sector in Kenya in the face of a rapidly changing
ecological and economic environment. The Bank also continues to assist the
expansion of the water supply and sewerage systems in Nairobi, the nation's
capital and center of tourism, to which the Government attaches high
priority.

II. THE PROJECT AREA - NAIROBI
Location and Features
2.01     Nairobi is the capital and largest city in the Republic of Kenya.
It is located close to the Central Highlands region at an average elevation
of 1,500 m above sea level, some 500 km from Mombasa on the coast to the
East and 300 km from Kisumu on Lake Victoria to the West. The city of
Nairobi now encompasses some 600,000 hectares.   The area slopes gently
down from west to east with an approximate change in elevation of 300
meters across the city area, drained in the main by the Nairobi River and
its many tributaries.   The exceptions are the Karen-Langata area and the
airport area at Embakasi which are drained by tributaries of the Athi
river. Nairobi's current population is near to 1.3 million with an annual
growth rate of about 5.3%.
2.02     Nairobi is not only the capital city of Kenya but is also the hub
of all business, economic, communication and cultural activities, and the
centre of tourism. There are no major secondary centers beside the city
center within Nairobi's boundary, but outside the boundary Thika, Athi
River, Machakos and Kiambu are now urban centers to the north, south, east
and west, respectively. The urbanized area to be provided with
infrastructure now covers an area of approximately 30 km by 15 km.
2.03     The climate in the Nairobi area is predominantly controlled by its
equatorial position and the large scale pressure systems of the African
continent and Indian Ocean. However, topography strongly influences the
magnitude of the climatic elements and to a lesser extent their seasonal
distribution. Nairobi has two distinct wet seasons during April/June and
October/December. The average rainfall in the Nairobi area is about 900 mm
and the average annual temperature about 200C.
2.04     Nairobi receives its water supply from catchment areas some 50 to
60 km to the north, in the high rainfall area of the Aberdare Mountains.
This water is conveyed to Nairobi through pipelines which traverse densely
populated rural areas, some of which have inadequate water supplies. In
addition, the urban centers around Nairobi (some of which are already
supplied from Nairobi's system) will require additional facilities and
extended supply. The need to safeguard the interest of the other water
users outside the Nairobi area has been evident. With this in mind, the
water demand and the water supply facilities required for an integrated
utilization of the region's water resources to the benefit of Nairobi and
the other potential consumers have also been studied as part of Project
preparation under the Engineering Credit. This study area covers
approximately 7,500 km2 and comprises the whole of the upper Athi catchment
and the Thika catchment of the Upper Tana System. The present population
within the area is estimated to be about 2.5 million, half of which live in
Nairobi. The growth rate in the rural areas is expected to decline during
the planning period up to 2010 from the present estimated 3.9% per annum.
The long-term development plan is intended to eventually provide water to
this wider region. Priority of supply in the short-term, however, remains
for Nairobi.



- 9-
Existing Water Supply Systems
2.05     The water supply to Nairobi is derived from four sources:
(i)    The first water supply to Nairobi was provided by a railway
authority.  The source of potable water was Kikuyu Springs,
developed in the early 1900s.  In 1921 the water undertaking
was bought by NCC from the railway authority, and it is still
in operation.
(ii)    In 1939, an intake on the upper reaches of the Ruiru River
with pipeline and treatment work at Kabete were constructed.
This source was progressively developed up to 1950 by adding
a dam and two further pipelines.
(iii)    Between 1952 and 1956 the Sasumua River was developed by
building a dam, treatment works and transmission main. This
was further developed between 1960 and 1966 by raising the
dam, diverting the flow from other rivers into the reservoir
and extending the treatment works twice.
(iv)    It was apparent in the early 1960's that additional sources
would be required and investigations were carried out leading
to the implementation of Phase I of the Chania-Kimakia-Thika
Project. The works, comprising a diversion weir across the
Chania River, pumping station and raw water main, treatment
plant at Ngethu and treated water transmission mains, were
commissioned in 1974 (financed in part by IBRD Loan 714-KE)
increased the water supply capacity to about 130,000 m3/day.
This scheme was followed by Phase II of the Chamia-Kimakia-
Thika Project completed in 1985 (financed in part by IBRD
Loan 1520-KE). It employs a gravity feed to Ngethu from a
weir intake further upstream at Mwagu, through a tunnel and
new raw water main.
2.06     The available yields from these sources are as follows:
SOURCE                           M3/DAY
Kikuyu Springs                         4,800
Ruiru Dam                             21,400
Sasumua Dam                           46,000
Chania (Phases I and II)             122,000
TOTAL               194,200
It should be noted, that with the present sources on the Chania River (and
the Sasumua Dam operated in regulating mode) are basically run-of-river
abstractions. The yields above are given at 98% reliability levels.
2.07     About 90% of the water supplied and distributed in Nairobi is
conveyed by gravity. The total storage reservoir capacity in the
distribution system is 180,900 m3. While total supply presently
approximates total demand, the demand of the city is not fully met due to



- 10 -
an imbalance in the distribution zones; the western part of the city (upper
zones) which receives water from the first developed sources, is supplied
independently from the eastern part (lower zones), which receives water
from the later developed Chania source. Due to the demand growth in the
upper zones, especially in drought situations, urgent measures are required
for the interzonal transfer. The physical losses in the system (primarily
in the lower zones), which approximated 40-50% of the total supply after
the completion of the Second Water Supply Project in 1985-86, have been
considerably reduced through improved pressure control and rehabilitation
of the network under the immediate improvement measures, to about 30% at
present.
Existing Sewerage and Sanitation Systems
2.08     Presently about 700,000 people are served by the Nairobi sewerage
system, covering a sewered area of about 35 kM2, out of which about 125
hectares in the city center are sewered with combined sewers. The trunk
sewers (with a total length of about 115 kin) follow the Nairobi River, the
Matari and Ruiruaka Rivers, and the Ngong River. There are presently 14
sewage treatment works in operation in Nairobi, the two largest being the
Dandora Plant (Dry Weather Design Flow: 30,000 m3/day) and the Karioabangi
Plant (32,000 m3/day). The Industrial Area Treatment Ponds treats 4,500
m3/day and the Kahawa West Ponds about 1,750 m3/day. The capacity of the
rest of the treatment works which are serving mostly individual
institutions and industries vary between 75 and 455 m3/day.
2.09     The Dandora Sewage Treatment Works (Phase 1), owned and operated
by NCC/WSD, is situated about 17 km west of Nairobi, on gently sloping land
adjacent to the Nairobi River. An extensive area of adjacent land is
available for expansion. The works are the largest waste stabilization
pond installation in Kenya. Sewage reaches the works from Nairobi via the
Dandora Estate Trunk Sewer and the treated effluent is discharged into the
Nairobi River. The ponds are overloaded both organically and
hydraulically, but despite this the treatment process still provides an
acceptable degree of treatment. However, rehabilitation and extension of
the work is urgently needed to cope with the rapidly growing sewage flow.
2.10     The Kariobangi Treatment Works, owned and operated by NCC/WSD,
receives sewage flow via the Nairobi River Trunk Sewer. Flows in excess of
the works capacity overflow to the Dandora Treatment Works via the Dandora
Trunk Sewer. The works is designed to produce an effluent better than 20
mg/l BOD and 30 mg/l SS using percolating biological filters. Sludge is
settled in the primary and humus tanks and is pumped to heated digesters
after which it is dried in open beds. Treated water effluent is discharged
to the Nairobi River.
2.11     Residents in the areas not served by NCC/WSD sewers use septic
tanks, conservancy tanks, cesspools, bucket latrines and pit latrines. A
few small communities and some factories have individual treatment
facilities usually in form of small waste stabilization ponds.

III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01     Nairobi has had piped water supply since the turn of the century
and the development of the water supply system has generally kept pace with
effective demand. The population of Nairobi has grown from 4,000 in 1900
to 835,000 in 1979 (actual census figure), and to about 1.3 million in
1987. Based on the expected growth rates, Nairobi's population may reach
2.5 million by 2000, while effective water demand is expected to grow from
the present level of about 170,000 m3/day (just barely met) to about
350,000 m3/day.
3.02     The Bank has been involved in Nairobi's water supply development
since 1970 (see para. 1.24), through the Nairobi First and Second Water
Supply Projects. The need for the third expansion phase of Nairobi's water
supply was already clearly identified during the appraisal of the Second
Project in 1977. At that time, following a redesign and rephasing of the
project, it proved economical to defer construction of an expensive dam and
storage reservoir for about 10 years. Notwithstanding the full benefits of
the Second Project and achievement of a reasonable level of operational
efficiency, the city was expected to experience water shortages beyond
1987/88. NCC, in consultation with MLGPP and MWD, decided in 1984 that a
short-term plan (to meet the demand up to 1995) and a long-term plan had to
be prepared for the expansion of water supply to Nairobi and its environs,
followed by a phased implementation of these development plans. As the
extraction from the present water sources in the Chania-Kimakia-Thika River
system will approach the upper extraction limit to satisfy the short-term
demands by about 2005, the necessity to plan for an integrated utilization
of all the regional water resources to satisfy the longer-term needs of
Nairobi City and all other regional users was recognized.
3.03     The Government requested IDA assistance for the financing of the
studies for a phased development of Nairobi's water supply and for the
preparation of the engineering designs of the short-term expansion in May,
1984, preceded by a PPF advance to facilitate the timely commencement of
the consultancy work. The PPF advance of US$1.0 million was approved on
July 31, 1984 and the Nairobi Third Water Supply Engineering Credit (1566-
KE) of SDR 6.2 million was approved on April 15, 1985.
3.04     The Engineering Credit provided for the preparation of the Third
Nairobi Water Supply Project including feasibility studies for the short-
term expansion of the water supply system and also for the development of a
long-term regional water resource management program, detailed engineering
designs, preparation of bid documents and evaluation of bids, assistance to
NCC/WSD in the improvement of the Nairobi City distribution system and for
the assessment of Nairobi's sewerage and sanitation needs. In addition, it
included support for the institutional development and strengthening of
NCC/WSD's operational and financial performance through technical
assistance, training, and improvement to NCC's computer installation. The
implementation of a tariff increase of 40% for water and sewerage services,
covenanted under the Development Credit Agreement significantly improved
WSD's financial position.



- 12 -
3.05     The preparation of the technical project components, based on the
design horizon of 1995 for the Nairobi Third Water Supply Project, was
carried out satisfactorily and with only minor delays. However, NCC/WSD's
institutional development stagnated in the period 1984-86 until the present
management of WSD took over in January, 1987. WSD's financial base also
deteriorated until the approval and effective implementation of the new
water and sewerage tariffs. The implementation of the proposed changes in
WSD's organizational structure, the filling of the vacant higher level
posts in the WSD and the updating of NCC/WSD's accounts did not take place
on time due to indecision by NCC/WSD and lack of adequate Government
support. In order to avoid further slippage of the Project which would
have caused serious water shortages in Nairobi from the early 1990s,
Government gave priority to the Project from mid-1987. The Bank
preparation mission in December 1987 prepared an action program and a list
of requirements and prerequisites for the Project appraisal (see Annex 1).
Since then, significant improvement took place (some of the most important
vacancies have been filled, efforts were made to strengthen WSD's Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), and accounting consultants were employed to
update NCC/WSD's accounts and to prepare WSD's financial projections). Due
to an immediate improvement program implemented under the Engineering
Credit a dramatic improvement took place in reducing the unaccounted for
water through leak detection, rehabilitation of distribution network,
improve pressure zoning and improving the meter reading, billing and
collection system. The Project was preappraised in April 1988. The formal
appraisal of the Project (jointly with the prospective cofinanciers) took
place during June/July 1988.
3.06     During the December 1987 preparation mission NCC/WSD proposed to
change the planning horizon of the Project from 1995 to 2000-2005. Due to
the delays in the preparation of the Project, commencement of
implementation was likely to slip from 1987 to 1989, and considering a four
to five year construction period, substantial completion of the project
(i.e. availability of additional water for Nairobi) was to be expected by
1994. This would imply that demand would exceed supply within one year,
and construction for a next extension should start almost immediately after
the completion of the third extension phase. The Bank (and the
cofinanciers) agreed to the proposal, and the work to redesign some parts
of the Project (notably to increase the capacity of the Ngethu Water
Treatment Plant and the transmission mains) started in early 1988, together
with the reassessment of the environmental impact of the project and
preparation of an environmental action plan. The design modifications
(substantially completed by end-March 1988) increased the Project cost by
about 10%, in spite of deferring the proposed distribution network
extension in the not yet developed areas in Nairobi.
3.07     The need for the extension to the Dandora Sewage Treatment Plant,
simultaneously or before the proposed extension to the water supply system,
was recognized already in 1984-85. NCC/WSD's efforts to secure the
financing for this work failed and finally Government and NCC/WSD requested
the inclusion of the Dandora Plant extension under the proposed Project.
The Bank (and the co-financiers) have agreed and the approximately US$30
million component is now part of the proposed Project.



- 13 -
Population Proiections
3.08     In terms of future development, the rapid growth of overall
population and the need for balanced rural-urban growth are among Kenya's
most pressing problems, which in turn generate an ever increasing demand
for food, housing, employment and social infrastructure facilities. The
analysis of the present and future population patterns in Nairobi is
extremely important for the definition of urban infrastructure needs.
3.09     Population forecasts for Nairobi have been based on:
(a) Interpretation of historic trends, with particular reference
to the 1962, 1969 and 1979 census data;
(b) "Population Projections for Kenya 1980-2000" published by the
Central Bureau of Statistics in March 1983. This is accepted
as the official national plan. It provides projections by
districts, including Nairobi, up to 1990, assuming constant
fertility and mortality. The report also projects national
population up to 2000 under three alternative scenarios: a
decline in fertility and mortality (low), constant fertility
and mortality (medium), and fertility remaining constant with
mortality continuing to decline (high). In the medium term,
the district projections up to 1990 offer the most
comprehensive set of projections currently available; and
(c) Analysis of future urban development of Nairobi; using urban
planning and land use data and plans, comparing them with
actual development, and analyzing and producing population
forecast by residential categories.
In 1985, Nairobi had a population of 1.2 million with a growth rate of 5.3%
a year and accounting for 5.7% of the national population. Population
density in Nairobi has more than doubled in the last 20 years from 744
persons per km2 in 1969 to 1699 persons per km2 in 1985. The end-1987
population is estimated at 1.3 million.
3.10     The following table shows the medium population projections in
Nairobi. For comparison, the total urban population and the total
population of Kenya are also shown:

Nairobi is projected to increase to about 2 million in 1995 and 3.9 million
in 2010, at an average growth rate of 5.3% per annum to 1995, then falling
to 4.7% per annum to 2010. In comparison to the national population
projection, Nairobi's proportion to the total will continue to increase
from 5.7% in 1985 to 6.4% in 1995 and 7.4% in 2010. However, as a
proportion of the indicative national urban projections, Nairobi is
expected to decline from 32% in 1985 to 29% in 1995 and 25% in 2010. These
projections are in line with the Government's policy of developing
secondary urban centers and relieving some of the pressure on Nairobi.
This policy is supported by the Bank and is complemented by the
Government's District Focus Policy which seeks to encourage the development
of rural areas.
3.11     The low, medium and high population projections for Nairobi are
given in the following table (and presented graphically in Annex 2).

While by 1995, the range of projections show the population closely around
the 2 million mark, the spread widens to 3.4 to 4.6 million by the year
2010.  In this report the medium projection is used and represents a
reduction in the expected size of the city compared to projections
presented in other reports before the 1979 census. For example, the
Nairobi Metropolitan Growth Strategy (NMGS) (1973) projected the city's
population at 2.9 to 4.2 million by the year 2000.
3.12     Urban planning in Nairobi is still largely guided by the NMGS.
However, the progress of implementation has not kept pace with the proposed
program because:
Mi)    Population growth has been slower than predicted in the 1973
Urban Master Plan;
(ii)    Population densities have increased in well established
areas;
(iii)    The city has lacked sufficient financial resources and
organizational capacity;
(iv)    The city boundary has not been extended; and
(v)    Housing construction has not been able to keep pace with
demand which in turn has led to increasing growth of shanty
areas like Kibera and Mathare Valley.
In order to assess water requirements, water demand in Nairobi needed to be
analyzed in more detail, with breakdown by area and household income level.
As a current land use map was not available for Nairobi, the engineering
consultants prepared one. In general terms, the growth of the city is
expected to follow the historic lines of development, in close proximity to
major infrastructure (e.g. roads and water supply) and centers of
employment. In the low to medium income groups, population growth will
accelerate in the west (Dagoretti), the east (Dandora and beyond), and the



- 16 _
north east (along the road to Thika). In the medium to high income groups,
the main growth points will be in the south west (Karen-Langata), in the
north (Kitisuru), and the coffee estates within the city boundary which are
gradually making way for residential development. The population
projections by residential category are presented below (medium
projection):
Residential Category         Population (1000's)      Distribution (%)
1985  1995  2010        1985  1995  2010
Rl   - High Income             139   225   384          12    11      10
R2   - Medium Income           289   479   901          25    25      23
R3   - Low Income              500   888 2,114          43    46      55
R4   - Poor Settlements
and shanty areas       234   358   461           20    18      12
TOTAL        1,162 1,950 3,860         100   100    100
The projections indicate that as Nairobi continues to grow, an increasing
proportion of the population will be in the R3 low income group, and a
significant decline will occur in the R4 category. The above projections
are based on the assumption that substantial urban upgrading projects will
take place, especially in Dagoretti in the medium- and long-term in line
with the developments specified in the Structure Plan for the area. If
this does not happen, there is a possibility that a significant proportion
of Dagoretti's future population will still be accommodated in R4 type
housing. This would in turn have an impact on the water demand
projections, as substandard housing does not qualify for individual plot
connections, and consumption per capita per day remains lower.
3.13     Since it is highly doubtful that the dramatic improvement in the
housing situation, as implied in the table above, is realistic, it is
necessary to consider other, less optimistic scenarios, and their impact on
the water demand projections. This will be discussed under the following
section on water demand projections.
Water Demand Projections
3.14     According to 1984 meter records, the water consumption pattern in
Nairobi is as follows:
Category      Percentage
Domestic            63
Commercial          16
Industrial           8
Institutional       11
NCC/WSD              2
TOTAL      100
These figures refer to billed consumption. In order to match demand with
production, allowances for unaccounted-for water have to be made in any
water supply system.



_ 17 -
3.15     In the analysis of current water consumption and the projection of
future consumption, several important adjustments have been made by the
engineering consultants to the basic data, together with certain critical
assumptions. Firstly, a certain proportion of domestic consumption is
concealed in the commercial, industrial and public categories. This has
been separated out through an examination of available billing records.
Secondly, 1984 was a year in which there were water production cutbacks
because of drought and supply constraints within the distribution system.
Therefore, 1984 was a year in which real demand was constrained, despite
the fact that additional water from the Nairobi Second Water Supply Project
was available. Thirdly, unaccounted-for-water had risen to an unacceptably
high 40% of normal production in 1985/86. Since then, losses have been
considerably reduced due to the immediate improvement program under the
engineering credit (presently to about 30%). In the projections it has
been assumed that unaccounted-for-water will be reduced to 25% by FY92/93
and to 20-22% by 2005. Fourthly, it is estimated that about 90% of the
current population in Nairobi is served by the mains systems. By 1995 it
is assumed that this will rise to 95% and remains constant thereafter.
3.16     Domestic Consumption.  The population served by the mains water
supply system is projected in the following table, in five yearly steps for
each residential category up to year 2010. However, as mentioned in para.
3.12, the consultant's assumption about urban upgrading may be overly
optimistic (i.e. the ratio R3/R4 too high), and therefore a sensitivity
analysis was carried out comparing the following assumptions:
(i)    Worst scenario:  no low cost housing development will take
place, i.e. R3 = constant and R3/R4 decreasing over time.
(ii)    No change in relative poverty, i.e. R3/R4 = constant.
(iii)    Major housing development (Consultants' projection ): R3/R4
increasing over time.

(Medium projection)              1,162  1,505  1,950  2,490  3,100  3,860
Total Population Served (1000) 1,035  1,385  1,853  2,365  2,946  3,667
Total Domestic Demand (1000 m3/day)
(i)  R3 = constant           81.1  109.6  153.7  200.2  248.7  307.0
(ii)  R3/R4 = constant        81.1  114.9  165.5  219.6  282.0  359.8
(iii)  Consultants'            81.1  115.9  167.5  225.0  291.8  377.2
Projection
Case (i) is probably overly pessimistic, since private sector response to
housing demand is expected to cover at least part of the slum upgrading
requirements. Case (ii) implies that the low-cost housing development in
Nairobi will at least be adequate to maintain the current relative housing



- 18 -
situation. However, in absolute terms, the poor settlements and slum areas
will still be growing, accommodating 3 1/2 times the present population by
2010, and the population of the low-cost housing areas will likewise be
over 3 1/2 times the 1985 population. This would require a robust but less
unrealistic housing program: assuming an average of 6 persons per housing
unit, about 6,000 housing units in the R3 category will have to be built
annually in Nairobi in the next 10 years and over 10,000 units per annum
after the year 2000. Case (ii) has been adopted as somewhat more realistic
in calculating the demand (and financial) projections. Since the per
capita consumption in R4 is projected to be substantially lower than in R3,
this adjustment reduces the water demand from the consultants' somewhat
high projections. In terms of variations in total demand, if case (i)
rather than case (ii) would occur, demand would be 8.8% less in 2000 and
11.8% less in 2005. In case the consultants' projections materialized,
case (ii) would require 2.3% more water in 2000 and 3.5% more in 2005.
Details are shown in Annex 3.
3.17     In addition, it has to be noted that the present per capita
consumption in the poor settlements (and slum areas) are unacceptably low,
only about 15 l.p.c.d. In the projections this is assumed to increase to
20 l.p.c.d. by 1990, 25 l.p.c.d. by 1995, 30 l.p.c.d. by 2000 and after.
This rate of increase should be accelerated to improve the basic needs
provision and the health situation (see para 5.15).
3.18     Commercial Demand.  Present commercial consumption is concentrated
in the Central Business District, the Industrial Area, the hotel area to
the east of Uhuru Highway and parts of Eastleigh. It has been assumed
(like in the previous projections: World Bank (1976), WSD (1977)) that the
demand will grow in line with Nairobi's economic activities. On this basis
5.5% and 6.0% growth rates per annum have been adopted for 1985-95 and
1995-2010, respectively (medium projection). Details are shown in Annex 3.
3.19     Industrial Water Demand.  In the absence of an up-to-date
industrial census, the conventional method of measuring industrial
consumption in terms of m3 per hectare has been adopted by the engineering
consultants with some adjustments to reflect the existence of known large
consumers.  The present consumption (m3/hectare) varies considerably
between the various industrial areas. In the City Industrial Area water
consumption is low at about 7 m3/ha/day, which illustrates the fact that
many of the industries can be classified as dry. In contrast, the Ruaraka
Industrial Area uses up to 27 m3/ha/day, due largely to the Breweries'
consumption; because the area is not yet fully developed, unit consumption
is likely to rise as more industries become established in the area. The
other industrial areas are in the early stages of development and therefore
current water consumption is relatively low. The projections reflect the
general trend of employment in each area. In the City Industrial Area the
rate of increase in water consumption is assumed to decrease from 1995 as
greater emphasis is given to the development of areas like Dandora, Ruaraka
and Kassarani for medium and heavy industries, away from the Old City and
the already congested City Industrial Area. Annex 3 shows the detailed
projected industrial demand.



- 19 -
3.20     Institutional Water Consumption.  It has been assumed that
increases in institutional (public) water consumption will reflect the rate
of growth in population. It is to be noted that some Government
departments and establishments will be dispersed to areas outside the
capital, in line with the strategy of encouraging the development of
secondary urban centers in other regions. A summary of projected water
consumption by institutions is shown in Annex 3.
3.21     Summary of the projected water demand (medium projection) for the
Nairobi area is as follows:
Year        Water Demand at source (1000 m3/day)l
1985                          226.3
1990                          252.3
1995                          345.9
2000                          452.4
2005                          580.5
2010                          752.2
Annex 4 presents the demand projections graphically and in comparison with
previous World Bank and NCC projections.
Project Objectives
3.22      The objectives of the proposed Project are to augment and secure
the water supply to Nairobi, through the expansion of source works by the
construction of a new dam/reservoir and to expand Nairobi's water supply
system to cater for the increased demand. The additional capacity would
meet Nairobi's demands up to about 2003-2005, and will improve the basic
needs provision and health conditions of the urban poor by expanding the
coverage of the piped water supply to low income groups. The extension of
the Dandora sewage treatment plant will assist in maintaining the
sanitation standards in the city and to decrease the pollution in the
recipient rivers. The Project provides for environmental control and
mitigating measures in the relocation of the affected population.
3.23      The Project also provides for training and technical assistance
to improve the operational and financial efficiency of NCC/WSD.
Water Resource Development
3.24      As presented in para. 3.21 and Annex 4, the water demand at
source is presently (1988) about 240,000 to 245,000 m3/day, compared to
source availability of 194,200 m3/day at 98 percent reliability and 217,200
m3/day at 90 percent reliability. The last major water shortages in
Nairobi occurred in 1984/85 (in spite of the completion of Phase II of the
Chania Scheme under the Second Nairobi Water Supply Project) due to severe
drought and extremely high unaccounted-for-water (physical losses) in the
system. There is still a considerable suppressed demand in Nairobi, but
1/ Assuming that the ratio of the population in low cost residential areas
and in the poor settlements (R3/R4) remains constant (water demand
projection, case (ii)).



- 20 -
with the return of average or above average annual rainfall, water
availability at the (run-of-river) sources was above average. In addition,
the Dagoretti area is not fully served by the city's water distribution
system (about 50,000 to 60,000 people may be dependent on well water).
Also, the demand in Kitisuri is mostly met by private sources, together
with a considerable part of the industrial demand.
3.25      In spite of the better than expected supply situation in the past
two years, it is apparent that Nairobi is at the beginning of a period when
water shortages with growing severity and frequency are likely to occur
unless a further expansion in the system takes place (see graph in Annex
4).
3.26      The total demand in the study area of greater Nairobi will be
about 11 m3/sec by 1995, which exceeds the estimated capacity of all run-
of-river flows (about 8.2 m3/sec in total) but could be satisfied by 30% of
mean annual runoff provided more storage is introduced into the system.
Storage already exists at Sasumua and Ruiru Dams, but together these yield
only 0.9 m3/sec. The local demand in most sub-areas of the study area can
just about be satisfied by run-of-river flows until 1995-2000, with the
exception of Nairobi itself. To ensure satisfactory supply, major storage
should be provided to supplement the present sources.
3.27      Since the late 1970s several studies were carried out on the
selection of the best possible dam site(s) and combination of sources for
an optimized and integrated system. On the basis of the previous studies
of 26 sites (and source combinations), seven alternatives were selected for
more detailed studies as part of the preparation of the Project. Since
none of the seven sites could supply water up to 2010 (the long-term
planning horizon), fifteen different combination of dams on these sites
were examined. Inter-catchment transfers were allowed for where
appropriate. Of the best seven combinations, three had Thika 6 Dam as the
first stage (giving priority to the supply of Nairobi), and four had
Ndaguru 1 as the first stage. The best two alternatives both commenced
with Thika 6. The comparisons were based on technical and cost comparisons
(including capital and operating costs). Sensitivity tests confirmed that
the order of ranking was unchanged over a wide range of variation of
capital cost, discount rates, etc. The result of the studies confirmed
that the Thika 6 Dam was the optimum next source development. The
utilization of this source (water extraction right) was approved by WAB.
Proiect Components
3.28      The Project would consist of the following parts:
A. Water Supply Component
1.    Source Works
(i)    Construction of a new dam on the Thika River at Ndakaini,
about 50 km north of Nairobi (rolled earthfill dam of 63 m
maximum height and volume of 2.34 million m3, impounding a
reservoir volume of 70 million m3).



- 21 -
(ii)    Construction of access roads, raw water intakes, transmission
tunnels and main, comprising:
. Thika-Kiama Tunnel, of 1.1 km length and 2.5 m diameter;,
. Kiama diversion weir to collect the Thika and Kiama waters
and divert them into the next tunnel section;
. Kiama-Chania Tunnel of 3.6 km and 2.5 m diameter;
. Kimakia weir and shaft to divert and drop Kimakia water
into the tunnel passing below.
The Chania-Mataare Tunnel, constructed under the Second
Project is of adequate size to pass the waters diverted from
the Thika-Kiama-Kimakia system with only minor modifications
at the existing Mwagu weir intake.
. Mataara-Ngethu new pipeline (10 km, dia 1100 mm) to
increase the capacity of the existing 1400 mm dia main to
the treatment plant.
2.   Extension of the Water Supply System
(i)    Extension of the water treatment plant at Ngethu to increase
its total capacity from about 180,000 m3/day to 460,000
m3/day;
(ii)    Construction of treated water transmission main of
approximately 36 km length and of 1300 to 1400 mm diameter
from Ngethu to the Kiambu and Gigiri terminal reservoirs;
(iii)    Distribution system extensions, including additional
reservoirs (increasing the storage capacity by 46,000 m3 to a
total of 224,000 m3 or 50% of the average daily consumption
in 2005) and the construction of the Gigiri-pumping station;
(iv)    Instrumentation, control and automation;
(v)    Staff housing and offices.
B. Sewage Treatment Plant Extension
1.   Rehabilitation and extension of the Dandora Sewage Treatment Plant
(Phase II extension) to a total capacity of about 90,000 m3/day
dry weather flow;
2.   Staff housing, offices and amenity building.
C. Improvement of Water Supply and Waste Disposal Facilities in Low Income
(R3 and R4) Residential Areas
1.   Vehicles, water meters and miscellaneous equipment.
2.   Construction of infilling mains, public water points, water
selling kiosks, and improvements to sanitation facilities.



- 22 -
D. Engineering and Construction Supervision:
1.   Provision of consultancy services for detailed engineering
designs, construction supervision and for the Dam and Tunnel
Safety Panel.
2.   Provision of consultancy services for the updating and preparation
of a Sewerage and Sanitation Master Plan.
E. Technical Assistance and Training for NCC/WSD including:
1.   Provision for management staff support (salaries and benefits).
2.   Provision for implementation of a training program, including:
(i)   training consultancy services;
(ii)   purchase of training materials and equipment;
(iii)   technical, financial and managerial training courses in Kenya
and abroad; and
(iv)   purchase of office technology equipment.
3.   Implementation of an appropriate "self accounting" system
including asset valuation for WSD (consultancy services, materials
and equipment); and
4.   Implementation of an environmental action program (consultancy
services and equipment).
Location of the various sites are shown on Map (IBRD 21208).
Cost Estimates
3.29     The total Project cost is estimated at Ksh 3,683.9 million
(US$216.7 million equivalent), of which Ksh 2,107.7 million (US$124.0
million) or about 57% is the foreign exchange component. Local taxes are
estimated at about Ksh 182.2 million and are included in the cost
estimates. However, all taxes and duties on imported goods are to be
exempted by Government from payment by NCC/WSD and are therefore not
included in the cost estimates. Base costs are expressed in January 1989
prices. Summary project cost estimates are shown in Table 3.1 and detailed
cost estimates are given in Annex 5.
3.30     Project costs were estimated by WSD and its engineering
consultants on the basis of detailed engineering designs for civil works
and recent quotations for equipment purchases. The land cost is the
estimated purchase price for land proposed to be acquired including
compensation costs for crops and structures. The engineering and
supervision costs are estimated at about 4% and 6% of civil works for water



- 23 -
and sewerage components, respectively. Technical assistance, training and
management staff support cost estimates are based on recent actual costs
for similar activities. The consultant and advisory services to be
provided by individual specialists are estimated to require about 240 man-
months in total, including 120 man-months of foreign and 120 man-months of
local consultants. Physical contingencies are estimated at 20% for the dam
and tunnel construction, at 15% for the other civil works and equipment for
the water supply component and at 10% for the civil works and equipment for
the sewage treatment plant extension. Price contingencies for local
currency costs are based on expected increases in construction costs of 8%
in 1988 and 5% per annum thereafter. The corresponding rates for foreign
costs are 3% per annum in 1988-90 and 4% per annum thereafter. In total,
physical contingencies are estimated at about 15% of base cost, and price
contingencies are estimated at about 14% of base cost plus physical
contingencies.

3.31     The Project cost estimate prepared by the engineering consultants
was originally based on a four-year Project implementation period and
totalled US$202 million equivalent. As this program did not allow for any
slippage in project start-up and implementation, the project cost was
recalculated on the basis of a six-year implementation period totalling
US$216.7 million equivalent. It should be noted that one donor, OECF,
recalculated the cost of the raw and treated water mains (which they intend
to finance) in accordance with their own regulations and the result was
2.6% lower than the Bank's estimate. This was considered negligible and
the Bank's estimate was accepted for the purposes of the Project financing
plan.
Project Financing
3.32     The proposed IDA Credit of US$64.8 million (Ksh 1,101.6 million
equivalent) would finance about 30% of the total Project cost (equivalent
to about 32% of total Project cost net of local taxes). The remaining 70%
of total project cost would be provided by NCC/WSD from internal cash
generation (Ksh 929.9 million or 25%), by the Kenyan Government as a
budgetary allocation for land acquisition (Ksh 57.8 million or 2%), and the
balance (Ksh 1,594.6 million or 43%) by other cofinancing sources including
the African Development Bank/Fund (AfDB/AfDF), the European Investment Bank
(EIB), and the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). NCC/WSD
would finance interest during construction amounting to Ksh 787.5 million
and any loan shortfalls. The financing plan for the Project is summarized
below in Table 3.2 and detailed by component in Annex 6. Submission of
satisfactory evidence that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of
the loans from the co-financiers have been fulfilled would be a condition
of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.  Since NCC/WSD has already paid Ksh 50
million to the Commissioner of Lands to expedite land acquisition,
agreement was obtained during negotiations that Government would reimburse
NCC/WSD for land acquisition/compensation costs associated with the Project
by June 30, 1991.

3.33     The IDA Credit and loans from other cofinanciers would be made to
the Republic of Kenya (ROK) and on-lent to NCC/WSD. The IDA credit would
be made for a period of 35 years, including 10 years grace, at the standard
IDA service charge. The OECF loan would be made at an interest rate of
2.5% for a period of 30 years, including 10 years grace. About half the
contribution from the AfDB would be made on concessional terms, at 0.75%
service charge for a period of 50 years, including 10 years grace, and the
other half would be made on AfDB terms, at the standard variable interest
rate (currently 7.4%) for a period of 21 years, including 6 years grace.
The EIB loan would be made at an interest rate of 5% for a period of 20
years, including 5 years grace. All loans from cofinanciers were
negotiated prior to negotiations of the proposed IDA Credit. The terms of
the loans from other cofinanciers were confirmed during negotiations.
3.34     The IDA Credit would be on-lent to NCC/WSD at the IBRD interest
rate prevailing at the time of negotiations (7.65%) for a period of 21
years, including 6 years grace. The proposed interest rate is in
accordance with terms of the prior IDA Credit and with normal government
practice which currently requires loans to be provided to local government
authorities and parastatals at interest rates of 6-10%. The maturity of 21
years allows for a 6 year grace period corresponding to the construction
period of the Project and a repayment period of 15 years. The foreign
exchange risk of the IDA credit would be borne directly by ROK (indirectly
by NCC through the differential between the service charge to ROK and the
on-lending interest rate). The on-lending terms of the IDA credit were
agreed during negotiations. The on-lending terms of other cofinanciers
would be available upon finalization of their respective subsidiary loan
agreements, and are expected to include an average interest rate of about
10-11% with a maturity of about 20-21 years, including a grace period of
about 5-6 years.



- 27 -
3.35     Retroactive financing of the order of about SDR 3.0 million
(US$4.0 million equivalent) would be permitted for expenditures incurred
from April 1, 1989 for construction supervision associated with the
intakes, tunnels and access roads (financed by EIB) and civil works
associated with extension of the water and sewage treatment plants and
construction of treated water reservoirs. This would facilitate
construction of major works before the onset of the peak rainy season and
thus expedite Project implementation.
Implementation
3.36     The Water and Sewerage Department (WSD) of the Nairobi City
Commission would be responsible for implementation of the Project, and
would retain engineering consultants for construction supervision and for
the detailed civil engineering and structural design of the water treatment
plant extension.
3.37     Engineering consultants would also be retained for the
updating/preparation of the sewerage and sanitation master plan, and
specialized consultants would be employed to assist in the preparation and
implementation of a training program, environmental action program,
management information system and valuation of fixed assets.
3.38     The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of WSD has been improved
(see para 4.09). Further strengthening of this unit through appropriate
training would be provided under the Project. The Project would also
provide staff support for NCC's Computer Manager during the project
implementation period.
3.39     Project implementation would begin in mid-1989, with priority to
the development of the new run-of-the-river abstractions and the tunnel to
ensure early increase of source availability. The project implementation
schedule is shown on Annex 16.
Procurement
3.40     Procurement of the IDA financed construction and supply contracts
with a value exceeding US$1.0 million equivalent 2 would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts for vehicles and
equipment to cost less than the equivalent of US$200,000 each up to an
aggregate value of US$600,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding (LCB). Contracts for goods (office technology

equivalent of US$20,000 each up to an aggregate amount not to exceed of
US$300,000 may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of local
shopping or contracting. All contracts with a value above US$100,000
equivalent should be subject to review by the Association.
3.41     Construction supervision will be carried out by consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Association. Such consultants shall be selected in
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Association
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank
in August 1981. NCC/WSD and the cofinanciers have requested the Bank that
the engineering consultants who carried out the feasibility studies and
detailed engineering designs, Howard Humphreys (water supply component for
a total of US$6.5 million equivalent) and Sir Alexander Gibb (sewage
treatment plant extension component for a total of US$2.5 million
equivalent) should be retained for the supervision of construction, to
facilitate the timely commencement and execution of the works. The cost of
construction supervision of the respective components are estimated at
US$9.3 million and US$1.7 million equivalent.  This request seems
justified. Both consultants were employed by NCC/WSD since the mid 1970s,
during the previous extension phases of Nairobi's water supply and sewerage
system and carried out their assignments satisfactorily.
3.42     In order to assist in carrying out the training component and the
environmental action program, and for the introduction of the self
accounting system for WSD, NCC will employ specialists and consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment
shall be satisfactory to the Association. Such consultants shall be
selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the
Association on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published
by the Bank in August 1981.
3.43     The General Procurement and Prequalification Notice was published
in October 1987 which called for prequalification for 13 contracts. The
response was substantial: a total of 127 companies from 22 countries
submitted applications. Sixty applicants prequalified for the eight, Bank-
financed contracts (their number varying between 9 and 18 for each
contract). The bid period has been scheduled for May through November,
1989.

Disbursement
3.45     The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:
(i)    100% of foreign and 30% of local expenditures on all major
civil works and supply contracts;
(ii)    100% of total expenditures for instrumentation, control and
automation;
(iii)    100% of foreign and 90% of local expenditures for training
materials and equipment, and office technology equipment;
(iv)    100% of foreign and 70% of local expenditures for vehicles,
water meters and other equipment, and infilling mains, public
water points and improvement to sanitation facilities; and
(v)    100% of foreign and 60% of local expenditures for
consultants' and advisory services.
(vi)    100% of total expenditures for training costs and management
staff support.
The Disbursement Schedule is given in Annex 7 and the Schedule of
Withdrawal of Proceeds of the Credit by category in Annex 8. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by the Credit Closing Date
of June 30, 1996.
3.46     Disbursements would be made against standard IDA documentation.
Disbursements for goods and services would be made against Statements of
Expenditure for each contract and purchase order with a value not exceeding
US$50,000 equivalent. All items costing less than US$50,000 equivalent
would be prefinanced by the Borrower and the minimum size of withdrawal
applications to be submitted to the Association would have to be in excess
of US$50,000 equivalent. In order to ensure quick processing of
disbursement requests from all cofinanciers, NCC/WSD reached agreement with
the Ministry of Finance and MLGPP on the disbursement procedures and
information requirements for the Project. During negotiations confirmation
was obtained from Government and NCC/WSD regarding the disbursement
procedures and information requirements for the Project.
3.47     Disbursements by the cofinanciers would be on a parallel basis and
would be carried out as follows:
AfDB/AfDF 100% of foreign cost and 22% of local cost
(Construction of Thika Dam)



- 31 -
EIB       100% of foreign and local cost
(Construction of Intakes, Tunnels and Access Roads)
OECF      100% of foreign cost and 59% of local cost.
(Supply and construction of raw and treated water
mains).
Dam and Tunnel Safety Aspects
3.48     An independent panel of experts reviewed the design of the dam and
the tunnel in December 1987 and found it acceptable with minor
modifications. The Panel would inspect the dam during construction and
also after completion, as required.
Environmental Aspects
3.49     The environmental aspects of the Project (including relocation and
socio-economic aspects) were reviewed during the December 1987 preparation
mission by a Bank environmentalist and an ecologist consultant. The
mission reviewed the consultant's report on environmental considerations
and discussed its findings with the relevant Kenyan authorities. It has
been concluded that the proposed Project will present no major
environmental problems during the Project's lifetime if all the necessary
controls are implemented.
3.50     The present policy of the Government of Kenya is to limit
compensatory measures to cash payments connected with land acquisition.
The policy of the Bank is that borrowers should be assisted to ensure that
the population affected by the Project will regain at least their previous
standard of living after the Project, that environmental costs are avoided
or mitigated wherever possible, and that the project includes compensation
measures for unavoidable impacts. To comply with the Bank's policy and
Government's requirements, WSD prepared an appropriate environmental action
program which was discussed during negotiations.
3.51     The environmental action program was prepared on the basis of
mutually acceptable guidelines. Additional data collection has been
carried out in the following areas:
(a)       Socio-economic characteristics of the population
directly and indirectly affected by the Project, and
(b)       Additional data on the physical environment both
upstream and downstream of the proposed dam (in addition
to the consultants' report of June 1986).
3.52     The directly affected population includes about 150 households,
most of whom reside in the reservoir area. The directly affected
population has been enumerated by NCC/WSD in collaboration with the
Commissioner of Lands (Ministry of Lands and Settlement) as part of the
land acquisition process. It includes all households which will lose all
or part of their land. Only about 50 families will actually be displaced
from their homes.



- 32 -
3.53     The socio-economic survey also included an inventory of the public
and commercial facilities (shops, schools, health posts, government
offices, processing plants, other local industries, etc.) in the five small
centers in the vicinity of the construction area. The purpose of this
inventory was to assess probable short-term and long-term impacts on
community development deriving from the planned construction activity and
from future uses of the dam and reservoir.
3.54     Based on the Terms of Reference and the additional studies (para
5.21) NCC/WSD submitted an Environmental Action Program (EAP) during
negotiations (Annex 9). This was discussed in detail and agreement was
reached regarding the principles and activities under the program.
Agreement was reached that NCC/WSD will submit detailed annexes to this
document by May 15, 1989 for review and shall commence the implementation
of an EAP, satisfactory to the Association, by January 1, 1990. The final
EAP, supplemented with the Annexes, was submitted for Bank review on May 2,
1989 and it was found to be fully satisfactory.

IV. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
4.01     The Borrower would be the Republic of Kenya which would pass on
the proceeds of the IDA Credit to the Nairobi City Commission (NCC), the
implementing agency on the terms stated in para 3.34. The implementing
unit within NCC would be the Water and Sewerage Department (WSD). NCC/WSD
was the recipient of two prior IBRD loans and an IDA credit for the First
and Second Nairobi Water Supply Engineering Projects (Loans 714-KE and
1520-KE) and the Third Nairobi Water Supply Engineering Project (Credit
1566-KE), respectively. NCC has demonstrated satisfactory administrative
capacity in completing these projects successfully.
Nairobi City Commission (NCC)
4.02     Nairobi City was incorporated in 1950.  Under local government
regulations, the MLGPP has broad control powers over NCC including approval
of budgets, appointment and dismissal of senior officers, approval of award
of contracts, etc.  The Town Clerk is the Chief Executive of NCC.  The
organizational structure of NCC is presented in Annex 10.
4.03     The NCC was appointed Water Undertaker for the Nairobi area on
February 25, 1959, the area of supply being subsequently extended during
the 1960s and again in 1974. The Water Act enables local authorities who
are water undertakers to make Water By-Laws. NCC produced by-laws in 1974,
updated recently in 1987, with detailed provisions related to water supply
and sewerage activities of the city including levying of fees and charges
for services provided. The responsibility for sewerage and sewage disposal
within the Nairobi City boundary was conferred on NCC by the Public Health
Act of 1921 and the Local Government Act of 1963.
Water and Sewerage Department (WSD)
Background and Organization
4.04     WSD was established in 1970 as a precondition for Loan 714-KE.
Previous to that, water supply and sewerage were the responsibility of
separate divisions of the City Engineering Department. WSD is headed by
the General Manager, who has two Deputy General Managers. The Deputy
General Manager (Commercial) is responsible for meter readings, billing and
all accounting and finance matters. The Deputy General Manager
(Engineering) is responsible for the preparation, planning, design and
construction of projects and for the operation and maintenance of the water
and sewerage systems. Some support services to WSD are provided by the
City Engineer (i.e. transport maintenance) and the City Treasurer (i.e.
financial, treasury and computer services). WSD's present organizational
chart is shown as Annex 11.

4.05     An Organization, Management and Finance (OMF) Study was carried
out under the Engineering Credit 1566-KE, with the aims of preparing (i) a
program of immediate corrective measures, and (ii) proposals for a proper
organizational structure, financial framework and tariff structure to
ensure a viable institution capable of providing water and sewerage
services to Nairobi and the wider study area up to the short-term planning
horizon (defined as 1995 at the time of the OMF Study). The report
revealed the current deficiencies in the organization, identifying areas
that need developing over the next five to ten years. Some of the
deficiencies identified are not constrained to organizational needs but
relate to institutional problems, e.g. inadequate salary scales, cash flow
problems, bureaucratic decision-making processes, poor financial control,
low staff morale, inflexible purchasing procedures and hence poor
management.
4.06     The recommended Action Program is presently being implemented in a
number of areas. For one, the proposed new organizational structure (Annex
12) has been accepted, with some minor changes which reflect the concerns
both by the Bank (and cofinanciers) and WSD about the importance of the
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and its place in the structure. Other
recommendations concerning financial and management improvements are also
being implemented.
4.07     For the long-term, the establishment of a single, autonomous water
and sewerage undertaking for Nairobi (Stage I) and for the wider study area
(Stage II) has been recommended in the OMF Study. It has been decided in
consultation with NCC/WSD and Government that the transformation of WSD
into a separate entity which would require tremendous additional effort in
many fields - political, legal, managerial, financial, etc. - would be
premature and counterproductive during the implementation of the proposed
Project. The technical assistance provided under the Project, however,
would strengthen WSD to achieve the operational and financial efficiency
and autonomy required prior to its establishment as a separate and fully
autonomous public corporation.
Staffing, Manpower Development and Training
4.08     Ever since its establishment, WSD has experienced serious
difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel to staff its organization. In
the early 1980s, the situation became very critical, mainly due to the non-
competitiveness of NCC's salary structure and general government freeze on
recruitment. The number of professional staff decreased steadily following
local staff resignations and departure of contract expatriate staff when
there has been a real need to increase both the number and calibre of staff
to cope with the increasing responsibilities. The responsibility for
recruitment, appointment, dismissal and promotion of staff alternated
between NCC and MLGPP. The recruitment freeze was relaxed early in 1984,
and the situation slightly improved at the lower management level. Since
August 1984, responsibility for the appointment of senior staff is now
vested in the Public Service Commission (a government body responsible for
all staff in the Civil Service). Since January 1987, the position of the
General Manager has been filled by secondment from MWD.



- 35 -
4.09     As a result of the slow progress in filling the most important
vacancies (at senior management level) and the consequent doubts about
WSD's ability to manage the implementationi of the proposed Project and to
devise the necessary financial and administrative control systems, the
joint Bank/donors mission in December 1987 set minimum staffing
requirements as prerequisites for the formal appraisal of the project (see
Annex 1). These requirements have now been largely met. The posts of the
Deputy General Manager (Commercial) and the Computer Manager were filled
and the staffing of the PIU is now adequate.
4.10     The OMF Study also identified immediate and long-term training
needs for WSD. However, further efforts were needed to identify and match
the needs with suitable training institutions both within the country and
abroad. NCC/WSD contracted with the Industrial Consultancy and Research
Unit (IRCU) of the University of Nairobi to prepare a detailed training
program. The training program which was reviewed and agreed upon during
negotiations is an expansion of the ongoing training activities which
include on-the-job and in-house training for mid- and lower level
professionals, workshops, seminars and refresher courses for mid- and top-
level managers. The core of the training program will be carried out using
IRCU's services, the Kenya Water Institute of the Ministry of Water
Development and the Kenya Polytechnic. In addition, to facilitate overseas
training the project will provide for the financing of graduate and
postgraduate courses in engineering, computer studies, accountancy, law,
and social studies, and specialized diploma courses in electronics,
telecommunication and instrumentation. The training program summarized in
Table 4.1 is designed as an integral part of WSD's long term institutional
building strategy, and provides a flexible framework for the training
activities. As a continuation of the present practice under the
engineering project NCC/WSD will submit quarterly progress reports during
the project implementation period for review by the Association. The
project will also provide for training materials and equipment to improve
the in-house training facilities.

Accounts and Audit
4.11     The Controller and Auditor-General is designated by legislation as
the auditor of the accounts of NCC, of which WSD is an integral part. As a
result of severe overloading of his limited staff, the audits of NCC and
WSD have been sub-contracted to a local firm of professional accountants
which prepares the interim audit reports. The private auditor reports to
the Controller and Auditor-General, who retains overall responsibility for
the audits and issues the final audit reports.
4.12     Audited financial statements for WSD/NCC required under prior Bank
and IDA-supported projects have been received consistently late by the
Association, due in recent years in part to delays within NCC/WSD in
processing financial information, to the departure of the WSD's Deputy
General Manager (Commercial) and other vacancies in WSD's accounting
department, to the requirement to report WSD's accounts on a commercial
basis, and to a change in reporting periods after 1984. The vacancies
within WSD have now largely been filled with competent staff, and the
slowdown in processing of financial information is currently being



- 37 -
addressed through improvements to the Computer Department (see para 5.13)
and instructions to WSD's accounting staff. Separate accounts for WSD are
currently maintained, prepared on an accrual basis and reported in a
commercial accounting format, in addition to the required local government
accounting format. Fixed assets have been revalued on an annual basis
using inflation indices as required under prior Bank-supported projects for
commercial rate of return calculations but have never been professionally
revalued at current replacement costs. In addition, no depreciation is
charged for the major portion of capital expenditure, since it is assumed
that the majority of fixed assets are externally funded and repayments of
principal are the equivalent of depreciation. In order to develop an up-
to-date inventory of WSD's gross and net fixed assets valued at current
replacement costs to permit WSD to prepare its accounts on a proper
commercial basis, consultancy assistance would be provided under the
Project to establish the current value of its gross and net fixed assets
and a method for annually revaluing its fixed assets. The first year that
WSD's accounts would be prepared utilizing the current value of its fixed
assets would be FY90/91. During negotiations agreement was obtained that
NCC/WSD retain consultants to carry out a valuation of WSD's gross and net
fixed assets by not later than end-FY89/90 and WSD would annually
thereafter revalue its fixed assets, using methods acceptable to the
Association.
4.13     The last audit of NCC/WSD's financial accounts was for FY84
(calendar year) and was heavily qualified. In particular, NCC was in
arrears in repayment of various loans, both local and foreign. NCC has
indicated that it has paid the overdue amounts on its foreign borrowings
but the payments on its local borrowings (primarily from the Ministry of
Local Government and Physical Planning (MLGPP)) are not being made because
MLGPP, as well as other government agencies, owe NCC even larger amounts
for their contributions in lieu of rates and water and sewerage charges.
In order to eliminate this serious qualification from future audit reports
of NCC, it will be necessary to formally offset or repay the inter-
governmental balances due. During negotiations agreement was obtained from
NCC and MLGPP that a plan of action for resolving this qualification to the
audit reports of NCC would be agreed with the Association.
4.14     NCC and WSD audit reports for FY85/86 (18 months) and FY86/87 (12
months) were overdue at the time of appraisal. Consultants were retained
by WSD to assist in preparation of final accounts, which are now complete
and have been audited by a private auditing firm, and NCC's accounts are
now also audited. The FY85/86 and FY86/87 NCC and WSD interim audit
reports of the private auditors were received by the Association prior to
negotiations of the proposed IDA Credit. NCC and WSD FY87/88 audit
reports, not yet overdue, would be expected to be received according to the
current covenanted requirements.
4.15     Although not required under past projects, a separate project
account would be prepared by WSD's PIU, and it would show all sources and
uses of funds for carrying out the Project. The project account would be
included in the audit of WSD's financial statements. During negotiations,
agreement was obtained that, beginning with the FY88/89 accounts, NCC and



- 38 -
WSD interim audit reports, including WSD's project account and financial
statements prepared in a commercial format, would be received by the
Association within nine months of the end of the financial year and the
final audit reports would be received within a further three months of the
submission of the interim reports. The Auditor's report would also express
a separate opinion on the use of SOE submitted during each fiscal year,
indicating that the procedure and internal controls involved are
satisfactory.
Billing and Collection
4.16     Meter readings are currently done monthly by WSD's meter readers
(about 80) and sent to the Computer Department for processing of bills.
Payments of bills are received at three cash offices of WSD. In order to
further expedite the collection process, WSD plans to establish an
additional six cash offices in the near future. Over 120,000 customers are
presently being billed, of which about 90,000 customers receive both water
and sewerage services.
4.17     WSD's billing is now up-to-date but has experienced a number of
problems in the recent past which contributed to deterioration of WSD's
collection performance. Critical staff and vehicle shortages in the meter
reading section, reduction of the work week from six to five days and lack
of flexibility to permit overtime for meter readers resulted in a meter
reading cycle of 60 days by December 1987. Together with delays in
billing, the lack of follow-up for customers (primarily government
ministries and parastatals) in arrears resulted in WSD's total accounts
receivable increasing to Ksh 249.6 million or 243 days of total billings as
of end FY86/87. WSD's newly (March 1988) installed Deputy General Manager
(Commercial) has focused on improving meter reading and collection
performance since his appointment. Thirty-three more meter readers have
been employed and four additional vehicles have been purchased which
permitted a reduction of the meter reading cycle to 34 days by mid-1988 and
is targetted to improve to 30 days shortly. Introduction of a new
computerized billing program (currently being installed and tested) is also
expected to contribute to faster processing. In addition, water supply for
a number of government ministries in arrears was disconnected mid-year, and
arrangements for payment are currently underway. The above improvements in
meter reading and billing and closer attention to follow-up of customers in
arrears is expected to reduce arrears to 90 days of total billings by the
end of the project period. During negotiations agreement was obtained that
WSD take actions necessary to reduce it water and sewerage accounts in
arrears to 210 days by end-FY90/91, 180 days by end-FY91/92, 150 days by
end-FY92/93, 120 days by end-FY93/94 and 90 days by end-FY94/95.

divided by average gross fixed assets in operation at beginning and end

b/ Reported on historical cost basis for FY85/86 and FY86/87
5.02     WSD's FY85/86 and FY86/87 financial statements demonstrate its
continued underlying viability. Consolidated water and sewerage net
operating income (before depreciation and interest) in FY85/86 (18 months)
amounted to KL 18.1 million and in FY86/87 (12 months) amounted to KL 15.3
million, representing an increase of 21% when equivalent 12-month periods



- 40 -
are compared. Operating expenses have been kept reasonably well under
control as demonstrated by the operating ratio (operating expenses divided
by operating revenues) which has declined to 43% in FY85/86 and to a
further 37% in FY86/87. Debt service coverage has been adequately high at
2.3 in FY85/86 and 3.1 in FY86/87 and was in excess of the prior covenanted
requirement of 1.5.  WSD's consolidated debt/reserve ratio of 47/67 at June
30, 1987 indicated a satisfactory capital structure. However, the
consolidated rate of return on gross revalued fixed assets in operation,
amounting to 5.6% in FY86/87, fell below the prior covenanted required
annual rate of 7.5%, due primarily to the lack of an increase in water and
sewerage tariffs since 1984. The recent water and sewerage tariff
increases introduced during FY87/88 (paras 5.05 and 5.06) are estimated to
restore rate of return performance to a satisfactory level beginning in
FY87/88.
5.03     WSD's main financial problem stems from cash flow problems
experienced by NCC. By law, NCC is responsible for making payments on
behalf of WSD. Because of the failure of a number of government agencies
to pay NCC rates and other charges and particularly to the non-receipt of
loans due from the Ministry of Finance for expenditures incurred in respect
of earlier projects, NCC's cash flow situation deteriorated during recent
years. As a result, NCC continued to borrow from the Water Fund, which was
established by law to account exclusively for all water and sewerage
revenues and expenditures, and the remaining cash in the Water Fund was
insufficient to pay all of WSD's suppliers and loan payments on time.
Furthermore, delays in reporting by NCC of WSD's payments made it
impossible for WSD to properly monitor its cash and expenditure
performance.
5.04     NCC's financial position is now improving as a result of an
increase in May 1988 in the property tax rate from 8% to 9% (the property
tax is NCC's primary source of revenue) and increases in the charges for
fees, fines and other revenues. Furthermore, introduction of an additional
source of revenue, the service charge, is expected to be approved shortly
which is estimated to provide revenues to NCC of a similar magnitude as the
property tax. NCC has already reduced its outstanding obligation to WSD
for monies borrowed from the Water Fund previously, from a high of Ksh 240
million as of end-1982 to about Ksh 50 million as of June 30, 1988. With
the recent increases in NCC's property tax rate and other charges, NCC is
not expected to borrow from the Water Fund in the future and to repay its
outstanding obligation. As a result, WSD's cash flow difficulties are
expected to be eliminated. During negotiations, agreement was obtained
that revenues deposited in WSD's Water Fund would be utilized solely for
recurrent and capital expenditures associated with water and sewerage
activities and that NCC repay half its outstanding obligation to WSD's
Water Fund by June 30, 1992 with the remainder by June 30, 1995.
Water and Sewerage Tariffs
5.05     Since the late 1970s, water and sewerage tariffs have been
increased from time to time to meet inflation and other cost increases and
have moved towards achieving prior covenanted rate of return obligations.
Since 1977, average water tariffs have increased from Ksh 2.60 per m3 to
Ksh 4.16 per m3 in 1982, representing an increase of about 60%, and to Ksh
5.55 per m3 in 1984, representing an increase of about 35%. During the



- 41 -
same period, sewerage charges (which are based on 75% of water consumption
billing for connected customers) have increased from Ksh 1.04 per m3 to Ksh
1.33 per m3 and again to Ksh 2.65 per m3. More recently, Government
approved average increases of 40% for both water and sewerage tariffs, with
a greater impact on larger customers, both industrial and residential, due
to concern about the low-income group. The increases were introduced in
August 1987 and March 1988 for the water and sewerage tariffs,
respectively.
5.06     The new tariff rates are summarized below:
Water
consumption
per month           Ksh/m3
0 - 9 m3               4
9 - 18 m3              6
18 - 30 m3              8
30 m3 and above        10
Sewerage: 75% of water consumption at the rate of Ksh3.71 per m3.
5.07     NCC/WSD and Government are aware that further water and sewerage
tariff increases will be required regularly to generate sufficient internal
funds to finance essential capital works, avoid cash-flow problems, provide
adequate debt service coverage and avoid large, lumpy tariff increases
later. During negotiations agreement was obtained that Government approve
regular tariff increases to ensure that WSD earns an annual rate of return
of 7.5% on consolidated gross fixed water supply and sewerage assets in
operation except for FY88/89 through FY91/92 for which a rate of return of
7.0% would be required. The impact of the tariff increases would be
analyzed at the end of each fiscal year to determine the rate and structure
of the next increase as well as the effect on the low-income group. It is
estimated that water and sewerage tariffs would only have to be increased
by the expected inflation rate, except for FY91/92 when a 5% real increase
is estimated to be required, in order to meet this requirement.
Future Financial Performance
5.08     Projections of WSD's financial performance over the period
FY87/88-FY97/98, including income statements, sources and applications of
funds statements and balance sheets, are shown in Annex 13. The
projections have been prepared on a conservative basis assuming that (a)
WSD would reduce its water and sewerage accounts receivables from about 240
days as of June 30, 1987 to about 90 days by the end of the project period;
(b) WSD would introduce, beginning in FY90/91, regular water and sewerage
tariff increases which will at least keep pace with inflation; (c) WSD
would reduce its unaccounted-for-water from an estimated 29% presently to
about 25% by the end of the project period; and (d) demand for water will
exceed the supply until the end of the project period when the available
water supply would increase to 455,200 cubic meters per day. Furthermore,
gross and net fixed assets would be valued according to current replacement
cost by end-FY89/90 and revalued annually using methods acceptable to the



- 42 -
Association. For the purposes of the projections, gross fixed assets have
been revalued annually using a domestic inflation index. In addition, it
has been assumed that the terms of all borrowed funds for the Project would
not exceed an average interest rate of 10%, with a maturity of 21 years
including a 6-year grace period.
5.09     The financial projections indicate that WSD's financial position
is expected to remain sound over the period. Interest coverage and the
current ratio would be maintained above adequate levels of 1.5 and 2.0,
respectively. Net operating income (before depreciation and interest)
would be sufficient to permit a rate of return on revalued gross fixed
assets averaging 7.9% for FY88/89 through FY97/98. Significant cash
balances would accumulate during the early project years which would be
required later on to support WSD's contribution of about US$54.7 million or
about 25% of the capital cost of the Project as well as the costs of its
other capital works. The operating ratio would increase to an average of
48% during project implementation, primarily as a result of introducing
proper depreciation of capital assets, but would decrease to a more
acceptable level of about 36% by end FY97/98. To protect WSD's financial
position, agreement was obtained during negotiations that WSD maintain a
debt service ratio of at least 1.5 over the project period. To properly
monitor financial performance, agreement was obtained during negotiations
that WSD prepare a report annually containing ten-year financial
projections, beginning with FY89/90, to be reviewed by the Association on a
annual basis and which would contain an analysis of the impact of the
revised tariffs on water sales by category of customer. To ensure that
WSD's total investment program remains within its financial capacity,
agreement was obtained during negotiations that WSD/NCC would submit a
description of additional investment projects with an estimated cost in
excess of US$2 million (other than its on-going and planned capital works)
and analysis of the financial impact of the proposal on the implementation
of the IDA-supported project, for review and comment by IDA.
5.10     In order to continue the development and improvement of WSD's
financial management and controls to move it towards a system of "self-
accounting" (greater financial autonomy), a number of other areas need to
be improved including:
(a) provision of more timely information on payment of WSD's
expenditures, which is managed by NCC, in order to permit proper
monitoring of WSD's cash and expenditure performance;
(b) establishment of a management information system within WSD to
ensure proper monitoring of its financial and operational
performance; and
(c) improvement of the computer service operated by NCC in order to
permit WSD to obtain regular information, to prepare financial
accounts and for customer inquiries.



- 43 -
5.11     As mentioned previously, due to NCC's cash flow problems some of
WSD's payments to suppliers and loan repayments were made late. In
addition, reports of WSD's expenditures, prepared by NCC staff, were
received by WSD three months late, and this gave WSD little ability to
monitor its cash and expenditure performance. As noted earlier, NCC's cash
flow difficulties are now largely over. In order to improve the timeliness
of payment and reporting of WSD's expenditures, NCC and WSD have agreed to
transfer the internal audit section responsible for processing WSD's
payments to the City Treasurer's Office and head the section with a senior
officer, to prepare weekly schedules of WSD's approved expenditures, and to
utilize monies in the Water Fund only for water and sewerage activities so
that the Water Fund's monthly bank statements can serve as the report
indicating actual time of payment.
5.12     Regarding financial management information, other than collection
information which is produced monthly and occasionally sales information,
financial information is not provided to management on a regular basis.
WSD recognizes that there is an urgent need to establish a management
information system to ensure better monitoring of its financial and
operational performance. In particular, WSD needs to begin monitoring
sales information by category of customer in order to review the impact on
and to establish appropriate tariff increases for each category of
customer. Consultancy assistance would be provided under the Project to
assist WSD in establishment of a proper management information system.
5.13     Another priority area for early improvement is the management and
operation of NCC's leased computer installation on which the billing of WSD
depends. The computer department has been plagued in the past by a lack of
competent staff compounded by rapid staff turnover. Consequently, the
department has experienced difficulty in processing an expanding volume of
documentation with inappropriate programs which preclude the introduction
of further applications which are urgently needed. A new Computer Manager
has recently (July 1988) been employed, and he is currently addressing the
problems of the department. As the disciplined use of the computer
installation is a vital input into the generation of income for both WSD
and NCC, technical assistance would be provided under the Project to
upgrade computer management through management staff support, staff
training and further rationalization of the existing computer programs.
During negotiations agreement was obtained that NCC/WSD undertake the
necessary actions to improve the timeliness of payment and reporting of
WSD's expenditures, hire consultants, if necessary, by March 1990 to
establish a proper management information system and undertake training and
technical assistance to support further development of NCC's computer
service in order to move WSD toward a system of "self-accounting."
Affordability for Low Income Group
5.14       The proposed financing plan for the Project and tariff increases
are in accordance with the stated objectives to improve and maintain WSD's
financial viability, while at the same time not placing an undue burden on
the consumers, especially in the low income group.



- 44 -
5.15       The following calculations suggest that the low income group in
Nairobi can presently afford without hardship to buy the 15 l.p.c.d., the
quantity the consultants found they are, on average, actually buying.
(These households probably supplement these very low quantities by using
free water from public standpipes and other sources such as place of work).
The relevant tariff for the purchase of the first 9 m3 is Ksh 4 per m3.
However, low income households have to pay a higher price when they buy
small quantities at kiosks.3 Low income household monthly water
consumption is assumed to be:
15 l.p.c.d. x 5 persons per household x 30 days = 2,250 1 or 2.25 m3/month
At Ksh 4 per m3 this would cost a low income household Ksh 9 per month.
At the kiosk rate (i.e. Ksh 12.5 per m3), the same quantity would amount to
Ksh 28 per month.
5.16       Since the 1982/83 household budget survey results are not
available yet, the median of the low income bracket for the consumer price
index, i.e., Ksh 350 in 1975 prices or Ksh 1,350 in March 1987 prices, was
used as a proxy for average monthly low income household income. The
household expenditure for water calculated above would require only 2% of
household income, which is considered to be affordable.
5.17       An alternative approximation of household income is to use the
actual nominal monthly earnings of a typical, modern sector unskilled
laborer in manufacturing; i.e., Ksh 972 in 1985 prices or Ksh 1,818 in 1988
prices. Assuming 1.8 wage earners per household, household income would be
Ksh 3,272. The water expenditure would represent less than 1% of household
income in this case.
5.18       These findings suggest that the Government's objective of
keeping water affordable for the low income group in Nairobi by
differentiating rate increases by income group in the past has been
achieved. For example, for the latest rate increase, the lower usage
category was raised by only 12.7% only as against 40%, on average.
Prospects that water will continue to be affordable for the low income
group are good. Consumption per capita is projected to double. The
financial calculations suggest that, on average, future tariff increases
will only need to keep up with general inflation; in other words, average
water tariffs will remain constant in real prices. In principle, it should
be possible to increase tariffs for the low income group at the same pace.
However, the proposed annual tariff reviews during project execution will
provide a possibility to continue with differential rate increases for the
low income group in the future, if this is found to be necessary.
3/ Ksh 0.10 per "debe", i.e. an 8 liter container, corresponding to Ksh
12.5 per m3.



- 45 -
5.19       For the higher income households, where present consumption
averages about:
210 l.p.c.d. x 5 persons per household x 30 days = 31,500 1 or 31.5 m3
for which they are paying 9 x 4 + 9 x 6 + 12 x 8 + 1.5 x 10 = Ksh 201 per
month,
this represents 2.2% of household income. This calculation refers to
households on the threshold of the higher household income bracket, earning
Kshs 2,500 in 1975 or Kshs 8,950 in March 1987. For higher income levels,
the percentage may be lower than 2.2%. Daily consumption per capita for
this higher income group is projected to increase by 16.7%, and as stated
above, tariff increases are expected to increase at the same pace as
general inflation. If there were a need for cross-subsidization, then the
higher income households could be charged larger increases to offset
relatively small tariff increases for low income households. Some decline
in water demand might occur, but it would be expected to be small.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Prolect Benefits
6.01       The proposed Project would augment and secure the water supply
infrastructure in Nairobi, Kenya's rapidly growing capital, which is also
the center of business, economic and cultural activities and the center of
tourism. The Project would expand the source works (by the construction of
a new dam/reservoir) and the water supply system to cater for the increased
demand. The additional capacity would meet Nairobi's demands up to about
2003-2005 and will improve the basic needs provision and health conditions
of the poor, expanding the coverage of piped water supply to the low income
group. The extension of the Dandora sewage treatment plant will help to
maintain sanitation standards in the city and to decrease pollution in the
recipient rivers. The Project will provide for the preparation of a
Sewerage Master Plan and for the Feasibility Study for the next execution
phase of the Dandora Sewage Treatment Plant. The implementation of this
extension has been included in WSD's capital investment program.
6.02       The Project would also continue to assist NCC/WSD to further
strengthen its operational, institutional and financial efficiency moving
towards the establishment of a single water authority first for the Nairobi
area and later for the whole region surrounding Nairobi.
Least Cost Solution
6.03       Based upon extensive studies, the proposed Project represents
the least costly of several technical alternatives considered (see para
3.27). With the proposed construction schedule and phased source
development, some additional water would be available to Nairobi's water
supply two years after the commencement of the Project.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
6.04       The estimated incremental project revenues were used as the
measure of the economic benefit of the Project. Incremental water revenues
were valued at the present water rate of about Ksh 9 per m3. Other
benefits, including health benefits resulting from improved sanitation,
environmental benefits resulting from prevention of pollution of rivers,
and benefits resulting from fish farming and the impact on urban
development, tourism and recreation, were not possible to quantify. All
land, civil works, equipment, design and construction supervision, physical
contingencies and recurrent costs were included in the analysis and
adjusted to exclude taxes, interest charges and inflation. Costs as well
as benefits were considered over a 35-year period. No adjustments were
made for shadow pricing of foreign exchange, since the Kenya shilling is
presently not overvalued viz-a-viz the US dollar. On this basis, the
internal economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated at 12.6% and compares
favorably with the average 5-8% ERR on similar water supply projects.



- 47 -
6.05       Sensitivity analyses were carried out assuming (i) higher and
lower investment costs and (ii) higher and lower than predicted average
tariff rates (revenues). In addition, 35 year and 40 year periods were
considered. The calculations are presented in Annex 14 and are summarized
below. It is to be noted that the ERR calculated on the basis of the
Bank's 8 year disbursement profile gave the same result.

Proiect Risks
6.06       Since NCC/WSD has demonstrated its ability to carry out two
previous Bank-supported projects and an IDA-supported engineering project
in a reasonably satisfactory manner, the risks associated with executing
this fourth Project are expected to be small. Delays in project start-up
and implementation due to inadequate improvement of WSD's institutional
capacity may result in cost overruns, but considerable technical
assistance, training and management support would be provided under the
Project to reduce this risk. In addition, the estimated project cost and
consequent financing plan have been developed on a realistic implementation
period which should mitigate against significant cost overruns. It is
possible that NCC would continue to utilize monies in WSD's Water Fund for
payment of its expenditures, but introduction of a new and significant
source of revenue for NCC, the service charge, is expected shortly which
should reduce this risk and make it possible for NCC to repay its current
outstanding obligation to the Water Fund. Introduction of tariff increases
on a regular annual basis may face political difficulties, but in view of
Government's commitment to the Project as demonstrated by its approval of
the large water and sewerage tariff increases recently, this risk is
expected to be minimal. Monitoring WSD's performance in these areas would
be a focus of IDA supervision.
Project Monitoring System
6.07      The key indicators to be monitored during implementation concern
physical progress of the project, operational performance of WSD, progress
with the training component and actions on tariff and financial performance
of WSD. Suitable indicators for monitoring project implementation and for
measuring performance are set out in Annex 15. After completion of the
proposed project, WSD would prepare a "Project Completion Report" on the
basis of an outline to be agreed with the Bank.

(j)   Government to approve regular tariff increases to ensure that
WSD earns an annual rate of return of 7.5% on consolidated
gross fixed water supply and sewerage assets in operation
except for FY88/89 through FY91/92 for which a rate of return
of 7.0% would be required (para 5.07);
(k)   WSD to maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.5 over the
project period (para 5.09);
(1)   WSD to prepare a report annually containing ten-year

computer service (para 5.13).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.02     Submission of satisfactory evidence that all conditions precedent
to the effectiveness of the loans from the cofinanciers have been fulfilled
would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit (para 3.32).
Recommendation
7.03     Subject to the above, the Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of
US$64.8 million equivalent at the standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35
years. The Borrower would be the Republic of Kenya.

THIRD NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PROGRAM
1. Introduction
1.01     Nairobi City Commission has planned to increase Water Source
availability to the city by constructing Thika Dam on Thika River. As part
of the planning activities, studies were undertaken on the impact of Thika
Dam to the Environment within the location it is to be constructed. These
studies covered the physical and social effects (if any) the Dam will have
on the environment.
1.02     The reports of the studies produced are:
(i)    Environmental Impact Study by Ecosystem for Howard Humphreys
Group, U.K.
(ii)    Environmental Impact Study by Environmental Assessment Ltd.
for Howard Humphreys Group, U.K.
(iii)    Environmental Action and Monitoring Program by Aquasystems
Consultants, Kenya
(iv)    Socio-Economic Survey by Syagga Associates, Kenya
1.03     From the findings and recommendations of these reports Water and
Sewerage Department has prepared an Environmental Action Plan and Program
which is the subject of this report.
1.04     The Environmental Action Plan and Program specifies actions to be
taken to ensure that the construction of Thika Dam will enhance the quality
of the environment where it is located. The report is prepared as
fulfillment of the condition put up by World Bank and African Development
Bank on environmental impact of the Dam. The report has been compiled by
the staff of Water and Sewerage Department who were involved in the
preparation of the Project.
1.05     The Commission desires to pay considerable attention to the need
to take necessary environmental actions that will ensure that the
construction of Thika Dam will enhance the quality of the environment where
it is located whilst rendering at the sametime the vital service of
providing water to her customers. The implementation of this program
including provision of funds thereto is intended to achieve this desire.

2. Summary
2.01      The Environmental Action Program is detailed in Section 3 of this
report and covers both socio-economic and physical aspects in an integrated
manner. Action on social aspects will cover counselling, dissemination of
information, assistance with transportation to new homes (where necessary),
education, health care and monitoring of welfare of those families who will
have moved to new homes. Action on physical aspects will involve
implementation of measures of re-afforestation, prevention of soil erosion
and sediment transport control, compensation flow downstream of dam,
livestock management, fishing and recreation on reservoir, prevention of
contamination of catchment surface run off by agrochemicals, containment of
nuisance arising out of dam construction work and water quality monitoring.
Initially, the actions proposed to be undertaken in this program are
estimated to cost KShs 5,000,000 and will cover the period FY1989/90 to
FY1990/91.
2.02      The program provides for mid-term review and evaluation of
progress and impacts of the implementation of the environmental actions
detailed in Section 3 of this report. This review will establish the
future continuance with the action on same levels or in a modified manner
where necessary.
2.03     Water Sewerage Department of NCC in consultation and liason with
area Provincial Administration will co-ordinate the implementation of the
program based at a site office. An implementation committee chaired by the
Area District Commissioner with representatives of participating ministries
as members will be established to oversee the implementation of the
Project.
3. Environmental Action Program
3.01    (i)    To enhance and protect the quality of the environment in the
area where Thika Dam will be constructed, the commission
proposes to implement practical recommendations of the
environmental impact studies according to the action program
detailed in Table 1. The Environmental Action Program is
planned to be implemented during FY 1989-1990/91 at an
initial estimated cost of Shs. 5,000,000 million. At the end
of this period, the Environmental Action Program experience
will be reviewed with the Bank and agreement reached on any
necessary further actions.
(ii)    The limited budget available requires that WSD/NCC and the
relevant Government institutions involved implement the
Environmental Action Program and that the existing laboratory
facilities within WSD and GOK be utilized for analysis of
samples. Since the actions required to be undertaken in
Table 1 involve dealing with local people, it is recommended
that WSD/NCC and relevant Government ministries implement the
program. The role of consultants will be to review and
evaluate the outcome and effects of the environmental
measures so implemented.

ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 6
(iii)    WSD/NCC shall establish and put into place an environmental
action program team to be operational at site and co-ordinate
the activities thereof from a site office to be provided
under the Project. To assist in giving due guidance to the
program, an implementation committee under the chairmanship
of the Area District Commissioner and comprised of
representation of all relevant government ministries
participating in the program will be established. Assistance
of the Ministry of Local Government and Physical Planning and
the Office of the President will be required to cause the
said implementation committee to be established under
chairmanship of Area District Commissioner.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR WATER AND SEWERAGE DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
WATER SUPPLY INCOME STATEMENT
1.  Available Supply - The current system has production capacity of
194,200 m3/day (FY87/88 Uas an exception due to unusually heavy rainfall).
The construction period of the project is FY89/90-FY94/95 (6 years), during
which time production will increase to Z13,700 m3/day upon completion of
the tunnel. New production capacity at full commissioning of the project
will be 455,Z00 n3/day.
2. Unaccounted-for-water - Expected to decrease from about 29% to 25% over
the project period and remain constant thereafter.
3.  Available Sales Volume - Available supply less unaccounted-for-water.
4. Water Demand - Engineer's estimate. Expected to be greater than supply
until project completion in FY94/95 at which time system capacity would be
greater than demand.
5. Sales Volume - Available sales volume or water demand, whichever is
lower.
6. Annual Sales Volume - Sales volume X 365 days.
7. Fiscal Year Inflation Rate - Average of appropriate calendar years'
estimates of inflation.
8. Average Tariff - For FY85/86, FY86/87 and FY87/88, computed by dividing
actual billable revenue by sales volume. For FY88/89, due to lower
expected sales volume than previous year, average tariff is estimated at
about KSh 9/m3 and expected to increase each year thereafter by estimated
inflation rate.
Operating Revenue
9. Other income - estimated to increase by 2% in FY87/88 and each year
thereafter.
Operating Expenses
10. Salaries - FY87/88 reflects a backdated salary increase to May 1,
1987, amounting on average to an increase of about 40% over the previous
year. Expected to increase by 10% per year thereafter.
11.  Administration - Assumes a 40X increase in FY87/88 and expected to
increase by 10% per year thereafter.
1?. Power and Fuel - FY87/88 reflects an increase of about 30% in prices.

14.  Labor - FY87/88 reflects a 40% increase over the prior year.
Estimated to increase by 10% per year thereafter.
15. Supplies - FY87/88 reflects a 25% increase over the prior year (mainly
due to increase in the cost of pipes). Estimated to increase by inflation
thereafter.
16. Meter Maintenance - Estimated to increase by inflation and sales
volume increases each year.
17. Cost of collection - FY87/88 reflects a 40% increase over the prior
year. FY88/89 reflects a 10X increase in number of collection personnel
due to WSD establishing 6 new collection points as part of decentralization
strategy as well as inflation and sales volume increases. Estimated to
increase by infaltion and sales volume increases each year thereafter.
18. Provision for bad debts - Estimated to increase by ZZ of billable
revenue each year.
19. Project maintenance - engineer's estimate of incremental maintenance
costs of the project, increased by inflation till the time of project
commissioning.
20. Depreciation - For FY85/86 and FY86/87, amounts reflect annual
principal repayments of loans. Beginning in FY87/88, amounts are based on
revalued assets and asset life by category of asset.
21. Interest - Excludes interest during construction which is charged to
deferred charges during project period.
22. Amortization of deferred charges - Includes interest during
construction, consultancy costs and technical assistance/training costs,
which are amortized over 15 years, beginning at the time of project
commissioning.
SEWERAGE INCOME STATEMENT
1. Annual Volume Billed - Estimated at 75% of water sales volume, based on
past experience.
2. Average Tariff - For FY85/86 and FY86/87, average tariff is calculated
by dividing billable revenue by sales volume. Tariff for FY87/88 reflects
the 40% increase in March 1988 applied to 5 months billable revenue.
Tariff for FY88/89 reflects prior year's increase applied to entire year.
Tariffs for each year thereafter assumed to increase with inflation.
3. Other income and operating expenses are expected to increase as
described above for water increases, except for suppliet which are
estimated to increase in FY87/88 by the rate of inflation.

reservoirs, water release recording, metered production by
month at the treatment plant;
2.   Water consumption:  metered monthly consumption and revenues
billed for all categories of water demand and consumption
blocks including, but not restricted to, the following uses:
(i) residential; (ii) commercial/industrial and (iii)
governmental/institutional.
3.   Unaccounted-for water by month;
4.   Numbers of connections at year-end listed by consumption
blocks and category (see para a(2) above) including
residential connections of the following types: (i) private
connections; (ii) public standposts, (iii) kiosks, and (iv)
other;
5.   Interruptions in service:  the extent to which water service
was interrupted on an annual basis with specific
consideration of: (a) frequency, (b) duration, and (c) cause
of interruption.
B.       Treated Water Quality:  Summary of physical, chemical and
bacteriological quality.
C.       Project implementation:
1.   Quarterly forecasts of expenditures are to be prepared for
each contract within three months of signature of contract.
Quarterly reports are to indicate percentage completion of
original forecasts and revised forecast of expenditure for
