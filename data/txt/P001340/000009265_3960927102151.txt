MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A THIRD NAIROBI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed Credit to the Republic of Kenya
for SDR 49.1 million (US$64.8 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed Credit, on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity, would help finance the third phase extension to Nairobi's water
supply including technical assistance to improve the operational and
financial performance of the Nairobi City Commission (NCC) and its Water
and Sewerage Department (WSD). The IDA Credit would be on-lent to NCC.
Co-financing totalling US$93.8 million equivalent would be provided by the
following donors: OECF, US$40.0 million equivalent; AfDBIAfDF, US$35.2
million equivalent; and EIB, US$18.6 million equivalent. NCC/WSD would
provide US$101.0 million equivalent towards the Project cost (including
interest during construction) and GOK will provide US$3.4 million
equivalent to finance land acquisition costs.
2.       Backaround: Nairobi has had piped water supply since the turn of
the century, and the development of the water supply system has generally
kept pace with effective demand. The population of Nairobi has grown from
4,000 in 1900 to 835,000 in 1979 (actual census figure), and to about 1.3
million in 1987. Based on the expected growth rates, Nairobi's population
may reach 2.5 million by 2000, while effective water demand is expected to
grow from the present level of about 170,000 m3/day (just barely met) to
about 350,000 m3/day.
3.       The Bank has been involved in Nairobi's water supply development
since 1970 through the Nairobi First and Second Water Supply Projects. The
need for the third expansion phase of Nairobi's water supply was already
clearly identified during the appraisal of the Second Project in 1977. At
that time, following a redesign and rephasing of the Project, it proved
economical to defer construction of an expensive dam and storage reservoir
for about 10 years. Notwithstanding the full benefits of the Second
Project and achievement of a reasonable level of operational efficiency,
the city was expected to experience water shortages 'Pieyond 1987188. NCC,
in consultation with Ministry of Local Government ani Physical Planning
(MLGPP) and the Ministry of Water Development (MWD), decided in 1984 that
short- and long-term plans have to be prepared for the expansion of water
supply to Nairobi and its environs, followed by a phased Implementation of
these development plans. As the extraction from the present water sources
in the Chania-Kimakia-Thika River system will approach the upper extraction
limit to satisfy the short-term demands, the necessity to plan for an
integrated utilization of all the regional water resources to satisfy the
longer-term needs of Nairobi City and all other regional users was
recognized.
4.       The Nairobi Water Supply Engineering Credit provided for the
preparation of the Third Nairobi Water Supply Project including feasibility
studies for the short-term expansion of the water supply system and also
for the development of a long-term regional water resource management
program, detailed engineering designs, assistance to NCCIWSD in the



- 2 -
Improvement of the Nairobi City distribution system and for the assessment
of Nairobi's sewerage and sanitation needs. In addition, it included
support for the institutional development and strengthening of NCCIWSD's
operational and financial performance through technical assistance,
training, and Improvement to NCC's computer installation.
5.       NCC's Water ond Sewerage Department (WSD) was established in 1970
and since that time, WSD hsa experienced serious difficulty in recruiting
and retaining qualified personnel to staff Its organisation. Partly due to
the past vacancies in its financial section, WSD's collection performance
deteriorated such that about Ksh 249.6 million or about 240 days of
billings were in arrears by end-June 1987. Also, because of cash flow
problems it Was experiencing, NCC continued to borrow from WSD's Water
Fund, which was established by law to account exclusively for all water and
sewerage revenues and expenditures, and this created cash flow difficulti'es
for WSD. Recent key vacancies have now been filled and an $mmediate and
long-term training program has been identified to further strengthen WSD's
staff. Furthermore, actions are currently underway to improve collection
performance. NCC's financial position is now improving as a result of
recent increases in its charges and the expected introduction of a new,
major source of revenue, which should reduce NCC's requirement to borrow
from the Water Fund in the future and permit it to repay its outstanding
obligation, Other deficiencies related to the reporting by NCC of WSD's
expenditures, lack of an adequate management information system and
difficulties with NCC's computer service would be addressed under the
Project. With these improvements, WSD's financial management practices and
position are expected to remain sound over the Project period.
6.       Pro_ect Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed Project are to
augment and secure the water supply to Nairobi, through the expansion of
source works by the construction of a new dam/reservoir and to expand
Nairobi's water supply system to cater for the increased demand. The
additional capacity would meet Nairobi's demands up to about 2003-2005, and
will improve the basic needs provision and health conditions of the urban
poor by expanding the coverage of the piped water supply to low income
groups. The extension of the Dandora sewage treatment plant will assist in
maintaining the sanitation standards 'n the city and in preventing
pollution in the recipient rivers. The Project provides for environmental
control and mitigating measures in the relocation of the affected
population. The technical assistance and training component would help to
further improve the operational, institutional and financial efficiency of
NCCIWSD.
7.       Proiect Description:  Totalling US$263.0 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$124.0 million equivalent, the Project
would provide for the implementation of the third expansion phase of
Nairobi's water supply, consisting of the following parts: (a) source
works including construction of a new dam and raw water transmission
tunnels and main; (b) expansion of the water supply system including
extension of the existing Ngethu water treatment plant, construction of
treated water transmission main, distribution system extension,
instrumentation, control and automation, and staff housing and offices; (c)
extension of the Dandora sewage treatment plant, including provision of
staff housing, offices and amenity building; (d) improvement of water



-3-
supply and waste disposal facilities in low ii.come residential areas; (e)
consultancy services for engineering, construction supervision and
preparation of a sewerage master plan; and (f) technical assistance for
management staff support (salaries and benefits) and implementation of a
training program, self accounting system and environmental action program.
Location of the various sites are shown on Map IBRD No. 21208. A breakdown
of costs is shown in Schedule A, amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7500-KE is being
distributed separately.
8.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  The Bank has been involved in the
water sector since 1970. The Nairobi Water Supply Project (Loan 714-KE)
implemented during 1972-76 assisted by the Bank was the first phase of a
long-range program to develop the Chania-Kimakia-Thika river system for the
purpose of meeting Nairobi's water supply requirements. This was followed
by the Nairobi Second Water Supply Project (Loan 1520-KE), implemented
during 1978-84, to provide the necessary extensions for Nairobl's water
supply up to 1987-88. The presently still on-going Third Nairobi Water
Supply Engineering Project (Credit 1566-KE) has been assisting the
Government and the Nairobi City Commission (NCC) and its Water and Sewerage
Department (WSD) in the preparation of the next extension phase (proposed
Project) as part of a long term water supply strategy for Nairobi and its
environs, and to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of the
implementing agency (NCC/WSD). The Bank also financed the Mombasa and
Coastal Water Supply Project (Loan 1167-KE), which was implemented by MWD.
These Projects have been physically completed successfully albeit with cost
overruns of varying degrees. The Bank has made one loan to the rural water
sector (Rural Water Supply Project, Loan 1637-KE) in 1977. Due to problems
of implementation and operation of MWD's Rural Water Supply Program and
Government's financial constraints, the Project was cancelled on mutual
agreement in 1985. The recent trend in rural water supply strategy
focusses more on -rillage based operations, community participation and
appropriate technology.
9.       It is essential to maintain and improve the standard of urban
services in Nairobi which is not only the capital and largest city of Kenya
but also the hub of business, economic, communications and cultural
activities and center of tourism (which provides about half of Kenya's
foreign earnings). Recognizing this need, Government formally requested
Bank assistance for the phased development of Nairobi's water supply system
and attaches high priority to the proposed Project. The Bank Group
supports Government's effort to achieve its targets in water sector
development by providing financial assistan-^e for high priority, long-term
water supply projects with continuing assistance for institution building,
emphasizing manpower development and training, and improvement in
administrative and financial management. The significant weight attached
to the environmental issues of the proposed Project is also in line with
the Bank's policy.
10.      Actions Agreed Upon.  During negotiations agreements were reached
regarding:  (i) operational and financial targets addressing, inter alia,
improvements in collection performance; tariff requirements to achieve an
adequate rate of return; debt service requirements; preparation of ten-year



- 4 -
financial projections, use of revenues in the Water Fund and auditing
requirementsa (ii) financing of land acquisition costs; (Cii) disbursement
proceduresa (iv) Implementation of an Envirormental Action Program and a
training program; and (vi reporting requirements. A condition of credit
effectiveness would be the submission of satisfactory evidence that all
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the loans from the co-
financiers have been fulfilled.
11.      Benefits.  The Project would prevent water shortages In Nairobi
from becoming progressively more severe and enhance the 2urther development
of the rapidly growing capital city of Kenya by providing the required
water supply infrastructure to meet demands up to 2003-5. The Project
would also help to meet the basic needs and improve the health conditions
of the urban poor. The extension of the sewage treatment plant and the
environmental action program will assist in maintaining the sanitation
standards in the city and in preventing pollution in the recipient rivers.
The Project also provides for training and technical assistance to Improve
the efficiency of NCCIWSD.
12.      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the Project is estimated at
12.6Z which compares favorably with the average 5-8Z ERR on similar water
supply projects.
13.      Risks.  Based on NCCIWSD's performance in carrying out three
previous Bank and IDA-supported projects, the risks of this Project are
expected to be small. Delays in Project start-up and implementation may
result in cost overruns, but technical assistance, trainin and nmanagement
support would reduce this risk. NCC may continue to utilize the Water Fund
for payment of its expenditures, but introduction of a new source of
revenue would reduce this risk and make it possible for NCC to repay its
remaining obligation to WSD. Introduction of tariff increases on a regular
basis may face political difficulties, but in view of Government's
commitment to the Project as demonstrated by recent increases, this risk Is
expected to be minimal. Monitoring WSD's performance In these areas wmuld
be a focus of IDA supervision.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
