APPR&ISAL OF THE GUATAPE II HYDROELECTRIC PROJiCT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report is an appraisal of a Project consisting of the second
stage of the Guatape hydroelectric scheme, a 220-kV transmission line, and
expansion of the distribution system serving the Medellin area. The recently
completed first stage consisted of a small diversion dam and the first four
generating units of the Guatape power station. The hydroelectric works under
the Project would double the station's present installed capacity of 280 NJ
and substantially enlarge the Santa Rita Dam to create a reservoir providing
multi-annual storage on the Nare River.
ii.       The estimated cost of the Project is US$98.2 million equivalent,
half of that amount being the foreign exchange cost. Turbines and generators
would be financed by suppliers' credits. A Bank loan of US$56 million is
proposed ihich would finance the balance of the Project's foreign exchange
cost, interest during construction, and $4.3 million of local currency ex-
penditures for engineering services and civil works.
iii.      The borrower would be Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), an
autonomous public utility which supplies power in and around Medellin and
is also responsible for providing the city's water, sewerage and telephone
services. Separate accounts are maintained for the various departments of
EHM.  The utility has had three power loans from the Bank, which have helped
finance about 70% of its present installed capacity of 730 MW. The projects
were well executed and the facilities they provided have been operating
satisfactorily under EPM's efficient technical and financial management.
iv.       The proposed loan would be the Bankts eighteenth loan to the
Colombian power sector. Previous loans have assisted, among other things,
in achieving interconnection of the power systems of the four major power
utilities in central Colombia, one of which is EPM. The creation of Inter-
conexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) in 1967 to construct and operate intercon-
nection facilities has resulted in some rationalization of power planning
in Colombia; however, there is a need for fuller coordination of sector
development -- a task only recently undertaken by the government planning
authorities. In conjunction with the proposed loan the Government has there-
fore agreed to establish a national power development plan that would be the
basis for scheduling future power sector investments and mobilizing finance
for them.
v.        The Project is the least-cost solution for meeting the load growth
of the interconnected system, which constitutes 80% of the country's power
market. The return on the Project is at least 16%.

APPRAISAL OF THE GUATAPE II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Colombian Government has requested Bank financing for a
project comprising the second stage of the Quatape hydroelectric plant,
involving an installation of 280 MW, and associated transmission and
distribution facilities. The cost of the Project is estimated at US$98.2
million equivalent excluding interest during construction. A Bank loan of
US$56 million is proposed, to be made to Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM).
1.02      The Bank has been active in the Colombian power sector for some
20 years. The proposed loan would be its eighteenth loan to the power
sector and its fourth to EPM. The previous loans to EPM -- US$12 million
in 1959, US$22 million in 1961 and US$39 million in 1964 (extended in 1967
to cover additional works) -- helped finance hydroelectric plants with an
aggregate capacity of 531 MW, or 72% of EPM's present installed capacity.
All of these facilities are operating satisfactorily.
1.03      The Bank fostered the establishment of the central interconnected
system in Colombia by two loans to Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA), a
company created in 1967 for the purpose of building and administering the
interconnected system. A 220-kV transmission system now interconnects the
systems serving the cities of Bogota, Cali, Manizales and Medellin -- EPM's
area of operations. The Project would operate as part of the interconnected
system.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. E. Friedmann and K. Stichenwirth
and is based on the findings of missions to Colombia in December 1971 and
March 1972.



II. THE POWER SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Colombia has a population of 22.3 million, which is growing at
3.2% per year and is almost entirely concentrated in the more highly
developed regions -- Costa Atlantica (northern) and Andina (central and
western). In 1970 some 56% of the population was urban compared with
4h% in 1951. The GDP has been growing rapidly, averaging 6.4% in the
1968-70 period, with manufacturing increasing by 7-8% per year. In 1970
the GDP per capita was about US$325. Despite inflation, which has been
a chronic problem (averaging 11% per year during the past decade), the
outlook for the economy continues to be good, with estimated rates of
growth approaching 7% per year by the mid-1970s.
2.02      The country is well-endowed with energy resources.  Coal reserves,
estimated at 18 billion tons, are the largest in South America, Oil reserves,
of possibly 3 billion barrels, rank Colombia third on the continent after
Venezuela and Ecuador. Hydroelectric potential is estimated at 60,000 MW,
of which only about 3% is utilized. Hydroelectric generation (76%) is pre-
dominant in the central region (Bogota-Medellin-Cali-Manizales), while
thermoelectric generation (241) utilizing coal, oil and gas is concentrated
in the northern region.
The Sector
2.03      Over the past 20 years, power demand in Colombia has grown at the
relatively high average rate of 11% per year. Installed capacity per capita,
however, is still only 103 watts, which is less than in most Latin American
countries. Only about 45% of the population enjoys uninterrupted electricity
supply; about 30% has no supply at all, and the remaining 25% is supplied
part time. The national development plan aims to provide at least 95%
of the population with electricity supply by 1980 (see Annex 7).
Organization of the Sector
2.04      Electricity in Colombia is generally supplied by public corporations
owned by the central, departmental or municipal governments. Captive indus-
trial plant accounts for about 10% of installed capacity. Since 1967 signi-
ficant progress toward national integration of supply has taken place. The
main areas of service are the Central region, which became interconnected in
1972 (see Map IBRD-3948); the Northeast, which will become part of the inter-
connected in system in 1974; and the Atlantic Coast region) planned for
interconnection to the rest of the country in the late 1970s.
2.05      Four utilities supply 95% of the public electricity: Empresas
Publicas de Medellin (EPM), Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (REEE),
Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica (ICEL)$ and Corporacion Autonoma
Regional del Cauca (CVC), Public power generation was as follows in 1970
(in GWh):

Total         100           7,838
Sector Finance
2.06      Anmnal investment in-the power sector has been consistently around
15% of total public investment. About 52% of this expenditure on power has
been in foreign currency, of which the Bank provided some 73% during 1950-1970.
In recent power loans, Bank financing has been supplemented by joint or parallel
financing of equipment for the projects.
2.07      Raising sufficient funds for the local currency cost of power project-s
has been a problem at times, as the normal complements to internal cash genera-
tion have been limited. There is on2ly a limited domestic capital market and
Government policy is to confine its financing for power to projects which have a
low financial return (such as slum-area and rural electrification) but important
economic and social benefits. The proposed Project would represent a new depar-
ture in domestic capital mobilization: it is planned to finance a substantial
part of the local cost by loans from local banks and a domestic bond issue.
Sector Plannin
2.08      While Bank support of Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) has helped
provide considerable rationalization of the planning process, overall coord-
ination of sector planning is still limited and there is no national power
development planning. A national power development plan properly coordinated
with Colombia's overall development objectives and with a national energy
policy is needed to ensure that the limited financial resources available to
the sector are applied to the most needed projects. Such a plan, which should
be reviewed annually, would include a generation and transmission program
on the basis of which the construction of major facilities would be authorized,
and would serve as a guide for investments in urban and rural distribution systems.
A start on this has been made with funds under ISA's first Bank loan (575-co),
with which it is carrying out a number of river basin and feasibility studies



for new hydroelectric plants. A broad national plan would suggest insti-
tutional reorganization and reforms to increase planning and operational
efficiency and would help to improve the coordination of foreign lending to
the sector. Consequently, the Government has agreed during negotiations to
establish during 1973 a national power development plan  along the above lines
and the Bank will be given the opportunity to comment on it and on later re-
visions before they are made final.
Tariffs
2.09      In 1969 the Junta Nacional de Tarifas was set up as part of the
National Planning Office to have jurisdiction ever tariffs and, by this
means, help direct national savings toward development. The utilities submit
tariff applications to this agency, which has full authority to act on them.
Current policy is that tariffs should be adequate to cover all of the partic-
ular utility's operating expenses, including debt service, and generate enough
funds to cover a substantial part of its expansion program; tariffs should
cover fully the cost of service to different categories of consumers except
for low-income residential consumers, for whom a subsidized price is provided.
2.10      The application of this policy has been uneven.  Since the Junta's
establishment, Bank borrowers generally have received adequate tariff adjust-
ments.  Other utilities, however, for political reasons, have not always
applied for tariff adjustments and have therefore not received them. The
Junta has no legal power to establish new tariffs by itself; it is only when
these utilities request Government budgetary support that the National Planning
Office can press them to make adequate tariff adjustments.

III. THE BORROWER
3.01      Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), created in 1955 from municipal
departments, is one of the best organized and administered public utility
enterprises in Colombia. The Bank was instrumental in establishing it as
an autonomous public entity responsible for providing Medellin and some of
the surrounding areas with electricity, water, sewerage and telephone services,
thus minimizing political influence and ensuring independent management.
Organization and Management
3.02      EPM has a nine-member Board of Directors consisting of:  the Mayor
of Medellin, who serves as ex-officio Chairman; a representative of the
Government of Antioquia, the Department in which Medellin is located; the
Chief of the Municipal Planning Office; and six members elected by the Munic-
ipal Council, three from among the Council members and the other three from
business, the professions and labor unions. With the exception of the Mayor,
the directors serve for two years; they cannot be reelected more than once.
Previous loan agreements with EPM contain an undertaking which requires con-
sultation with the Bank before any amendments to either EFM's statutes or
the legislation affecting them are proposed; this has been retained in the
proposed loan.
3.03      The Board appoints a general manager who is the company's chief
executive officer. EPM's internal structure is organized along functional
lines so as to charge each manager, in his respective professional field,
with the responsibilities arising from all sectors combined in the enter-
prise, i.e. power, water, sewerage and telephone (see Annex 1A). EPM's
accounts, however, are kept separately by sector, thus providing a precise
breakdown of assets and liabilities on the one hand, and expenses and
revenues on the other hand. The quality of management is satisfactory. Recent
appointees to positions that were vacant because of retirements are well
qualified. Political events of the last 2-3 years seem to have hampered the
ability of the Board of EPM to appoint the General Manager. Three persons
have held this position since July 1970, and at present only an Acting General
Manager is in charge. To ensure continued efficient management, and because
the statutes are silent in this respect, EPM agreed during negotiations that
only persons with appropriate qualifications will be appointed to managerial
positions and that the Bank will be consulted in advance with respect to the
nominees for the post of General Manager.
3.o4      EPM employs a total staff of about 3,300, out of which 870 are
directly concerned with the operations of the power department. In addition,
about 500 employees of the general services group which serves all the
sectors, have to be allocated to power thus raising the total work force
engaged in electricity supply to about 1,370 (about 2 per MW installed),
which is reasonable considering the scope of the department's activities -
generation, transmission and distribution - and compares favorably to similar
companies in Colombia and elsewhere. Some training in the field of distri-
bution techniques is required (para. 4.07). For further reference on EPM's
activities other than power see Annex 1B.



-6-
EPM's Facilities
3.05      EPM distributes energy in the city of Medellin and, in addition,
sells power in bulk to Electrificadora de Antioquia, a governmental agency
in charge of distribution to other urban and rural areas within the Depart-
ment of Antioquia. This service area has a total population of some 1.5
million.
3.06      EPM's installed capacity in 1971 was 727 MW and is entirely hydro-
electric. As one of the owners and shareholders of ISA, EPM is entitled to
a share of the output of ISA's generating capacity; when Chivor, ISA's
first plant, is completed in 1976, EPM's share will be about 16%, or 80 MW.
Details ofEPM'stransmission and distribution networks, which serve about
190,000 customers in both urban and rural areas, are in Annex 2.
3.07      The distribution system for Medellin has as its backbone a llO-kV
ring. Sub-transmission and distribution lines are generally overhead, except
in the high-density center of the city, where underground cables are used.
EPM builds the primary feeders for the distribution system, but in new urban
areas the building developers install the distribution transformers and
secondary feeders, which are then turned over to EPM and become its property 4
EPM is responsible for providing secondary distribution facilities other than
those provided by developers but has not had an entirely free hand in this,
for reasons explained in the next paragraph.
3.08      For some years the Government's policy of discouraging rural
migration to urban areas was implemented in part by limiting public service,
including power supply, to urban "squatter areas" resulting from such md-
gration. Under this policy) EPM was not permitted to provide service -
nearby areas   In 1969 the Government changed this policy, and a substantial
portion of the proposedi distribution expansion included in the Project is
for improving electricity supply in such areas.
Electricity Sales
3.09      Sales have been increasing in recent years by some 12% annually,
to reach maximrum demand of 422 MW in 1971.    Losses from theft and illegal
connections have been a serious problem in recent years, increasing from
about 14% in 1960 to 28% in 1968. A major reason for the increase was the
considerable theft of electricity in squatter areas up to 1969, largely
due to the lack of service which encouraged the inhabitants to make illegal
connections to nearby secondary power circuits. In 1969, regular service
to such areas was begun and in 1971, with a concurrent meter control program,
losses were reduced to 22%. They are expected to decrease steadily hereafter,
by some 2% per year until reaching the 12-14% level which would be normal
for the EPM system size and the nature of its market.
Tariffs
3.10      EPM's tariffs (see Annex 13) are the lowest in Colombia because of
the favorable hydroelectric resources available to the company. On average,_
the tariffs amount to USA per kWh. Availability of power at reasonable cost
has been an importaiit faictor in Xedellin's industrial development.
I/EPM acquires these facilities at no cost and they are shown in its books
at nominal value.



- 7 -
3.11      The structure of EPM's tariffs is generally adequate.  Charges
for industrial consunption are substantially lower than for residential
and commercial, and low-income residents enjoy a subsidized tariff (para.
2.09). Large industrial customers are charged separately for day and night-
time energy and for peak demand. In the past, tariffs have increased an
average of 10% annually to maintain their real value in the face of rising
prices.
Accounting, Billing and Collection
3.12      Most of EPMts accounting is computerized.  The staff is well
qualified and efficient. Collections are prompt as consumers are surcharged
5% if bills are not paid within 10 days.

IV. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The Project (see Annex 6 ) would consist of:
(i) construction of the 280 MW second stage of the Guatape hydro-
electric power station, involving the heightening of the Santa
Rita dam and duplication of most of the civil and electro-
mechanical features of the first stage (see Annex 6/Map No. 6742);
(ii) a 230-kV power transmission line from Guatape to load centers
and associated sub-stations; and
(iii)  expansion of the distribution system in EPM's service area.
4.02      The existing Santa Rita Dam is a small structure, 27 m high, which
impounds a headpond permitting only run-of-river operation as the 70 mil-
lion m3 storage capacity is very small. The enlarged earth and rock-filled
dam would be 26 m higher, with a size of over 3 million m3.  The water
storage capacity provided by the enlarged dam would be 1,240 million m3,
providing an additional reliable peaking capability of 280 MW and an energy
storage of 3,000 GWh, equivalent to the average yearly production of the
site. This energy wauld be available to supplement the interconnected
system's energy production during poor hydrological years. The present
intake towers, headrace and tailrace tunnels, underground penstock, and
underground power station of Stage I would be duplicated.
4.03      A 230-kV line from the Guatape station to the Miraflores sub-
station in Medellin is proposed. But an alternative which would link
Guatape with the Barbosa substation and Guadalupe power station is under
study. Costs would not change significantly if the second alternative
is chosen.
4.04      The distribution expansion includes additional bays and trans-
former capacity for about 240 MVA at the 10 main substations of the 110 kV
ring. In addition, the underground network for the central part of Medellin,
which is overloaded due to the increase in high-rise building construction,
would be substantially increased; about one-third of the distribution facili-
ties being provided would be for the squatter reclamation areas.
Engineering
4.05      Hydroelectric development of the Nare River was first studied in
the early 1960s by Edison S.P.A. (Italy) and Integral Ltd. (Colombia).
The latter, in association with Harza Engineering (USA), designed and
supervised the first stage.  Its design included all the main elements of the
second stage now proposed, including the heightening of the Santa Rita dam.
4.o6      EPM has retained Integral, a firm with considerable experience in
designing and building hydroelectric projects in Colombia, as its main
consultant for the second stage. Foreign specialists will assist Integral
in reviewing seismic design and ecological aspects of the Project. The
firm will also be assisted by foreign consultants in procurement and super-
vision of electro-mechanical installation. During negotiations, EPM agreed



- 9 -
to retain consultants acceptable to the Bank to assist in design, preparation
and evaluation of bids, and supervision of construction.
4.07        The distribution facilities proposed under the Project were planned
by rPFFs engineers after detailed analysis of load growth and network studies.
B3's plans for further development of sub-transmission and distribution facili-
ties call for increased personnel training; the proposed loan therefore includes
US$100,000 to train EFM staff abroad in the planning, design, and naintenance
techniques of distribution systems. The training program will be submitted to
the Bank for approval.

- 10 -
4.09        The cost estimates, which were prepared in detail by the consult-
ants early in 1971, were revised in January 1972 to reflect subsequent local
inflation and devaluation of the peso and the U.S. dollar. Physical contin-
gencies to provide for uncertainties during construction of the various items
of the Project are based on the considerable experience gained during the
construction of the first stage (see Annex 6). The following values were
adopted:  20% for the Santa Rita Dam and miscellaneous civil engineering works;
7% for the power station civil works and tunnels; 4% for the foreign costs and
10% for the local costs of electro-mechanical plant; and 7% for transmission
and distribution. Contingencies to cover price escalation were based on an
assumed annual increase of 4% in foreign costs and 10% for local costs, in
line with recent and currently expected trends. Overall, physical contingencies
amount to US$8.0 million and price contingencies to US$13.6 million, repre-
senting 10% and 17% of direct costs, respectively. This should be adequate.
Unit Cost
4.10        The cost per kilowatt installed of the Guatape II plant would be
US$299. The cost of the first 280 MW stage, completed in early 1972, was
US$220JkW. The average unit cost for both stages would be about US$260/kW,
which is attractive for this type of project.
Amount of the Proposed Loan
4.11        The proposed loan covering 46% of the Project cost, plus interest
during construction, would finance the following items:
US$ Million
Fquivalent
(i)  62% of the total cost of main civil works contracts -        $27-5
consisting of:  direct foreign exchange cost            $20.9
contingencies on foreign exchange cost 4.4
local currency cost                       2.2
(ii) Foreign costs of electromechanical equipment, exclud-
ing turbines and generators -                                   5.5
consisting of:  direct foreign exchange cost              4.7
contingencies of foreign exchange cost  0.8
(iii) Foreign costs of transmission line and substation
materials and equipmrient -                                     3.2
(iv)  Foreign costs of distribution and equipnent and training -   6.6
(v) 50% of total cost of engineering -                               2.3
consisting of:  foreign exchange                          0.2
local currency                           1.8
contingencies                            0.3
(vi)  Interest on the Bank loan during construction period -        10.9



W4ith the exception of US$4.3 million for local currency expenditures (US$2.1
million for engineering services and US$2.2 million for civil works), the loan
would cover only foreign cost of the Project. The only items involving foreign
exchange not included in the Bank loan would be the turbines and generators
for which suppliers' credits are envisaged (para. 6.11). Suppliers' credits,
however, finance neither the down payments (15%) required at the time of award
of a contract nor interest during construction and this foreign exchange there-
tore (US$2.2 million) will have to be provided by FPM.
Procurement
4.12      Two large civil engineering contracts which will attract inter-
national bidding, are contemplated, one of about US$20 million for the intake
towers, tunnels, and cavern of the power station and the other of about US$14
million for the heightening of the Santa Rita Dam. The latter would be started
about one year earlier than the former in order to fill the reservoir by 1977
when the project is to commence operations. Tenders for the dam contract were
opened on October 24, 1972, and are being evaluated by EPM. The contract will
not be signed until after the Bank loan is made. Minor civil engineering con-
tracts for roads, town relocation and reservoir rim treatment would not be
financed by the loan and would be contracted locally.
4.13      The equipment to be financed by the loan is not manufactured in
Colombia and will be procured through international competitive bidding. EPM
intends to reserve for local suppliers certain distribution equipment (13.2 kV
and below) which is manufactured in Colombia; this equipment would not be
eligible for Bank financing. The need for granting preference to Colombian
manufacturers does not seem to arise. However, in over to accommodate local
industry should it become competitive in the future,  the loan documents, at
the request of the Government, provide a preference for domestic suppliers in
bid comparisons of the applicable customs duties or 15% of the c.i.f. price,
whichever is smaller. Though Colombia as a member of the Latin American Free
Trade Association (LAFTA) belongs to a trading bloc granting tariff preferences,
the fact that EPM is exempt from import duties eliminates this factor from bid
evaluation.
Disbursements
4.14      Disbursements for the two civil work contracts would be made against
62' of the amount billed in the contractors' periodic invoices provided that
this 62'p of the cost does not exceed the estimated US$27.5 million (para. 4.11).
If the 62% of the cost of these contracts were to exceed US$27.5 million, this
percentage would be reduced to insure that no more than US$27.5 million be
disbursed and that these payments are made over the whole period of execution
of the contracts.
4.15      Disbursements for equipment and training would be made only against
the foreign exchange costs. For engineering consulting costs, disbursement
would be made against 50% of expenditure as in earlier power loans in Colombia.
No disbursements would be made for expenditures incurred prior to signing of
the loan. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 8. Any
/ A possible case is the supply of some transmission structures.



- 12 -
loan funds remaining undisbursed upon completion of the Project would be
cancelled, unless their disbursement on other works associated with the
Project were considered appropriate.
Ecological Aspects
4.16    _   The heightening of the Santa Rita Dam will flood the small town
of El_Penol, which has a population of 3,000. EPM and the Municipality of
El Penol have already agreed that EPM will compensate and relocate those
displaced and will ensure that their standard of living and means of live-
lihood will not be impaired (see Annex 12).
4.17        A reconnaissance of the ecological aspects of the Project, in-
cluding a field visit and evaluation of reports relevant to this problem
was carried out by a foreign consultant in 1972. No adverse consequences
were identified. A number of suggestions were made to preclude problems
which might arise if the riparian lands around the reservoir are not adequately
protected from undue agricultural or forestry exploitation. A program is
also proposed to encourage the multi-purpose utilization of the reservoir
for tourism, sports and fishing. EFM has written to the Bank giving assurances
that it will take adequate steps to implement the consultant's recommendations
(see Annex 12).

V. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
5.01      The primary purpose of the Project is to help meet the growing
demand for electricity for Colombian industry,commerce and households
already connected to the Central interconnected system, but it will also
provide for connecting new consumers in and near Medellin who do not now
have access to electricity.
Demand
5.02      Although Guatape II will primarily serve the EPM market, the
need for the Project is based on the requirements of the power market
of the entire interconnected system, representing about 80% of the country's
consumption. The 1972-78 forecast of system demand, which was prepared
by ISA's partners and reviewed by the Government Planning Office, is based
mainly on a review of the historical trends and the economic outlook in
each sub-system -- Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Manizales and the Northeast.
Average rates of growth have been remarkably stable in these five sub-
systems. The individual annual growth rates adopted were: EPM 8.7%;
EEEB 12.9%, decreasing to 10%; CVC 9.4%; ICEL/CHEC 7.8%; and the Northeast
10.2%, decreasing to 8%. On this basis the overall growth rate for the
interconnected system was forecast at 9.5%, which is reasonable in the
light of the 6-7% growth expected in GDP.
5.03      EPM?s sales forecast is based on an analysis of past consumption
trends, for which there are statistics since 1936, and on an evaluation of
prospective industrial activities, urban growth and electricity distribu-
tion expansion policy. Because of the relative importance of industry in
EPM's market area,its energy demand shows the effects of economic cycles.
For this reason,the sales forecast reflects a 10 year perspective on the
past, which includes periods of growth as low as 51 and as hieh as 12%.
The forecast is conservative considering Colombia's presently favorable
economic outlook. The expected average growth of b.7% per year'comprises
industrial growth at 9.8%, residential growth decreasing from 11.5% in
1972 to 6.2% in 1978, and commercial growth at 8.6%. These rates have
been applied to each type of consumer considering that industrial, residen-
tial, commercial and others are 31%, 50%, 8% and 11% respectively of EPM's
sales.
Power Supply
5.04      Annexes 4A-4B show projected peak demand and energy consumption
in tae interconnected region, with the installed capacity and energy
available from the system during dry hydrological years. The reserve
capacity provided for is about 15%, a security standard adequate in the
Colombian interconnected system.
Alternatives
5.05      ISA studied the least-cost expansion program for the inter-
connected system after 1975, iee, after commissioning of the power plants
presently under construction. Only projects for which firm engineering



- 14 -
data had been developed could be considered as alternatives. These were
Guatape II (280 MW), Chivor II (500 MW), Samana I (572 MW), Mesitas I
(515 MW) and a thermal power project. Since all these projects are needed
for the period up to 1985, the various permutations in the scheduling of the
projects were compared and the sensitivity of the choice to various param-
eters was analyzed. Comparisons were made with discount rates varying
between 8% and 12%, exchange rates varying from US$1 = Col$20 to Col$30,
and fuel costs varying between the present price of Col$90 per ton and the
Col$108 per ton expected in due course. The sequences of plant construction
which scheduled Guatape II as the next generation station were the least-
cost solutions within the whole range of variations of the above-mentioned
parameters.
Return onIvesnt
5.o6        The return on the Project is estimated to be at least 16%
(see Annex 5). In this calculation, the stream of costs includes capital
and operating costs, exclusive of all duties, taxes and depreciation. Shadow
pricing was not considered necessary for foreign exchange or local labor
costs. The stream of benefits consists of the increase in revenues from sales
attributable to the Project. The only alternative to the proposed project would
imply a decision to avoid meeting the forecast increase in demand, thereby
reducing system reliability and affecting adversely economic activity in the
entire interconnected system service area.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      Bank lending to EPM has been confined exclusively to the
Power Department; 90% of the department's borrowing has come from the
Bank (para. 6.04). Foreign currency loans to the other departments
included MDB-loans totalling US$41 million for the water department
and about US$3 million suppliers' credits for the telephone department.
6.02      The consolidated financial situation of EPM as well as that of
each of its various Departments (Power, Water and Sewerage, Telephones)
has been thoroughly investigated and found satisfactory. Since EPM's accounts
are kept strictly separated (para. 3.03), a detailed financial analysis has
been made only for the power department; however, the financial implications
of the other departments on EPMts situation as a whole or on the Power Depart-
ment have been investigated and, where necessary, appropriate covenants were
agreed on (paras. 6.05, 6.o6 and 6.21). Unless otherwise indicated, the
following paragraphs deal only with the Power Department. For a brief descrip-
tion of EPM1s other Departments see Annex 1B.
Finances, Past and Present
6.03      Management of the Power Department of EPM has been prudent and
efficient. Internal cash generation, traditionally the main source of local-
currency finance, has contributed on average about 45% of investment in the
past few years. This was made possible by substantial tariff increases of
6o% in 1963, 39% in 1966 and 37% in 1968, which enabled the level of tariffs
to be maintained in real terms in the face of inflation and achieved rates
of return of 13%-16p on revalued net fixed assets in operation.  More re-
cently, the rate of return has been lower; in 1972 it will be about 9%, the
level generally aimed at by the larger utilities in Colombia.
6.04      Local borrowings have had only a secondary role in EPM financing,
and accounted for about 6% of the total debt outstanding in 1971. Foreign
borrowing consisted almost exclusively of the three Bank loans. Capitaliza-
Aion, after taking into account revaluation of assets (para. 6.13) as of
December 31, 1971 was as follows:

- 16 -
Apart from the revaluation reserve, equity consists of the initial capital,
representing the net value of assets transferred to EPff during the period
1955-59, and retained earnings. The Bank loans were made during 1959-64
and are for periods of 25-35 years at interest rates of 5.5% to 6%. Terms
of the other outstanding debt are shown in Annex 11.
Inter-Departmental Borrowing
6.05      Due to an insufficient departmental cash situation in the Water
and Sewerage Departments, which had not been experienced before, the Power
Department's 1969 cash surplus (about Col$14 million) was loaned to these
departments. Further borrowing increased this debt to Col$ 51.4 million by
the end of 1971. EPM agreed during negotiations to arrangements for repay-
ment of these fbnds to the Power Department. A financing plan, satisfactory
to the Bank, providing for payments of Col$ 5 million in 1973, Col$ 26.4
million in 1974 and Col$ 20 million in 1975 has been submitted. Furthermore,
EPM agreed not to make in future loans from the Power Department to other
departments for terms longer than six months; the aggregate outstanding
amount of such loans will not exceed the total of revenues earned from the
sale of electricity during the month preceding the date of such transfer.
6.06 The proposed loan retains the covenant in Loan 369-Co which stipulates
that each operating department, other than the Power Department, will set
tariffs to yield revenues sufficient to cover all expenses including interest
and depreciation and debt service in excess of depreciatior and leave a
reasonable surplus to finance new investment. The above covenant should be
sufficient to enable the Bank to ask EPM for corrective measures in other than the
Power Department should they become necessary.  (See para. 6.14 for power covenanat.)
Financing Plan
6.07      EPM's financing plan for the power department is, in general based
on the proposed Bank loan and suppliers' credits for financing the foreign
exchange requirements, and on internal cash generation and local borrowing to
cover the local component.
6.o8      Annex 10 shows in detail EPM's financing plan for the Power Depart-
ment for 1972 through 1978. A condensed version covering the project con-
struction period, 1972-77, is given below:

6.09      The Project represents $98.2 million out of the total $105.8 million
of construction expenditures (excl. interest during construction) planned for
the period 1972-1977. The balance corresponds to other expansions which will
be started at the end of this period.
6.10      Net internal cash generation is expected to finance about 41% of
the planned investment and increase in working capital, on the basis of
tariff increases of 25% in 1973 and 20% in 1976 (para. 6.17).

6.11      Suppliers' credits, amounting to US$6.7 million for a term of
12 years at 7.5% interest, are expected to cover the cost of the turbines
and generators except for the 15% down payment. As manufacturing firms
have expressed interest in financing this equipment, EPM should be able to
obtain such credits without difficulty.
6.12      The additional funds to finance the local expenditure on the
Project during 1973-75, amounting to about Col$ 175 million or approximately
6% of the financing plan, would be obtained as follows:
Col$ Million     Year

Total                     175.0
The loan from IDEA (Economic Development Institute of Antioquia, a develop-
ment bank) would be at 14% interest for a four-year term, the loan from the
Local Bank Consortium (three banks) at 15% interest for a seven-year term,
and the EPM bonds at 12% interest for a ten-year term. Evidence of author-
ization for these transactions on the part of the Government has been
received by the Bank as well as the necessary commitments by IDEA and the
bank consortium. The bonds will be used mainly to buy from large landoners
some of the land required by the Project.
Return on Assets
6.13      It was not until 1967 that Colombian law penmitted companies to
revalue foreign debts and assets. Prior to this, EFM assets which were all
stated at historical cost were undervalued because of the depreciating local
value of the Peso and the corresponding, if not always timely, change in the
external value of the Peso. Under earlier Bank loans, therefore, tariff
covenants were based on a contribution-to-investment rather than a rate-of-
return concept. In recent years, however, a flexible exchange rate policy
and the establishment of a realistic local cost index have made it possible
to establish in Colombia a procedure for revaluation of assets which is
satisfactory to the Bank. It should be noted that the Borrower's accounting
practices do not include all of the above revaluation procedures and there-
fore their official financial statements would not be identical with those
prepared for Bank use.
6.14      As a consequence, the most recent Bank power loans to Colombia
(EEEB and ISA) have contained conventional rate-of-return tariff covenants,
stipulating a minimum 9% rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets
in operation. This percentage has proven to be adequate for generating
sufficient internal funds in companies of the power sector and has also been
adopted by the Colombian Government as a yardstick for measuring the adequacy
of power tariffs. During negotiations, EPM agreed to a similar covenant
for the Power Department. The present contribution-to-investment covenants in
prior Bank loans have been rescinded accordingly.



- 19 -
6.15        For determining the rate base and operating income under the new
covenant, depreciation would be calculated by the straight-line method, and
rates would be based on the useful lives of assets but with an average of not
less than 2.5% for hydroelectric plant and 4% for thermal-electric plant.
As in earlier power loans in Colombia, a review will be made by EPM every
three months of the adequacy of tariffs to meet the rate of return target.
Investments in ISA and the revenues received from them (dividends or interest
on ISA shares or bonds) need not be included in these rate-of-return cal-
culations since ISA's statutes provide, through such revenues, for an adequate
return on the investments (presently 9%).
Future Finances
6.16        EPM's Power Department financial prospect is satisfactory
(Annexes 9-11). The forecast of the cost of operations includes increases
of 11% per year, based on EPMVs past experience, as follows: the labor
force is assumed to grow about 3% per year commensurate with the needs of the
expanding power system, and wages to increase about 8% per year to provide
for a rising cost of living and other higher costs. The cost of material is
assumed to increase 11% annually, reflecting past experience and some ex-
pansion in the scope of maintenance work.
6.17        Forecast revenues are based on tariff increases of 25% in 1973,
20% in 1976 and 10% in 1978. Authorization is now being sought by EPM for
the first increase, which would compensate for the impact of inflation in
recent years and enable a rate of return of 9% to be achieved through 1975.
The increases projected for 1976 and 1978 are intended to maintain the rate
of return at this level.
6.18        The debt/equity ratio (after asset revaluation) was 44/56 at the
end of 1971; it is expected to reach about 49/51 in 1975 and subsequently
decrease to about 41/59. The capital structure reflects the favorable
earning level and prudent borrowing policy of the Borrower and is very
satisfactory.
6.19        As shown in the Forecast Sources and Applications of Funds State-
ment (Annex 10), on an annual basis debt service coverage by internal sources
is expected to vary between 1.7 and 2.3, which is satisfactory. During negoti-
ations ERM agreed to replace the 60/40 debt/equity covenant of the previous Bank
loan with a debt service coverage test whereby EPM will not incur debt on behalf
of the Fower Department without the Bank's approval unless its most recent 12-
month internal cash generation from power assets is at least 1.4 times the maximum
debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year.
Audit
6.20        The financial statements of EPM have been audited for a number of
years by Deloitte, Haskins and Sells. These arrangements have been satisfactory.
To ensure that adequate auditing continues, the Bank standard audit covenant is
included in the proposed loan agreement.
Lien Limitation
6.21        In view of EPM's multiple activities, the covenant in Loan 369-Co was
repeated which stipulates that none of EPM's operating departments, other than the
Power Department, may incur debt unless the creditor explicitly waives any right
to repayment from the assets or revenues of the Power Department.

than six months nor in excess of 1 month's Power Department
revenues (para. 6.05);
(g) tariffs for operating departments other than the Power Depart-
ment will be adjusted to provide appropriate revenues
(para. 6.06);
(h) electricity tariffs will be set to produce a minimum 9% rate
of return on the Power Department's average revalued net
fixed assets in operation (para. 6.14 and 6.15);
(i) no debt will be incurred by the Power Department without
the Bank's concurrence, unless its maximum future debt service
is covered at least 1.4 times by historical cash generation
(para. 6.19);
(j)  EPM will have its books audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.20); and
(k)  no debt will be incurred by EPM's operating departments,
other than the Power Department, unless the creditor explicitly
waives any right to repayment from assets or revenues of the
Power Department (para. 6.21).

7.02      With the above agreements reached, the Project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$56 million equivalent, for a term of 25 years including
a grace period of five years.

Water, Sewerage and Telephone Departments
Water and Sewerage Departments
1.        As of December 1971, the Water Supply Department had 126,500
consumers (up 6%) with a total consumption of 82 million cubic meters
(up 8%). Rationing, to which the company had to resort to during the
dry periods at the beginning of each year in the late 1950s and early
1960s, has no longer been necessary in the recent past.
2.        The current water tariff has been in effect since 1969.
Average revenues per m3 sold reached 96 centavos. The rate of return
on investment amounted to about 6.5%. During 1972, a 40% tariff increase
will be implemented; this should enable EPM to strengthen the water
department's internal cash position and help finance its investment
program to a substantial extent.
3.        EPMts sewer network was extended by about 55 km in 1971 and
has reached 1,160 km by the end of that year. Sewer rates are related
to water consumption, increasing sharply for consumptions above 30
cubic meters per month.
4.        The Water and Sewerage Department has a direct labor force of
680 employees.  In addition, about 390 employees for general services are
allocated to this department.
Telephone Department
5.        As of the end of December 1971 there were about 125,000 instal-
lations serving Medellin and some suburban municipalities.  This number
includes about 3,000 public telephones. The tariffs consist of a monthly
fixed charge per line plus a charge for each call. 1971 revenues (Col$
83.6 million) earned a rate of return on investment of about 10.5%.

Average yearly energy output of these plants is 3,890 GWh, giving
an average utilization of 59%.
Transmission
The transmission system consists of 128 kilometers of 220 kV cir-
cuits and 735 kilometers of 110 kV circuits. In addition, there are 160 km
of 44 kVsab-transmission circuits. Substation capacity amounts to about
770 MVA.
Distribution
With the exception of the downtown area of Medellin, where an
underground "network-meshed" type distribution system is installed, over-
head feeders are employed. There are 1,680 km of primary feeders (13.2 kV),
43,500 km of secondary (low voltage circuit), and approximately 600 MVA of
distribution transformers.

Return on Project Investment
1.        The method followed to determine the return on the Project consists
of discounting the net cost/benefit stream attributable to the Project, to
find the rate at which the present worth of the stream becomes zero. In the
calculation, which assumes a Project life of 40 years, the following elements
have been taken into consideration:
Costs
(i)  capital investments, net of all duties and taxes, of the plant
and associated transmission and distribution facilities necessary
to convey the energy generated by the unit to the consumers; and
(ii)  operating and maintenance costs, exclusive of depreciation,
estimated at about Col$ 20 million per year, for the plant and
for the associated transmission and distribution.
No shadow pricing has been considered necessary for foreign exchange or
labor costs.
Benefits
(i) The mininum benefits are deemed to be the revenues from sales
attributable to the Project. These revenues account for the
fact that the Guatape II expansion includes a valuable multi-
annual reservoir which permits a fully regulated operation of
the plant. As a consequence the mode of generation of Guatape
can be optimized in a way which is reflected in the table
below. This table shows how all the annual energy of Guatape
I + II can be used during peak and day time hours, while
without the Guatape II Project there is less total generation
and also different distribution over day and night. The values
given to these energies are in accordance with the corresponding
EPM retail tariffs: CoW1/kwh 48.2, 29 and 20.5, respectively.

interconnected system when other projects, downstream of
the Guatape project,will begin operation. For present purposes

this calculation includes only those benefits attached
to the conmnissioning of the Samana hydroelectric project, for
which it assumes a conservative commissioning date (1983).

Description of the Project
General
The second stage of the Guatape project would duplicate the in-
stalled capacity of the plant through the construction of an identical and
parallel set of intake structures, pressure and tailrace tunnel, underground
penstock and powerhouse. The only major new construction feature is the
heightening of the Santa Rita Dam to create a large reservoir. This storage
would allow the complete regulation of the Nare River inflows and therefore
optimum utilization of the plant's total 560 MW installed capacity to provide
firm peak and energy for the interconnected system. The storage capacity
would be equivalent to one year of average inflow (average rate of 52 m3/sec.)
and therefore could serve as a nultiannual reserve to be drawn upon in dry
hydrological years.
The appraisal report of the first stage (Jan. 1964) describes the
basic hydrological and geological data available at that time. Subsequent
data have not suggested changes in the design for the second stage. The
main features of the dam and spillway which are peculiar to the second stage
and of the other main items are described below.
The Santa Rita Dam
The project involves a substantial enlargement of the existing
Santa Rita Dam. This rock and earth-filled dam is to have a height of
59 meters and total fill volume of 3,115,000 m3. Additional earth fills
of 1,000,000 m3 are to be used for the treatment of low and weak reservoir
rim areas.
Spillway
A chute spillway, 369 m long with a width varying from 80 to 30 m
and reinforced concrete lining, has been designed to discharge the design
flood.. It has an outflow capacity of 1,090 m./sec., corresponding to a peak
inflow hydrograph of 4,440 mn-/sec.
Headworks
The headworks would be a duplicate of those built for Stage I.
The water intake is a cylindrical structure 59 m high connected through a
90-meter vertical shaft to the inlet pressure tunnel. The pressure tunnel
is 4.8 km long, 3.6 m inside diameter.  The penstock is 908 m long, 3.1 to
2,65 meters variable diameter, installed as a free-standing pipe inside an
underground inclined shaft.



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
Powerhouse
The second stage duplicates and is an extension of the first stage.
The extension of the powerhouse consists of two parallel underground caverns,
one to house the generating units and the other for the step-up power trans-
formers. The main hall, to be excavated at a depth of 650 m, is 172 m long,
24.35 m high and 16.75 m wide. Access is through an existing 2.2-km vehicular
tunnel. In addition, a 4.56-km tail tunnel would be built during this stage.
Experience with the Construction of the First Stage
With the exception of the enlargement of the Santa Rita Dam the
rest of the works will be a duplication (see layout in next page) of the
Guatape I project. Therefore the experience obtained during the construc-
tion of the first stage is most relevant and has been considered in the
preparation of cost estimates - including adequate contingencies - construc-
tion schedules and methods of work.
The construction of Guatape I experienced delays of about 2 years.
These were due to unexpected large quantities of water in the low end part
of the project which require a bigger and more complex pumping system. The
excavation methods also had to be changed after a severe accident resulted
in the death of several workers.After some studies, this was attributed to
the detonation of explosives by atmospheric discharges. Finally, other delays
arose from late shipments of foreign manufactured equipment and difficulties
of coordination due to an excessive sub-division of equipment orders. All
these problems have been taken into consideration for the present project.
The foreign exchange costs of the first stage were lower than the
cost estimates and the initial loan was not fully utilized. Local costs were
somewhat higher but were covered almost entirely by adequate contingencies.
On the whole the total cost did not differ significantly from the estimates
mainly due to the favourable equipment prices at the time of bidding and the
generally good geological characteristics of the terrain.

COLOMBIA
The Colombian Power Sector
Organization of the Sector
1.        Public corporations owned by the central, departmental or
municipal governments account for about 90% of the electricity supply
in Colombia, leaving about 10% to industry-owned plant.
2.        Four large utilities supply about 95% of the publicly gener-
ated energy:
Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EBEB)
Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM)
Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca (CVC)
Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica (ICEL)
EEEB and EPM are autonomous, municipality-owned conpanies, generating and
distributing power in Bogota and Medellin, respectively, and the surround-
ing areas. CVC is a multiple-purpose, autonomous and regional entity re-
sponsible for developing mainly agriculture and power in the Cauca Valley;
for the latter purpose it operates Central Hidroelectrica del Rio Anchicaya,
Ltda. (CHIDRAL). CHIDRAL sells energy in bulk to Empresas Municipales de
Cali (EMCALI), the municipal company which distributes electricity through-
out the city of Cali. ICEL is a government company with national respon-
sibility for power supply. It controls 15 subsidiaries which provide
service to 20 of the country's 29 Departments, outside the areas of service
of FEEB, EPM and CVC. ICEL's main subsidiary is Central Hidroelectrica de
Caldas (CHEC), which operates around Manizales in central Colombia. The
remaining Departments are in the southeastern region; they have a very small
and scattered population (5% of the country's total) and limited power facil-
ities.
3.        Two major new institutions, Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) and
Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica (CORELCA), were created in 1967.
ISA was founded as a joint-stock company by the above-mentioned four major
power utilities, each one contributing 25% of the share capital. Its stat-
utory purposes are the interconnection of the sponsors' transmission systems
and the planning, cons ruction, ownership and operation of all major new
generating plants and transmission lines serving the interconnected system.
Guatape II, together with six other projects, was specifically excluded from
ISA's ownership. Interconnection in central Colombia, partly financed by
Loan 575-CO to ISA, was achieved in March 1972, and will be extended to
interconnect the northeastern part of the central region in 1974 (see Map
of Electric Sector). ISA's first major hydroelectric plant, CHIVOR, is now
being built.
4.        CORELCA is a public company, responsible for interconnecting the
major markets of the northern region. Its first important thermal plant
(132 MW) at Barranquilla and 230 kV and 115 kV transmission linking
Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Cartagena are under construction. Comis-
sioning is scheduled for this year.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2 pages
Only about 45% of the country's population enjoys uninterrupted
electricity supply; most of this population is concentrated in the more
highly developed Departments of Cundinamarca, Antioquia, Cauca, Caldas and
Atlantico, where the country's big cities such as Bogota, Medellin, Cali
Manizales, Barranquilla and Cartagena are located. About 30% of the
population has no supply at all; the remaining 25% are supplied in a dis-
continuous manner. The national development program envisages that by
1980 only 5% of the population will have no electricity supply, though
about 15% will have discontinuous service.
Sector Planning
6.        Under the Administrative Reform Act of 1969, the National Depart-
ment of Planning has overall responsibility for coordinating development
of the power sector with the National Development Plan. Guatape II is part
of the national plan. Planning of future generation and high-voltage trans-
mission has now been to some extent coordinated by the creation of ISA.
This coordinated planning should be strengthened and extended to the only-
remaining isolated market, the area served by CORELCA. ISA and CORELCA
have agreed to study interconnection between them. Sub-transmission and
distribution will still be planned by the regional utilities, but national
standardization is being established and a major role for locally manufac-
tured equipment is expected in the future.
7.        Major problems remaining in the sector call for:
(i) Eurther consolidation of ICEL's subsidiaries along regional
lines similar -to CORELCA; six regions have been identified.
(ii)  Improved distribution in urban slum areas.  EFEB and EPM are
now giving hig. priority to this problem.
(iii)  Inproved quality of service in many small towns served by
ICEL's subsidiaries; a program for 127 small towns has been
started with the help of a US$25 million loan from the Inter-
American Developmert Bank (IDR).
(iv) Rural electrification to serve about six million people living
in areas without supply; in this connection basic studies,
sponsored by ICEL, to ascertain priorities are now under way.
(v) Nationwide revision of tariff levels and structures.

Power Department
Notes and Assunptions on Income Statements
1. Revenues from Sales of Power
EPM's revenues from sales of power are based on the generation
and sales forecast of EPM's local market given in Annex 3, the estimated
sales to Interconexion Electrica S.A. (forecast of energy interchanges
in the interconnected system) and, starting mid-1976, the assumed sales
to the proposed ferro-nickel development in Cerro Matoso.
Revenues derived from sales to the local consumers and to the
ferro-nickel development were calculated on the basis of presently pre-
vailing tariffs, increased by 25% (overall) in 1973, 20% in 1976 and 10%
in 1978 in order to maintain a 9% rate of return and a reasonable level
of self-financing. The energy interchanges are based on the ISA tariffs.
The 25% tariff increase is presently being applied for and is scheduled
to be effective at 10% by January 1, 1973, another 10% by April 1, 1973,
and the remaining 5% by July 1, 1973; the resulting impact on revenues
is thus estimated to be of a 20% increase in 1973 and the full 25% in
1974.
2.  Municipal Tax
This is a franchise tax payable to the Municipality of Medellin.
According to present legislation it amounts to 4.h5% of the total oper-
ating revenues. EPM is otherwise tax exempt.
3. Depreciation
A review of the useful lives of EPM's assets showed that the
average rate of depreciation in the past amounted to about 3.5% per year.
With the hydroelectric plant of Guatape I commencing operation, the aver-
age depreciation rate will drop to about 3% per year, a rate which has
been used in the projections.
4. Contributions to ISA
This item consists of EPM's forecast share of the operating cost
of the interconnected system, its debt service and ISA's administration
cost. The expenses have been calculated in accordance with the require-
ments of ISA's statutes.
5. Power Purchases from ISA
The power purchases from ISA represent sales of the partners in
the interconnected system to EPM and, after 1975, EPM's purchases from
Chivor (ISAts first hydroelectric power station).



ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 3 pages
6. Dividends Received from Investments in ISA
ISA's statutes provide that 9% dividends on the share capital
and 9% interest on the bonds have to be paid to ISA's sponsors; they are
ISA s sole shareholders and provide for the larger portion of local cur-
rency financing of ISA's projects by funds for which they receive the be-
fore-mentioned shares and bonds in exchange. Dividend and interest pay-
ments are made only on capital invested in plant which has started
operation.

Notes and Assumptions on Balance Sheets
1. Fixed Assets - Revaluation Reserve
Colombian legislation provides for only partial adjustment of
the value of assets insofar as it permits the foreign outstanding debt to
be revalued using the variations in the rate of exchange between the
Colombian peso and the various foreign currencies; no adjustment of the
asset value concerning the local component is provided for.
In order to arrive at a reasonable rate base which reflects
local inflation and permits arriving at an adequate value of asset repro-
duction cost, the following revaluation method was adopted:
(a)  foreign exchange component of assets  revaluation,
using the variations in the rate of exchange between
the Colombian peso and US dollar;
(b) local exchange component of assets revaluation,
using the variations of the national cost-of-living
index (Obreros).
Basis for the revaluation procedure is the value of assets as of December
31, 1959; at that time the process of asset transfer from the municipa-
lity to EPM had been completed.
The balancing figure resulting from the above-described revaluation
process is shown as "Revaluation Reserve" and represents part of the
"Equity".
2. Investments in ISA
Investments in ISA comprise exclusively the estimated EPM portion
of the local construction cost of the interconnected system, Chivor, Samana
and Las Mesitas I. EPM receives shares and bonds in exchange.
3. Billing Cycle (Accounts Receivable)
EPM's billing procedures are excellent. This is the reason why,
at the end of any fiscal year, the amounts outstanding and unpaid represent
only about 1u months' billing.

Ecological Aspects
1.        The construction of the second stage of Guatape involving the
creation of a large reservoir with a surface area of about 60 sq.km. and
the relocation of about 3,000 people mostly of the town of El Penol re-
quired careful attention to the ecological and human resettlement aspects
of the project. These problems had been under investigation for a good
number of years and various reports had been prepared by Corporacion
Social de Desarrollo y Bienestar (1965), Comite del Penol, EPM (1962),
Instituto Colombiano de Planeacion Integral (1970), Univ. Nacional (1970),
Univ. de Antioguia (1970), Tecnicas Turisticas de Colombia (1970).
2.        In 1969 an agreement was signed between EPM and the municipality
of El Penol providing    the following:
i)  The establishment of a new town of El Penol with adequate roads,
water, sewerage and electric service.
ii) Procedures for compensation in kind (land) and/or money for
inundated property.
iii)  The preparation of development programs in the fields of
fishing, agriculture, forestry and tourism, including train-
ing of the local population and the creation of some cooperatives.
The 1969 agreement has been followed up and at present most of the programs
have been defined and implementation is being started on some of them (land
purchasing, town construction, roads, etc.).
3.        At the request of the Banr  a reconnaissance of the ecological aspects of
the Project has been carried out by a U.S. ecological expert in April 1972. He
visited the region and studied all the previous reports as well as the con-
tractual agreement referred to above. His report makes a number of sug-
gestions regarding potential problems in watershed conservation, natural
resources (mainly soil) management, urban waste disposal and livelihood pro-
spects of the increasing local population. The consultant's survey concluded
that none of the identified potential problems are such as to require changing
the present plans but proposed that EPM create a special office to handle
these matters on a continued basis not only in connection with the present
projects but also regarding the existing EPM's reservoirs. EPM has confirmed
in a letter that it will create this office and will take action on the basis
of the consultant's recommendations. The cost estimate of the project in-
cludes a substantial amount (about Col$ 170 million) to cover the expenditures
required by the relocation of people and environmental control measures needed
during the period of construction.
