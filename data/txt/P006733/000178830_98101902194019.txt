INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMEN4DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
EMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE MEDELLIN FOR THE
GUATAPE la HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Enpresas Pudblicas de Medellin (EPM) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of uS$56 million to help finance
the Guatape II hydroelectric project. The loan would have a term of 25
years, including five years of grace, with an interest of 7-1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's latest economic report on Colombia (Economic Position
and Prospects of Colombia, R-72-21) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on January 14, 1972. Last October/November an economic mission visited Colombia;
its report is in preparation and is scheduled for distribution in April 1973.
The following paragraphs in this part of the Report and Recommendation take
into account the mission's preliminary findings. A draft report entitled the
Development of Colombian Agriculture is also being prepared by a recent Bank
mission and will be available in early 1973.
Agriculture
3.        The Colombian economy continues to depend heavily on agriculture,
despite the fact that the sectorts relative importance in terms of GDP share
has declined steadily from 36 percent in 1950 to 26 percent in 1970. Roughly
two-fifth of Colombia's 23 million inhabitants (mid-1972 estimate) reside in
villages and towns of 1,500 or fewer inhabitants, and 40-45 percent of the labor
force is engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1971 half a dozen agricultural
comnmodities--bananas, coffee, cotton, livestock and meat, sugar and tobacco--
accounted for over three-fourths of Colombia's foreign exchange earnings.
Between 1950 and 1970 agriculture grew in real terms by an average of 3.4 per-
cent per annum, versus 4l.o percent for total GDP. Output growth declined to an
estimated 2.2 percent in 1971 as a result of disastrous rains and flooding in
the countryside, but 1972 promises to be an outstanding year. The Bank's draft
report on Colombian agriculture indicates a 5.5 percent target rate of growth
as feasible for the next 10-12 years, given certain policy improvements. Although
such a rate might seem high by historical standards it is only one percentage point
above that achieved during the 1965-70 period.



-2-
Industry
4.        Manufacturing industry accounts for about one-fifth of
Colombia's gross domestic product, and has consistently outpaced
other sectors in its rate of growth.    Between 1950 and 1970 in-
dustry expanded by an average of 6.3 percent per year, versus 4.9
percent for total GDP.    Output grew by an estimated 8 percent in
1971, and early indications point to at least as much growth in 1972.
Most manufacturing value-added arises from the production of non-
durable consumer goods; and intermediate products, consumer durables
and capital goods add les,s than 15 percent of the total.   The domes-
tic market as it now stands is not sufficient to allow for economies
of scale in the production process for many items, a fact that is
increasingly recognized by the industrial community.    Many industries
are able to produce goods at prices which are competitive in inter-
national markets, and there is a growing interest in export sales, as
evidenced by Colombia's success in steadily reducing its dependence on
coffee exports.
Employment
5.        One of Colombia's most challenging development goals is to
generate jobs for its unemployed and underemployed citizens.    The na-
tional labor force is expanding by an estimated 3.5 percent per year, one
of the highest such rates in the world, and at least 5 million job oppor-
tunities will be needed for the existing unemployed and new entrants to
the labor market between now and 1985.    Most visible unemployment is found
in the urban areas, where immigrants from the countryside have had to
settle in slums and shanty-towns because of the lack of jobs and adequate
housing.   The International Labor Office (ILO) and the Bank have calculated
that real GDP growth on the order of 7-8 percent per annum would be neces-
sary, together with a variety of specific policy measures, to reduce unem-
ployment to manageable levels by 1985-90.    The Bank economic mission has
calculated the domestic savings and foreign borrowing requirements associ-
ated with such high growth rates, and has found them to be feasible so long
as external resources continue to be available on favorable terms.
Development Planning
6.        In recognition of the severity of the unemployment problem,
the 1971-74 Development Plan spells out a growth strategy addressed to the
creation of new jobs in the urban sector. The diagnosis of Colombia's
national planning agency is that it is aggregate demand that needs to be
stimulated, and in particular demand for urban housing and items of mass
popular consumption.   The official planners have concluded that only in this
way can Colombia develop a broad-based economy characterized by economies of
scale and low unit costs of production.



-7.       There are in fact four "istrategies" enunciated in the Plan:
urban development, increased agricultural productivity, export promotion,
and action to achieve a more equitable distribution of personal income.
The National Planning Department, however, is concentrating on the urban
development strategy.    Reflecting frustration over the high rate of un-
employment, the planners have focussed on residential construction as the
key to a "massive structural shift" in the economy.    One concrete measure
to implement this aspect of the Plan has been the establishment of a new
savings and loan system, with both deposits and loans subject to indexing
to provide full monetary correction.    The idea is to stimulate a substantial
inflow of funds into the system in order to finance a dramatic increase in
the pace of urban construction (primarily middle-class housing).
8.        One of the assumpuions in the Plan -- the existence of a great deal
of unutilized plant and equipmenc in Colombia's manufacturing sector -- is
strongly challenged by organized industry groups.   Moreover, there is concern
in Colombia that the proposed ho6using financing program of the planning agency,
if carried out on a large scale, will over-stimulate aggregate demand, thereby
creating inflationary pressures that could prove difficult to dampen.     The
new Plan strategy, which is being actively debated in public and private
circles in Colombia, will-be discussad in detail in the Bank's forthcoming
economic report.
The Outlook
9.        The near-term outlook for the Colombian economy at the moment is
somewhat mixed.   Output growth is strong, and a 7 percent real rate of in-
crease in 1972 is quite possible.    Coffee prices are high and shipments are
moving well.   Non-coffee exports are booming, and will approach the value
of coffee shipments in 1972.    Merchandise export earnings in 1972 should
surpass US$800 million, some US$150 million above 1971 receipts, and net inter-
national reserves of the Bank of the Republic reached nearly US$275 million
(a historical high) at the end of September 1972.    On the negative side is an
accelerated rate of price inflaticn, with consumer prices likely to rise by
1L-15 percent, on the average, during 1972.    Ihis is far above the 9-10 per-
cent average increase for the 1967-72 period as a whole.     Should this rate
of inflation continue for long, Colombia will undoubtedly encounter a number
of serious problems.    Trade difficulties could arise, particularly if depre-
ciation of the exchange rate falls behind domestic price increases.     Indica-
tions are that the peso will have been depreciated 9 percent vis-a-vis the
U.S. dollar in 1972, slightly less than during 1971 despite a much higher rise
in prices.   Thus the index of real peso depreciation (rate index divided by
price index) will fall back to only 2-3 percentage points above the level of
early 1967 when the flexible rate policy was introduced.    However, since
prices in the United States and other trading countries have risen by some
20 percent during the same interval, the pace of devaluation has been fast



- 4 -
enough to secure a substantial competitive gain for Colombia.    Looking
ahead to 1975 and beyond, two faotors cloud the balance of payments
picture.   First, it is not unrealistic to visualize a cyclical upturn
in world coffee supply in response to current high prices, which would
force prices downward.   Second, it seems inevitable that by 1975 or 1976
Colombia will begin importing crude petroleum on a substantial scale.
Domestic requirements for diesel fuel, motor gasoline, and other products
are rising far more rapidly than new oil reserves are being discovered in
the country.   Thus, it is now as inportant as ever for Colombia to maintain
the agricultural and industrial export drive to the fullest extent compatible
with minimum domestic supply requirements.
Sources of External Finance
10.       The main sources of external financing for Colombia in the 1963-71
period are shown in Annex I.   In the past, IBRD, IDB and AID have provided
about four-fifths of total external financing to Colombia.    The IDB has
assisted projects in low-cost housing, university education, agrarian reform,
ports, electric power, water supply, transportation, and industry.    AID
has shifted the emphasis of its lending in recent years from program to
sector loans, particularly for education, urban development, and agriculture.
Thanks to the relatively large assistance from official development agencies,
Colombia's debt structure is favorable; suppliers' and financial credits
account for only one-tenth of the total medium and long-term debt.    This
has been an important factor in holding down the debt servicing burden despite
the large capital inflow.
Creditworthiness
11.       In Colombia it appears feasible to aim at maintaining a 7 percent
real annual growth rate.   This would necessitate a continuation of a strong
expansion of non-coffee exports, however, and a steady inflow of long-term
development capital from abroad.    Some of this capital will have to be
provided to finance local costs, because in spite of Colombia's efforts to
mobilize domestic resources in support of its development program, external
assistance in excess of the foreign exchange component of development projects
will continue to be required.    Colombia's public debt service ratio is low,
relative to many other developing countries (13.5 percent in 1971).    Public
long-term external debt repayable in foreign currency amounts to US$2,018
million at the end of 1971, or US$1,354 million excluding undisbursed commit-
ments.   Colombia is, therefore, judged creditworthy for substantial amounts
of foreign loans.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
12.       The proposed loan, which would be the fifty-second made to
Colombia, would bring the total amount of Bank loans to that country
to US$997.6 million (net of cancellations).    Of the foregoing amount,
US$761.8 million is now held by the Bank.    IDA has made one credit
of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia in 1961.
13.       Disbursements have been completed on twenty-six loans and the
one IDA credit.   Of the twenty-four effective loans with undisbursed
balances, progress on the majority is satisfactory.    IFC has made invest-
ment and underwriting commitments in 18 enterprises in Colombia, total-
ling about US$20 million of which IFC now holds US$9.94 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, the IDA credit, the IFC
investments as of November 30, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
14.       Bank disbursements as a percentage of total disbursements by
official lenders to Colombia are expected to peak at about 40 percent
in 1973-74 and then decline.   The Bank's share of total debt service is
also projected to peak at about 40 percent in 1974-75, and the Bank
share of total debt disbursed and outstanding should stay at about 33
percent during the next several years.
15.       For this fiscal year, two further loans to Colombia are planned.
One would be for a third education project and the other for a development
finance companies project.   As regards FY 1974, project preparation is
going forward on two agricultural projects, one industrial and possibly
a sixth railway project.   It is still too early, however, to determine
which of these projects will advance sufficiently to be ready for presen-
tation to the Executive Directors in that year.
16.       Over the past few years, Bank lending in Colombia has become
increasingly diversified as Bank activities expanded and as the Bank
assumed greater responsibilities as head of the Consultative Group for
Colombia.   Increasingly, projects involving Bank loans in agriculture,
industry, and the social sectors were developed.    While the Bank's efforts
continue to be directed toward production-oriented operations in support
of economic growth and related export expansion objectives, we are now seek-
ing, in cooperation with Colombia, to develop projects in such a way as to
combine increasing output with maximum benefits in terms of employment and
improving the income of the poor, particularly in rural areas.    Such
further shift in emphasis of Bank lending, however, requires a new approach
in many instances and hence, project preparation and appraisal are likely tc
be more time-consuming than in the past.    Also, at least in the initial
stage, such projects are likely to be of much smaller size than the tradi-
tional large infrastructure projects.



- 6 -
17.       Keeping the foregoing considerations in mind, we expect
over the next several years to do the major part of Bank lending in
Colombia in the agricultural and industrial sectors.   In evaluating
the suitability of projec-ts in these two sectors for Bank lending, four
main objectives would be pursued: efficient growth of output; poten-
tial contribution to foreign exchange earnings or savings; creation of
employment; and improvements for the lower income groups.    he other
major focus of our activities would be in such social sectors as education
and water supply.   In the project areas which have been the traditional
sectors of Bank lending - i.e. electric power, transportation and tele-
communications -- we would continue to be active if important institution-
building objectives can bie achieved.  In formulating conditions for
lending, the Bank would a:Lso continue to cooperate with the Government
in its efforts to improve its fiscal system and in developing institutions
capable of increasing public savings.   As the Government's development
activities progress, we shall maintain close contact with the Colombian
authorities to adjust our own lending program to any major changes in the
Government's priorities.
18.       In the past, one of the most important aspects of the Bank's
operations in Colombia has been the financial assistance given to the
power sector through 17 loans to seven public utilities totalling US$288.1
million.   Bank involvement with the electric power sector began with
the first economic mission which visited the country in 1949. In lending
for the sector in Colombia, the Bank gave priority to building up electric
power capacity in major urban centers in line with the Government's
strategy, and to meeting -the urgent demand backlog, as well as providing
support for Colombia's growing industry.   An important objective was to
establish financial self-sufficiency of power companies and to help create
an interconnected network in the central region of the country -- which is
the basis for a national interconnected power network in the future.
As part of its lending, the Bank has also financed a number of studies
with the aim of identifying projects to satisfy the rapidly increasing
power needs of Colombia.
19.       Through the proposed loan for the Guatape II hydroelectric
project, the Bank would continue its association with Colombian efforts
at the sound development of the electric power sector.   As discussed in
greater detail in Parts III and IV below, the proposed loan breaks new
ground in a number of aspects: on the project level, it includes expansion
of electricity distribution to low income areas; and for the first
time in a Colombian power project, ecological issues have been thoroughly
taken into consideration.   For the sector as a whole, the operation



- 7 -
involves a coumtry-wide power development plan to be carried out
by the Colombian Government; among other things, this plan would
address itself to further institutional improvements and take into
account several suggestions on power investment, tariff policy, and
rural electrification, which emerged in part from Bank staff evalua-
tion of the sector.
PART III - POWER SECTOR IN COLGMBIA
20.       Colombia's power resources are large.    Abundant rainfall in
the three Andean mountain ranges gives the country an excellent hydro-
electric potential; an estimated 60,000 MW are available at known sites.
Of these, about 30,000 MW are located in the high Andean regions. The
largely unexploited plain of the Llanos, which covers more than half the
country in the southeast, is also estimated to have a potential of
30,000 MW.
21.       Total installed capacity in the public sector was nearly 2,100
N4W in 1970, of which about 1 ,465 MW was of hydroelectric origin, con-
centrated exclusively in the Andean region.    This latter figure represents
only 5 percent of the total hydroelectric potential of that region; thus,
the overall power potential of the country has hardly been tapped. About
90 percent of the exploited hydroelectric potential is concentrated within
the Bogota-Medellin-Cali industrial triangle, which also includes the
Manizales power system (see attached map).    About 65 percent of the popu-
lation of Colombia lives in these areas.
22.       Colombia also has an important thermal potential.    Coal reserves,
the large scale exploitation of which is under study, are estimated at
18 billion tons.   In the northern zone of the country along the Atlantic
Ocean about 22 percent of the total population relies almost exclusively
on thermal generation.   In the future, when this region is connected with
the central system, it is expected that thermal power will give way to
hydro-electric power on the basis of cost advantage.
23.       The power sector of Colombia has developed rapidly during the last
two decades. Investment in power, after increasing unevenly from 1950 to
1963, has remained fairly constant since then at some $60 million per year.
Total installed generating capacity,including captive plants, increased almost
ninefold, from 270 MW in 1950 to 2,330 in 1970, or an average annual growth



rate of about 11.4 percent.    Installed capacity per capita for the
country as a whole, however, is only 103 watts, less than in most
Latin American countries.   Only about 45 percent or the population
enjoys uninterrupted electricity supply; about 30 percent has no
supply at all, and the remaining 25 percent is supplied part time.
2h.       Electricity in Colomrbia is generally supplied through public
corporations owned either by the central, departmental or municipal
governments.   Captive industrial plants, both public and private,
account for about 10 percert of installed capacity.
25.       The public service is supplied almost wholly by the following
four entities:
(a)  Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica (ICEL), a central
government company, which, through 15 departmental and 13 minor
subsidiaries, supplies electric energy to most of the areas in
the northern, central, and western regions of the country not
served by the large generating companies mentioned below.
(b)  Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), a municipal utility
for electrical service only, which supplies energy to Bogota and
the populous Cundinamarca Department directly, and by bulk supply
to distributing agencies and subsidiaries of ICEL in rural regions
in its service area.
(c) Empresas Publicas de NLedellin (EPM), a municipal utility provid-
ing electricity, water and sewerage, and telecommunication
services, which supplies electric energy directly to Vedellin
and the Department of Antioquia, and by bulk supply to the
Electrificadora de Antioquia, a rural distributing subsidiary of
ICEL.
(d)  Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Va1le del Cauca (CVC), which
supplies energy to the Valle Department, mainly by bulk supply
to Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI) and to other rural
distributing agencies, subsidiaries of ICEL, and CVC.
26.       The considerable expanse of the country and its rugged mountain
chains have isolated the various regional centers, which have traditionally
developed separately their regional institutions and economic resources as
well as their own power systems. One of the results has been the fragmentation
of electric service. In the case of the ICEL system its affiliated entities
are mnall and the areas they service are generally uneconomic. The individual
systems are not sufficiently connected with other areas and as a result are
not able to provide satisfactory service. The entities affiliated with ICEL
often suffer financial and technical difficulties.



- 9 -
27.       An important step towards the rationalization of the power
sector was the establishment, in 1967, of Interconexion Electrica,
S.A. (ISA).   ISA, a corporation owned in four equal parts by EEEB,
EPM, CVC/Chidral and ICEL was formed to interconnect tho sponsors,
electric systems and to plan, construct, own, and operate new power
generating plants in the interconnected system, covering to date the
central zone of the country.   The Bank was instrumental in the estab-
lishment of ISA and has granted it two loans for an interconnection
project (US$18.0 million) and a loan, in cooperation with the IDB, for
the Chivor hydroelectric project (US$52.3 million).   The interconnected
system represents about 80 percent of the country's power consumption.
28.       For the northern coast area, not yet interconnected with the
ISA system, an important development was the establishment, in 1967, of
the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica (CORELCA).   CORELCA
operates in seven departments previously served by ICEL's subsidiaries.
It plans, constructs, and operates new power generating plants and
transmission lines in that area.
29.       The Bank has been Colombia's main source of foreign financing
for the power sector; through its loans it has made available about
73 percent of the total external financing in the sector between 1950
and 1970.   As shown in Annex II, through the end of 1972 the Bank hal
extended 17 loans to seven Colombian utilities, totalling US$288.1 million,
of which 14, totalling US$199.8 million, have been fully disbursed.
Existing generating capacity financed by the Bank amounts to 1 ,000 MW,
or about 50 pei7cent of total public sector capacity.
30.       Over the last five years the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) has also assumed an important role in the financing of the sector.
The IDB has lent US$118.9 million for the following projects: Alto
Anchicaya (US$60 million), Chivor I (US$33.9) and for a transmission and
distribution project executed through ICEL (US$25 million). The IDB and
Bank both financed the Chivor I project.
31.       While Bank and IDB support of ISA has helped provide considerable
rationalization in the planning process for a major part of the sector,
overall coordination of sector planning is still limited.   1 jor problems
remaining in the sector call for: (a) further consolidation of ICEL's
subsidiaries along regional lines similar to CORELCA; (b) improved distri-
bution in the urban slum areas. EEEB and EPM4 are now giving high priority
to this problem; (c) improved quality of service in many small towns
served by ICEL's subsidiaries; a program for 127 small towns has been
started with the help of a US$25 million loan from the IDB; (d) rural
electrification to serve about six million people living in areas without
supply;   in this connection basic studies sponsored by ICEL to ascertain
priorities are now under way; and (e) a nationwide review of tariff levels
and structure.



- 10 -
32.       After discussions with the Bank in connection with the
proposed loan, the Colombian Goverrment has begun to prepare a power
development plan that will address the aforementioned problems and
will include institutional changes necessary to increase the planning
and operational efficiency of the sector on a national scale.    The
plan will propose a long-term generation and transmission program aimed
at the integration of regional systems and will also serve as a guide
for investments in urban and rural service systems.    Further, in view
of the rapidly mounting power demand and other claims on transferable
savings of the economy, the plan will propose new mechanisms for raising
local funds in Colombia for the sector, as well as foreign financing.
The power plan will be coordinated with Colombia's overall development
plan and it is expected to be concluded early in 1974.    The Colombian
authorities have expressed their wish to consult with the Bank during
the preparation of the plan and also during its implementation.
33.       At present, Colombia's approach to external lenders for
financing of power is made ditficult by a lack of coordination among
the numerous companies operating in the sector and the absence of any
institution with a sector-wide strategy for external financing. The
resulting fragmentation of demand for, and procurerent of, imported
equipment is clearly an obstacle to the orderly development of the sector.
The implementation of the institutional changes to be proposed by the power
development plan would help rationalize the financing of the sector and
promote greater involvement by the countries participating in the Consulta-
tive Group for Colombia.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       Guatape II is the second stage of a hydroelectric project identi-
fied in 1960.   Ihe Bank helped finance the first stage -- through the Nare
Project (Loan 369-CO) -- which included a small diversion dam and the first
four generating units (280 MW).    The Tare project has now been completed.
and is in operation.   The feasibility studies for the proposed project
were prepared by Colombian and foreign consultants and concluded in 1971.
Appraisal of the project was carried out in March 1972 and loan negotiations
were held in October 1972.    The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. Josue
Ortiz, Manager of EPM, and the Government's delegation by Mr. Rafael Marino,
from the Planning Office.   A loan and project summary is attachedl as
Annex III to this report and ar appraisal report (PU-104a) is being circu-
lated separately to the Executive Directors.
Description and rurpose of the 1roject
35.       The Guatape II Project consists of (a) construction of the 280 MW
second stage of the Guatape hydroelectric power station, raising total
capacity to 560 MW.   This involves heightening the Santa Rita dam and



duplicating most of the civil and electromechanical features of the
first stage.   The higher dam will permit better control of the Nare
river and facilitate future hydroelectric projects;   (b) a 230 kV
power transmission line from Guatape to EPM's load centers and associ-
ated sub-stations; (c) expansion of the distribution system in EPM's
service area; and (d) training of EPM's personnel in distribution
techniques. The proJect also includes the resettlement cf the community
of El Penol, which will be flooded by the expanded reservoir for the
project.
36.       The primary purpose of the project would be to help meet the
growing demand for electricity by industry, commerce, and households
already included within Colonbia's central region interconnected system.
The need for the 280 MW increased generating capacity is based on the
requirements of the entire system, although the project will primarily
serve the Medellin area.   A forecast of system demand prepared by ISA
and the National Planning Office assumes an annual growth of demand of
8.7 percent in the EPM system, and 9.5 percent for ISA's interconnected
system.
37.       The distribution system expansion will improve the service to
areas where present facilities are overloaded and will provide for
connecting new consumers in or near Ibdellin who do not have access to
electricity.   Mbst of these new consumers are located in low income
areas.   The distribution facilities proposed under the project require
additional specialized training of EPM's personnel.    This will be
accomplished through a progran which contemplates overseas training in
distribution, planning, desigrn, operation and maintenance techniques.
Project Costs and Financial Plan
38.       The total project cost, excluding interest during construction,
is estimated at the equivalent of US$9&.2 million, including local costs
of US$49.1 million and foreign costs of US$49.1 million.    Total financing
required including interest on the Bank loan during construction would
be US$109.9 million.    Ihe proposed Bank loan of US$56 million, would
finance the following items:



- 12 -
US$ I-llion Equivalent
(i)   62% of the main civiL works contracts -
dam and power station                                27.5
(ii)   Foreign costs of electro-mechanical equip-
ment, excluding turbines and generators
(iii)   Foreign costs of transmission line and sub-
station materials and equipment                       3.2
(iv)   Foreign costs of distribution equipmert and
training                                              6.6
(v)   50% of the cost of engineering                        2.3
Sub-total (L6i of total cost)                      5 .1
Plus interest on the Bank loan during
construction period                               10.°
Total Bank loan                                56.o
39.       The major electromechanical equipment -- turbines and generators --
for which the total estimated cost is US$ 8.8 million, would be financed
through US$6.7 million of supp:Liers' credits.   EPM would finance the 1;
percent down payment on the contracts, as well as the interest during con-
struction in the case of these credits.    EPM has obtained preliminary credit.
commitments from manufacturers and banks in Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan,
Germany, Sweden and the United States.    The physical characteristics of
the Guatape II project are such that no other components are suitable fcr
long-term financing under parallel supplier credit arrangements.
ho.       About US$38.2 million will be obtained from EPM's internal cash
generation.   In addition, EPNI would obtain about US$8.2 millior from local
borrowing.
41.        Some US$4.3 million of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed
against local currency expenditures (US$2.1 million for engineering
services and US$2.2 million for civil works), but since EPM would be fin-
ancing part of the foreign exchange requirements the Bank loan would remain
somewhat lower than, the foreign exchange component of the project.

Rate of Return
42.       On the basis of the financial revenues from the project
alone, the minirum return on investment is estimated to be 16 per-
cent.   Additional benefits will flow from the effects of improved
river control on the Samana plant, which is planned for construction
in the late 1970s and commissioning by 1983.
The Borrower
43.       The project will be carried out by EPM in the period 1973-77.
EPM was established in 1955 and is one of the best organized and admnini-
stered public utility enterprises in Colombia.    It is responsible for
providing Medellin, the second largest city in Colombia, with electricity,
water, sewerage and telephone services.    The company also provides bulk
electricity to the area surrounding Medellin.    EPM has a nine-member
Board of Directors; the Board appoints the general manager, who is the
company's chief executive officer.    The internal structure of the company
is organized along functional lines so that each manager, in his respec-
tive professional capacity, is responsible for all sectors of the enter-
prise.   EPM's accounts, however, are kept separately by sector, thus
providing a precise breakdown of assets and liabilities, expenses and revenues.
44.       The consolidated financial situation of EPM as well as that of
each of its departments (Power, Water and Sewerage and Telephones) is
satisfactory.   In the future EPM intends to maintain for each of its
departments a level of tariffs which will yield at least sufficient revenue
to cover admiinistrative expenses, debt service in excess of depreciation
and make a reasonable contribution towards new capital investment.
45.       Internal cash generation in the Power Department has financed
on average, about 45 percent of investment over the past several years.
This was achieved through the implementation of a tariff policy which
enabled the real level of tariffs to be maintained in the face of inflation
and attained rates of return of between 9 and 16 percent on revalued net
fixed assets in operation.    In spite of the above, EPM's electricity tar-
iffs are the lowest in Colombia, reflecting the company's efficiency and
favorable hydroelectric resources.    The tariff structure is satisfactory;
charges for industrial consumption are substantially lower than for resi-
dential and commercial consumption.    Low income residents enjoy a sub-
sidized tariff.   The company has undertaken that it will continue to
maintain electricity tariffs which will generate an annual rate of return
of at least 9 percent on revalued fixed assets in operation.



- 14 -
46.       EPM's Power Department debt/equity ratio after asset
revaluation was 144:56 at the end of 1971; it is expected to reach
about 49:51 in 1975 and subsequently decrease to about 41:59.    Ihe
capital structure is satisfactory and reflects the favorable earnings
level and prudent borrowing policy of the Borrower.
47.       EPM employs a total staff of about 3,300, of which about
1,400 are concerned with the operations of the Power Department (about
2 per MW installed). This labor force is reasonable considering the
scope of the Department's activities and compares favorably with
similar companies elsewhere.
Resettlement and Ecological Aspects
48.        The heightening of the Santa Rita dam will flood the small
town of El Peniol, which has a population of about 3,000, and about
US$6.0 million of the total project cost will be devoted to resettling
these families.    In 1969 an agreement was signed between EPM and the
Municipality of El Penol providing the following:
(i)  The establishment of a new town of El Pehol with adequate
housing, roads, water, sewerage and electricity services:
(ii)  a procedure for compensation in kind (land) and in cash
for inundated property, and
(iii)  the preparation of development programs in the fields of
fishing, agriculture and forestry.    These programs include
the establishmen-b of a number of cooperatives designed to
assist the reset-tled inhabitants in finding employment.
The 1969 agreement is being implemented.   EPM has informed us that it
will report to the Bank semi-annually on the progress of the resettle-
ment program.
49.       A reconnaissance of the ecological aspects of the Guatape II
project was carried out in April 1972.    As a result a number of recom-
mendations were made regarning potential problems in watershed con-
servation, natural resources (mainly soil) management, urban water
disposal and livelihood prospects of the increasing local population.
The survey concluded that none of the potential problems required changes
in the project but proposed that EPM establish a special office to handle
these matters in connection with all its reservoirs.    EPII has confirmed
that it will establish this office and that it will take action on the
basis of the survey's recomrnendation.

Loan Disbursement and Procurement
50.       The proposed loan would be disbursed according to the
schedule included in Annex III.   No retroactive financing is con-
templated.   International competitive bidding procedures will be
followed in placing contracts for the major civil works and equip-
ment purchases.   Two large civil engineering contracts suitable
for widespread international competition will be awarded: one for
about US$20 million for the intake towers, tunnels and cavern of the
power station and the other of about US$14 million for the heighten-
ing of the Santa Rita dam.   Minor civil engineering contracts for
roads, town relocation and reservoir rim treatment would not be
financed by the loan and would be awarded to local firms.
51.       The equipment to be financed by the loan is not presently
manufactured in Colombia.    However, there is a possibility in the
future that local industry might be able to manufacture a small
amount of the equipment required.   Accordingly, a margin of preference
of 15 percent, or the actual custom duty, whichever is lower, would be
allowed for the purpose of comparing bids for equipment manufactured in
Colombia. Any tariff preference resulting from Colombia's membership in
the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) would be eliminated for
the purpose of bid evaluation since EPM is exempt from import duties.
Consultants
52.       In carrying out the project, EPM will be assisted by INTEGRAL,
a Colombian consulting firm with considerable experience in hydro-
electric projects.   Foreign specialists will assist INTEGRAL in review-
ing: (a) seismic design; (b) the ecological aspects of the project;
and (c) the procurement of electro-mechanical equipment and the super-
vision of its installation.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Enpresas Publicas
de 1Medellin and the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Colombia and the Bank, as well as the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii),of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.



- 16 -
54.       ihe draft Agreements contain provisions to reflect the
various arrangements described in Part IV above, including the usual
covenants for public utilities projects.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PAIT VI - REOOMMENDAT ION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Summarized below is the current status of al1 loans signed but
not fully disbursed:
Loan 499  -  Telecommunications I, US$16 million, June 1967.
The main works of the original project have now largely
been completed; however, a number of installations, some
of which were added to the project when it was revised
in 1069 and 1970, are behind schedule mainly because of
delays in building construction. The undisbursed balance
of US$0.7 million is expected to be disbursed by December
31, 1972, the revised closing Date of the loan.
Loan 502  - Irrigation (Atlantico I), US$9 million, June 1967.
This project has suffered from unexpected difficulties in
selecting suitable irrigable soils.   Also, difficulties
were experienced in constructing the main irrigation pumping
plant and the main drainage pumping plant.   Construction
is about two years behind schedule but is now expected to be
completed by the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1973.
Loan 534  - Development Finance Companies II, US$12.5 million, May 1968.
This loan is fully committed for approved sub-projects, and
the undisbursed balance of US$0.4 million is expected to be
completely disbursed by the June 30, 1973 Closing Date.
Loan 536  - Water Supply (Bogota I), US$14 million, June 1968.
The major part of the First Bogota Project is in operation.
kater service in most areas with poor service is rapidly
improving. The operating performance of the E&npresas is
good.   The remaining works are proceeding at a pace partly
adjusted to needs dictated by the borrowing entity's temporary
budget constraints, but should be completed between mid- and
end 1973.   The budget constraints are the results of apparently
temporary shortfalls in projected borrowing sources.   The undis-
bursed balance of this loan is US$1.7 million.
Loan 537  - Electric Power (Bogota), US$18 million, June 1968.
The project financed by this loan is substantially completed.
Lower than anticipated participation of joint financing
agencies together with foreign cost increases due to the



Isl-;of 9
devaluation of the U.S. dollar led to ce-rdjocnticn      9
funds in mid-1972 anorg the loarn categories.    Delays in the
defin_tior of the distribution exoansions have caused late
bidding -for distribution equipment.    The Closing Date has
been extended to the end of 1973 to allow completion of the
project.   Cf the loan proceeds, US$2.8 million are undis-
bursed.
,oere 550  - Highway V, US$17.2 million, July 1968.
Project im.plementation has been lengthier and more costly
than foreseer because of design changes, pour performance
by contractors, rainy seasons appreciably heavier thar.
normal, delays inr payments to contractors and delays exper-
ienced by them in obtaining equipment and spares.      Due to
the cost increases, the Bank's participation in the categor-y
for civil works has been reduced from 45 to 26 percent in
order to allow the Bank to continue its association with the
project.    The project is about 80 percent compaeted and
41 .7 million are undisbursed.
Loan 551   - Railways V', US1E-.3 milliorn, July 196.
In October 117C, US$5.Q million of the loan was cancelled
after the Borrower obtained financing for a portion of the
project under a; barter agreement with Poland.    Disburtlements
under the loa  were not quite as rapid as forecast anG the
Closing Date was extended first to June 30, 19J72, and then to
December 31, l972.    Only US$72,0OC  is still undisbursed.
Loan 552   - Education I, U4$7.6 million, July 1968.
School construction is virtually completed but the procurement
of furniture and equipment is seriously delayed.     The executirg
entity for the project has promised to strengthen its procure-
ment unit.    The Closing Date has been extended a second time
to June 30, 1W73.    The supply of qualified teachers for some
technic4i subjects remains insufficient; facilities for their
training would be included in a third education project which
has recently been appraised.    US$2.1 million are undisbursed.
Loan 575  -  Electric Power (Interconnecticn), UST$;18 millior, December 1968.
The project as originally described in the Loan Agreement
started operation in November 1>71.     Mainly due to the fact
that the joint financirg arrangements raised more funds than
expected during the appraisal, the 230 kV line Guatape-
Barrancabermeja, which will incorporate the northeastern region



ANNEX II
rnge 5 of 9
into the interconnected system, was includod in tho loan.
Completion of the extension is scheduled by mid-1974.
US$7.2 million are undisbursed.
Loan 624  - Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969.
The project has been affected by many problems, one of which
is that INCORA now prefers to concentrate its resources on
farmers who have already benefitted from the agrarian reform
program, thus excluding areas presently undergoing such
program. As only US$2.9 million of the US$17 million loan
has been disbursed through November 22, 1972, the Government
has presented a proposal for enlarging the project area and
improving project management.   A mission is scheduled for
January 1973 to analyze these suggestions.
Loan 625  - Development Finance Companies III, US$25 million, June 1969.
US$24.9 million of this loan is committed for approved sub-
projects. To permit completion of disbursements the Bank
has agreed to extend the original Closing Date from September
30, 1972, to December 31, 1973.   US$3.2 million are undisbursed.
Loan 651  - Livestock II, US$18.3 million, December 1969.
Disbursements under this loan have been affected by policy and
administrative problems. Demand for the loans has been reduced
by uncertainties associated with lack of clarity in application
of the Agrarian Reform Law.   However, the Government feels
that proposed amendments to the Law, which have passed the Senate
and are awaiting House concurrence, should help to resolve the
uncertainties; higher beef prices should also contribute to an
improved investment climate. During the last supervision mission,
the Colombians requested some changes in the Project designed
to facilitate loan implementation.   The changes mainly strengthen
the administrative organization, expand the project areas and
increase the flexibility of the executing agency in fixing the
term and grace period of the sub-loans.   In addition to improv-
ing administration, these changes should increase access by
smaller ranchers to loan funds.   The proposed changes have been
accepted. ke will continue to keep this loan under close
supervision in order to assess the effects of the new measures
on the progress of disbursements. US$16.0 million are undis-
bursed.

Loarn 69  - Education II, US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Delays in procurement of furniture and equipment are respor-
sible for the slow rate of project execution. As indicated
above for Loan 552, improvement is expected when the procure-
ment unit is strengthened.    US$5.2 million are undisbursed.
Loan 680  - Highways VI, US$32 million, June 1970.
Ihis project st;arted slowly and to date only about hall of
planned expenditures have been made.    There have been sub-
stantial cost overruns which can be ascribed to the same
reasons as for Loan 550-CO and to insufficient preparation and
insufficient supervision of the works.    The Borrower has
recently taken action to improve supervision of the contractors
but the loan is still being kept under close review, partic-
ularly in view of serious financial difficulties presently
being experienced by many of the contractors.    US$15.9 million
are undisbursed..
Loan 681  - Electric Power (Chivor I), US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Progress of the main civil works contract is generally satisfac-
and in agreement with the contractual dates.    Bidding for the
rest of the civil works financed by the Bank is proceeding as
planned.   Higher than expected prices for equipment, due partly
to the revaluation of various European currencies and the yen,
together with changes in the access road program, have. substar-
tially increased the total cost of the project.    Recently we
have received a revised cost estimate and as of October 1972 total
project costs are estimated at US$14i million, that is,about
US$26 million more than estimated in the Appraisal deport.    ISA
plans to finance the cost overruns with unallocated funds of the
IBRD and the IDB loan and with suppliers credit and a direct loar
from a group of foreign banks.    The Bank is reassessing the
economic and financial viability of the project in view of the
cost overruns.   US$36.5 million remain   undisbursed.
Loan 682  -  Cali Water Supply and Sewerage, US$18.5 million, June 1970.
The project was delayed for about one year due mainly to a change
in the Cali Municipal Government that occurred after the loan
was signed.    The Board of EYCALI changed the general manager
twice, and a number of key personnel resigned. Weakened admin-
istrative capacity has accentuated the tight financial situation
and the need to raise revenues.    Presently, a large cash deficit
and lack of financial management threaten the project and the
financial viability of the company.    Last NTovember the Govern-
ment "intervened" ENICALI in view of its poor financial and adminn-
istrative situation.   A new Board has expressed its willingness

to take prompt corrective action and the aik- pia'ri: to
review the situation early in 1573.   JS$15.. million are
undisbursed.
Loan 738  - Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage, US$2 million, May 1971.
Const;-uction on this project was delayed due to slow project
design and administrative problems with the consultants and
the Borrower.  The situation is now improving.   Contracts
for equipment and materials have been awarded and construction
has begun.   US$1.9 million are undisbursed.
Loan 739  -  Land Settlement Caqueta I, US$8.1 million, May 1971.
This loan is financing primarily farm credits, road construc-
tion, schools and health centers for a colonization project
administered by the INCORA (Agrarian Reform Agency).   Road
and building construction work is proceeding on schedule, but
there was initially some delay in working out the details of
administrative arrangements between INCORA and the Banco
Ganadero for the operation of the credit program.   Additional
problems were caused by a shortage in the supply of suitable
livestock.   As the result of recent discussions these prob-
lems have been resolved.   US$7.3 million are undisbursed.
Loan 740  -  Telecommunications II, US$15 million, May 1971.
Owing to the higher-than-expected price for toll ticketing
equipment, in part due to currency changes, the amount of the
loan will be insufficient to cover the cost of the items
originally included in the loan.   TELECOM is presently explor-
ing the possibilities of obtaining additional funds, failing
which the purchase of some of the lower-priority equipment
of the project will have to be postponed.   US$14.2 million are
undisbursed.
Loan 741  - Water Supply (Bogota II), US$88 million, May 1971.
Preparatory works for the tunnel construction such as access
roads and construction camps have started and design and
preparations for the other works are proceeding on schedule.
Contracts for operational equipment havebeen awarded. US$82.8
million are undisbursed.
Loan 742  - Development Finance Companies IV, US$4o million, May 1971.
Only US$0.7 million of this loan remain uncommitted.   Dis-
bursements are proceeding ahead of schedule. US$18.8 million
are undisbursed.

will be followed in placing contracts for the
major civil works and for equipment purchase.
For the purpose of evaluating bids, a 15 per-
cent preference would be allowed for equipment
manufactured in Colombia.   The EPM is exempt
from import duties; the bidding would
therefore not be affected by regional prefer-
ences.
Consultants:                 Consultants will be retained by EPM to assist
in design, preparation and evaluation of bids.
INTEGRAL, a Colombian consulting firm has been
retained by EPM for this purpose.    Foreign

(a) seismic design; (ii) ecological aspects;
and (iii) procurement of electro-mechanical
equipment and in its installation.
Rate of Return:               The minimum economic rate of return is estimated
at 16 percent.
