Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Aniiex 1 for key performance indicators):
The Community Infrastructure Project (CIP) represents the first (pilot) phase of a longer-term  program  of small-scale
infrastructure improvements (sub-projects) to poor communities in Jordan This pilot phase would be completed in about three years
and will test the opportunities for developing: (a) income-generating activities in economically deprived areas; (b) approaches to
promote local participation in the identification of priority infrastructure needs; (c) criteria for eligible appropriate investments, and
(d) detailed relocation plans in squatter settlements to enable upgrading basic infrastructure in subsequent phases of the CIP The CIP
is one component of the Government of Jordan's (GOJ's) Social Productivity Program (SPP), aimed at addressing the problem of
poverty The SPP is a comprehensive program to address the conditions of the poor and the unemployed through (i) improving the
targeting and coverage of social assistance to the poor and unemployed; (ii) upgrading or providing essential physical and social
infrastructure to the poor through the CIP; and (iii) generating employment through the provision of skills training and
milcroenterprise development The CIP's primary development objective is to improve the living conditions of the poor through the
provision of essential physical and social infrastructure services  A secondary objective is to improve the capacity of selected
institutions to deliver infrastructure services to the poor in an effective, efficient and targeted way. The CIP intends to reduce the
hardship of poverty through infrastructure provision, but it is recognized that it cannot by itself reduce poverty

3. Benefits and target population:
The CIP is aimed at the poor in underdeveloped urban squatter settlements and refugee camps (Part A of the CIP) and low-
income municipalities and villages (Part B of the CIP) in Jordan   The CIP will improve the living and safety conditions of
approximately 290,000 people in 27 poor urban settlements and 1 3 million people in approximately 300 municipalities and villages
through the provision of. safe access roads; street paving and lighting, drainage systems; efficient potable water supply and sanitation
services, and social infrastructure such as schools, health centers and community and youth centers. These investments will (i) reduce
flooding and the incidence of water-borne diseases, (ii) improve overall health, and (iii) mitigate environmental pressures In addition
to developing income-generating activities in distressed communities (through the pilot program activities), the program will create
temporary employment opportunities for the unemployed poor through labor-intensive, small-scale public works
The project will improve the efficiency of public services through improvements to data collection, surveying, and studies to
improve the identification of beneficiaries Finally, the CIP will improve the capacity of local governments to identify and prioritize
needs with the participation of beneficiaries and to improve planning, cost-effective design, implementation and maintenance of
essential infrastructure.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period 5 years
Project Imnplementation
ExIecuting Agencies Part A of the CIP will be implemented by HUDC. A full-time project management unit (HUDC/PMU),
which will report to the Director General of HUDC, will manage Part A HUDC will be responsible for all planning, studies, design,
tendering, contract award, and supervision of construction, commissioning and transfer of completed works to the public institutions
responsible for operations and maintenance With respect to work to be carried out within camps, HUDC will carry out its activities
in coordination with the Department of Palestinian Affairs (DPA), which will coordinate with camp improvement committees (CICs)
and the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA). Because it is likely that a large portion of the work under the CIP will
involve water and sewerage works, HUDC will work closely with the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) in the planning, design, and
implementation of such works WAJ may be fully responsible for implementation of highly specialized investments, such as sewage
disposal facilities, and when such investments are financed by other donors.
Part B of the CIP will be implemented by CVDB A full-time project management unit (CVDB/PMU), which will report to the
Director General of CVDB, will manage the project CVDB will work with in-house experts and consultants, as required, to carry out
infrastructure needs assessment studies, survey communities, and prioritize investment needs The consultants will provide technical
support in aspects of public participation and awareness, prioritize needs, select least-cost options of priority investments, manage
construction and quality control, monitor and evaluate project performance and report on project progress CVDB will coordinate
with the Ministry for Municipal and Rural Affairs and Environment (MMRAE) in all aspects of project implementation.
Part C of the CIP will be implemented by HUDC, CVDB and the MOP. The MOP will oversee the implementation of poverty
surveys and pilot projects. The MOP will also coordinate the application of the findings and recommendations of poverty surveys and
studies
Sub-project cycle Part A: During project appraisal, 14 squatter settlements and 13 refugee camps and the basic infrastructure in
each of them were identified. In the case of refugee camps, the priority investments were based on a list of basic needs identified by
CICs. in the case of squatter settlements, priority investments were based on surveys conducted by HUDC. HUDC, as administrator
of Part A, will be responsible for planning, design, procurement. supervision of implementation and commissioning of completed
works for transfer to concerned municipalities, public utilities or sectoral ministries responsible for operation and maintenance of such
works.
Part B The general infrastructure needs of about 300 poor municipalities and villages were identified during appraisal. In the
absence of reliable poverty indicators, data from the National Aid Fund (NAF) on the number of families receiving NAF aid were
used as a proxy poverty indicator. Unemployment data, which is generally a good indicator of poverty, was not reliable and could not
be used. However, poverty surveys are included in the project to help improve identification mechanisms to be used in future phases
of the CIP. The priority needs in these eligible areas were based on a list of needs identified by the municipalities and village councils
available at CVDB. This list was not all-inclusive and did not directly take into account the views of the beneficiary population.
During appraisal 12 communities and their basic infrastructure needs were reviewed and a program of eligible investments were
identified for implementation in the first year of the CIP. However, since among the needs identified by the local councils there were
many investments not considered of priority, it was agreed that CVDB will undertake in the first year of the CIP detailed surveys and

assessments of such needs in the remaining communities (about 290) and take measures to promote participation of the beneficiary
population in the selection of priorities. CVDB, with the help of consultants, will also undertake socio-economic and affordability
studies and develop public awareness programs to promote participation of beneficiary populations in the process of prioritizing basic
infrastructure needs and to test beneficiaries' willingness to pay.
CVDB, as administrator of Part B, will assist eligible communities in the prioritization of needs, and, prior to approval of sub-
projects, will appraise, approve and enter into implementation agreements with concerned municipal and village councils The local
councils, with the support of the regional engineering units of the MMRAE, will prepare designs and bidding documents, contract out
the works following national procurement methods, supervise construction and assume responsibility for maintenance of completed
works   CVDB will monitor implementation on a periodic basis to ensure the investments are made in accordance with
implementation agreements. CVDB's regional offices will disburse funds to beneficiary local councils for payments to contractors for
services rendered under approved contracts. CVDB will also provide, with the help of consultants, support to improve institutional
capacity of local councils in all aspects of sub-project development and management. This support will improve identification of
priorities with local participation, design using least-cost methods, and maintenance of completed works. A detailed methodology for
CIP implementation is given in the Operations Manual.
Part C The project management unit in the Ministry of Planning (MOP/PMU) will manage poverty surveys and studies which
will be used in the SPP (NAF component and poor communities identification under the CIP). MOP/PMU will also manage the pilot
projects with the support of CVDB, concerned ministries, authorities, NGOs, UNDP and beneficiaries. The findings obtained from
these pilot projects will be used to design a comprehensive program consisting of similar sub-projects for implementation in a second
phase of the CIP. Details on the implementation of Part C are given in the Operations Manual.
Project Coordination
Overall SPP coordination will be the responsibility of the MOP/PMU. Subsidiary agreements between the MOP and HUDC and
the MOP and CVDB will be made, specifying the responsibilities of HUDC and CVDB in implementing the project. Initially, the
MOP/PMU will also manage poverty and unemployment surveys. These surveys will eventually become the responsibility of the
Social Survey Unit (SSU) to be established in the MOP
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The HUDC/PMU and CVDB/PMU will submit quarterly and annual progress reports, annual audit reports, and a completion
report to the MOP/PMU, which will monitor project implementation and the achievement of project objectives and provide the Bank
with relevant reports on a quarterly and annual basis The Bank will supervise the program with four missions the first year, three
missions the second year, and two missions per year thereafter. A comprehensive review will be carried out at the end of the first year
of the CIP and a midterm project review will be conducted in the second year (September 1999) Missions will be staffed with
engineering, financial, social development, and institutional development experts Performance indicators relating to development
objectives, i e., the provision of essential physical and social infrastructure and institutional capacity building, will be monitored and
evaluated on the basis of data gathered by the implementing agencies and measured against agreed targets.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project
* Improve infrastructure extent and efficiency to relieve constraints to sustained growth  Document number and date of latest
* Reduce poverty and unemployment and improvement in the living conditions of the poor.  CAS discussion: Report No. 14999-
JO, October 24, 1995.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The overall government strategy to combat poverty in Jordan has been to design and implement growth-oriented economic reforms,
which have been supported by the World Bank-sponsored Economic Reform and Development Loans. Since 1996, however, the
Government has also placed a high priority on addressing the immediate problems of poverty and unemployment. The long-term SPP
subsumes the economic reforms, the direct actions on poverty and unemployment, and sector-specific actions, all intended to increase
the productivity of Jordanian society The issues addressed by the direct action program on poverty and unemployment and the

made available to most of the population. Major improvements
can be made in the short run through better targeting of the poor
and efficiency measures such as converting in-kind assistance to
cash.  The institutions that identify the poor also require
strengthening.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project
The CIP addresses (i) substandard living conditions through a program of investments in essential physical and social
infrastructure in areas inhabited primarily by the poor; (ii) capacity building in the implementing agencies and local governments to
promote local participation in the selection of priority investments, in the use of least-cost methods, and in timely sub-project
implementation, and (iii) unemployment of the poor through increased construction activity under the project and the design of pilot
sub-projects to investigate income-generating activities in economically deprived areas.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Establishing an autonomous social fund to implement the entire SPP, and therefore the CIP, was considered, but was rejected for
various reasons. First, there are existing agencies with the experience to implement the components  Second, it is feasible for
coordination and overall management of the SPP to be achieved through a small project management unit at the MOP In particular,
the NAF and microenterprise components of the SPP would add an unacceptable degree of managerial complexity if handled together
with the CIP and training and employment support components by a social fund. Finally, the government has decided that
sustainability of the SPP could be accomplished better by strengthening program delivery of existing government institutions already
responsible for the type of activities included under the SPP

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
- Infrastructure investments may not be sustainable in areas where there are land tenure issues The CIP will not include
subprojects which would require acquisition of land in areas with unresolved land tenure issues The CIP requires that eligible sub-
projects are located in areas with easements and rights-of-way, and land is acquired for the construction of buildings.
- Achieving cost recovery at levels higher than what the general population is paying is not feasible The selection of CIP
investments will be done with the participation of community residents, taking into account affordability of various service levels,
however, it still may not be possible to achieve cost recovery. Cost recovery will be in accordance will lawful charges and will not
exceed the amounts paid by others for similar quality of services according to standard practice in Jordan. Also, projects wlil be
designed to meet minimum service quality standards and will follow cost-minimization approaches This will enable cost recovery to
the degree possible

- Project design and supervision of municipal development operations need to focus principally upon strengthening local councils
The CIP includes consultancy services to assist municipalities and MMRAE's engineering units. which provide technical support to
municipalities, in sub-project identification and prioritization, including promoting the participation of beneficiary populations
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
H M The King, H R H. The Crown Prince, the Prime Minister. and several Ministers have publicly endorsed the SPP The
borrower has also formed full-time task forces for the preparation of each of the various components of the SPP and an SPP steering
committee chaired by MOP to provide policy guidance. Furthermore. PMUs have been established within the MOP, HUDC and
CVDB and key staff are already identified
12. Value added of Bank support
Value added from Bank participation in the CIP comes from several factors
* The Bank has considerable experience working with HUDC's predecessor. the Urban Development Department, in upgrading
slum areas in Jordan under Urban Development Projects 1, 11, and III, and working with CVDB to implement similar
improvement projects through local councils  The Bank also worked with the CVDB on a 1994 green-cover report on
lntergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Municipal Finance.
* Initial Bank support helped the Government to define the broad outlines of the SPP. Experience gained in earlier urban projects
has enabled the Bank to help design the project and include existing institutions as implementing agencies
* The Bank provides a degree of international experience and analytical rigor in community development projects not otherwise
available to the Government
* Bank support is currently the largest source of official funding for the project, without which the program's impact would be
greatly reduced.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (Annex 4):    [ ]  Cost-Benefit Analysis  [x]  Cost Effectiveness Analysis   []   Other]
Annex 4 explains in detail the logical framework used in the project analysis. Highlights are given below
Infrastructure investments in squatter settlements and refugee camps (Part A of the CIP) have been selected on the basis of a plan
to improve the level of infrastructure services to a defined minimum  level  Alternatives for addressing each deficiency were
considered and the least-cost option, consistent with sound engineering and design standards, was selected Infrastructure investments
in urban areas not yet identified will be based on the same criteria as investments already chosen  A traditional rate-of-return
calculation, which normally relies on increases in property values for multi-component upgrading, cannot be done because changes in
land prices for land in untenured and low-transaction areas are not easily available or considered reliable However, evaluations of
similar Bank-financed projects carried out by the Operations Evaluation Department yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of about
22 percent.
Sub-projects in municipalities and villages (Part B of the CIP) will be selected based on the same cost-minimization approach
However, investments will not be chosen on the basis of an overarching plan for the community Instead, funded sub-projects must
meet specified criteria, and ranking will be determined by measures of community commitment and evidence of high concentrations
of poor residents
Fiscal Impact (for all projects)
The CIP is estimated to cost $140 million for the initial three to five years. The GOJ will contribute $30 million (including
the DM20 million debt swap with Germany). The World Bank would provide $30 million, UNDP will provide a $1.7 million grant,
and Germany has agreed to provide a DM20 million grant and DM20 million through a debt swap. The Government is seeking
financial assistance from Italy, the Arab Fund, USAID, the Islamic Development Bank and Norway which are assumed to contribute
about $64 million  Should cofinancing in the amount of about U$64 million has not become effective by July 31, 1998, the
Government must show that adequate funds are available from other sources otherwise the program will be scaled down The CIP will
require counterpart funding of about $6 million per year and will increase the annual level of capital investment by about $28 million
(including donor funding), compared to total government capital expenditures estimated at about $500 million per year over this
period Depending upon the terms of funding from donors, the GOJ will incur an additional, but manageable, debt service obligation
in subsequent years as a result of the project



Project Appraisal Document                                                                                           Page 8
Country: Jordan                                                                 Project Title: Community Infrastructure Project
The CIP is intended initially to provide a conduit for targeted donor and GOJ programs to help poor communities, but the system
of prioritizing sub-projects according to how they affect the poor is expected to be eventually incorporated into regular public
programs. The system of considering residents' ability to pay in deciding levels of infrastructure investments and services can
promote increased cost recovery in other, non-CIP areas in which low-income residents cannot afford full cost-recovery tariffs
All of the proposed CIP investments are presently covered by GOJ policy and regulation with respect to the financing of recurrent
costs. Those mechanisms are not satisfactory in all cases, and other Bank-assisted operations are seeking to address them in the areas
of transport, power, agriculture, water, education and health. The CIP is not a suitable vehicle for improving recurrent cost-recovery
practices in general, and it is expected in any case that the light urban infrastructure proposed under the CIP will incur low recurrent
costs of approximately one to two percent of investment costs per year (about US$1 2-2 4 million)
Although the CIP provides grant financing for some of the capital costs of infrastructure targeted to poor communities, direct
cost-recovery from beneficiaries under the CIP will largely follow existing practice. For example, Part A will cover a portion of the
implementing agency's capital costs and the capital costs normally charged owners. Households will be expected to pay all normal
connection and usage costs such as water and electricity tariffs. For Part B, a portion of the capital costs will be covered by the CIP.
Households will generally be assessed the same charges as prevail in existing infrastructure programs. No assistance for usage tariffs
is anticipated.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):          NPV=US$ N/A           million; FRR=  N/A
No single financial assessment is possible for the CIP, as sub-projects to raise infrastructure service levels will be selected based
on minimum standards and cost-minimization options. Calculation of traditional financial rates of return in multi-component projects,
where changes in land prices are used to measure the benefits of the investments, will not be possible due to the conditions of land
tenure in squatter settlements and refugee camps. Furthermore, as noted earlier, only partial cost recovery is anticipated as most
beneficiary communities may not be able to afford to repay such investments.
15. Technical Assessment:
Projects funded by the CIP will follow internationally acceptable standards for design, construction, and operation and
maintenance (O&M) and will be technically sound. Environmental and social concerns will be taken into account as part of project
planning, design and construction. The CIP will consist of simple small civil works that will be designed and implemented by
agencies with good records in execution of small works. Because it is likely that a large proportion of investment will involve
rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage services, coordination with WAJ will be required in investment design and
implementation The investments themselves will be done by HUDC in accordance with WAJ's requirements, WAJ, however, will be
responsible for O&M of water and sewerage services.
First Year Program
During appraisal, investment programs for three urban settlements under Part A and fourteen municipalities and villages under
Part B, estimated to cost a total of about US$8 million equivalent, were reviewed in detail and approved for further preparation.
Tender documents for these investments will be completed by December 1997 so that procurement can take place as soon as financing
is available. Other Part A investments in the pipeline are under preparation and should be completed within the first eighteen months
of the CIP. Additional investments under Part B are also under development, and preparation should be completed within the first
eighteen months of the CIP.
The criteria for the selection of appropriate investments in municipalities and villages is given in the Operations Manual This
criteria is essentially based on the level of poverty and service deficiency, and requires that beneficiary local governments demonstrate
administrative and financial capability to properly operate and maintain the works funded by the CIP NAF and other poverty data
have been used to identify eligible areas This data will be complemented by poverty surveys and studies carried out through the CIP.
Within selected communities, eligible projects will have to be oriented to the needs of the poor. CVDB consultants will ensure that
investments will benefit the community as a whole. Eligible communities will be asked to prioritize investment requests and, to the
extent possible, contribute to the cost as well as to indicate commitment to maintenance and operations of facilities that are the
responsibility of local governments. Sectoral ministries responsible for the infrastructure being considered under the CIP will
participate in planning, design and implementation, as they will assume full responsibility for running such facilities upon
commissioning of completed works.

16. Institutional Assessment
a. Implementing agencies: HUDC and CVDB are well known to the Bank They have a good implementation record, and have
significant experience in implementing similar programs However, consultants to strengthen CVDB and to complement HUDC will
be necessary, particularly to develop computerized management information systems and to introduce principles for promoting local
participation, for targeting beneficiaries, for introducing least-cost methods of project analysis and design, and for building
institutional capacity within local governments in the design and implementation of projects PMU directors and key staff at
HUDC/PMU and CVDB/PMU have already been identified and official appointment should be done soon. These staff participated in
project preparation and appraisal for which interim budgets were made available by each implementing agency.
b Project management: Overall CIP oversight will be the responsibility of MOP/PMU, a new unit to be established at the MOP. This
unit will also coordinate other SPP components, some of which may be financed with the support of bilateral donors. The MOP/PMU
will hire consultants, as needed, to assist in the management of the CIP. MOP Director for Infrastructure and staff participated in
preparation and appraisal of the CIP. This directorate will play a key role in the MOP/PMU.
17. Social Assessment.
The target populations of the CIP are urban poor living in squatter settlements and refugee camps and rural poor living in low-
income villages and municipalities throughout the Kingdom.  HUDC has conducted socio-economic studies in some squatter
settlements and a report summarizing the findings will be completed soon. Under this first phase of the CIP, there will be no
involuntary relocation of people As subsequent phases of the CIP are likely to involve involuntary relocation of people, under this
project financing will be provided for a comprehensive relocation plan that will enable smooth implementation.
18. Environmental Assessment           Environmental Category      [ ]  A        [ ]  B          [x]   C
The CIP is classified as a category C project. All investments will be of small size and will result in reductions in environmental
hazards. The CIP includes four small off-site sewage treatment and disposal facilities to service refugee camps and nearby areas.
These will be funded by bilateral donors and government The sizes and location of these investments are not yet known, but
agreement was reached during appraisal that environmental impact assessments (ElAs) will be performed during the planning stage,
and that facility design will take into account mitigative measures recommended by the ElAs. WAJ will be responsible for all
applicable studies, planning, ElAs, design and construction, commissioning and eventual operation and maintenance of the facilities in
an environmentally sound manner. WAJ will consider options ranging from improved on-site disposal to regional system integration
There are no known archaeological sites in the program areas. The Department of Antiquities will be consulted in the event that
any archaeologically significant finds are uncovered
19. Participatory Approach:

Note IS = information sharing, CON = consultation, COL =collaboration
Part A  Community participation in the selection of priority investments is already institutionalized within the refugee camps
CICs have prepared a list of priority needs, which have been forwarded to DPA HUDC will coordinate with DPA regarding all
investments proposed for the camps. All work carried out within the camps will be prepared in coordination with the CICs.
Within squatter settlements, HUDC has significant experience consulting with residents to determine priority needs and work
arrangements HUDC has already conducted socio-economic surveys regarding the needs in these settlements, which have been used
in planning and design of upgrading programs. HUDC will carry out studies with respect to the need for relocation, which is likely to
be a necessary complement to street widening investments to be carried out in a later phase of the CIP.
Part B: Community participation in the selection of investments in muncipalities and villages is generally less common than in
urban areas. As a first step in selecting appropriate investments, CVDB will review investment requests from local governments In
addition, CVDB will, with the help of a team of specialists in engi.aeering, sociology and economics, assess the most urgent
infrastructure needs and the cost-sharing capabilities of beneficiaries and will, with the assistance of professional communications
experts to be selected to develop public awareness programs, inform local governments and beneficiaries about CIP objectives.

Local participation in the first two years will focus on decision making and, to the extent feasible, local contributions to
construction and/or maintenance. For some types of investments, one measure of community preference may be willingness to
contribute financially to the investment
Part C An SPP task force will design pilot projects with the help of qualified consultants, NGOs with appropriate experience
and pilot beneficiary populations. In these projects, communities will be organized and encouraged with specific examples to identify
community infrastructure that would provide the greatest stimulus to job-creating business investments  During implementation,
beneficiaries will work hand-in-hand with the CIP team of experts, NGOs, concerned sectoral ministries and public authorities
20. Sustainability
CIP Sustainability The government has expressed strong commitment to the overall SPP and its sustainability It views the CIP
as a long-term program, of which the current project is the first phase  The methods developed under Part C of the project,
particularly the experience gained through pilot projects to promote economic activities, would be expanded as rapidly as is feasible
during the second phase, which would begin as early as three years from the start of the first phase This progression supports the
government's goals of decentralization and geographically broad-based development
Investment Sustainability Sustainability of CIP investments will be enhanced due to local participation in selection and thereby
local ownership. Most investments will be small civil works requiring only periodic repairs Water and wastewater investments will
be maintained by WAJ, and other sectoral investments will be maintained by the appropriate agencies Where local governments are
responsible for operations and maintenance, contractual agreements between HUDC and CVDB and beneficiary local governments
will be made  CIP institutional capacity-building components will improve local government capacity for maintenance of local
services

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Undermining of existing infrastructure financing mechanisms for municipalities and villages: Local governments generally
have very few sources of funding. Municipal and village infrastructure investments are therefore often funded through CVDB loans
extended to credit-worthy (solvent) local governments Local governments repay these loans from general revenues, such as property
taxes, fuel-tax revenue sharing and proceeds of usage fees There is a risk that local governments may misunderstand the CIP to be a
replacement financing mechanism, i e, established to fund all infrastructure investments, or, local governments not eligible for the
CIP may place political pressure on CVDB to change the terms of existing loans or to cancel repayment. To try to mitigate this, a
public awareness program will clearly specify criteria for municipality and project eligibility. The program will clearly differentiate
CVDB's system for financing non-poor communities and non-vital infrastructure from the CIP's system for funding basic
infrastructure needs in areas of concentrated poverty  CIP launch workshops will train CVDB staff to make municipalities and
villages aware of the highly specific eligibility and implementation aspects of the CIP.
Perception that the CIP will "regularize" the status of refugee camps: There has been little infrastructure investment in
refugee camps outside of UNRWA and DPA due to the fear that government investment in the camps would signify "regularization"
of refugees, and therefore relinquishment on the part of refugees of the right to return and the right to compensation. The CIP,
however, in no way affects the status of refugees. Improvements to necessary infrastructure affects the health, safety, and sanitation
conditions of the community as a whole, but do not assume or imply ownership of dwellings within the camps. In order to reduce the
perception that the CIP regularizes the status of refugees, the government will continue to present its arguments on this point to the
public.

Jordan: Community Infrastructure Project
Detailed Project Description
Introduction
1.     The Government of Jordan (GOJ), concerned with rising poverty and unemployment, has
developed a program entitled the Social Productivity Program (SPP), which forms the basis for
Government policy and a framework to solicit donor assistance  The SPP is designed to address in a
comprehensive way the conditions of the poor and the unemployed. This program  has three main
thrusts: (1) improving the targeting and coverage of social assistance to the poor and unemployed; (2)
upgrading or providinig essential plhysical and social infrastructure to the poor; and (3) generation of
employment through two parallel tracks, demand-driven skills training and credit facilities and services
to promote microenterprise development
2.     The Community Infrastructure Project (CIP) is the first component of the SPP to be prepared,
appraised and ready for Bank and donor funding. This pilot phase would be implemented in about three
to five years and will test the opportunities for developing: (a) income-generating activities in
economically deprived areas; (b) approaches to promote local participation in the identification of
priority infrastructure needs; (c) criteria for eligible appropriate investments. and (d) detailed relocation
plans to enable upgrading basic infrastructure in subsequent plhases of the CIP. The CIP is designed to
improve only the living conditions of the poor. It is designed as a public sector instrument for financing
essential infrastructure in areas where there is a concentration of poor households and where essential
infrastructure services are below a minimum acceptable standard. The total financial needs of the CIP
have been estimated oni the order of JD465 million. It should be noted, however, that appraisal of the
CIP was based on limited studies of essential physical and social needs in squatter settlements and
refugee camps and municipal and village communities in the Kingdom.  During CIP appraisal, a
representative sample of investment needs for such areas, prepared by the CIP task force to preliminary
design levels, were reviewed in the field.2  This review concluded that the overriding need in most
communities is jobs. Therefore, the proposed program will include five pilot projects to test
opportunities for income-generation activities integrating, to the extent possible, the various componenits
of the SPP. These pilot projects may provide the necessary knowledge and methodology to prepare
similar comprehensive programs over a larger geographic area in the Kingdom, and expand the CIP
objectives to include integrated economic development goals in which infrastructure would support
economically and socially viable employment-generation initiatives. On this basis, the pilot phase would
be the first package of investments identified by the World Bank (Bank-financed program), which
represents a modest slice of the bigger program of essential needs, is estimated to cost about US$140
million (about JD 98 million) over a period of about three to five years. The investment program  is
grouped in separate packages to give donors a menu of choices ready for financing 14 out of 27 squatter
settleimients and 13 refugee camps, and about 300 out of 600 municipalities and villages in the country.
The entire CIP includes about 27 squatter settlements and 13 refugee camps (Part A of the CIP) and about
600 (now being considered to be reduced to about 433 local councils) municipalities and villages (Part B
of the CIP) in the Kingdom The total investment needs (JD 465 million) were based on the following
breakdown by major component JD 244 million for Part A, JD 205 million for Part B; and JD 16 million
for program management, design and supervision, consultancy, pilot projects, surveys and training
2      During pre-appraisal and appraisal Bank missions visited 12 municipalities and villages (or 4 percent of
about 300 communities considered in the first phase program) and 15 squatter settlements and refugee
camps (or about 55 percent of 27 settlements considered in the first phase program).

Bank-Financed Project
3.     Project Objectives. Strategy and Design Concept. The principal objective of the CIP is to
improve the living conditions of the poor through the provision of essential physical and social
infrastructure services. A secondary objective is to strengthen the capacity of selected institutionls to
deliver infrastructure services in a more effective, efficient and targeted way to benefit the poor and their
communities. It is clearly recognized that this project can alleviate some of the hardship of being poor
but that infrastructure cannot by itself make people less poor. The Bank-financed project, however, has
been designed as a pilot phase to test opportunities for income-generating activities which would be
designed in partnership with beneficiary communities and use this experience in the design of
comprehensive programs to expand the CIP objectives.
4.     Within the CIP, the strategic consideration was whetlher to concentrate oni the needs of the poor
or on projects most likely to directly help the poor, regardless of where they live. The division of the
program in two parts -- A and B -- the first including underdeveloped poor settlements (squatter
settlements and refugee camps), and the second including poor municipalities and villages throughout the
Kingdom, reflects the outcome of that deliberation. The worst living conditionis were found in rural
communities in the southern and northeastern areas and the Jordan Valley, and in areas of dense
concentrations of poor inhabitants who were generally without formal land property rights (squatter
settlements and refugee camps). Part A of the CIP thus focuses on area-wide comprehensive upgrading
of the latter. This approach also lends itself to rapid implementation since consultations with residents
and feasibility studies and preliminary designs of some areas were available. Part B of the CIP, on1 the
other hand, is designed to provide discrete service upgrading to more isolated and dispersed groups of
the poor throughout the Kingdom. The investments financed bv Part B will be smaller, and the process of
communities generating and bringing forward  proposals will necessarily take longer.   These
communlities will need assistance to identify their priorities and to design and implement projects.
5.     The criteria for identification of candidate investments under Part A and Part B are based on
deficiencies in infrastructure service levels or performance below a minimum standard. Candidate
investments so identified will then be compared to a menu of CIP-eligible projects and subject to a cost-
minimization analysis both in terms of alternative solutions and the design of the projects. Both Part A
and Part B will serve beneficiaries whose needs are not easily addressed by existing programs. In the
case of Part A, since beneficiaries have n1o property rights, it is very difficult for municipalities to
provide them with infrastructure, which requires owners to financially contribute to the capital cost
Under Part B, local authorities and implementing agencies are generally too poor to shoulder their share
of infrastructure cost and thus have not been able to provide some essential infrastructure services. CIP
will thus channel funds for the benefit of poor households without property rights and to poor local
authorities in support of projects for low-income residents. Without the CIP few if any of these areas
could be served with additional essential infrastructure at this time.
6.     In support of the primary objective of ameliorating poor living conditions, the framework for
selecting investments is a model of raising infrastructure service and performance levels to a minimum
standard in deficient areas where income levels are low. The minimum standard is defined in terms of
the level of service or performance necessary for safe and healthy inhabitation. Within the identified
infrastructure deficiencies, priorities were set which ranked first, investments related to public safety
(mostly high risk flood mitigation and soil stability projects) and dangerous environmental and healtlh
risks, such as exposed raw sewage discharges and unsafe potable water supply. Part A focuses on
locations where high concentrations of poor households could be identified. A comprehenisive plan for



Annex 2
Page 3 of 8
raising critical infrastructure services to minimum levels was devised. Few technical alternatives exist
for most simple problems but more costly problems, such as sewage collection and disposal, technical
alternatives including regional collection systems under consideration by the Water Authority of Jordan
(WAJ) will be considered. For Part B, the method of selecting investments will be somewhat different.
They will be individual projects prepared by local governments with the assistance of regional
engineering units of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Environment (MMRAE) as needed,
against criteria for both eligible projects and qualified beneficiaries. The eligible project criteria is listed
in the Operations Manual. Determination of acceptable targeting to the poor and of participation by the
beneficiaries in the identification and selection process will be incorporated in the project design criteria
for Part B.
7.     Project Description. The Bank-financed project consists of three parts: (i) Part A, upgrading on-
site and off-site essential infrastructure in about 14 squatter settlements and 13 refugee camps located in
the central region (Greater Amman, Zarqa, Russeifa, Jerash, Madaba and Irbid); (ii) Part B, upgrading or
providing priority essential infrastructure in about 300 low-income municipalities and villages
throughout the Kingdom; and (iii) Part C, program management, project design and supervision,
consultancy services and training to strengthen the capacity of implementing agencies and local councils.
Consultanits will carry out poverty-related surveys, studies to identify and prioritize essential needs and
to prepare projects for CVDB's appraisal, and to design and implement pilot projects for income-
generating productive activities linking the various SPP components. A detailed description of these
components is given below.
Part A:
Project Component 1 - Upgrading On-Site Infrastructure in Squatter Settlements in the
Central Region - US$34 million (total cost of component)
This component consists of upgrading about 14 urban squatter settlements in or near Greater
Amman, Zarqa and Russeifa. It will include the following squatter settlements: Abdoun, Al-
Hashemi, Al-Qaisiyeh, Al-Natheif, Safeh Al-Nuzha, Al-Tafayleh, Al-Lawziyeh, Abu Sayyah,
Al-Misdar, Al-Haddadeh, Al-Musheirfeh, Al-Bakistan, Janna'a, and  Al-Qattar. These
settlements are densely built-up and were illegally and randomly developed on government and
privately owned land and privately co-owned land (the latter are not squatter sites, but sites have
been developed illegally by owners). These areas have developed without any consideration of
zoning and building codes, and therefore are not approved by municipal authorities. The streets
consist of narrow poorly-built pathways suitable only for pedestrian access, which are
inaccessible for rescue and emergency vehicles, as well as for garbage collection equipment.
The water supply networks are undersized, some installed above ground, however, pipes
installed underground leak excessively due to corrosion. Water leaks, in addition to being an
economic loss of a scarce resource, also become a hazard to the structural stability of houses.
These areas also have sanitary sewerage networks which for the most part will need minor
upgrading (mostly leveling access manholes and improving covers), however, some houses will
need connections to the network. There is no drainage system to collect surface stormwater
which is a hazard to people and properties. And there are areas without street lighting, which is a
hazard to people at night, and power lines in many places pose a life threatening hazard to
people.  On-site upgrading will be extended to integrate such services to existing off-site
facilities. Some settlements will also need schools, health centers and community and youth
centers. These facilities will complement the programs of concerned ministries. The provision
of community and youth centers will be coordinated with programs (such as skills training for
women and youth, and other community related activities) which would be provided by
concerned government agencies and possibly Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Under



Annex 2
Page 4 of 8
the project, financing has been included for the preparation of relocation plans in consultation
with and agreement of affected people, and to be approved by Government, the World Bank and
concerned donors. The relocation plans will be carried out for areas identified under subsequent
phases of the CIP. The relocation plans will include fair compensation for affected families.
Project Component 2 - Upgrading On-Site Infrastructure in Refugee Camps in the Central
Region - US$32 million (total cost of component)
This component consists of upgrading 13 refugee camps in the central region. It will include the
following camps and their surroundings: Souf, Al-Baqa'a, Al-Husein, Al Shalhid Azmi El-Mufti
(Al-Husn), Hai Al-Amir Hassan (Hneiken), Irbid, Jerash, Madaba, Hitten (Marka), New Amman,
Sukhnia, Talbiyeh, and Zarqa. These areas will be upgraded to improve water supply and
sewerage, drainage, roads and footpaths, pedestrian crossings at major roads, street lighting and
retaining walls. This program will not require relocation of people. Some settlements will also
need schools, health facilities, and community and youth centers. Some of these investments
will be included in the first phase of the CIP. The latter facilities will complement the
development plans of concerned government ministries.
Project Component 3 - Upgrading Off-Site Infrastructure in Refugee Camps in the Central
Region - US$28 million (total cost of component)
This component includes the provision of four sewage treatment plants for four refugee camps
and nearby communities in the central region.  The cost estimate has been based on the
assumption that separate facilities designed to meet secondary treatment levels would be
provided. These facilities would be designed to meet environmental, social and economic
criteria. However, prior to taking a final decision of the type of off-site facilities, several
alternatives will be studied. Options to be considered will be improved on-site facilities (existing
facilities are undersized and soil conditions may not be suitable) and new off-site disposal
facilities, which will be large enough to serve surrounding communities. These facilities have
not yet been sized, the least-cost feasible options have not yet been studied, and locatioii of off-
site facilities have not yet been determined (except for Talbiyeh camp, for which WAJ is seeking
financing)  During the detailed planning stage, environmental impact assessments will be
carried out to identify negative impacts and recommend mitigative measures. Studies of regional
wastewater management systems are under way by consultants retained by WAJ, which also
include looking into alternatives to service these areas (either through separate systems or by
integrating them in regional systems). The planning, studies, design, tendering, constructioni
management and commissioning of sewage disposal facilities to service these settlements would
be the responsibility of WAJ Least-cost options are preferred, as building central systems will
entail substantial costs in operation and maintenance. Long-term sustainability of investmenits
will also be taken into consideration To date, several donors have expressed interest in finalicinig
this program component.

Part B
Project Component 4 - Upgrading Municipal and Village Infrastructure - US$32 million
(total cost of component)
This componenit will consist of a first phase program to provide essential physical and social
infrastructure in about 300 municipalities and villages.  The poorest communities will be
addressed first. Upgrading essential infrastructure will generally consist of either providing or
upgrading drainage systems and stream crossings; safe access roads; retaining walls; street
lighting; and solid waste collection equipment. As in Components I and 2, some communities
will also need health centers and community and youth centers. These will complement
approved development plans of concerned sectoral ministries  Programs of activities for the
facilities would be approved prior to approval of construction.
Part C:
Project Component 5 - Project Management, Project Design and Supervision, Consultancy,
Training and Pilot Projects - US$14 million (total cost of component)
This component includes project management over five years, consultancy services and training
to strengthen the capacity of selected institutions for the management of the project (MOP/PMU,
HUDC, CVDB, MMRAE's regional engineering units and local councils). Consultants will
carry out poverty surveys, and project preparation studies and design, as well as design and
implementation of pilot projects. Design of five pilot sub-projects will be carried out in five
selected areas to test opportunities to complement essential infrastructure with income-
generating productive community activities and possibly activities supported by microenterprise
credit facilities and services. Consultants will be retained to assist implementing agencies in
public awareness programs and affordability studies to promote participation of beneficiaries in
the selection of priorities, project implementation and cost-sharing (in kind or cash).
8.     Project Cost Estimate. The cost of the proposed first (pilot) phase CIP is estimated at about
US$140 million equivalent (about JD 98 million), of which about US$74 million (about JD 52 million)
will be foreign costs (about 53% of total costs). This first phase project would be implemented over a
period of three to five years depending upon availability of donor financing. A cost breakdown by
component is given below:

9.    Project Financing. Preliminary project financing would consist of a GOJ contribution of US$30
million equivalent (about JD21 million including a grant from Germany of DM20 million equivalent as a
debt swap), a World Bank loan of about US$30 million equivalent (about JD21 million), a UNDP grant
of US$1.7 million (JD].2 million equivalent), a contribution from Germany of DM20 million (in terms
yet to be determined and a DM20 million grant as debt swap) and contributionis of other donors (the
terms and conditions are not yet known) of about US$64 million equivalent (about JD44.8 million). To
date, the Governments of Italy and Norway, the Arab Fund, USAID, and the Islamic Development Bank
have expressed interest in the project. The Bank loan was allocated as follows: about US$17 million for
Part A, about US$12 million for Part B and about US$1 million for Part C.
10.   Implementation Arrangements. A project implementation operations manual was prepared by
the Bank based on discussions and understandinigs agreed with the CIP task force, HUDC and CVDB. A
final operations manual was agreed by the Bank and GOJduring negotiations Highlights of the main
elements of the operations manual are summarized below.
11.   The MOP, on behalf of GOJ, will be responsible for the management of the SPP. To this end, it
will establish an SPP Steering Committee (SPP/SC), a Project Management Unit (MOP/PMU), and a
Social Survey Unit (MOP/SSU). SPP/SC will be chaired by the Ministry of Planning and will include
high level officials (at the level of secretary general) of concerned ministries, authorities and institutions
to provide SPP policy guidance. MOP, on behalf of GOJ, will enter into subsidiary agreements with
implementing agencies (HUDC and CVDB) for carrying out the CIP. These agreements will specify the
manner in which both institutions will be compensated for their cost to manage the project; and in the
case of HUDC, the compensation for professional services rendered onl planning and zoning, designing
and procurement, construction supervision and commissioning which will be carried out with owIn
resources. Regarding the Bank loan proceeds, MOP, under these subsidiary agreements, will make
available to HUDC the funds allocated for carrying out Parts A and C of the CIP, and to CVDB the funds
allocated for carrying out Parts B and C of the CIP. These funds will be deposited directly by the Bank as
instructed by MOP in the Special Account each of these institutions will open in accordance with the
Bank's requirements as specified in the Loan Agreement. MOP will also be responsible to ensure that
SPP policy decisions taken by the SPP/SC are carried out diligently. MOP/PMU will functioll as
secretariat to the SPP/SC, and will be responsible for SPP operational oversight. This unit will be
responsible for ensuring that the four components of the SPP are implemented by the government
agencies charged with that responsibility within the agreed subsidiary agreements and programs.
Regarding the CIP, the MOP/PMU will be responsible for monitoring implementation of the programs
carried out by the implementing agencies, and will ensure that program development objectives are being
met. In the event that program changes may be required to meet its objectives, it will present such
proposals to the SPP/SC and the Bank for consideration. MOP/PMU will be responsible for managing
the implementation of pilot projects included under Part C of the CIP, and will coordinate the application
of the findings and recommendations of poverty surveys and studies managed by MOP/SSU.
MOP/PMU will also be responsible for submitting to the Bank and concerned donors CIP consolidated
quarterly and annual progress reports, annual audits of program accounts and a CIP implementation
completion report (ICR).
12.   Implementation of Part A of the project will be the responsibility of HUDC. To this end, HUDC
will establish a full-time project management unit (HUDC/PMU) with senior staff to manage the
program. All detailed work will be done by the various departments within the organization upoIn
request from the PMU. Consultants may be hired as needed to carry out detailed design and supervision



Annex 2
Page 7 of 8
to complement the work done in-house. HUDC will be responsible for all planning, studies, design,
tendering, contract award, and supervision of construction, commissioning and transfer of completed
works through MOP, on1 behalf of the Government, to the public institutions (ministries, municipalities.
authorities) responsible for operation and maintenanice of such infrastructure. It will provide the MOP
the necessary information on cost recovery of the parts that correspond to concernied government
institutions which are legally responsible for the provision of such services.3 Regarding works in refugee
camps, HUDC will carry out its activities through the Department of Palestinian Affairs (DPA), whiclh
will coordinate with the camps improvement committees (CICs) and with the United Nations Relief
Works Agency (UNRWA). Regarding water and sewerage works, HUDC will work closely with WAJ In
the planninig, design and implementation of such works; however, in highly specialized cases such as
implementationi of sewage disposal facilities, and when such works are financed by the Bank, it will
delegate implementation responsibility to WAJ under special agreements4. HUDC will also coordinate
its work in Part A area with donors interested in financing such programs. HUDC will maintain separate
special accounts for each source of funds and carry out annual audits.  It will monitor project
implementation against agreed indicators to determine if the project meets its objectives, if
implementation is on schedule, and to measure program outputs. HUDC will also prepare and submit to
concerned donors through MOP/PMU quarterly and annual progress reports and a completion report at
the end of the project.
13.    Implementation of Part B of the project will be the responsibility of CVDB.  CVDB will
establish a project management unit (CVDB/PMU) with senior staff to centrally manage the program.
The PMU will be supported by the CVDB departments in the day-to-day operations. It will also hire
individual consultants, as needed, under short- or long-term contracts to support the PMU with expertise
not available in-house and to help with the increased work load. It will also hire consultants, as needed,
to complement its staff resources in carrying out infrastructure needs assessment studies in the Kingdom
to improve the targeting of benefited areas and their corresponding priority needs. Consultants would
also provide technical support to the local councils and MMRAE's regional engineering units in aspects
of public participation and awareness, prioritizing needs, selecting  least-cost options of priority
investments, managing construction and controlling quality, monitoring and evaluating project
performance, and reporting. CVDB will provide the MOP the necessary information on cost recovery of
Cost recovery will be in accordance with current law, however, since there are poor municipalities and
beneficiaries that may be unable to pay their share of the cost, this matter will be resolved by the SPP/SC
Agreement in principle on institutional cooperation has been reached at the highest levels of WAJ and
HUDC. Since WAJ is in the process of designing the Amman water distribution network, and regional
wastewater collection and disposal studies are ongoing, HUDC will work closely with WAJ to take into
account these studies. WAJ's design of water supply network rehabilitation and standards of pipe material
and construction will be used, and HUDC will ensure that WAJ participates in construction supervision,
testing and commissioning of such works However, in the case a donor may wish to fund only the
provision of water supply and sewerage networks, and the sewage treatment plant for a given camp where
there are no other works requiring HUDC's participation, it may be advisable to assign full responsibility
for implementation of such works to WAJ. Four camps are now facing very serious problems with in-situ
sewage disposal facilities: some require pumping as frequent as twice per month at very high cost to poor
families; and in others raw sewage overflow from cesspools into open channels in the street flooding
private property off-site. As an interim solution, GOJ should seek donor assistance in the form of tanker
trucks (five to eight would suffice) which could be operated by camp improvement committees or WAJ at
affordable charges, to provide short-term solutions to untenable financial burden (some poor families pay
to private companies up to forty percent of their monthly income to pump-out their cesspools) and
unsanitary conditions until more permanent measures, which would take five or more years to be
operational, are taken

if the project meets its objectives, if implementation is on schedule, and to measure project outputs.
CVDB will also prepare and submit to concerned donors through MOP/PMU quarterly and anilual
progress reports and a completion report at the end of the project
14.   All procurement and disbursements for Bank funded programs will be in accordance with World
Bank guidelines. Final agreement on procurement arrangements was reached at negotiations. In
principle, with few exceptions, most procurement would be based on National Procurement Procedures,
as most works will be small in size and scattered all over the Kingdom. Works in squatter settlements
and refugee camps will be issued in separate packages for each site and will also be small in size which
would not be of interest to international contractors
15.   Monitoring indicators to determine during project implementation whethier the project as
designed is meeting its development objectives, whether project implementation is on schedule, and to
measure project outputs are given in the operations manual.  MOP/PMU will be responsible for
analyzing such data together with HUDC and CVDB and to propose to both the SPP/SC and the Bank
project restructuring to better meet the development objectives, or, in the event implementation is
delayed, to bring project implementation on schedule.

Jordan: Community Infrastructure Project
Economic Analysis
Project Context in Country Strategy
I.   The Community Infrastructure Project (CIP) is a program  of small-scale infrastructure
improvements to poor communities in Jordan. It is one component of the government of Jordan's
(GOJ's) Social Productivity Program (SPP), which is a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of
poverty. The CIP is envisioned as a first phase of a long-term program of financing essential
infrastructure in areas of concentrated poverty where infrastructure services are below basic needs.
2.    The most recent CAS for Jordan (October 1995) identifies, inter alia, improving the livilg
conditions of the poor as a priority for Bank assistance. As a result of a relative deterioration of the
living conditions of the poor, the GOJ asked the Bank to assist in the preparation of a program to address
rising poverty and unemployment. The results of a joint effort between the Bank and GOJ - the SPP -
was formally adopted by the GOJ in late 1996 The SPP has formed the basis for GOJ policy and
provides a framework under which the GOJ will solicit assistance from other donors, some of whom
have already expressed their intention to assist.
3.   The SSP has three thrusts: (1) social assistance, (2) physical and social infrastructure, and (3)
employment generation. The CIP addresses the second of the three thrusts and is the first to be prepared
and appraised for Bank and donor funding. The commitment and priority accorded this program by the
GOJ is high.
Project Objectives. Strategy and Design
4.     The principal objective of the CIP is to improve the living conditions of the poor through the
provision of essential physical and social infrastructure services. A secondary objective is to strengthen
the capacity of selected institutions to deliver infrastructure services to the poor in a more effective,
efficient and targeted way. The CIP intends to reduce the hardship of poverty through infrastructure
provision, but it is recognized that it cannot reduce poverty by itself. The Bank-financed project,
however, has been designed as a pilot phase to test opportunities for income-generating activities which
would be designed in partnership with beneficiary communities and use this experience in the design of
comprehensive programs to expand the CIP objectives. Other components of the SPP address and aim to
alleviate causes of poverty in Jordan.
5.     Within CIP, the strategic consideration was whether to concentrate on the needs of areas with
concentrations of poverty or on the needs of the poor regardless of where they live. The division of the
project into two components, Part A and Part B, reflects the outcome of that deliberation. The worst
living conditions were found in rural communities in the southern areas and in the Jordan Valley and in
areas of dense concentrations of poor inhabitants who are generally without formal land property rights
(squatter areas and refugee camps) Part A therefore focuses on area-wide comprehensive upgrading for
the latter settlements. This approach also lends itself to rapid implementation, since consultations with
residents and feasibility studies of some camps and squatter areas were already available. Part B, the
second component of the project, is designed to address infrastructure deficiencies in more isolated and
dispersed poor communities throughout the country. Part B investment decision making will involve
prioritization of candidate projects and implementation of the most urgent needs. Comprehensive
upgrading as proposed in Part A is not envisaged for Part B. The investments financed by Part B will be
smaller, and because the consultative process has not yet begun, the generation of proposals will
necessarily take longer.



Annex 4
Page 2 of 6
6.     The criteria for candidate investments under Part A and Part B are based on deficiencies in
infrastructure service levels or performance below minimum standards. Identified candidate investments
will then be compared to a menu of CIP-eligible projects and subject to a cost-minimization analysis
both in terms of alternative solutions and the design of the projects. Both Part A and Part B will serve
beneficiaries whose needs are not easily addressed by existing programs. In the case of Part A, since
beneficiaries have no land property rights it is very difficult for municipalities to provide infrastructure,
which requires owners to contribute financially to capital costs. Under Part B, eligible local authorities
and implementing agencies are too poor to shoulder their normal and full share of infrastructure costs,
and therefore have not been able to provide essential infrastructure services. Without the CIP few if any
of these communities could be served with additional infrastructure services at this time.
Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery
7.     CIP is estimated to cost $140 million for the initial three to five years. The World Bank will
provide $30 million, donors are assumed to contribute $80 million, and the GOJ $30 million. The CIP
will require government commitment of about $6 million per year and will increase the annual level of
capital investment by about $28 million, compared to total government capital expenditures estimated at
about $500 million per year over this period. Depending upon the terms of funding from donors, the
GOJ will incur an additional, but manageable, debt service obligation in subsequent years as a result of
the project.
8.     The CIP is intended initially to provide a new conduit for targeted donor and GOJ programs to
help poor communities, but the criteria for identifying low-income communities and priority investments
is expected to eventually be incorporated into the prioritization of public infrastructure investments. The
system  of considering residents' ability to pay in deciding levels of infrastructure investments and
services can be used to promote increased cost recovery in other, non-CIP areas, as well.
9.     All of the proposed CIP investments are presently covered by GOJ policy and regulation with
respect to the financing of recurrent costs. Those mechanisms are not satisfactory in all cases, and other
Bank-assisted operations are seeking to address them in the areas of transport, power, agriculture, water,
education and health. The CIP is not a suitable vehicle for improving recurrent cost practices in general,
and it is expected in any case that the light urban infrastructure proposed under the CIP will incur low
recurrent costs of approximately one to two percent of investment costs per year.
10.    For each type of eligible investment under CIP there is an existing cost recovery regulation.
Although CIP is designed to provide grant financing for some of the capital costs of infrastructure
targeted to poor communities, direct cost recovery from beneficiaries under the CIP will largely follow
existing practice. For example, Part A will cover a portion of the implementing agency's capital costs
and the capital costs normally charged owners.  Households will be expected to pay all normal
connection and usage costs such as water and electricity tariffs. For Part B, a portion of the capital costs
will be covered by the CIP. Households will generally be assessed the same charges as prevail in
existing infrastructure programs. No assistance for usage tariffs is anticipated.
I.    Existing cost recovery practices for eligible investments are:
a.     Roads: owner beneficiaries are charged 50 percent of the capital cost of new roads (local
councils cover the balance from general revenues), and 100 percent for new sidewalks and footpaths.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 6
b.     Water supply: owner beneficiaries are charged for house connections, a hook-up fee and usage
tariffs.
c.     Sewerage: 25% of rental value or connection charge, the full cost of the sewerage connection,
plus 10% of water consumption in quarterly bill. Same as water but usage bill is 3 percent of annual
imputed rent.
d.     Drainage and flood protection: no charge to beneficiaries; 100 percent is paid by local councils
from general revenues.
e.     Street lighting: no charge to beneficiaries; 100 percent is paid by local councils from general
revenues.
Choice of Investments: Providing Minimum Services in a Cost Effective Manner
12.   In support of the primary project objective of ameliorating the poor living conditions of those
living in poverty, investments will be selected to raise infrastructure service and performance levels to a
minimum standard in deficient areas where income levels are low. The minimum standard is defined in
terns of the level of service or performance necessary for safe and healthy habitation. Minimum
standards, as used for the CIP, imply a political decision that the benefits of reaching the minimum level
of service are sufficient to justify the cost (minimized by a least-cost procedure). The costs of not having
access to a minimum level of service include both private costs to the intended beneficiaries and external
costs to other members of the society. From identified infrastructure needs, investments related to public
safety (mostly high-risk flooding and soil stability projects) and dangerous environmental problems such
as exposed sewage flows and unsafe potable water supply will be given priority.
13.    Part A focuses on locations where high concentrations of poor households were identified. A
comprehensive plan for raising critical infrastructure services to minimum  levels was devised. Few
technical alternatives exist for most simple problems, but for more costly problems, such as sewage
disposal, technical alternatives are considered, e.g., individual septic disposal versus a common water-
borne system. Cost minimization techniques are used to evaluate all proposed investments. The benefits
of each type of investment are described below (for Part A and Part B), but most benefits are not
quantified. The usual method for quantification of the benefits of comprehensive upgrading projects is to
measure changes in property values, but this can not be undertaken where there are no beneficiary
owners and virtually no property transactions. It should be noted, however, that the economic rate of
return for similar Bank financed operations has been estimated by the Operations Evaluation Department
at about 22%.
14.    The method of selecting investments for Part B will be somewhat different. All investments will
raise existing infrastructure services to a minimum level, but investments are not derived from a
comprehensive plan prepared for this purpose Instead, they are individual projects prepared by elected
local governments and central ministries. Proposed investments will have to be tested against project
and beneficiary criteria. The eligible project criteria is listed in the operations manual. Beneficiary
criteria and the degree of beneficiary participation in the identification and selection process will be
incorporated in the decision criteria for Part B.
15.    The benefits expected from each type of investment under Part A and Part B are as follows:
a.     Roads. Scattered, relatively small investments in roads, footpaths and stairs will benefit residents
by providing access for emergency and other vehicles, by increasing the safety for pedestrians, and by
reducing mud and dust where roads are not paved. No quantification of benefits is proposed, but all



Annex 4
Page 4 of 6
investments are subject to least-cost analysis following an identification of the problem  based on
minimum service levels.
b.     Water Supply: In most cases the benefit from water supply investments will be improved supply
(pipes are currently undersized) and reduced leakage (physical losses could be as high as 40 percent of
supply). Each investment will be required to produce savings in excess of its cost; savings will be
measured as the marginal cost of lost water saved. An additional benefit will be safer water - currently,
failure to maintain constant pressure in the systems makes leaking pipes susceptible to flooding of
contaminated ground and waste water.
c.     Sewerage: Except for four camps, no new collection systems are planned, so the benefits of
repair will be to keep systems fully functional. For the four possible treatment plants to be built under
the project, the benefits will be reduced environmental and health hazards. Technical standards for
determination of unacceptable levels of such hazards will be used to establish the need to remedy the
situation.  Alternative solutions (comparing on-site disposal, connection to existing systems and
construction of new treatment facilities) will be subject to technical feasibility and a traditional cost
minimization approach to select the investnent. The required environmental impact assessment (EIA)
for a treatment facility will examine benefits in more detail.
d.     Drainage and Flood Protection: The benefits of such projects are to protect the lives and property
(including livestock) of nearby residents, as well as to preserve existing infrastructure such as roads.
Investments will be identified based on surveys of actual conditions and enumeration of the risks.
However, no damage estimate or probability analysis is planned as the investments are relatively small
and scattered. Once an area is ranked above a threshold for risk, alternative methods to address the needs
will be explored and the least-cost effective option selected. Larger projects would be subject to a full
cost-benefit analysis.
e.     Street Lighting: The main benefit will be increased safety. Need and the commitment of local
authorities to pay for the recurrent costs of operating street lighting will be used to determine where
investments in lighting will be made.
The Risks
16.    The principal risk of the program is that the CIP will not be able to identify: (i) low-income
areas in greatest need, and (ii) infrastructure investments that will benefit poor communities as a whole
(rather than influential or relatively well-off residents of poor communities). Although this would not
necessarily affect the economic value of the investments it would be a serious shortcoming in achieving
project objectives. This risk will be mitigated by the mechanism for identifying eligible communities
and investments. National Aid Fund (NAF) data will be used initially to identify eligible communities,
and will be complemented by site visits, meetings with municipal and village councils, and surveys of
community residents in order to determine the most needed investments with the widest impact on the
poor. The second risk of the CIP is that it may be perceived by municipalities as a new funding
mechanism for all infrastructure investments, rather than as a supplemental mechanism for very poor
communities lacking the most basic levels of infrastructure. Although this would also not affect the
economic value of investments, this misperception could undermine the existing system of infrastructure
financing - local governments not eligible for financing from the CIP may exert political pressure to
change the existing mechanism, change the terms of existing loans, or cancel repayment. This second
risk will be mitigated by a public awareness program that clearly specifies the objectives of the CIP and



Annex 4
Page 5 of 6
the criteria for community and investment eligibility. The awareness program will clearly differentiate
CVDB's system for financing non-poor communities and noni-vital infrastructure from the CIP's system
for funding basic infrastructure needs in areas of concentrated poverty.
17.    The specific risk to the economic value of investments under the CIP is that project selection
procedures may fail to correctly minimize investment costs.  This risk is mitigated both by the
investment review described above and by the establishment of criteria for future CIP investments.
Institutional Capacity
1 8.   In order to expedite the program and to minimize the cost of delivering assistance, the program
relies upon and strengthens the capability of existing proven institutionis. The strategy is to provide clear
and consistent policies for the program from a steering committee established for that purpose. In
addition, to augment the capability of the implementation institutions, particularly with respect to
targeting projects to the poor, stimulating and incorporating community preferences and introducing
stronger project analysis and selection skills, technical assistance and training will be provided to the
implementing agencies - the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC) and the Cities and
Villages Development Bank (CVDB).
19.    Part A: HUDC has successfully undertaken similar projects in the past. The volume of work
may require HUDC to hire consultants to undertake some tasks, but in-house managerial capacity and
experience exist to carry out HUDC's role in the program.
20.    Part B: CVDB's role in the program is first as a fund management institution, which is their
normal scope of work.  They will also be charged with promoting, appraising and overseeing
implementation, for which they will require considerable strengthening. CVDB will establish a program
management unit (CVDB/PMU), and additional skills will be acquired through the use of consultants. In
addition, Part B will make use of regional offices of the Ministry of Municipalities and Rural Affairs and
environiment (MMRAE), where local engineering services exist. All institutions will require new
capacity to analyze projects and training in beneficiary participation techniques.
21.    National-level capacity to identify the poor and their needs is an important operational input.
The technical assistance component of the program will address capacity strengthening in this area.
Addressing Poverty
22.    Both Part A and Part B target benefits to the poor. In the case of Part A, the refugee camps and
squatter areas selected are well known and studied by officials. According to studies the typical income
in most families in Part A target areas are below the poverty line. Part B will use data from the NAF and
unemployment statistics (available unemployment data is unreliable but surveys may provide
information to fine-tune the initial targeting mechanisms based on NAF's data) to prioritize communities
for assistance.
23.    The definition and selection of eligible projects is also part of the targeting mechanism. In the
case of Part A, the standards were kept low to maximize coverage of the areas of concentrated poverty.
The investment programs for each location has been discussed with camp improvement committees. For
Part B, the list of eligible projects favors smaller investments in the areas with poorest service and
demands a full consultative process with residents in order to receive funding priority.

Environlmental Analysis
24.    The program is classified as Category C for environmenital purposes. Most investmenits are
small and many are expected to have environmental benefits. Larger projects, such as the sewerage
treatment facilities, if required, will be subject to full EIAs in accordance with Bank procedures (or
donor's procedures, as such facilities are likely to be funded by donors).
25.    Environmental factors play an important role in assuring that program  investments are
economically sound. In many cases the identification of infrastructure service deficiencies is in terms of
environmental criteria.  This threshold defines the minimum  benefits to which all households are
entitled. Actual selection of investments results from the comparison of alternatives and the application
of cost-minimization guidelines. If the minimum environmental criteria are set too high relative to the
cost of solutions, projects could have unfavorable economic consequences

Jordan: Community Infrastructure Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Civil works undertaken under the Project will generally consist of small, labor- intensive works
usually not exceeding US$250,000, in dispersed communities throughout the Kingdom, except for works
in refugee camps and squatter settlements, where contracts will not exceed US$500,000. However,
works in the latter areas will be packaged in sizes not exceeding US$700,000. Off-site works for
refugee camps and vicinities consist mostly of the provision of about four sewage treatment and disposal
facilities which would be packaged in sizes of about US$5,000,000 each and will cost about
US$20,000,000 in the aggregate. However, these works will be financed by donors and procurement will
be in accordance with donors' requirements.  All civil works would be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB), but foreign contractors will not be excluded. Goods and equipment with an
estimated value per contract not to exceed US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
US$2,000,000, will be procured through National Shopping. Goods and equipment with an estimated
value per contract not to exceed US$150,000 up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3,000,000 will
be purchased through International Shopping.  Goods and equipment exceeding the above thresholds
will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Bank-financed consultants will be appointed following the World Bank's Consultant Guidelines;
except for specialized consultancy services not available in Jordan, consulting firms will be recruited
locally through competitive selection. The short list of consultants for services for project management,
estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent per contract, may comprise entirely national consultants.
Consulting services may be required from  a single source, costing in the aggregate less than
US$100,000, for twining services primarily to CVDB in aspects of program management. Individual
conisultanits, mostly Jordanians, who would be hired under short- or medium-term contracts, may be
required to complement the Program Management Units in the implementation of the program.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
The first bidding package for Bank financing below the threshold and all bidding packages above
the threshold of US$700,000 for civil works, and all bidding packages above the threshold of
US$150,000 for goods and equipment would be subject to prior review procedures. The threshold for
prior review (the first contract below and all contracts above the thresholds) for consultant services will
be US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firns and US$50,000 for contracts with individuals and all
sole source contracts and terms of reference regardless of the contract value. All other contracts would
be subject to selective post award review. HUDC and CVDB will be responsible for following
monitoring procedures and for maintaining proper records for easy review by the Bank. It is expected
that about 95 percent of the NCB contracts for civil works and about 90 percent of the NCB contracts for
goods and equipment would be subject to post review.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of three years and the project would be
completed by December 31, 2000. The last date for presentation of sub-projects by GOJ to the Bank
would be December 31, 2000 The closing date of the Bank loan would be June 30, 2001
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs):
Payments made by MOP, HUDC and CVDB out of the Special Accounts (SAs) will be against
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts that are below the prior review threshold as well as for
training.
Special account.
To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government will establish three
Special Accounts in the Central Bank of Jordan. The first is to be operated by HUDC, the second by
CVDB and the third one by MOP; these accounts will be operated under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. IBRD will make Authorized Allocations of US$1,700,000 for HUDC,
US$1,400,000 for CVDB and US$200,000 for MOP. Initially the allocation will be limited to
US$800,000 for each HUDC and CVDB accounts, until disbursements had reached US$3,000,000 for
HUDC and US$3,000,000 for CVDB, then the full Authorized Allocation could be claimed.
Replenishment applications will be submitted on a monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial
deposit has been utilized, whichever comes first. The replenishment application will be supported by the
necessary documentation, bank statement of the special account, and a reconciliation bank statement of
the special account against Bank records. During negotiations agreement will be reached with the
Government that the Special Accounts and the SOEs will be audited annually by independent auditors
and submitted to the Bank within six months from the end of the fiscal year.
