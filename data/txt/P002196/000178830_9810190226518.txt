REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR A CINCHONA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of US$1.8
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a cinchona project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Development and Prospects of
Rwanda" (No. 422a-RW) was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 24,
1974. An economic updating mission visited Rwanda in October 1975 and its
report is being completed. A summary of the mission's findings is set out
below. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        With an average per capita income of about US$80, Rwanda is one of
the poorest countries in the world. It is included in the United Nations
list of the "25 least developed countries", and has also been designated
"most seriously affected" by recent economic developments. The country
became independent in 1962. It is lacking in both administrative and physi-
cal infrastructure, and must overcome formidable constraints to its develop-
ment. Overwhelmingly a subsistence economy with only an embryonic modern
sector, it faces land shortages and a rapid growth in population. The de-
velopment of export-based agriculture is limited by the priority of food
crop production and Rwanda's inland position (1,700 km away from the near-
est port at Mombasa), while the potential for expansion of the industrial
sector is constrained by a lack of raw materials, mineral deposits and an
appropriately trained labor-force.
4.        Despite these handicaps, the present Government, since its ascent
to power in July 1973, has made perceptible progress in developing a strategy
to lift the economy from its present low level. Some aspects of the country's
characteristics are favorable and it is around these that the Government has
designed its strategy. The population has a certain unity, deriving from
similarities in customs, ways of life and standard of living throughout the
country. Income and wealth distribution are remarkably even. There are
neither the remnants of a strong traditional hierarchy nor signs of signifi-
cant emerging urban-rural polarization. Moreover, the small size of the
country reduces the administrative difficulties and at the same time limits
serious regionalism. The country also has a natural asset in its relatively
fertile soil which, provided that the problem of erosion in Rwanda's hilly
terrain can be overcome, can give good yields for a variety of crops. To take
advantage of and preserve these admittedly modest assets, the Government has
recognized that its development policies must be built around a carefully in-
tegrated and balanced strategy reaching the entire population. Although

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



obliged to pursue export crop development to earn foreign exchange and domes-
tic revenues, increases in food crop productivity are at the core of the
Government's proposed strategy.
5.        Pressure on land, combined with traditional cultivation methods
that degrade and erode the soil, make food crop intensification the nation's
first priority. The growth rate of the population is 2.8 percent per year,
and 60 percent of the population is less than 20 years old. At the same time,
all good agricultural land is already occupied and only limited amounts of
marginal land remain available. Over the last two years the Government has
begun preparatory work on a rural development plan which would focus future
efforts on food crop production at the level of the commune - the smallest
administrative unit comprising an average of 30,000 inhabitants. In doing so,
the Government has recognized that its approach must be directed towards the
farmers' needs, with careful integration at both the grass-roots and central
levels. The emphasis on food crops would be linked with soil conservation and
livestock development, and supported by extension services and necessary in-
frastructure such as markets, local roads, and storage facilities enabling
the Government to implement an appropriate pricing policy. Infrastructure
improvements would rely on local initiative where possible; under the plan,
local labor and other resources would also be used to back up economic im-
provement with social betterment in the form of simple health facilities,
schools and training centers, and village water supply. Much preparatory
work on the plan still remains to be done, but with the Government's present
strong commitment to a rural development policy, it is likely that further
progress can be made. An IDA agricultural sector mission recently visited
Rwanda and will provide further assistance to the Government regarding possi-
ble alternatives for the implementation of a rural development strategy.
6.        Faced with the prospect of a doubling of the population by the end
of the century, the Government has ultimately little choice but to adopt a
policy to limit population growth. Emigration is considered by some as a
short run alternative, but the practical possibilities are limited. Although
family planning is a sensitive issue, the Government has set up two commis-
sions which are gradually examining various aspects of this problem, and
senior officials appear to have open minds on the subject. Most of the
reservations concern implementation difficulties rather than outright objec-
tion. This new attitude is an important element and gives hope that concrete
action may ultimately be taken.
7.        Rwanda's landlocked position has been particularly disadvantageous
in the last two years when the costs of external transport for merchandise
from Europe have approximately doubled. Its need to rely on other countries'
transport systems leaves little room for action by the Government. Over the
last two years, some intiatives have, however, been taken within the limited
sphere possible. New roads through Tanzania to the sea and northward to
Uganda are being built, while the road southward to Burundi is being improved.
On the other hand, higher transport costs constitute a natural protection
for some import substituting projects, such as cement, bricks, and peat, and



- 3 -
their domestic production now seems more economically justified. The manu-
facturing sector is presently very small but the Government plans an expan-
sion to take advantage of the quite limited available raw materials. While
the development of some industry is essential to support the rural develop-
ment effort, it is clear that in the immediate future the manufacturing
sector would occupy only a modest role in the economy.
8.        The Government has been and will continue to be hampered in the
preparation and implementation of a development program by shortages of
trained manpower and organizational deficiencies. This weakness has led to
extensive use of technical assistants at the higher level, while the middle
and lower levels are understaffed both in terms of number and quality. As
a result, many basic administrative needs are barely covered. To increase
the supply of much needed skills, the Government is taking two lines of
action. Firstly, large numbers of Rwandese nationals have been studying
abroad over recent years, and there are at present 1,500 Rwandese students
at university level. Secondly, the Government is preparing, despite some
resistance, a reform of the primary education system which would modify
curricula to better meet the needs of a rural economy. The effect of this
development is already visible in the medium layers of the Government's
administration, which has a group of new civil servants who are well educa-
ted and capable. The decision to base rural development on the commune can be
expected to put an even greater strain on the Government, but the continued
emphasis on appropriate training, to which the Government is committed, will
ultimately enable this constraint to be eased.
9.        Rwanda's economic history has been one of stagnation in recent
years with little real growth of GDP. During the last two years, Rwanda has
experienced poor weather and a deterioration in its terms of trade. Climatic
conditions in 1974 were the worst in 35 years and food production fell, neces-
sitating a small emergency food imports program organized by UNDP. In 1974
the terms of trade deteriorated by 20 percent, mainly as a result of higher
international prices for imports, but also of a decline, towards the end of
the year, in export prices for coffee, the principal export crop. Weather
conditions in 1975 were more normal and permitted production to rise again.
During the first half of 1975 coffee prices remained low, but since July have
been substantially higher, offsetting the effect of the deteriorating terms
of trade earlier in the year. Against this background, national income
fell in 1974 by 2 percent, and public savings - largely dependent on coffee
earnings - were negative. However, the investment level was maintained and
consequently the resource gap widened from an average of US$12.5 million
in 1972-1973 (at 1972 constant prices) to US$18 million in 1974 and 1975.
Investments in 1974 and 1975 were roughly equivalent to 10 percent of GDP.
Financing of the resource gap did not present any major difficulty, as Rwanda
receives considerable amounts of external assistance.
10.       Most external assistance to Rwanda has in the past been in the
form of grants. Aid commitments reached over US$50 million in 1974, in-
cluding technical assistance and budgetary support in the form of recurrent



cost financing, and many countries and agencies intend to offer increased
assistance to Rwanda in the future. The principal external aid agencies
operating in Rwanda are Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, the
European Development Fund, UNDP and IDA. In view of the Government's staff
constraints and its correspondingly low ability to prepare and implement
development projects, a considerable amount of aid to Rwanda has necessarily
been in the form of technical assistance. However, appropriate counterparts
were not always available and some of the training benefits were lost.
Furthermore, technical assistance has tended to produce projects that were not
always well suited to the country's needs by making insufficient use of local
materials, local manpower and existing institutions. Besides this, the
recurrent costs of projects were often high, and their position in the overall
development strategy not always clear. To avoid these difficulties in the
future, the Government has begun to be more rigorous in its choice of priority
projects, and has decided to organize a meeting of aid agencies in the fall
of 1976 with a view to ensuring future projects that are more closely related
to national priorities and improved coordination among the external agencies
themselves. The Bank Group is expected to participate in this meeting.
11.       Rwanda's external debt is low.    External public debt, outstanding
and disbursed, amounted at the end of 1974 to US$13.0 million, of which IDA
credits represented US$8.2 million. Service payments on this debt amounted to
US$0.5 million in 1974, or about 1.2 percent of export earnings, of which
payments to IDA represented 6 percent. Nonetheless, because of Rwanda's
poverty, assistance should continue to be on the most concessional terms and
should cover a high proportion of total project cost, including local cost.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN RWANDA
12.       Bank Group assistance started in 1970 and has so far focused
primarily on the improvement of the road network, on which the country is
almost entirely dependent for the movement of its domestic and foreign trade.
Rwanda has received six IDA credits totaling US$39.9 million, of which four
were for roads, one for agriculture, and one for education. There have been
no Bank loans. An IFC loan of US$535,000 for a tea factory was approved in
1975. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC invest-
ments as of May 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Problems have arisen in the course of execution of several proj-
ects, particularly with respect to the First Highway Project (Credit 196-RW).
Severe cost overruns occurred, which led in 1975 to a supplemental IDA credit
of US$9.5 million, of which US$0.8 million would be used to help finance cost
increases under the Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 299-RW) of 1972. The
Saudi Fund for Development agreed to co-finance part of the cost overrun of
the First Highway Project with a loan of US$5.0 million. The implementation
of the Agricultural Development Project (Credit 439-RW) began in September



1974, about a year behind schedule because of delays in selecting a suit-
able consulting firm to assist in project execution. Plans for settlement
of the project area could not be carried out as anticipated since farmers
had already occupied part of the area before project inception. Following
an in-depth review in November 1975, the project is now being revised, taking
into account the development of an irrigation and drainage project in the same
area financed by Canada.
14.       In future, we intend to continue to pay close attention to
the execution of ongoing projects. Because of the lack of skilled manpower
and expertise in Rwanda, this will require substantial input of Bank Group
staff and expatriate experts. As technical assistance is being provided by
various sources, we also intend to pursue our efforts to improve cooperation
and coordination among the aid agencies active in Rwanda. With respect to
new operations, we intend to place primary emphasis on agriculture while
continuing our support to the highway and education sectors. This is in
accordance with Government priorities. A Rural Development Project has been
appraised, and is expected to be negotiated in the next few months.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
15.       Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, account-
ing in 1974 for about 65 percent of GDP, as well as providing the main source
of income for 95 percent of the population and 77 percent of export earnings.
Yet despite the importance of agriculture and the Government's commitment to
rural development, the share of agriculture in total investments has been
relatively modest and has consisted primarily of projects for tea development.
This was mainly due to the limited human and organizational capacity of the
Government to prepare and implement projects that would reach large numbers
of farmers.
16.       The almost universal pattern for agriculture is the small family
farm. Most farms average little over one hectare and the pressure on land
now limits farm size close to the subsistence minimum, given present cul-
tural techniques. There are only limited variations in farm size from re-
gion to region and a larger farm is usually indicative of poorer quality
soil. The egalitarian distribution of land has created a very even income
distribution.   Almost the entire rural population falls into the Bank's
poverty target group; in 1974, annual income per farm household averaged
about US$250.
17.       About 90 percent of cultivated land is under subsistence crops
such as beans, peas, potatoes, sorghum and sweet potatoes or under bananas
which are used or sold for traditional beer brewing. Most farmers use a
small part of their plots for an export crop, generally coffee, but also
tea, pyrethrum or cinchona in suitable growing areas. A substantial land
area - less suited to cultivation - is devoted to pasture.     Livestock plays
a major role in the rural economy; the national herd was estimated at around
700,000 cattle in 1974, in addition to a large number of goats and sheep.



-6-
18.       Nutritional standards in Rwanda are poor.    The population as a
whole receives only 80 to 85 percent of the minimum daily requirement of
calories, and 90 to 95 percent of that of protein. The deficiency in animal
protein and fats is much higher and more widespread. As a result, diseases
related to undernutrition or malnutrition are common. Moreover, food supplies
in all areas of the country are often disrupted by temporary local shortages,
even though adjacent regions might be simultaneously in surplus. The Govern-
ment has recognized that an increase in food production is essential, but that
this must be accompanied by improvements in marketing, storage and transport
facilities.
19.       Rapid population growth dictates an increase in the production of
food crops, but in view of the shortage of land this must primarily occur
through intensification. Present productivity in agriculture is low, even
though the fertile soil (when properly cared for) would permit increased
yields. Farming is mostly traditional and is carried out by hand using only
the simplest of tools, mainly the hoe. Soil conservation measures are insuf-
ficient, even on the steepest slopes. Crop rotation is irregular, and im-
proved seed varieties are only sparsely utilized. Finally, agriculture and
livestock are little integrated.
20.       While the Government has adopted food crop intensification as its
basic development objective, it is not neglecting export crops and in-
deed sees higher productivity in subsistence agriculture as a vehicle for
ultimately releasing land to export crops. To stimulate coffee cultivation
the Government has paid higher producer prices during the last three years.
Other export crops such as tea, pyrethrum and cinchona have been introduced
more recently and have been well received by farmers. Although produc-
tion is as yet small, output of these crops tripled between 1970 and 1975.
Sugar cane production was also begun very recently with favorable results.
21.       The Government's objectives for agriculture are to be realized
through a change of emphasis in project design. Whereas previously projects
generally focused on a particular crop or activity and projects designed
under this strategy are still being executed, new projects will attach
greater importance to the overall development of rural areas. The avail-
ability of non-agricultural services such as health and educational facil-
ities, roads, markets and water supply will be important considerations in
project design, as well as the necessary agricultural services. The devolve-
ment of certain development responsibilities to the commune is a key element
in executing this strategy, since it is to serve as the focus of different
ministries' efforts at the grassroots level.
22.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock provides extension serv-
ices to farmers for coffee and food crop cultivation, soil conservation and
animal husbandry. Cashcrop cultivation such as coffee, tea and cinchona is
promoted by the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR), a govern-
ment agency organized under the Ministry of Agriculture in 1964. OCIR is
governed by a Board of Directors, consisting mainly of government officials,
which is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture; the day-to-day operations



are supervised by the Director General. OCIR is not a commercial institu-
tion but has its own budget and limited financial autonomy to facilitate
its operations. OCIR is parttcularly entrusted with the promotLion of coffee
production by smallholders and has developed price policies which provide
farmers with an adequate and stable remuneration. To this end, OCIR admin-
isters a Coffee Price Stabilization Fund and a Coffee Promotion Fund which
are both held by the National Bank of Rwanda. Coffee is exported through a
separate commercial firm, while another firm is being established to export
most of Rwanda's tea production. Smallholder cinchona production, which is
still small as it started only some years ago, is currently being exported by
OCIR. OCIR's operational expenditures are recovered from export duties levied
by the Government. OCIR's financial position is sound; at the end of 1974,
its net assets (excluding the Coffee Price Stabilization and Promotion Funds)
amounted to about US$2.0 million and net income in 1974 was about US$200,000.
Two other major governmental agencies have been formed to implement two larger
projects for food crop and livestock development, one assisted by the European
Development Bank and another by IDA (the Agricultural Development Project in
the Mutara region, see paragraph 13); the Government provides a wide range of
agricultural and other rural services through a number of smaller projects
and settlement schemes.
23.       Investment in agriculture in 1974 was about US$6 million or about
a quarter of total fixed investment. Some investments in other sectors
naturally assisted the rural areas also. Only a small proportion of agricul-
tural investment could be financed by the Government directly, and a major
role was played by external assistance agencies and various semi-private or
religious organizations. The Government's recurrent expenditure for agricul-
ture amounts to about US$2 million; other operations are directly financed by
OCIR and the other parastatals, and by external assistance within the framework
of projects. For the future, financing from external agencies is likely to
continue to cover a substantial proportion of local and recurrent costs.
However, while financing for agricultural development may be sufficiently
available, the human and organizational constraints may prove a serious
impediment to increasing investments.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Rwanda - Appraisal of the Cinchona Project"
(No. 1047a-RW), dated June 30, 1976, is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately. A credit and project summary is provided in Annex
III.
25.       The project would be the Bank Group's second agricultural opera-
tion in Rwanda.  It was originally part of a larger project, which also in-
cluded coffee improvement and rehabilitation of degraded soils. This project
was appraised in October 1974 and discussed with the Government in May 1975.
Subsequently, the Government expressed reservations about the justification
and high costs of the latter components and finally requested in December
1975 that the project be confined to cinchona development. Negotiations



- 8 -
were held in Washington in June 1976. The Rwandese delegation was led by
the Mlnister of Finance and Economy, H.E. Denis Ntirugirimbabazi.
The Project Area
26.       The project would be carried out in the prefectures of Cyangugu,
Kibuye and Gikongoro, located in the southwest of Rwanda (see map). Alti-
tudes range between 1,400 and 3,000 m; average rainfall is 1,300 mm per
year, with the dry season occurring between July and September. Many of
the cultivable areas are on slopes. Soils are fertile where adequately
protected against erosion but in the highlands sails are degraded and are
of limited agricultural value. Cinchona, which is obtained from the bark
of cinchona trees and used for the production of quinine, is grown on about
600 ha of foreign owned plantations; in addition, about 200 ha have thus far
been planted by smallholders. OCIR, which is responsible for smallholder
commercial crop production, including cinchona (see paragraph 22), provides
farmers with agricultural inputs and extension services, and operates nur-
series and two buying centers in the project area.
The Project
27.       The project, to be executed over a period of five years, would
assist smallholders in improving and increasing the production of cinchona.
Detailed features would be as follows:
a)   Cinchona development
The project would provide agricultural inputs, such as seedlings,
lime, fertilizer, pesticides and spraying tools to smallholders against
nominal fees; in addition, extension services would advise smallholders on
the planting, maintenance and harvesting of 900 ha of cinchona trees. Cin-
chona would be planted either on slopes or in boundary rows, thus limiting
the reduction in areas used for other crops. Nurseries would be established
under the project with a capacity of 4 million plants per year. To permit
the participation of as many smallholders as possible, the Government has
agreed that individual planting areas would not exceed 0.25 ha (Section 3.05
of the Draft Development Credit Agreement). Where available, the Government
would also provide the smallholders with land for cinchona cultivation.
b)   Extension staff
OCIR's extension staff would be strengthened with 15 additional ex-
tension agents. An agronomist with experience in cinchona growing would be
internationally recruited and appointed not later than December 31, 1976
(Section 3.02(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement) on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. He would function as Cinchona Development
Officer and would be assisted by an agronomist recruited locally. The proj-
ect would provide the extension staff with office space, stores, staff housing
and transport means.    Staff training for project purposes would be provided
in Rwanda and in neighboring countries.



-9-
c)   Marketing
Four additional buying centers would be built in the project area
and operated by OCIR to purchase cinchona from smallholders. OCIR would be
responsible for exports.
d)   Technical Assistance
The project would provide for consultants' services as needed to
assist during project execution when difficulties occur that cannot be handled
satisfactorily by the project staff. Consultants' services could also be used
for broader purposes, such as specific advice to the Government on the prepa-
ration and execution of agricultural projects in general, and to advise on
sector policies. The specific areas in which said consultants' services would
be needed are to be agreed between the Government and IDA (Section 3.02 (b)
of the Draft Development Credit Agreement).
Project Implementation and Evaluation
28.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock would have overall super-
vision of project implementation and would be responsible for the recruit-
ment of foreign experts. The project would be executed by OCIR. The Chief
of OCIR's Cinchona Division would function as Project Manager and the Cin-
chona Development Officer would be his deputy. The locally recruited agro-
nomist would replace the Cinchona Development Officer during project imple-
mentation or at project completion as appropriate. The Cinchona Development
Officer would monitor the progress of the project, taking into account the
number of participating smallholders, the size of the cinchona plantings on
new or previously cultivated land, the growth of new seedlings and ultimately
the yields of cinchona trees.
Ecology
29.       Project activities would have a beneficial effect on the ecology
of the project area. The planting of cinchona trees would help reduce soil
erosion and also contribute to improving and maintaining soil fertility.
Project Cost and Financing
30.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties amounting
to about US$140,000, is estimated at US$2.0 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$1.2 million. The proposed IDA credit would cover 90 per-
cent of the total project cost net of taxes and duties, including $600,000
of the local costs. The need for external financing to cover local as well
as foreign costs was noted in paragraph 11. The Government would finance
the balance of the local cost estimated at about US$200,000. The financing
plan would be as follows:

of taxes and duties
Procurement
31.       Contracts for agricultural inputs (about US$260,000) exceeding
US$30,000 equivalent would be awarded following international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Equipment and vehicles
(about US$270,000) would be procured after advertising in the local press
and in adjacent countries or the solicitation of competitive offers from
suppliers represented locally. As no foreign contractors are likely to be
interested in the limited amount of civil works for staff housing, office
space and stores, these works would be carried out by local contractors
following local competitive bidding or on force account by the Ministry of
Public Works and Equipment. Contracts for goods and services costing less
than US$30,000 equivalent would be let in accordance with Government pro-
curement procedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
32.       The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed over a period of
five years against: (a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 90 percent
of total expenditures for equipment, vehicles, and farm inputs, including
fertilizer, pesticides and implements; as well as for technical assistance,
consultants and staff training, and (b) 90 percent of total expenditures for
civil works, salaries of local staff and operating and maintenance costs of
units employed under the project.
Cost Recovery
33.       Revenues from cinchona bark would start accruing four years after
plantation. The burden of initial investment and operating costs of the
project would be borne by OCIR and the Government. Currently, the Govern-
ment applies export taxes and levies on cinchona totalling RwF 63 per kilo,
of which RwF 18 per kilo is allocated to OCIR to cover its operational ex-
penses. On the basis of 1975 price levels for cinchona and assuming an
8 percent discount rate, the Government would recover with these taxes 53
percent of the project cost over a 24-year period. The Government is deter-
mined to recover the full project cost(including subsidies to farmers and
operational expenditures)but, as cinchona prices on the world market fluc-
tuate considerably, the Government needs to maintain flexibility in deter-
mining the level of taxes and levies. If an additional tax averaging RwF
40 per kilo over the same period were levied, the Government would re-
cover 90 percent of the project cost. The increase in farmers' income has
been estimated on the assumption that an additional tax averaging RwF 40
would be introduced. If the Government were to impose an additional tax of



- it -
only RwF 20, the cost recovery factor would still be about 80 percent, The
Government has agreed to review the level of taxeS period-tcally to ensure
the ultimate recovery of subsidies and project Costs while maintaining ade-
quate incentives for smallholder production (Section 4.03 of the draft De-
velopment Credit Agreement).
Economic Benefits and Risks
34.       About 3,600 farmer families would benefit from the project.     Many
farmers have already accepted cinchona as a rewarding cash crop. During the
five full productive years of the ten-year cultivation cycle of ctnchona
trees, a farmer would earn about US$118 additional income per year, if he
planted 0.25 ha at once (see paragraph 27(a)). Spread over the full culti-
vation cycle, this would mean a 25 percent increase over the farmer's current
annual income. If planting were staggered over several years, this additional
income would be divided over a longer period. Additional benefits would result
from the use of debarked trees as firewood, which is in short supply.
35.       At full development by 1987, the incremental production of cinchona
under the project would be 450 tons, thus increasing Rwanda's total production
to about 1,000 tons and its share of the world market from about 4 percent at
present to about 10 percent. Although the world market for quinine is small
and dominated by seven firms with major plantations in Zaire and Indonesia,
demand for cinchona is expected to increase further. On the basis of current
estimates, Rwanda would have no difficulties in selling its total production
on the world market (currently it is sold entirely to pharmaceutical companies
in Europe). The Government is planning to process cinchona locally and to
this end is negotiating with a foreign firm to establish a processing plant in
Rwanda. The project would have a favorable effect on Rwanda's balance of
payments and over the first ten years would yield a net inflow of foreign
exchange amounting to about US$4.0 million.
36.       The economic rate of return has been estimated at 15 percent on
the basis of costs and prices for cinchona remaining constant at 1976 levels.
The main risks would be that yields might be below the level expected or that
prices might decline. If prices declined by 20 percent, the rate of return
would still be 11 percent. If output were 10 percent less and costs 10
percent higher than antlcipated, the rate of return would also be 11 per-
cent.
37.       The project risks are no greater than can normally be expected
with operations of this type. The risks for farmers would be reduced by
continuing food crop cultivation in conjunction with cinchona growing, by
staggering cinchona planting over several years and by the Government sub-
sidizing farm inputs and services.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 196-RW   Kigali-Gatuna ProJect; US$9.3 million credit of June 17,
1970; Date of Effectiveness: September 15, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977;
US$9.5 million supplementary credit of December 19, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: February 18, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977'
Construction works were interrupted in April 1975 because of a cost
overrun amounting to about US$16.0 milion, including a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$13.7 million. In addition to the subsequent US$9.5 million
supplementary IDA credit, of which US$8.7 million is earmarked for the com-
pletion of the Kigali-Gatuna Road, the Saudi Fund for Development has
agreed to co-finance the cost overrun with a loan of US$5.0 million. The
supplemental IDA credit became effective on February 8, 1976 and the Saudi
loan was signed in February 1976. Construction works were resumed in January
1976, with completion expected by mid-1977.
Credit No. 299-RW   Highway Maintenance Project; US$3.0 million credit
of April 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: January 15, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Delays in project implementation have resulted in cost increases
for equipment, spare parts and materials. The supplementary IDA credit
mentioned above included US$0.8 million to help finance these costs increases.
The cost of technical assistance, for which UNDP contributed a US$1.1 million
grant, has also increased. As a result, the UNDP grant will be exhausted
about 9 months before the consultants' contractual period terminates on
December 31, 1976, and an additional US$260,000 will be needed to keep the
consultants in the country for the period originally envisaged. As UNDP will
be unable to provide additional funds this year, the Government and the Bank
Group have agreed to use part of the proceeds of the supplemental IDA credit
to finance the technical assistance.
Credit No. 434-RW   Agricultural Development Project; US$3.8 million credit
of November 29, 1973;
Date of Effectiveness: September 5, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project implementation began about a year behind schedule because of
delays in selecting a suitable consulting firm to assist in project execution.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the solutions taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.



ANNEX II

Various difficulties have since been encountered, particularly in recruiting
staff and in defining the project area. In a large area spontaneous settle-
ment has occurred before project implementation was underway, thus restrain-
ing the possibilities for organized settlement as envisaged in the project.
On the other hand, plots prepared for organized settlement have not yet been
allocated as potential settlers are unwilling to sign settlement contracts
which require settlers to pay fees after an initial period of four years.
In addition, project cost has increased from US$4.3 million to US$7.0
million, mainly as a result of worldwide price increases. In view of these
problems, the project was reviewed in depth in November 1975 and discussions
were held with the Government on the future course of action. The project is
now being revised, which is likely to entail a reduction in scope of some of
its components in order to remain within the amount of the funds available in
the credit.  This revision will also take into account the implementation of
the irrigation project in the same area financed by Canada. Coordination with
regard to the implementation of both projects will be continued in the future
by all parties concerned.
Credit No. 475-RW    Ruhengeri-Gisenyi Road Construction (Third Highway) Project;
US$6.3 million credit of March 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 5, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The start of construction was postponed for about 4 months to permit
supervising consultants to complete detailed engineering. Slow contractor's
mobilization added to the delays. Completion of the project is now expected
by August 1976, about 15 months behind schedule. Costs are expected to re-
main within the original estimates.
Credit No. 567-RW    Education Project; US$8.0 million credit of June 30, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: December 1, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project execution has started satisfactorily. Construction of the
school and financing unit and the printshop is being prepared,
and staffing of the unit is well underway. Locations for the workshops to
be constructed under the project are being determined. Other financing
sources have agreed to finance various items included in the project. The
Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide all printing equipment for
the printshop, while UNDP will finance the technical assistants to be re-
cruited through UNESCO. The credit funds thus released will be reallocated
to construction of additional workshops or other related project items.

Procurement:    Contracts for agricultural inputs (about US$260,000) exceed-
ing US$30,000 would be awarded following international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Equipment and vehicles (about US$270,000) would be procured
after advertising in the local press and in adjacent coun-
tries or soliciting competitive bids from suppliers rep-
resented locally. As no foreign contractors are likely
to be interested in the limited amount of civil works for
staff housing, office space and stores, these works would
be carried out by local contractors following competitive
bidding or on force account by the Ministry of Public Works
and Equipment. Contracts for goods and services costing
less than US$30,000 would follow government procurement
procedures, which are satisfactory.
Foreign
Experts:       The following experts would be internationally recruited:
(a) an agronomist to be seconded as a Cinchona Development
Officer to the Office des Cultures Industrielles du
Rwanda (OCIR) to assist in the execution of the project
(60 man-months).
(b) Consultants as and when needed to assist in the execu-
tion of the project and to advise on agricultural
development in general (18 man-months).
