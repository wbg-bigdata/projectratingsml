F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Assist the Borrower in its efforts to ensure the sustainable management of the country's cultural
heritage with a view to developing cultural tourism". The Project Development Objective (PDO)
is shown here as in the Loan Agreement (LA). The PDO in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) is worded differently and in more detail but with the same meaning. The discrepancy was
corrected in 2009 and the wording of the PAD was aligned with that of the LA.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not formally revised.

   The Results Framework (RFW) and PDO indicators, however, were modified twice over the
life of the project, first informally, then formally. A first revision took place at Mid-Term
Review (MTR) in January 2005, with the possibility of a formal restructuring, but this was not
pursued at that time in agreement with MNA management. The project was restructured (Level
II) in November 2011 to conform the project description, the RFW, PDO indicators, and the
Intermediate Outcome Indicators with the actual achievements of the operation (refer to Section
2.3 for details).

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.      Like many of its neighbors in the Mediterranean, Tunisia possesses an exceptionally rich
cultural heritage, vestiges of a succession of civilizations that the country harbored over the last
two millennia. In addition to the remains of Carthage, there is a wealth of Roman ruins and
monuments of Arab culture. Many of the sites have been known since antiquity. Knowledge of
others was lost, however, and even in the case of those known, the full extent of their riches still
remains to be unearthed and made accessible to the public. While relatively marginal in its
beginnings, tourism started to become an essential factor in the Tunisian economy in the early
1970‟s. From a modest 50,000 international arrivals per year in the 1960‟s, the number grew to
1.5 million by the mid 1970‟s and over 5 million by 2000. At the time of appraisal, tourism
revenue represented 6 % of GDP and around 16% of foreign exchange income. Tourism also
became a major source of employment, and provided in 2000, an estimated 70,000 direct and
200,000 indirect jobs.

2.       Tourism in Tunisia was (and continues to be) essentially focused on mass marketed “sun,
sea, and sand? holidays of limited duration during the summer season and geographically
concentrated on the coastal stretch between the cities of Hammamet and Sousse, south of Tunis,
the capital city, as well as on the island of Djerba, close to the border with Libya. With few
though noticeable exceptions, all these areas are relatively far from many of the country‟s most
important archeological and cultural sites of the Punic, Roman, Arab, and Ottoman period.
However, even for the sites in proximity of the main tourism areas, little was done for a long
time to enkindle the interest of tourists in the historical heritage of the country. Museums, in
particular, were left in a state of benign neglect and lacked any strategy to improve their
attractiveness to potential visitors. A worrisome result of the focus on cheap mass tourism was
that at the time of project preparation foreign exchange per tourist earnings were stagnating at a
low level in comparison to neighboring countries.

3.      As of the early 1970s the Government became increasingly aware of the role of the
country‟s cultural heritage in developing and diversifying tourism and initiated efforts for its
protection. The Government joined in 1975 the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and
as of 1978 started placing a series of cultural assets on the list of protected sites. In addition, it
created a series of national parks around some of the major archeological sites, such as Carthage,
Dougga, and Sbeitla, in order to protect them from intruding housing and agricultural
development. An effort was also made not to limit preservation to individual monuments or
archeological sites, but to also include the urban environments of existing old town centers
(medinas), such as the restoration of sections of the Tunis medina under the World Bank-
financed Tunisia Third Urban Development Project which was approved in 1983.

4.     One of the main reasons for neglecting cultural heritage assets as a support to tourism
development was rooted in the traditionally weak institutional links between the authorities in
charge of cultural heritage and those in charge of promoting tourism. To more efficiently protect
the country‟s cultural assets and better exploit its potential as tourism resource, the Government
began an overhaul of the existing legal and institutional framework governing the cultural
                                                 -1-
heritage sector. In 1994, Loi 94-35 Relative au Code du Patrimoine Archéologique, Historique et
des Arts Traditionnels (Cultural Heritage Law) was enacted. Concurrently, the National
Archeological Institute (INA) was transformed from a research institution into an agency in
charge of protecting, managing and promoting national heritage, the Institut National du
Patrimoine (INP). In 1997, the Agence Nationale de l’Exploitation du Patrimoine (ANEP)
(National Agency for Exploitation of Heritage) became the Agence de Mise en Valeur du
Patrimoine et de la Promotion Culturelle (AMVPPC) (Agency for the Development of Heritage
and Cultural Promotion) emphasizing the value of improving access to historic and
archaeological sites to support tourism development. With financing from a Bank managed
Italian Trust Fund (TF034628), the Ministry of Culture established a comprehensive inventory of
over 300 cultural heritage assets at nearly 100 sites that were to be protected under the heritage
law.

5.       The Cultural Heritage Project (hereafter referred as “the Project?) was approved in June
2001. It was fully in line with the FY 1997-1999 and FY 2000 -2002 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), both of which called for the development of a more dynamic private sector,
further strengthening of the human capital base, and sound management of resources and
proposed Bank support for, inter alia, new initiatives of catalytic nature to strengthen local
institutions, launch new development niches, and mobilize external finance. The proposed
project was explicitly mentioned as an opportunity to help strengthen the preservation of
Tunisia's cultural heritage assets, contributing to employment generation, and diversifying
tourism options by increasing the appeal of sites of cultural and historical interest to foreign
visitors. In doing so, the Bank expanded on its earlier involvement in the country‟s tourism and
cultural heritage preservation activities1. It also conformed with the decision taken by the Bank
in 2000 to increase its involvement in the tourism and cultural heritage sector throughout the
MNA region and to support, in addition to Tunisia, the development of similar projects in other
Mediterranean countries such as Morocco, Lebanon, etc. These projects were approved after the
launching of the Tunisia project, however. The project was therefore a pilot and the first of this
scale, at a time when the Bank only had limited experience in the sector.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
6.    The PDO of the Project was to “assist the Borrower in its efforts to ensure the sustainable
management of the country's cultural heritage with a view to developing cultural tourism?.2

7.     Key indicators to measure PDO progress were (a) enactment of a national strategy and
appropriate regulations, (b) design of a marketing strategy, and (c) establishment of a model site
conservation and improvement plan and procedures.

   The Tunisia Tourism Infrastructure Project (FY73) and the Third Urban Development Project (FY84).

   This is the PDO as shown in the Loan Agreement (LA). The original PDO in the PAD is worded differently and
in a more detail but with the same meaning. The discrepancy was corrected in 2009 to make the PDO consistent on
both documents.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
        and reasons/justification
8.      The PDO was never revised. The RFW and PDO indicators, however, were modified
twice over the life of the project, first informally, then formally. A first revision took place at
Mid-Term Review (MTR) in January 2005 and the option of a formal restructuring was then
considered but not pursued. A level II restructuring occurred later in November 2011 to conform
the project description, the RFW, PDO Indicators, and Intermediate Outcome Indicators to the
actual achievements of the operation (refer to Section 2.3 for details).

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
9.       According to the PAD, the primary target groups of the project included but were not
limited to: (i) local communities at or near the sites, through additional employment arising from
restoration work, site activities for visitors, and local businesses stimulated by increased tourism;
(ii) poor communities surrounding some of the pilot sites (Oudhna in particular) and unemployed
or under-employed young people; and (iii) national and international visitors to the sites.
Additional target groups included local governments, NGOs and community-based organizations,
the central government, as well as the private sector through increased involvement in tourism
activities.

1.5     Original Components
10.     At appraisal. the project‟s total cost was estimated at US$23.8 million (EUR 26.9
million), of which 71% was to be financed through Loan 7059-TUN in the amount EUR 19.2
million (then equivalent to US$17.0 million 3 ) and 29% by the Government. The project
consisted of the following four components:

Component A: Policy Development and Capacity Building (US$2.15 million/EUR 2.42 million).
11.     The component was to assist the Government authorities responsible for cultural heritage
in strengthening (i) implementation of the country's policies governing the management of
cultural heritage assets and (ii) the operating capacity of AMVPPC and INP, the two key
agencies in charge of the sector, including the preparation of recruitment and training programs.
Component B: Market Development for Culture-related Tourism Products (US$1.62 million/
EUR 1.83 million).
12.     The component was to support (i) the development of programs aimed at the promotion
and marketing of cultural products, services, databases, documentation and publications, and a
tariff policy; (ii) the preparation of a communication strategy directed to foreign and local

 Although Loan 7059-TUN was denominated in Euro (EUR), financial figures in the PAD were expressed in US
Dollars (USD). Since over the life of the project the Euro appreciated by close to 50% against the US Dollar (and
over 60% against the Tunisian Dinar (TND), the ICR in order to more properly reflect the actual financial
performance of the project indicates all cost figures in EUR with their USD equivalents at the exchange rates
prevailing at appraisal or completion, respectively.

visitors, in association with the municipalities and local associations and communities; and (iii)
road and site signs.
Component C: Site Development and Management (USD18.08 million/ EUR 20.42 million).
13.     The component was to help improve access to, and visiting conditions for tourists and
other visitors at six different emblematic archeological and historical sites and finance to that
effect the following activities:

         Carthage: (i) preparation of a study on the organization of site-internal visitor transport
          systems; (ii) road access and parking improvements; (iii) construction of service facilities
          for visitors; (iv) exhibition space upgrading in the Byrsa museum; and (v) preparation of
          a study for the preservation of the Maalga water reservoirs. (Total estimated cost:
          US$4.87 million/ EUR 5.50 million)
         Bardo Museum: (i) preparation of a comprehensive development plan for the existing
          museum; (ii) upgrading of collection display; (iii) creation of a visitors‟ center; and (iv)
          extension of the existing building. (Total estimated cost: US$5.88 million/EUR 6.64
          million).
         Kairouan: (i) construction of a visitors‟ orientation center for the Kairouan mosque and
          medina; (ii) creation of visitor circuits within the medina; (iii) landscaping improvement
          around the Aghlabide water basins; and (iv) development of a financing mechanism to
          help medina residents upgrade and preserve their traditional housing. (Total estimated
          cost: (US$3.05 million/EUR 3.44 million)
         Sousse: (i) renovation of the Sousse archaeological museum; (ii) creation of visitor
          circuits in the medina; and (iii) development of a financing mechanism to help medina
          residents preserve their traditional housing. (Total estimated cost: (US$2.12 million/EUR
          2.39 million).
         Djerba Island: (i) rehabilitation of the Museum of Arts and Traditions in the town of
          Houmt Souk; (ii) development of visitor circuits throughout the island; and (iii)
          revitalization of traditional handicraft industry through the construction of sales facilities
          (Total estimated cost: (US$0.88 million/ EUR 0.99 million); and
         Oudhna: (i) construction of visitor facilities within the ruins of some Roman buildings;
          and (ii) preparation of a pilot site conservation and improvement plan. (Total estimated
          cost: (US$1.29 million/ EUR 1.46 million).
Component D: Project management (US$1.77 million /EUR 2.0 million)
14.    The Component was to finance the operating costs of the Project Unit (Unité de Gestion
du Projet - UGP) to be set up within AMVPPC.

1.6       Revised Components
15.     At the MTR, which took place in January 2005, the Government and the Bank jointly
decided to scale down the scope of Components A, B, and C, and specifically to: (i) delete some
of the original sub-components of Components A and B that had either become obsolete or lost
their relevance; and (ii) realign the focus of Component C by concentrating on four highly
                                                   -4-
emblematic sites. The change in the original program was made to increase the project impact
and thereby support a more substantial achievement of the PDO. A number of authorities in
Tunisia also believed that the location of the Carthage site in the immediate vicinity of the
presidential residence carried a potential risk of raising politically sensitive issues of land use and
appropriation of archeological assets by members of the president‟s family. In the case of
Oudhna, unanticipated but significant delays had taken place in the progress of archeological
excavation works undertaken by INP. Finally, reducing the number of sites freed additional
resources available for the four remaining sites for which the final cost estimates had turned out
to be substantially higher than originally anticipated. A formal revision of the project description
was delayed, but the changes were formalized in a Level II Project Restructuring in November
2011.

1.7    Other significant changes
16.     Closing Dates: The project was granted three successive closing date extensions to enable
completion of works already underway (from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2010; from June 30,
2010 to June 30, 2011; and from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2011). The first two extensions
were granted to provide additional time needed for the completion of works on three of the four
project sites that had started but were significantly behind schedule, while the third extension
was requested to compensate for additional delays in work completion brought about by the
political unrest in Tunisia from December 2010 to March 2011.

17.    Fund Reallocation: A reallocation of funds among categories was undertaken through a
Level II Project Restructuring in June 2011.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     The Concept Review was held in October 1998. Pre-appraisal in December 1999 was
followed by appraisal in September 2000 and a post-appraisal in February 2001 which included a
reduction in the scope of the project (through parallel financing) and a simplification of project
components. The project was approved by the Board on June 12, 2001, but the loan became
effective only eight months later on February 12, 2002, due to the lengthy loan approval process
by the Tunisian Parliament.

19.     Project preparation was supported by a US$454,000 PHRD Grant (TF 27148) which was
approved on July 16, 1997. The Trust Fund financed the preparation of a feasibility study that
was completed in 2001 as well as by a Bank-managed Italian Cultural Heritage Trust Fund
(TF034628) which helped establish an inventory of over 300 cultural heritage assets at around
100 sites.

20.     Both quality at entry and quality of supervision were reviewed by the Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) as part of the Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP-1 2009) review
of the Tunisia lending portfolio. Quality of project design was rated Satisfactory on the basis of
the strategic importance of the Development Objective (DO) to the Tunisian economy, the clarity
of the design, and the overall appropriateness of project preparation. Looking back at the project,

                                                 -5-
the ICR concurs with the quality of the approach but disputes the readiness for implementation.
It assesses the quality at entry and project design as Moderately Unsatisfactory for the reasons
outlined below:

Soundness of background analysis
21.     Project preparation took place in the context of the Bank‟s preparation of a
comprehensive strategy and action framework for the management of cultural heritage issues in
the MNA Region that was completed in 2001. The Bank had also acquired an incipient
knowledge of sector issues through its earlier involvement in the successful restoration of parts
of the Tunis medina under the Tunisia Third Urban Development Project (Ln. 2223-TN). The
feasibility study was prepared by a team of consultants with extensive prior experience in
Tunisia, and international expertise in cultural heritage management. The Bank team was well
aware of the intricacies of the Tunisian Government bureaucracy and the need of broad policy
reform and corresponding changes in institutional framework. This could only be initiated
through a comprehensive approach associating these changes with an improved presentation of
the heritage implying meaningful investments on the sites.

Assessment of quality at entry and project design.
22.     As designed, the Project could not realistically be implemented within the five-year
requirements of a Bank project. The feasibility study was thorough and well documented.
Considerable weight was given to the rationale behind the preparation of proposals for policy
and institutional reforms. However, the technical studies which provided the basis for the bulk of
project investments included only the identification and preliminary feasibility assessment of the
site development operations. The assumption that the final design studies could be rapidly
carried out as part of project implementation was largely responsible for the long delays incurred
in the latter. Additionally, both the feasibility study and the PAD were excessively optimistic in
terms of the time that would be required for the procurement and preparation of the final design
studies and implementation of works on the sites. This was particularly unfortunate with regard
to procurement, since the complexity and slowness of the public procurement procedures in
Tunisia were a well known issue that affected the entire Bank portfolio in the country.

23.      Another design factor that contributed to difficulties in project implementation was the
ambiguity of the implementation arrangements. Preparation had been initiated and primarily
supported by INP. For implementation however, the project was placed under the responsibility
of AMVPPC because of its role in the promotion of cultural tourism, INP being in principle
strictly focused on scientific research and archeological preservation4. The option retained for the
project was that the implementation would be managed with the involvement of both entities on
the basis of a formal agreement to be concluded between them. An executive order delimiting the
respective responsibilities of the two entities initially set as a condition for negotiation was

  INP (previously known as Institut National d‟Archéologie –INA) had exerted for over a hundred years a monopoly
in all matters of cultural heritage management.

                                                      -6-
prepared by the Ministry of Culture in 2001 but was never enacted despite frequent reminders by
the Bank team. This absence of a formally approved framework was the cause of inter-
institutional frictions (often compounded by inter-personal animosities) which had an effect on
the smooth implementation of the project. The problems were mitigated to a significant extent by
the fact that responsibility for day to day implementation of the project was entrusted to a UGP,
the implementing agency created specifically for the project within AMVPPC and, due to its
autonomous status, able to manage project implementation relatively independently.

24.      A last and important issue was that there the absence of strong involvement (other than
through membership of steering committees and working groups) of the Government entities
responsible for tourism (Ministry of Tourism, Institut National du Tourisme Tunisien – ONTT,
etc.). The lack of a strong link between AMVPPC and INP and the Government‟s key entities
responsible for promoting Tunisia as a tourism destination abroad and overseeing and regulating
tourism industry activities within the country, affected the effectiveness of certain project
activities (a weakness that has been recognized by the current Government and ranges among its
priorities for review).

Lessons of previous projects taken into account
25.     Bank involvement in the cultural heritage sector started only in the mid-1990s and at the
time of project approval Bank-internal experience in this area was still incipient and slowly
building up. The project was among the first of its kind in MNA and the Bank in general. A few
other freestanding smaller cultural heritage operations had been approved in the ECA Region in
the immediately preceding years but they were not at a sufficiently advanced stage of
implementation to allow any meaningful lessons to be learned.

Adequacy of government commitment
26.     As previously mentioned, the authorities responsible for cultural heritage management at
the time of project preparation were genuinely interested in addressing shortcomings in the
sector policy and regulatory framework and were committed to making necessary adjustments.
As shown in the Government‟s Policy Letter prepared prior to Board approval, the concept of the
project was fully endorsed by the Minister of Culture at the time. Changes in the Government
shortly after Board approval, however, brought these initiatives to a halt and saw the arrival of
new authorities who predominately considered the “scientific? value of the heritage but were not
as interested in its economic development potential. They thus failed to perceive the project as an
opportunity for promoting policy reforms or revamping of sector institutions and instead opted to
keep to the status quo.

Adequacy of participatory process
27.     Given the nature of the project, the preparation did not involve specific participation of
possible beneficiaries or groups of other people potentially affected by the operation.
Environmental consultations were held on sites with potential issues. A close participation of
local inhabitants was identified as a critical element and agreed to be developed as an important
part of project implementation on at least two sites, the island of Djerba and the medina of
Kairouan.

                                                -7-
Risks
28.     Since the project was approved in 2001, it did not include an Operational Risk
Assessment Framework (ORAF) and risk analysis was carried out in line with the then prevailing
practices for PAD preparation. Overall risk was rated as moderate. The assessment adequately
identified most of the critical institutional risks but would have gained from more concrete
mitigation measures. Furthermore, the assessment did not identify potential risks of possible
disagreements over design concepts or delays that were more complex than anticipated in
technical studies or procurement procedures. It also did not foresee the possibility of political
reluctance to reforms and structural changes, which proved to be a major hindrance to the
implementation of sector reforms.

2.2     Implementation
29.    Several factors affected project implementation and the achievements of both outcomes
and outputs:
(i)      Difficult political environment: Project preparation and nearly all implementation was
carried out under the authoritarian regime of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The authorities
responsible for cultural heritage management at the time of project preparation were genuinely
interested in addressing shortcomings in the sector policy and regulatory framework and
committed to making necessary adjustments. However, as a result of changes in the Government
that took place soon after project approval, they were either sidelined or replaced by more
unconditional supporters of the regime. From 2001 onward, the regime turned increasingly
repressive and averse to innovation and changes in institutional and organizational structures and
procedures. Few, if any, adjustments were allowed to even be considered and, despite their
technical quality, the studies financed by the project were not fully implemented. The regime of
Ben Ali was eventually overturned in the December 2010-January 2011 Revolution. The new
Government has expressed a strong willingness to reopen the reform agenda and tackle the issues
of sector policy reform and restructuring of cultural heritage management as underlined in its
2012-16 Social and Economic Development Strategy.
 (ii)  Cumbersome administration procedures: Procurement management by the Government
was extremely cumbersome and lengthy. In some cases, review procedures by the Commission
Supérieure des Marchés (National Tender Board) of simple contracts could take up to eighteen
months. This issue was not specific to the project and was well known to the Bank but it was
compounded by the unfamiliarity of the Tender Board with the heritage sector.
(iii) Fluctuating exchange rates: Over the life of the Project, the value of the Tunisian Dinar
(TND) experienced a steady decline against the Euro from a rate of about 1.24 in 2001 to 2.00 in
2011. As a result the amount of resources available for the project in local currency (in which
most of the contracts were denominated) increased by close to 50% (though the positive effects
of this increase were counterbalanced to a significant extent by the price inflation in the local
construction industry). The high volatility of the Euro vs. the US Dollar exchange rate over the
same period had no direct effect on the Project, but resulted in total disbursements showing in
the Bank‟s system as US$24.9 million or about 45% more than the original US$loan equivalent.


                                               -8-
30.    Overall, the pace of implementation was significantly slower than anticipated, largely
because of the lack of detailed technical studies at appraisal, and the project required a total of
four and a half years of closing date extension. Slowness in project progress was reflected in
lagging disbursements, which only amounted to 7% of the total loan amount at the time of the
MTR. In the following years however, disbursements picked up and eventually reached 98% at
the time of project closing on December 31, 2011.

31.     The longer than anticipated implementation period was also due to (i) the ministerial and
upper management changes, which took place shortly after project approval and prompted
noticeable changes in Government attitude and commitment; (ii) the decision made at MTR to
focus on more important improvement schemes than had been originally envisaged for the three
museums of Bardo, Sousse, and Djerba; and (iii) the effects of a substantial inflation in the cost
of construction materials over the life of the project (which largely counterbalanced the benefits
of the depreciation of the local currency vis-à-vis the Euro). The possibility of an Additional
Financing of US$12 million to help overcome the financing shortfall was discussed at MTR but
not pursued at the request of the Government which wanted to avoid an increase in its foreign
debt liabilities. The solution adopted was therefore to reduce the number of works that had been
projected on two sites of the Site Development Component and to finance those works from
either national budgetary resources or through assistance from other external partners.

Component A: Implementation of the Component got off to a good start with excellent studies
devoted to the strengthening of AMVPPC and INP and the development of a museum
management policy launched in 2002 and completed in early 2003. Despite repeated
recommendations by the Bank team and given the political environment and the difficulties
explained above, it became evident that a large part of these recommendations could not to be
implemented over the course of the project. However, the project initiated and developed new
patterns of public-private participation – not only through museum construction but also through
important works that were implemented on the archeological sites (Carthage and Oudhna). It also
provided, through the renovated and expanded museums, the trigger needed for accepting and
implementing a more meaningful institutional reform.
Component B: A comprehensive study was prepared and endorsed by the stakeholders,
outlining a strategy for cultural heritage promotion and communication. By the end of the project,
the strategy was only partially implemented. Achievements include, inter alia, more publicity in
the local and international press, various promotion events, publications, the development of web
sites, and the placement of 300 signs on the major highways to advertize the most important
archeological and cultural sites.
Component C: As pointed out above, the scope of two of the original six sub-components
(Carthage and Oudhna) was reduced at the MTR. The main achievements of the Site
Development Component are summarized below:
32.     Bardo: The original plan was to focus on the interior renovation of the museum with
some minor changes to the building exterior. At the MTR, due to the high quality of the detailed
feasibility study, the Government, supported by the Bank team, opted for a more ambitious
operation that would transform the Bardo into a high-standard museum focusing primarily on the
display of Tunisia‟s unique collection of Roman mosaics as well as artifacts from the Punic,

                                                -9-
Numidian, and early Islamic eras. The starting of works was delayed by a long procurement
process but implementation itself went according to schedule until a few months postponement
associated with the Tunisian Revolution. Works were completed by December 2011 on a much
greater scheme than originally envisaged at the time of appraisal. This was followed by the
installation of collections (outside of the project scope) and the museum reopened in its new
configuration in May 2012.

33.     Island of Djerba: The original proposal was to expand the existing museum of Houmt
Souk, support the development of visitor circuits and help revitalize some of the traditional local
crafts. The actual works included a complete renovation and important expansion of the museum
implemented over the period 2006-2008. The museum, compliant with international standards of
display, visitation, and security re-opened in 2009. The development of visitor circuits never
really took off, however, due to lack of follow-up from AMVPPC, despite interest from qualified
consultants.

34.    Kairouan: Originally, the Project was to finance the construction of a visitor center for
the Kairouan mosque and medina, improve the landscaping around the 7th century Aghlabide
water reservoir basins, and create a fund to support medina residents in the renovation of their
houses. The concept of a simple visitor center was modified at MTR in favor of a more
expensive combined visitor center/museum. The project produced a detailed feasibility for the
improvement of the landscaping of the Aghlabide water reservoirs but actual works were
removed from the project at MTR to free funds for the more emblematic sites. The creation of a
housing renovation fund was also deleted from the project as the Government embarked on a
comprehensive study on the financing of the rehabilitation of private homes in the medinas,
under financing from Agence française de Développement (AFD) (French Agency for
Development). The project completed renovation works in the medina, to which the Association
pour la Sauvegarde de la Medina–ASM, (The Association for Protection of the Medina) a local
NGO, was closely associated. Works on the visitor center commenced in early 2006 and were
completed in late 2008. As agreed at the MTR, the museum display will be completed by
AMVPPC. The urban renovation program in the medina has been completed. As a result, a
number of business activities have been created and are developing in and around the medina.

35.     Sousse: Originally, the project was to finance the renovation of the existing archeological
museum located in a historical 14th century fortress as well as the improvement of the Sousse
medina in a way akin to that proposed for Kairouan. The latter was removed at the MTR while
the scope of the museum works was much extended: the interior courtyard of the citadel was
cleared from its recent additions, providing a unique view of the fortress, and the museum was
completely rebuilt underground, an architectural achievement by world standards. Works started
in early 2008 but progress was hampered by archeological discoveries. They were completed by
end 2011 and the museum reopened early June 2012.

2.3          Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
36.    Originally, as shown in the PAD, the project included an RFW and a set of relatively
broadly defined performance indicators as shown below5:

                                     Amenities built and operated on 4 sites                                  06/30/07
                                     Associations and NGOs involved in at least two sites                     01/30/07
                                     Oudhna site conservation and improvement plan completed                  01/30/07
                                     Eight bids launched                                                      06/30/02
                                     Bids launched for a total value of US$8.5 million                        06/30/03


37.     The RFW design was largely consistent with the then applicable instructions for PAD
preparation and was in line with the PDO. In hindsight, it would have been preferable that all
indicators be set up on clearly defined baselines. The institutional objectives did not include
specific quantifiable output and/or outcome targets. Other indicators, such as the increase in the
number of visitors and revenues did not prove relevant as these increases were dependent on the
completion of works and the reopening of the museums, something that happened only after the
closing of the project. These indicators were thus cancelled at project restructuring in November
2011.

38.    At the MTR, the RFW was overhauled and expanded to incorporate baseline indicators
and adjust targets to reflect actual project developments. However, at that time the project team
and management did not see a need for a formal project restructuring. Nevertheless, the
informally revised indicators (given below) were used for project monitoring until they were
replaced through the project restructuring in November 2011.

39.     In November 2011, the project description, the results framework and indicators were
formally revised and adjusted through a Level II restructuring to more accurately reflect the
actual achievements of the project. It was essential to restructure the project to conform to the
evolving reality on the ground and bring the indicators in line with expected result. In retrospect
however, the project would have benefited from a restructuring at an earlier stage, when it had
become apparent that the expected institutional reforms would not fully materialize. This would
have also included revisions to the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework to keep the
PDO components and indicators fully aligned. Quality of data was good overall, given the
Tunisian National Tourism Office‟s reliable statistics on tourism and the UGP‟ solid grip on
physical data.

40.      Preparation of M&E data was of good quality, as evidenced by ISR updates, in particular
with respect to physical outputs. While the Bank regularly followed up on institutional reform
and continued a dialogue on these issues throughout project implementation, an earlier
restructuring would have contributed to an added attention to the “softer? aspects of the project,
including the definition of more appropriate indicators to support achievement of the PDO.

41.    Overall, quality of M&E was adequate throughout the project implementation. AMVPPC
in cooperation with ONTT and other Government agencies will continue monitoring progress
towards a more complete achievement of the PDO and collecting the corresponding data.

2.4        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
42.     Safeguards. The project was not expected to have any significant or irreversible
environmental impacts, and was therefore classified as Environmental Category "B". A
framework Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed during project preparation
and fully adhered to during implementation. Based on the framework EMP, INP prepared site
specific Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), which were submitted to and approved by
the relevant Tunisian authorities upon consultation with relevant stakeholders. Compliance with
OP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources) was ensured through the joint oversight of the two
national agencies responsible for cultural heritage management. There were no complaints on the
                                                             -12-
project approach regarding environmental and cultural heritage management, and there were no
environmental or other safeguard issues for any of the project sites raised during the
implementation of the project.

43.    Fiduciary. The project complied with all fiduciary covenants during implementation.
Procurement was carried out with delay, but in full accordance with the Bank guidelines. Post-
procurement reviews were carried out regularly by the Bank team and found no irregularities.
Financial Management was consistently rated satisfactory and reporting was done on schedule.
All audits were submitted on time and were consistently unqualified.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
44.     All project activities agreed upon at the MTR and recorded during the Level II
restructuring are completed. The Djerba island museum was inaugurated in 2009. The Bardo
museum, which remained partially open to the public during renovation/extension reopened in its
new configuration in May 2012. The Sousse museum, closed during works, also reopened in
early June 2012. The Kairouan visitor center is being used for temporary exhibits. Currently,
commercial operation of all museums and visitor centers supported by the project is managed by
AMVPPC, a state agency operating under the Ministry of Culture, and deriving its income
revenue from ticket sales and other commercial activities of the museums. INP is responsible for
operation and maintenance of the buildings, as the legal owner of the facilities and through state
budget funding. Discussions are ongoing on the upward adjustment of the tariffs. After
completion of the project, the museums are equipped with a comprehensive digital monitoring
system that documents the number of visitors and generated revenues on a daily basis; this
system is also directly connected to AMVPPC. Also under discussion is a proposal to modify the
current administrative status and management arrangements of the Bardo museum in order to
convert it into a financially and managerially autonomous entity. The new Government has
expressed a strong willingness to reopen the reform agenda and tackle the issues of sector policy
reform and restructuring of cultural heritage management as underlined in its 2012-16 Social and
Economic Development Strategy.

45.     The new Government has also expressed a keen interest in the preparation of a similar
operation targeting cultural heritage in the more remote and economically underdeveloped areas
of the country that house an abundance of archeological sites and ruins, dating primarily from the
Punic and Roman periods.

46.     Given that most of the facilities financed by the project were only completed upon project
closing, the ICR strongly recommends that an impact evaluation be conducted after three years
to assess the actual sustainability of the project‟s achievements.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
47.     Relevance is rated as High. Tourism remains an important pillar of the Tunisian economy
as it contributes about 7.5% to the GDP and represents a major source of employment. Although
the number of visitors had declined drastically in the wake of the 2011 Revolution to about 3.2

                                              -13-
million (compared to close to 7 million in 2010), there are strong indications that the sector is
about to rebound. The Government is fully aware of the need to diversify the tourism product
and move away from the excessive focus of beach-centered mass tourism. As stated in the 2012-
2016 Social and Economic Development Strategy, “cultural tourism ranks high among the
priorities for development [...] and the steps taken right after the Revolution to safeguard the
national archeological heritage will be continued by the updating the Code du Patrimoine and
its adaptation to the various international conventions and also through the establishment of a
permanent partnership between the Departments of Culture and Tourism?. The significance of
effectively preserving and managing the country‟s cultural heritage was highlighted in the 2009-
2013 Country Partnership Strategy and the 2012 Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The Government‟s
efforts to diversify the tourism products offered by the country are actively supported by the
Bank through an operation focusing on the development of alternative options through the
proposed Eco-Tourism and Desert Areas Bio-Diversity Project (P120561) which will be
presented to the Board of Directors in October 2012.

48.    Given the noted reluctance of the previous regime to engage in reforms of sector policies
or make changes to the existing management structures for cultural assets, the Bank‟s decision to
focus on using the project as an opportunity to improve Tunisia‟s museum infrastructure was the
only reasonable alternative, and proved beneficial by providing visibility to the sector.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.     Achievement of project objectives is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The PDOs were
only partially achieved because of the shortcomings in achieving institutional reform objectives,
while physical output targets were fully achieved, and even exceeded. As highlighted by the
indicators, the expansion of exhibition space and remarkable improvements in the display of
mosaics and other pieces of art and artifacts in the Bardo, Sousse, and Djerba museums will
allow these facilities to increase their attractiveness to tourists and become centers of
international importance and renown. The three museums and the visitors‟ center which were
renovated and expanded represent major achievements as they fully comply with international
standards of security and visiting conditions and are architectural landmarks. In Kairouan, as a
result of the works implemented in the medina, a number of boutiques and commercial
establishments have developed and expanded in the immediate vicinity of the project site.

50.     A number of staff was recruited at the main museums. A study on training needs
launched in early 2004 and completed in early 2005 defined an ambitious training program for
close to 700 AMVPPC and INP staff. Training eventually carried out in 2008 and 2009 involved
about 200 staff in topics covering management and technical skills (including 60 staff trained in
mosaic renovation and 44 staff trained in communication and visitor services). In addition, the
project succeeded in facilitating a transfer of knowledge to all staff associated with museum
construction and renovation and was at the origin of the current awareness about the importance
of heritage presentation and the potential economic benefits of the heritage.

51.     A noteworthy and highly visible impact of the works undertaken under Component B
was the installation of about 300 information panels with information on, and direction to,
cultural sites on the country‟s highway network and in the main cities. This is a unique case of
                                             -14-
comprehensive cultural heritage signage in the MNA Region. In addition, various web sites were
opened, several publications were prepared and distributed, and a number of cultural events and
workshops focusing on cultural heritage management and promotion were organized.

52.     The project also assisted the Government in the preparation of institutional studies of
high quality, but in the then prevailing political environment in Tunisia, major changes in matters
of institutional reform (including a reform of AMVPPC) or improvements in the marketing of
cultural tourism could not be achieved. While the target set for the original PDO indicator on
enactment of a national strategy and appropriate regulations was not achieved, it is deemed to
remain highly relevant and achievable in the longer term with the help of the studies prepared
under the project, all of which remain valid and provide a solid basis for the implementation of
these reforms by the new Government.

53.     Since the majority of disbursements took place before the Level II Restructuring,
achievement of the PDO should be weighed mainly against the original PDO indicators, as
indicated below:

       PDO Outcome/Impact Indicators
              National strategy agreed upon: target achieved.
              Increase in the number of visitors and increase in revenues: the indicators became
               irrelevant since the museums were closed (or partly closed) for construction.
       Project Output Indicators
              National strategy and appropriate regulations: strategy prepared but never enacted.
              New organizational scheme including recruitment plan and training program:
               scheme prepared; recruitment of key staff and training partially implemented.
              Market strategy designed and launched: strategy prepared and partially
               implemented.
              Amenities built and operational on four sites: target surpassed (new museums).
              Associations involved in at least two sites: target achieved.
              Oudhna site conservation and improvement plan completed: target achieved.
              8 bids launched during 1st year of implementation; accomplished with delay.
              Bids launched for a total value of US$8.5 million by end of 2nd year of project
               implementation: accomplished with delay.

54.     The project did not reach the targets for tourist visits to cultural sites which were set
during the 2011 restructuring, in part for exogenous reasons (i.e., the financial crisis in Europe
and elsewhere, and the Arab Spring events that temporarily discouraged tourists to consider
Tunisia as a vacation destination) but also, in part, because the project did not succeed in
implementing the strategic components that could have permitted the achievement of some of the
indicator targets. While the project contributed significantly to improving the prospects for the
development of culture based tourism, the lack of institutional change, which was essential to
reaping the benefits of the project, justifies a moderately unsatisfactory PDO rating at this stage.


                                               -15-
55.     At project closing, the sustainable management of the country‟s cultural heritage is not
assumed to the extent explicit in the PDO as the lack of sector reforms has, at least for the time
being, taken out an essential link in the results chain. While the project contributed significantly
to improving the prospects for the development of culture based tourism, the lack of institutional
change, which was essential to reaping the benefits from the project, justifies a moderately
unsatisfactory PDO rating at this stage. The willingness and interest of the new Government to
provide more autonomy to the museums and to strengthen the linkages between culture and
tourism institutions offer a strong prospect for a positive development outcome in the short to
medium term. As it is reaching the status of an internationally recognized art center (see Annex
8), the Bardo museum is very likely to give the impetus needed to speed up the implementation
of sector policy reform and help develop cultural tourism. The actual benefits of the project will
only be measured in a more meaningful way once the two most important museums are fully
operational for some time. As mentioned earlier, it would therefore be advisable to conduct a
follow-up evaluation in about three years from project completion.

3.3    Efficiency
56.     The economic evaluation of the ICR is focused on a cost-benefit analysis for the three
project sites of Bardo, Kairouan, and Sousse, which together represent about 85% of the
investments made for site development. The details are shown in Annex 3, including
assumptions on evolution of cultural tourism, fee setting, incremental recurrent operation and
maintenance expenditure, and incremental benefits from economic activity directly related to
museum visits and activities. The base case is conservative, as the potential overall positive
impact of the project on the country as a tourism destination, induced additional tourist visits,
and related economic activity is not taken into account. The cost benefit analysis shows a base
case that is highly profitable. The following table provides the results for each site.

                                  Bardo                   Kairouan                  Sousse
          IRR                     21 %                      30%                      16%
          NPV                     10,583                   5,115                     4,493

57.      For all the sites, there was a considerable reduction in benefits in 2011, reflecting the
recession of the tourism sector, as historic political developments unfolded and security
considerations deterred foreign tourists (particularly from Europe) from visiting Tunisia. In the
previous years, benefits had already declined in 2009 and 2010 as a result of the global financial
and economic crisis and the partial (Bardo) and total (Sousse) closure of the two main museums
for restoration and reconstruction work. However, as indicated above, the new government is
determined to support the tourism sector with its cultural vector in the near and long term future.
The sensitivity analysis shows that, with one exception, IRR and NPV for the three investments
remain positive in various scenarios covering (a) an only modest increase in visitors despite the
attractiveness of the new facilities, (b) a postponement of tariff increases for five years, (c) a
future 25% additional increase in tariffs, and (d) a significantly stronger impact on local
development. Only if the Sousse museum does not manage to substantially increase the number
of its visitors, the IRR lowers to marginally positive (1%) and the NPV turns negative (US$-895),
the case clearly underscoring the need for the authorities to start implementing the


                                               -16-
communication and marketing strategies that were prepared under the                      project, but left in
abeyance.

58.     The duration of project implementation, while exceeding World Bank guidelines,
compares favorably with other international experiences on cultural heritage projects which
demonstrate that works typically average seven years for new buildings and up to twelve years
for renovation of existing museums. Also, the works, executed by Tunisian companies, could be
completed at a fraction (as low as 10%) of the cost of similar operations elsewhere in the world6.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
58.     The project overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The rating is based on
the ICR guidelines specification that an unsatisfactory rating should be given to a project that
had major shortcomings in the operation‟s achievement of its objectives, its efficiency, or its
relevance, and that the evaluator should use judgment in weighing shortcomings. The project did
have major shortcomings in achieving the institutional objective. The overall Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating is warranted by weighing shortcomings in the achievement of objectives
against continued relevance and high economic efficiency. This includes: (i) the continuing high
relevance of the PDO for the Government‟s economic and social development agenda; (ii) the
likely strong contribution of the project to ensuring sustainable management of the country‟s
cultural heritage, the outstanding quality of the physical assets created, particularly in the case of
the Bardo, which brings the museum on par with similar cultural institutions in Europe and
elsewhere in the world - ; and (iii) the project‟s high economic rate of return which demonstrates
its contribution to the development of the tourism sector and the generation of revenues for the
sustainable management of the country‟s cultural heritage. While under the previous regime, the
reforms that were expected to take place under the project could not be implemented as foreseen,
this shortcoming is mitigated by the fact that the project nevertheless succeeded in laying a solid
groundwork for continued improvements, and helped draw the attention of the new government
to the potential inherent in the development of cultural tourism. The project is rated moderately
unsatisfactory however, as the expected benefits have not yet fully materialized by project
closing.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
        n.a.
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
59.     Due to its nature, the Project did not directly address any specific poverty, gender or
other social development aspects, though the expected contribution to employment growth in the
tourism sector might contribute to reducing regional unemployment.

  The cost of the renovation/extension of the Bardo museum is substantially lower than European comparators for a
result of similar quality: about US$900 per square meter at the Bardo vs. US$9,000 to US$10,500 per square meter
at the Prado museum and the Louvre Lens. The cost of the new Islamic Department of the Louvre, scheduled to
open in the Fall of 2012, is in excess of US$35,000 per sq. meter (Source: ICOM).

        n.a.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
60.      There were no other unintended impacts.
3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops)
61.    No beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were held, but Annex 6 lists a number
of events that contributed to improving coordination and visibility of the project.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

62.     Significant. There is at this stage a significant risk that the expected development
outcomes may not be fully realized. Any further development of the tourism industry in Tunisia,
including a successful stronger move towards a macro-economically more profitable cultural
tourism will depend, to a large extent, on the future evolution of the political environment in the
Arab world and the general security situation in the Mediterranean. However, the commitment of
the new Government to support the tourism sector has led to a partial rebound in the early
months of 2012, according to official estimates7. Between January 1 and March 10, 2012, the
number of tourists reached 660,000 compared to 451,000 for the same period in 2011 and
786,000 in 2010. Continued recovery in the tourism sector will depend on the Government‟s
ability to restore and preserve internal political stability (in the short and medium term), revive
economic development, while preventing a possible eruption of civil unrest and disorder.

63.     Despite the new Government‟s stated commitment to reform, achievement of the goals
set by the PDO will also depend on the authorities‟ actual capacity and/or willingness to take up
the agenda for policy reform and institutional reorganization that was drawn up by the project. In
particular, changing the administrative status and management arrangements of the museums and
providing them substantial autonomy in the setting of tariffs and other operational decisions will
be critical for ensuring their long-term development and expanding their role drivers of the
tourism industry.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
64.     The project design was innovative and fully consistent with the just adopted MNA
Cultural Heritage Management Strategy, but the Bank should have been more vigilant and
insisted on an objective assessment of (i) the likely prospects of achieving the PDO in the


7
    Ministry of Economy, ONTT and UNWTO.

                                               -18-
existing political environment and (ii) the realism of the proposed implementation timetable,
taking into account, in particular, the well-known complexities of the public procurement
procedures in Tunisia and the time needed to implement works of the type funded by the project.
These significant shortcomings warrant a moderately unsatisfactory rating.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
65.     The 2009 QALP review noted that MNA should be commended for ensuring team
continuity (with the TTL working for several years on cross-support from the Africa Region).
The ICR concurs with the assessment. Supervision missions were carried out regularly twice or
three times per year by a project team (including consultants) whose composition did not vary
over the life of the project. A country-based consultant participating in supervision throughout
the entire life of the project was instrumental in maintaining continuous contact with the
implementing authorities. The Bank actively followed up on institutional reforms as an important
part of assuring development impact, but in the prevailing political environment, full
implementation of the reforms proved impossible. The Bank also had value added in assuring
adequate design of the investments retained, and assuring the remaining physical program could
be implemented following MTR restructuring. A noticeable shortcoming, however, in the
supervision performance was the Bank‟s postponing the revision of the results framework and
corresponding indicators to the very end of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
66.     The rating is based on the ICR‟s judgment that quality at entry should have been more
objectively reviewed, and the project restructuring introduced earlier. Thus, a significant portion
of the challenges that hindered implementation could have been mitigated or avoided.
Nevertheless, the Bank demonstrated a noteworthy flexibility in implementation management by
agreeing to the changes in the project scope requested by the Tunisian authorities, and granting
exceptional closing date extensions which allowed the project to be successfully completed.
Following ICR guidelines, given that performance in ensuring quality at entry and in supervision
differ, overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory on the basis of the
moderately unsatisfactory rating of the project outcome.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
67.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The rating primarily reflects the Government‟s
unwillingness to undertake essential activities that would help achieve the PDO by taking the
institutional and policy reform measures needed to ensure the sustainable management of the
country's cultural heritage. The Government was also loath to implement the proposed
coordination between AMVPPC and INP, the entities responsible for heritage preservation and
valorization. However, the Government was highly supportive of investments in the construction
of the four facilities financed by the project and provided adequate counterpart financing in a

                                               -19-
timely manner. Also, to address funding shortages the Government effectively undertook to carry
out works at Oudhna and finance the museum display installation in the Kairouan visitors‟ center
from budgetary resources.

68.     Another major element contributing to the negative assessment of Government
performance was the complexity of procurement procedures. The delay in the review and
approval process by the Commission Supérieure des Marchés (Public Tender Board) contributed
to the delays in project, an issue, as mentioned earlier, that affected the entire Bank portfolio.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
69.     Rating: The rating is Moderately Satisfactory: The Project Management Unit (UGP)
faced initial difficulties but was successively highly skillful in implementing the project with
efficiency under extremely difficult circumstances and in bringing it to a successful completion.
Regrettably, AMVPPC, as the overall implementing agency, and INP, as the technical
preservation body, failed most of the time to provide adequate support to the UGP.

70.     Compliance with safeguards was consistently rated satisfactory. There were no issues of
misprocurement or financial management improprieties. All audits were unqualified and periodic
reporting on implementation progress was timely.

71.     Reporting on M&E was occasionally spotty, although this shortcoming should be
assessed in light of the fairly modest level of activity taking place under the first two components
for which monitoring of corresponding indicators was impractical. Most of UGP‟s attention was
directed towards the successful management of the construction operations, on which it reported
dutifully.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
72.     Notwithstanding the performance of the UGP in project implementation, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory for the following reason: the
PDO was to “assist the Government in its efforts to ensure the sustainable management of the
country's cultural heritage with a view to develop cultural tourism?. The Government fully
supported the implementation of the site development component efficiently, thereby endowing
the country with world-class museums. However, its reluctance to tackle the issues of policy
reform and restructuring of the institutions responsible for cultural heritage management - a
precondition for the long-term sustainability of cultural tourism in Tunisia and an aspect of the
project that was primarily under the control of the Government - must be considered as a
significant shortcoming. This is the main reason why residual a risk remains to fully realizing the
project benefits.

6.     Lessons Learned

73.    Projects should be fully designed and costed before appraisal. Investment projects
should not be allowed to go for Board approval without advanced preparation or completion of

                                               -20-
the final design studies and cost estimates for all components, in agreement with the relevant
country authorities. As experience shows, incorporating such studies into implementation carries
a high risk of delays in project start up, design changes and ensuing cost overruns, and other
related implementation issues.

74.     Investment in cultural heritage is a complex process that requires a combination of
lending instruments and technical support. As evidenced in similar operations worldwide,
museum and art center projects are always difficult and require a preparation that is both time-
consuming and resource-intensive. An objective and realistic assessment of time and resource
requirements at an early stage of project preparation would help ascertain the most appropriate
way to engage in such an operation and to establish from the outset a realistic timeframe for
implementation and allocation of resources. Given the need for extensive and detailed studies on
each site and component, a different approach, involving a two-step intervention, could have
been more suitable. A possible option could have included (i) the preparation of a first operation,
supported by a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) or technical assistance instrument financing
the detailed studies; followed by (ii) a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) focusing on the financing
of specific investments and assistance to the implementation of specific strategies (training,
communication, promotion, etc).

75.     Ownership and commitment to key reforms should play a central role in risk
evaluation. For projects where the achievement of PDO heavily relies on policy and institutional
reforms the likely political feasibility of such reforms and prospects of their implementation
should be thoroughly scrutinized at an early stage of project preparation and, in the case of
uncertainty about the outcome, scaling down the PDO to a more modest, but realistic level might
be a preferable option. The project also made it clear that the strengthening of the sector could
only be triggered through significant improvement on the sites. By improving significantly the
quality and appeal of the major museums, the project initiated tangible changes toward
sustainable policy reform, an approach that can be applied and adapted in other interventions in
the cultural heritage field.

76.     Economic benefits can be very high for cultural heritage investments. Especially in
the cultural heritage sector, even low cost investments that are strategically selected and
positioned can have a decisive impact. The museums supported by the project were renovated
and/or built with a comparatively very modest amount of financing resources; yet they can be
expected to significantly influence the future structural profile of tourism in Tunisia, have a
considerable positive effect on the local economies, and provide a model for the successful
replication of this kind of operation in the country or elsewhere. The project was the first of a
generation. Despite its shortcomings, it opened the way for a now well established and sound
program in the field of cultural heritage and tourism development.

77.     Need for a longer-term sector engagement: Changing the nature of tourism in a
country like Tunisia and increasing its reliance on cultural heritage assets as a prime factor of
attraction is a long term endeavor. It requires not only significant investments, but more
importantly it calls for significant changes in the attitudes toward management and exploitation
of the country‟s assets. Reforms that cut deep into well established institutional structures and
procedures are by nature unpopular and likely to meet resistance and political interference at all
                                                -21-
levels. Undertaking them and above all ensuring that they are irreversible and solidly anchored in
the new structures requires a substantial amount of time and a continuing unwavering support.
Operations like the project should therefore not be treated as a one-time event, but should be
embedded in a more comprehensive long-term strategy of support to the sector including
possible follow-up investment projects as well as other forms of assistance such as technical
assistance and advisory services.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
78.      The draft ICR was presented and discussed with project counterparts during a mission to
Tunis from May 17 to 19, 2012. The counterparts have issues with the standard methodology
used in the ICR given the uniqueness and pilot character of the project. They believe that the
project deserves more positive ratings in view of its strong outcomes. They also emphasize the
critical role of the Bank in the cultural heritage and tourism field. Finally, they recommend
undertaking an ex-post evaluation three to five years after project closing. Their detailed
comments are given in Annex 7.

79.     The critical appreciation of the report has been provided, in view of the innovative
character of the project, the impressive results that have been achieved on the sites and the highly
positive feedbacks that have been received. The relevance of the PDO remains as high as it was
at the beginning of the project. The ICR, however, is compelled to provide an assessment of the
project results on the basis of the Loan and Project Appraisal Documents, including the agreed
Results Framework. The project has been an ambitious and well worthwhile initiative for Tunisia
and for the Bank and it carries excellent lessons for the future.

                               Annex 3.        Economic Analysis

1.     Introduction


81.    The economic analysis of the project included in the PAD relied on two approaches:

(a)     cost-effectiveness analysis for two project sites, namely Djerba and Oudhna, that at that
time attracted a limited number of tourists visiting the cultural sites, and
(b)     cost-benefit analysis for the four project sites that enjoyed already significant flows of
visiting tourists, namely Carthage, Bardo, Kairouan and Sousse.
82.     The ICR limits the economic evaluation to a cost-benefit analysis for the three project
sites of Bardo, Kairouan and Sousse on account of the developments in the Tunisian tourism
industry and the changes made to the project during the ten years of implementation. Together
these three sites represent 85% of the investments made for site development under the project. It
must be noted, however, that the Bardo and Sousse museums have just re-opened to the public,
and the Kairouan site is not fully operational, pending installation of the museum display. All
data regarding incremental revenues and costs are therefore hypothetical and consist of estimates
based on the assumptions further detailed below.

2.     Main assumptions

83.     The overall economic justification of the project rests on the following three main
assumptions: (a) the tourism industry will continue to be a major sector in Tunisia‟s economy
and an important contributor to is foreign exchange earnings; (b) tourists traveling to Tunisia will
continue to show a strong interest in the country‟s cultural heritage; and (c) the expectation that
upon completion all project investments will be able to generate significant economic benefits
tangible and intangible.

Economic Importance of Tourism

84.     Tourism is a major economic activity in Tunisia, generating value added, foreign
exchange and employment. It accounted for about 7% of GDP in 2010 and, with the equivalent
of TND 3.5 billion, was one of Tunisia‟s major foreign exchange earners. In addition, assuming
that there are 30 direct jobs and 80 indirect jobs created per 1,000 tourists, tourism provided
about 600,000 jobs annually. Table 1 below, shows the evolution in the number of tourists during
the five-year period 2006-2010.

85.     The number of tourists peaked in 2008, but declined from 2009 onward, primarily as a
result of the financial and economic crisis in Europe. The decline was aggravated in 2011 by the
events related to the „Arab Spring‟, which started in Tunisia and was followed, among other
things, by the hostilities in neighboring Libya. The number of tourists declined from 6.7 million
in 2010 to 4.8 million in 2011. However, thanks to new advertising campaigns in foreign markets,
particularly in Europe, a partial rebound has occurred in the early months of 2012. According to
official estimates, between January 1 and March 10, 2012, the number of tourists reached
660,000 compared to 451,000 for the same period in 2011 and 786,000 in 2010.

86.     Despite the decline in numbers of visitors, receipts have consistently increased. As shown
in Table 2 below, total receipts rose from the equivalent of TND 2.8 billion in 2006 to TND 3.5
billion (US$2.3 billion/EUR 1.75 billion) in 2010, or by 25%, which is also reflected in the
increase in receipts per bed and per head of visitor.

87.     Receipts per bed rose from TND 11,186 in 2006 to TND 14,584 (US$9,720/EUR 7,300)
in 2010 or by 30 % and receipts per tourist capita increased by almost 25% during the five-year
period.

Significance of Cultural Tourism

88.     Visits to all cultural and archeological sites in Tunisia continue to be a significant
element of the tourism industry. Table 3 shows developments in the number of tourists,
particularly foreign visitors to cultural and archaeological sites during the period 2006-2010.




                                                          -26-
                                  Table 3: Ratios of Visits to Tourists (2006-2010)

                                                                  (In thousands)
 Total tourists                        6,666       6,793        6,916        6,409   6,667       6,690
                   of whom foreign     5,415       5,536        5,603        5,042   5,149       5,349
 Visits to cultural Sites              2,821       2,786        2,583        2,243   2,136       2,636

 tourists

89.     A possible explanation for the declining ratio is the change in the composition of foreign
tourists. As indicated in Table 1 above, the number of European tourists (who mostly visit
cultural sites) has decreased from 4.7 million in 2006 to 4.2 million in 2010, due to the impact of
the financial and economic crisis in Europe beginning in 2009. An additional cause lies, possibly,
in the changes in the socio-economic profile of the tourists with a growing number of visitors on
low-cost package tours fixated exclusively on „sun, sand and sea‟ at the expense of anything else.

3.        Cost Benefit analysis of the Bardo, Kairouan, and Sousse sub-projects

90.    The analysis of the incremental costs and benefits generated by the expansion and/or
renovation of the two previously existing museums in Bardo (Tunis) and Sousse, and the
construction of the new visitor‟s center in Kairouan yields the following results:
                                   Table 4: Results of Cost-Benefit Analysis
                                  Bardo                    Kairouan                     Sousse
          IRR                     21 %                       30%                         16%
          NPV                     10,583                     5,115                       4,493

91.       The IRR and NPV calculations are based on the following assumptions:

(a) General data:

         The period covered by the analysis is 2008-2027 including 5 years of construction (2008-
          2012) and fifteen years of operation of the facilities.
         For the purposes of the analysis all prices in Tunisian Dinar (TND) have been converted
          in US Dollar (USD) at the rate of 1.5, i.e. the average exchange rate over the 2001-2011
          project implementation period.
         The discount rate used is 10%.
(b) “Without Project? case:
         The number of visitors and corresponding revenue from ticket sales is assumed to stay
          constant at the 2005-2010 average level for Bardo and Sousse. (As a new construction,
          the Kairouan visitors‟ center does not have any „without project‟ comparators).




                                                      -27-
(c) “With Project? case:
           Visitor targets: Annual visitor targets for 2028 have been adopted as follows: Bardo
        about 1 million; Kairouan about 125,000; and Sousse about 150,000. The target for
        Bardo implies an increase of 100% over the 2005-20 average (about 500,000) while the
        target for Sousse represents an increase by over 200% compared to the 2005-2010
        average (about 45,000). The difference in growth is justified in the case of Bardo by the
        logistical constraints which the site will face to absorb an additional 500,000. In the
        case of Sousse the target seems reasonable given the quality of the facility and its
        exceptional location within the old town (medina), a major tourism destination. For
        Kairouan, the assumption is that in the starting year (2013), at least 25% of all tourists
        visiting Kairouan (2005-2010 average: 214,000) will also visit the visitors‟ center,
        located within the medina next to the Kairouan mosque, the main attraction of the city.
        In all three cases, the number of visitors is expected to see a rapid increase in the first
        years (reflecting the attraction exerted by the new buildings) followed by a gradual
        decrease in the growth rates towards the end of the period.
Incremental recurrent expenditure:
92.    Operation and Maintenance (O&M): Annual expenditure for O&M is estimated at 7% of
the building cost (i.e. cumulated O&M expenses equaling the building cost over the 15 year
period, or, three times over a period of 45 years, the expected life time of the buildings in
accordance with customary norms for service lifetime of public buildings).

93.     Additional staff: Required staff will be hired in line with the targets set by the project
indicators, (i.e. a total of 60 for Bardo, 5 for Kairouan, and 30 for Sousse). The average staff
salary is estimated at TND 350, or 41% over the current Tunisian minimum salary of TND 248
(US$165).
Incremental revenue/benefits
94.     Ticket sales: Incremental ticket revenue represents the difference between the amount of
ticket receipts under the “without project? case and the total sales amount in each of the facilities
to all visitors in accordance with a new tariff structure (Bardo: TND 15 for individual foreign
visitors, TND 10 for groups, and TND 4 for Tunisian nationals. Kairouan and Sousse: TND 10
for individual foreign visitors, TND 8 for groups, TND 4 for Tunisian nationals) assuming the
following distribution among categories: individual foreign visitors 40%, groups 50%, and
Tunisian nationals 10%.

95.     Store sales: Previously, neither museum had a cafeteria or a store of consequence with
identifiable revenues. The revenue generated is estimated on the assumption that at least two
thirds of all visitors will spend at least TND 10 (US$7) in the cafeterias and/or the museum
stores in Bardo and Sousse and TND 6 (US$4) in Kairouan and that those sales will have a 30%
commercial profit margin.

96.    External jobs: As any other economic entity, the three facilities will in addition to direct
employment (taken into account as an incremental expense) contribute to the creation of a
number of indirect jobs, both formal and informal. For the purpose of this analysis, it is
estimated that every 1,000 incremental visitors will create at least one full time job paid at the
                                                -28-
Tunisian minimum salary of TND 248, as a proxy for the reality where more likely there will be
multiple full and part time jobs paid at a variety of pay levels.

97.      Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken for the following scenarios:

o        Scenario A: The visitor growth does not meet expectations and stays at low levels up
         to end of period (Bardo 700,000, Kairouan 25,000, Sousse 75,000).
o        Scenario B: Adoption of a new tariff structure is postponed for five years and entrance
         fees remain at current levels (Bardo TND 8, Sousse TND 5).
o        Scenario C: Tariffs will be adjusted upward within five years by about 25% for foreign
         individual visitors and groups (Bardo: TND 20 and TND 12, respectively, Kairouan and
         Sousse: TND 14 and TND 10, respectively) but are kept constant at TND 4 for Tunisian
         nationals.
o        Scenario D: The operation of the three facilities has a positive impact on the economy
         of the surrounding urban areas and stimulates job growth by a higher factor (5 per 1,000
         visitors in the case of Kairouan and Sousse given their exceptional location within the
         medinas and their traditional markets (souks), and 3 per 1,000 visitors in the case of
         Bardo, reflecting the comparatively more unfavorable conditions of its surroundings and
         their limited development potential for tourism related activities (parliament, military
         installations, etc.).
98.      The tables below show the IRR and NPV variations for the four scenarios.

99.       The above analyses highlight several issues:
      (a) The long term economic viability of the three projects hinges to a critical extent on the
          capacity of the renovated and/or new facilities to attract a larger number of visitors. To
          this effect, the rapid development and actual implementation of a solid yet aggressive
          communication and marketing strategy is crucial. This is particularly true for the Sousse

                                                 -29-
   museum, which was closed for quite some time. Information on the re-opening of the
   museum should be made available quickly to tour operators and individual visitors alike
   or the operation will fail to become economically viable. The same risk exists for the
   Bardo, although it already enjoys a well established position in the Tunisian tourism
   industry, is a facility of international quality standards, and can therefore be expected to
   see a rapid recovery in matter of number of visitors. The issue appears slightly less
   critical in the case of the Kairouan visitor‟s center; as it is expected to face significantly
   lower operating costs due to the different nature of its activities.
(b) The effect of a postponement of tariff adjustments and continuing operation at current
   tariff levels is important but not critical for the economic viability of any of the facilities,
   provided the postponement is not deferred beyond a period of five years (and the growth
   of visitors stays on target). The occurrence of the postponement scenario is a serious risk
   as any upward adjustment of tariffs will face the likely opposition of tour operators as
   well as of Government officials and politicians wary about the possibility that such
   changes might hamper the redevelopment of tourism and therefore be detrimental to the
   country‟s economic recovery.
(c) A modest future increase in tariffs for foreign individual visitors and for groups would
   improve the overall economic viability of the facilities though not in a decisive manner.
   Substantial increases in entrance fees are unlikely to be accepted by the Tunisian
   authorities even in the medium and longer term as they might adversely affect the image
   of the country as a tourism destination and lead to a decline in the number of visitors.
(d) The potential impact of the three facilities on the economy of not only the surrounding
   urban areas, but also the host cities as a whole is considerable, though difficult to
   apprehend in detail without extensive surveys. What a cursory analysis confirms,
   however, is the critical need for a departure from the traditional museum management
   philosophy of regarding them as simple repositories of archeological or historic art works,
   and adopting a management system that focuses on outreach and conceives the role of
   these facilities as a centerpiece in the development of the communities of which they are
   part.

100. Given the current political instability and difficult working conditions in Tunisia, a
beneficiary survey was not considered a priority. The Bank team recommends, however that
such a survey be conducted in the context of the proposed ex-post evaluation three years after
project closing.

       Improvements (Bardo Museum, Carthage Archeological Site, Djerba, Kairouan
       Interpretation Center, Basins and Medina; Oudhna Archeological Site; and Sousse
       Archeological Site and Medina), July 2003. This one-day presentation, attended by the
       Ministry of Culture, AMVPPC, and INP, provided coordination between the various
       components.

        Annex 7.       Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Comments on the Draft ICR

102. The Tunisian team responsible for implementing the project reviewed the World Bank‟s
internal report. Our comments relate to (i) the use of a standard methodology for performing the
project ex-post evaluation; (ii) the ratings; and (iii) the project outcomes. We also suggest
another ex-post evaluation, after project completion.

(i) Methodology: In our opinion, the project was clearly a pilot initiative, both for the World
Bank and the Government of Tunisia. It was the first time that the Bank supported such a
comprehensive cultural heritage program encompassing institutional development, marketing
and communication, and site development. It should therefore be evaluated as a pilot project and
not as a standard lending operation. Changes were introduced along the way and the project
exceeded standard duration but the flexibility that guided project implementation on the part of
both the Tunisian team and the World Bank should be commended as it was the most appropriate
way to achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO).

(ii) PDO Rating: The PDO, unchanged throughout the project, was to “support the sustainable
management of the country‟s heritage in order to develop cultural tourism?. As pointed out in the
World Bank report, this included an ambitious institutional objective that was somewhat
unrealistic in the containing bureaucratic environment at that time but the project achievements
(see below under outcomes) have fundamentally changed the perception of the sector, brought
substantial change to the management of the heritage and are beginning to attract and develop
cultural tourism. We therefore believe that the PDO rating, along with the Borrower and Bank
performances, should be in the positive range.

(iii) Project Outcomes: At the outset of the project, the Tunisian authorities opted for World
Bank assistance, whilst access to other sources of financing was available and would have been
less expensive. This choice was based on the comparative advantage of the Bank‟s technical
expertise and experience that was indeed provided throughout the project. In so doing, the
Tunisian team benefitted from an important transfer of knowledge. It acquired the know-how of
project preparation and implementation. In particular, the staff and stakeholders involved in the
expansion and transformation of the three main museums have now acquired invaluable skills
that were inexistent in Tunisia prior to the project. It includes a completely new approach to
cultural heritage management, museum display and management, and cultural tourism
development. This is in addition to the formal management and technical training that was
dispensed as part of the project.

103. The outcome of the project is very important: the country now counts three beautiful
museums that comply with the best international standards, with up-to date attractive museum
displays, likely to attract large numbers of visitors. The methodology for urban renewal of
historic cores has also been tested in Kairouan, where the successful upgrading works carried out


                                              -35-
in the medina have already generated noticeable local economic development through the
creation and development of local businesses, shops, restaurants and cafés, etc.
104. Whilst the ambitious institutional reform that was envisioned at the beginning of the
project could not take place given the rigidity of the pre-revolution period, the project, through
its major museum accomplishments, triggered the initial change required for major reform. It
also financed the preparation of the needed strategies for institutional strengthening, museums
development, communication and marketing, and facilitated the beginning of a true cooperation
between the cultural and tourism entities.

105. Ex-post evaluation. Cultural heritage projects can only produce their benefits over time.
We therefore recommend that an additional ex-post evaluation be carried out in a period of three
to five years, as was actually the case for the rehabilitation of the Hafsia quarter located in the
historic medina of Tunis, as part of the 3rd Urban Development Project, often cited, to this day,
as a best practice and successful achievement.

Summary of Borrower’s ICR

106. The Cultural Heritage Project was in line with the Government prospective, developed in
the 1990ties, to treat the national heritage as a potential asset rather than a mere topic of
scientific studies. This involved: (i) revision of the legislation (Heritage Code) in 1994; (ii)
attribution of new responsibilities to the institutions in charge of the heritage through the
transformation of the National Institute of Arts and Archeology (INAA), which became the
National Heritage Institute (INP) in 1993 and the National Heritage Management Agency
(ANEP), which became the Heritage Valorization and Promotion Agency in 1997 ; and (iii) the
preparation of a National Plan for Cultural Tourism Promotion in 1999.

107. For the Ministry of Culture, the project was innovative in two regards; for the first time
(i) a loan (of a substantial amount relative to the budget of the cultural institutions) was awarded
for a cultural project; and (ii), a comprehensive project, covering all components of the built
heritage, would be implemented over the entire territory.

108. The project lasted ten years. This may seem like a long time, even if the project was
delayed for about a year on account of the Revolution. This duration, however, is common to
such large projects, which disturb the habits after decades of day to day management (extension
of Reina Sofia Museum, paintings, Madrid: 7 years; Acropolis Museum, Athens: 9 years; Maxxi
Museum, modern art, Rome: 12 years; Neues Museum, antiquities, Berlin: 13 years). The quality
of these projects depends for a great part on the team in charge of implementing them. The PGU,
did not demerit, to the contrary, but it appears that it was not fully supported by the two
institutions of the Ministry of Culture, INP and AMVPPC, which were satisfied with a formal
role of participation in the monitoring and approbation processes without any evident will to
discuss and/or implement the proposals/strategies prepared under the project. Collaboration
between the ministries of Culture and of Tourism was also lacking throughout the project.
Finally, Tunisian procurement procedures are particularly long and subject to frequent
modifications. More than half of the time that elapsed between tenders and work completion was
typically devoted to procedures, regardless of the size of the market.

                                               -36-
109. Despite these deficiencies, the project achieved substantial and tangible achievements,
including (i) the three museums (the Bardo, Sousse, and Djerba) and an Interpretation Center
(Kairouan) of international standards and quality; (ii) a stock of technical studies of excellent
quality relative to the improvement and enhancement of other sites (Carthage, Oudhna) and the
strengthening of the heritage sector (museums, promotion and communication), including
concrete recommendations that are immediately implementable; (iii) enhanced management and
technical skills, including collection display, museum management and mosaic restoration; and
(iv) ability to implement projects. It also appears that the institutions in charge of cultural
heritage (AMVPPC and INP) are now engaged in the maintenance, operation, and promotion of
the new museums implemented through the project. As an example and as a result of the project,
a brand new digital ticketing system (AMVPPC funded) has recently been installed at the Bardo
and Sousse museums and will be extended to all other museums. It allows the Agency to keep a
daily picture of revenues and visitors (who came, on which tour, at what time, and at what rate).
This will greatly help the Agency in its programming and management activities.

110. The project represents a major step toward the sustainable management of the country‟s
heritage and the development of cultural tourism. Such projects are critical for the preservation
of assets and for the national identity. They can also contribute greatly to local development and
economic diversification.

What a beautiful travel in time it is to wander in the galleries of the Bardo Museum!
I cannot but acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the current project of renovation of the
palace and of extension of the area of exhibition for both permanent collections and temporary
exhibitions.
In the spirit of excellent standards so dear to ICOM, you are creating a superb tool of museum
display, research, training... and wonderment for the visitors.
