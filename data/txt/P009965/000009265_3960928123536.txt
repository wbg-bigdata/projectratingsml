MEMOR7NDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN/CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR THE PUNJAB IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of US$ 15
million equivalent and development credit of SDR 117.7 million equivalent to
India is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 2' years,
including a five year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity. The loan and credit would help finance the continuation and
expansion of the irrigation modernization program started by the recently
completed First Punjab Irrigation Project (Cr 889-IN).
2.    Background  Agriculture contributes about 35% of GNP and 25% of
exports, and is the largest single sector in the national economy. It engages
65% of the total labor force and provides the base for about 60% of India's
exports. Agriculture production has grown steadily at an annual rate of about
2.5% since the early 1970s. This trend is mainly the result of substantial
increases in the cropped area coming under irrigation, together with the
increased use of high yielding varieties, fertilizer and improved farming
practices which irrigation encourages. However, the continuing increase in
the demand for food in the country requires that agricultural production
continue to increase substantially in the medium term.
3.    The Government of India (GOI) has allocated about 10% of public -ector
investments to irrigation in successive Five Year Plan periods. Irrigat..on
facilities are provided to almost 70 million ha, about 55% of which is surface
water irrigated and the rest served by groundwater. Actual utilization in
many completed irrigation projects remains significantly lower than planned
due to over optimistic assumptions about system efficiency, farmer preference
for water-intensive crops and lax system management. Experience varies widely
over the countrv, however, with some states performing far better than others.
Punjab, and the other states of northwest India are among the most productive
and successful irrigating states. In such states, increased attention is
being paid to maximizing the productivity of existing infrastructure, and
ensuring that the productive potential of land and water resources is
sustained through investments as and when required in modernization, drainage,
and flood control.
4.    Punjab is one of the mop productive agricultural states in India.  It
led the "Green Revolution" beginning in the late 1960's, and by 1985/86,
Punjab produced over 10% of total foodgrain production of India from a
cultivated area only about 3% of that of India. Some 60% of centrally-
procured foodgrains is produced in Punjab for redistribution to deficit
states. The increase in foodgrains production (averaging 15% per annum) during
the Green Revolution was due to the combined effect of higher yields from the
new crop varieties, a sound basic irrigation system, and rapid development of
private groundwater resources. However, the tempo achieved during these peak
years has slowed considerably in recent years because most of the potential
gains from using high yielding varieties were captured very quickly, the scope
for further development of groundwater is limited, and increasing waterlogging
in saline groundwater areas is beginning to affect the area available for
cultivation. Previous Bank involvement in the state of Punjab's irrigation
sector included the Punjab Flood Protection and Drainage Project (Cr. 15-IN),
the Punjab Irrigation Project (Cr. 889-IN), and the Kandi Watershed and Area
Development Project (Ln. 1897-IN).
6.    Rationale for Bank involvement: The Bank's assistance strategy to
India is to support policies and investments that will promote economic growth



- 2 -
and social development in a context of macro-economic stability. The emphasis
is on efficient rosource allocation, increased efficiency in the public
soctor, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the
poor.
7.    The recently completed Punjab Zrrigation Project (Cr. 889-IN) supported
a program of watercourse and canal lining, experimental subsurface drainage
works, and trials of improved irrigation techniques which provide the basis
for much of the proposed project. Canal and watercourse lining, the major
investment, were implemented to high technical standards. Project benefits
(mostly from water savings) marginally exceeded appraisal projections. The
project was well received by the beneficiaries, and the Government of Punjab
sought further assistance for a continuing program of modernization.
8.    During formulation of the proposed project, particular attention was
paid to longer-term issues facing irrigated agriculture in Punjab, as full
development of the state's water resources approaches. Studies conducted under
the previous project, and preparation activities for the proposed project,
involved specialists with experience in surface and subsurface drainage
problems elsewhere in the world, bringing new perspectives to the problem, and
the introduction of revised approaches to dealing with drainage problems.
9.    Project Objectives: Punjab's investment program in irrigation, which
would be supported through the proposed project, has the following objectives:
improving the productivity of the existing irrigation system; raising living
standards in the most backward areas of the state through development of
irrigation facilities; initiating drainage works and studies to address the
short and long-term drainage problems which threaten the environmental and
productive resources of Punjab and other basin states; and further upgrading
the professionalism of the irrigation Department.
10.   A number of discrete investment components have been identified by GOP
for implementation during and following the next Five Year Plan (1990-94). To
allow optimization of the program over time, and delays due to unforeseeable
events, the project would provide scope for some flexibility in the ultimate
composition of the investment program. Some 90% of project funds would be
allocated to the core investments, while the remainder would be used to
support components which are presently at pre-feasibility level of
preparation, and appear to have high returns.
11.   This flexibility would be exercised within a well organized
institutional framework within GOP which would be further strengthened under
the project. The major components of the project would yield benefits in
direct proportion tc the work done, and thus can be advanced or delayed
without prejudice to the returns to the investment. These characteristics
would be exploited in the course of finalizing annual implementation plans.
12.   Project Description:  The following investments would be financed by
the proposed project to support the objectives described above: 4=rnvad
irrigation efficiency would be achieved through lining of branch canals,
distributaries, minors, and watercourses; modernization of control structures;
and construction of a communications systems linking state and district
irrigation offices. Agricultural development in backward areas of the state
would be supported by developing the Kandi Canal over some 20,000 ha;
construction of about 240 public tubewells; and construction of low dams at 9
sites in the Kandi tract; drainape problemg, which pose a threat both to the
environment and the productive capacity of the State would be addressed
through drainage works in and around 200,000 ha of waterlogged areas. New
link drains would be constructed, improving existing drains and associated
structures; installation of subsurface drainage works in a pilot area covering



- 3 -
about 5,000 ha. A major technical study of the options for controlling the
drainage problems of northwest India is curren..ly under execution in parallel
with these physical works. institutiona- develogment would be supported
through provision of institutional facilities and development of specialist
skills in water resource development through training and study tours, and
establishment of a training institute. In addition to these major components,
a number of studies related to water resource issues witnin the State would be
supported.
13.    The project, which would be carried out over a period of 7 years is
estimated to cost US$ 246.5 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. To expedite project mobilization, Bank/IDA
would provide up to US$10 million equivalent for eligible expenditures made
after July 31,1989. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement,
and the disbursement schedu'e are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events is in Schedule C. The Status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedule D. Map 21801 is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8056-IN dated November 19,1989 is teing
distributed separately.
14.   The primary river basins involved in the project (the Ravi, Beas, and
the Sutlej) are international waterways flowing through India to Pakistan
where they join the Indus river. India and Pakistan are signatories to the
Indus Waters Treaty (1960) which sets out their rights and obligations with
respect to these and other tributaries of the Indus system. The Treaty gives
India the unrestricted use of the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers for irrigation
and other uses (Article II) and the right to utilize the natural channels of
the rivers for disposal of drainage effluent (Article IV, Paragraph 8),
provided "each Party will avoid, as fair as practicable, material damage to the
other Party" (Article IV, paragraph 2). Project works have been designed in
accordance with the Treaty and do not give rise to the need for notification
of Pakistan under the terms of the Treaty. Further, in the opinion of the
Bank's staff, the project would not adversely affect the quality or quantity
of the drainage effluent flowing into Pakistan.
15.   Agreed Actions: A condition of disbursement against additional
irrigation investments would be provision to the Bank of detailed cost and
benefit estimates justifying the economic and technical viability of the
investment, and a corresponding financing plan. During negotiations,
agreements were obtained from GOI that the results and conclusions of the
ongoing regional drainage study would be discussed with the Bank by December
31, 1992, followed by a proposal for actions to be taken on the basis of the
results and recommendations of the study. From GOP, assurances were obtained
that (a) execution of civil works would follow the standards set out in the
Punjab Public Works Department Specifications or such other specifications as
are agreed with the Bank; (b) all canals and facilities above the irrigation
outlets would be maintained so as to function in accordance with design
specifications; (c) sufficient resources for maintenance would be provided,
and specifically identified in the annual state budget. The Government of
Punjab's proposals for resettling oustees from the submergence areas were
discussed and agreed.  The standards would ensure that oustees would at least
regain their previous standard of livelihood, and resettlement would be
implemented prior to construction of any dam involving resettlement. All
oustees would be provided with replacement houseplots; small farmers would be
provided with agricultural land under the project; larger farmers would be
assisted with institutional finance to acquire replacement land or take up
other occupations, at their choice. Beneficiaries of the project would be
encouraged to release land in the irrigation command to resettle those
displaced. These arrangements would be carefully monitored and adjusted as
necessary after a minimum trial period of three years. Existing Dam Safety



- 4 -
Roview Panels would continue to function, under terms of reference agreed wlth
the Bank.
16.   knettta:  increaosd irrigation efficiency would bonefit somo 60,000
farm families in existing irrigated areaa, particularly tho.e at the tail ends
of watercourses.  Development of new water resources in the Kandi area would
benefit a further 30,000 farm familiea ii the poorest and most backward part
of the state. Approximately 110,000 ha of new irrigation would result from
modernization of canals and watorcourses, extension of canal conoands and
construction of new storages, walls, and surfaco irrigation systems. The
economic rate of return of project investments varies by component. Canal
lining in areas of saline or high water table has an economic rate of return
of 33%. Watercourse lining returns vary from 20-40% depending on whether the
local groundwater is fresh or saline. Returns to tubewell and surface
irrigation development in the Kandi area are lower, varying from 12-20%, but
these investments provide the only proven basis for economic development in a
backward area of the state. Other project activities such as drainage,
provision of improved regulation and communications, xpgraded and modernized
facilities for the Irrigation Department, and consailtancy services to the
Bhakra Beas Management Board, provide the basis fcr assuring sustained
improvements in agricultural productivity in the area of India which
contributes the major share of surplus foodgrain production. At full
development the project would result in incremental production of about
136,000 tons of rice, 276,000 tons of wheat, and 5,000 tons of cotton.
17.   Risks:  The major risk would be the ability of the Government of Punjab
to fund project investments in patallel with heavy competing demands for
resources in other sectors. Ho,w,ever, project investments are consistent with
allocations in the State's 1990-94 Five Year Plan, and furthermore, major
project investments (in l'ning, tubewell development, and drainage) are such
as to generate benefits in direct proportion to the extent of development.
Technical risks, on the basis of prior experience in the State, and the very
progressive farming sector, would be minimal. The agricultural impact of the
project is based on levels of productivity which are already widely achieved
in the state. Farmers are fully aware of the benefits of irrigation and the
value of water, so that the scope for increased production generated by the
project is unlikely to be wasted.
18.   Recomendation:   I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with Articles of Agreement of the Bank and Association,
respectively, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
