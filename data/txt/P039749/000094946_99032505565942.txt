Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators)
The project is expected to increase the efficiency, quality, and long-term financial sustainability of health services in
Jordan. Indicators to measure the achievement of these objectives include increased hospital occupancy rates,
adoption of treatment protocols, and a reduction in spending on pharmaceuticals as a share of total expenditures.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                            Page 2
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                                            Health Sector Reform Project
The project is based on the findings of the Health Sector Study, prepared jointly by the World Bank and the
Government of Jordan (April 1997). Jordan is at a cross-roads in the evolution of its health system. Passive
acceptance of the status quo would likely result in increasing costs, access gaps for vulnerable populations, wasteful
excess capacity, and poor value for money in terms of health outcomes. Moreover, the rising costs of public
programs driven by the epidemiological transition, population aging, population growth, and clinical and economic
inefficiencies in the delivery system will hinder efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and growth.
The Government of Jordan has decided against passive acceptance of the status quo and instead is embarking upon a
long-term reform program which will, for the first time, draw together all major players in the sector (the Ministry of
Health, the Royal Medical Services, Jordan University Hospital, and the private sector).
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description)
The first phase of this reform will be supported through this project and will focus on three key areas: (i) containing
growth in health expenditures; (ii) assuring the efficient utilization of physical facilities; and (iii) improving the
delivery and quality of health care services. Building upon this foundation, the second phase will likely be expanded
to address equity (universal health insurance), quality (medical education, regulation of the private sector),
management (in the context of Goverment-wide civil service reform), and cost effectiveness (rationalizing the
public/private mix). The five components of the project to support the first phase of the reform strategy are:
A. Rationalizing Jordan's Health Delivery System. Currently, most facility rehabilitation/construction decisions are
based on incomplete investment strategies which do not systematically consider the demographic and
epidemiological characteristics of the population and/or the existing resources available. Similarly, there are no
standards and norms applied in the construction of facilities to ensure efficiency in the allocation of space and
relative proximity of services. The current hospital occupancy rate of 63% suggests considerable room for improved
efficiency (80% occupancy is the generally accepted norm). Rationalizing the investment strategy for health
facilities in Jordan is a priority need and will support improved economic efficiency, clinical effectiveness and
quality of health services.
As a tool for rationalizing investment decisions for public sector hospitals, the Government is preparing a health
facility masterplan which incorporates norms and standards, overall needs, and existing public and private sector
capacity. Scheduled to be completed in March 1999, the masterplan will identify and prioritize all health facility
investment needs. The project would finance the top slice of these priority public sector structural and equipment
investment needs. (Preliminary estimates are that the project will support about one third of all public sector needs.)
The project would also support training to upgrade the clinical skills of MOH medical personnel. Provisional
estimated allocations of this component's civil works/equipment resources based on the institution's relative need as
defined through the masterplan are: MOH: US$18.6 million, RMS: US$9.7 million, and JUH: US$2.7 million.'
B. Developing and Implementing Health Information Systems. This component will address two sets of needs: (i)
for improved public health, it will help develop a national health information system which will provide the
Government with relevant and timely epidemiological data; and (ii) for improved service quality and efficiency at the
health facility level, help develop management information systems for patient records, services, inventory, and
personnel. Financing would be provided for equipment, technical assistance, software development/purchase, and
training.
C. Improving Hospital Financing and Management. This component will include the development and
implementation of a financing system for paying hospitals and physicians which supports the efficient use of
resources in public hospitals. Developing this new system will involve: (i) establishing clear and consistent
accounting standards that would apply to all public health facilities; (ii) setting up hospital-based financial
management systems; and (iii) adopting in RMS and JUH hospitals modern approaches to pay hospitals such as case-
i      These allocations represent base costs and include the estimated fees for architectural/engineering services.

Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                                              Health Sector Reform Project
mix adjusted global budgets and various physician incentive arrangements.2 The goal would be to provide hospital
managers and employees with the incentive to be efficient by linking budgetary allocations to established criteria and
giving managers the tools to operate autonomously and to be more responsive to current or emerging demands. The
project will finance the development of management tools (e.g., financial and accounting systems), equipment, and
training necessary to implement these systems.
D. Reforming the Pharmaceutical Sector. Pharmaceuticals account for over one-fourth of all health spending (2% of
GDP). Such high expenditures reflect inefficiency, waste, and improper use of drugs. To improve the quality and
efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector, a series of reforms would be undertaken: (i) promoting generic substitution;
(ii) implementing treatment protocols and training in the rational use of drugs; (iii) adopting essential drug lists; (iv)
improving overall sector management and pricing policies; and (v) reforming the processes for drug procurement,
storage, distribution, and quality control. The recently drafted National Drug Policy (NDP) will provide the
framework for supporting this pharmaceutical reform program. Specific inputs will include upgrading the facilities
and operations of the drug quality control lab providing technical assistance to develop joint procurement
mechanisms for the public health sector (e.g., MOH, RMS, and JUH) and to implement the recently drafted
legislation which will serve as the legal framework for the pharmaceutical reform program, and providing training in
the use of essential drug lists and treatment protocols. Financing would be provided for rehabilitation of the quality
control laboratory, laboratory and computer equipment, technical assistance, studies, workshops, and materials
development (e.g., to support treatment protocols).
E. Continuing the Reform Process. This project is addressing some, but not all, of the issues identified in the Health
Sector Study. Sectoral reform is not a static process; it is instead to be implemented incrementally in response to
evolving needs and demands. This component will support the continued preparation, evaluation, and monitoring of
the sector reform program. The Project Management Unit (PMU), in collaboration with the Project's Steering
Committee and the Higher Health Council (HHC) will commission studies and recruit technical expertise as needed
to explore alternative reform proposals.3 In addition, this component will support effective implementation of the
project activities by supporting the PMU and project implementation units (PIUs) to carry out their project
management and monitoring functions.
F. The summary cost breakdown is as follows (see Annex 3 for details):

3. Benefits and target population
The benefits of successfully implementing a well structured reform program are clear in terms of the potential for
improved efficiency in the utilization of resources, greater patient and provider satisfaction, improved quality, and
more equitable distribution of health resources. It is also important to note the benefits which have already been
derived during the formulation of the reform strategy. By encouraging efficiency and improving quality, the project
will benefit all stakeholders. Patients will benefit through higher quality and more accessible services. Through the
2      It was decided not to include MOH in the provider payment reforms sub-component because of the civil service
constraints which would not allow hospital managers to have control over staffing, a key criterion for successful provider
payment reform. These constraints do not exist for RMS and JUH.
The composition of the Steering Committee is described below. The HHC is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes
minister-level representatives from the various relevant Government agencies (Ministries of Health, Finance, Planning),
the RMS, and private sector stakeholders.

project, health providers and managers will have better tools to manage resources, incentives for improved
efficiency, new management skills, and patients who are more satisfied with the facility and services available.
Government planners and decision-makers will also benefit from the project as they will have better data from which
to track resource utilization and morbidity/mortality trends which can be applied as tools for effective planning.
Provider payment reforms and rationalizing facility planning will result in better use of overall resources.
Through the rationalization of health infrastructure component, patients can expect to have access to facilities with
services that better match their needs and which are more efficient in terms of the functional flow. Additionally, as
described in the Health Sector Study, adopting an investment strategy which is based on better utilization of facilities
(e.g., 80% occupancy) could reduce needed investments over the next 15 years by as much as 50%. The health
information component will also benefit patients since facilities will have basic management systems for better
managing resources (including inventory and staff) and patient records (important for case management). The
provider payment reforms will foster improved provider satisfaction and facilitate managers' ability to respond to
local needs. Finally, the pharmaceutical reforms will reduce out of pocket expenditures for drugs and better ensure
that pharmaccuticals are appropriately prescribed.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements (additional details are available in the Implementation Volume)
Implementation period. The project would be implemented over a period of five years.
Executing agencies. (see Chart 1 below). To ensure continuity from project preparation to implementation, the
technical quality of the reform program, and effective coordination among the institutions, three groups were formed
to guide and manage project activities. The groups are the: (i) Project Steering Comnittee; (ii) Project Management
Unit (PMU); and (iii) Project Implementation Units (PIUs) - one in each of the three implementing institutions (the
MOH, RMS, and JUH).
Project coordination. The PMU will ensure that policy guidance from the Steering Committee is incorporated into
project implementation by serving as the link between the PIUs and the Steering Committee. With respect to policy
development, the PMU will manage the recruitment of technical experts to: (i) develop various aspects of the reform
program; and (ii) work with the implementing agencies on the cross-sectoral reform programs (e.g., developing the
health information systems and provider payment reforms). With respect to implementation, the Project Director,
who will report to the Chair of the Steering Comrnittee (see below), will through meetings and regular reporting
arrangements, coordinate the activities of the PIUs to ensure they support the reform agenda and manage the project
accounts, including the Special Account. In addition to facilitating coordination among the various agencies, the
Project Director (recruited on a contractual basis) will be responsible for monitoring and tracking project
implementation and ensuring that project objectives are achieved. Terms of reference for this post are in the
Implementation Volume.
Project oversight. Supported by the PMU's regular updates, the Steering Committee will provide policy guidance,
facilitate coordination and oversee implementation.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements. The PMU will establish and maintain project accounts
in formats acceptable to the Bank and have them (including the Statements of Expenditure and Special Account)
audited each fiscal year, in accordance with Bank guidelines, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
Project Director will ensure that all the audited project accounts will be prepared in English and furnished to the
Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request.
Special Account: to facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government would open a Special
Account in the Central Bank which would be maintained in the PMU under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. Administrative details of the Special Account are included in Annex 6. The Project Director and the
respective PIU manager will approve payment requests and signatory authority will be vested with the Chair of the
Steering Committee (or his/her delegate) and the Secretary General of the MOP.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The Project Director will be responsible for monitoring progress against
agreed performance monitoring indicators specified in Annex 1. The PIUs will furnish the PMU with semi-annual
progress reports, summarizing the current status of project implementation (versus the implementation plan and
reasons for deviation from the plan) and financial records, constraints faced and corrective actions to be taken, a
work plan for the subsequent six-months, and an update on the agreed-upon monitoring indicators (most of the
sector-specific data to be used to monitor project impact will be available through the national health information
system). These reports will be consolidated by the PMU and forwarded to the Bank semi-annually. An Early
Implementation Assessment will be done in partnership between the Bank, the PIUs and the Project Director within
18 months after Board approval. The PMU and the PIUs would prepare a detailed mid-term report to serve as the
basis for a Project Mid-Term Review, scheduled for three years after loan effectiveness. The PMU, with input from
the PIUs, will also prepare an Implementation Completion Report within six months of the Closing Date of the Bank
loan.
Retroactive financing. During Loan negotiations, the Government requested retroactive financing for eligible
expenditures procured in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. Up to 10 percent of the Loan amount (US$3.5
million) is being proposed.
Chart 1. Implementation Arrangements
STEERING COMMITTEE
Project Oversight: The Steering Committee will provide policy guidance, facilitate coordination and oversee
implementation. The Committee will be composed of: (i) the Minister of Health (Chair) and the Secretary
General; (ii) the RMS Director; (iii) the JUH General Director; and (iv) the Minister of Planning (or their
delegate).
PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT (PMU)
Project Coordination: The PMU, headed by the Project Director, will report to the Steering Committee and
include, inter-alia: (i) the Project Director; (ii) an accountant; (iii) technical specialists recruited on an as needed
basis; and (iv) support staff. Given the cross-sectoral nature and important reform measures of the Health Sector
Reform Project, overall project management responsibility would form the foundation of the PMU's work
program. The Project Director will have specific responsibilities for project management and will work in
collaboration with the three PIU managers to: (i) coordinate the implementation of the project among the three
executing agencies; (ii) ensure that the project's activities support the achievement of each component's
objectives; (iii) submit periodic progress reports to the Steering Commnittee and the World Bank; and (iv) manage
the project accounts.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION UNITS (PIUs)
MOHIPIU          JUE/PIU          RMS/PIU
Project Implementation: The MOH, JUTH, RMS project activities would be implemented by their respective PIUs.
The PITJs would implement these activities in accordance with agreed upon procedures, in particular concerning
procurement, project accounts and project auditing. In addition to a Manager, the PIUs would be staffed with
sufficient procurement specialists, accountants, engineers, architects and administrative staff to ensure adequate
and timely implementation. The staff should be well trained and familiar with Bank procurement procedures and
financial guidelines. The PIUs will report to the Project Director at the PMU.
Status of readiness for implementation. Project management: All staff of the PIUs and the Project Director have been
appointed. Project inputs: The masterplan for health facilities will be completed by March 31, 1999. Preliminary
results have indicated several rehabilitation projects which are high priority in the masterplan and for which work

could begin immediately (architectural plans and tender documents are either complete or being finalized). It is
therefore expected that the first year facility rehabilitation program would include the rehabilitation of Al Bashir
Hospital (US$12.0 million) (preparation of masterplan for this hospital is being financed under the ongoing Health
Management Project), and the second phase of rehabilitation of Princess Basma Hospital (US$0.6 million - phase I of
rehabilitation financed under the ongoing Health Management Project). In addition, RMS has requested retroactive
financing of a laboratory currently under construction (US$7.0 million). The legal framework (the National Drug
Policy) for the pharmaceutical reform program has been adopted and detailed action plans for implementation
prepared. Finally, all terms of reference for the technical assistance have been drafted in collaboration with the
counterpart teams and are ready to be tendered.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project:         Document number/date of last CAS discussion: 14999,
10/24/95
* Establishing the enabling environment for sustainable growth through targeted interventions for improved
efficiency and effectiveness (e.g., the use of a comprehensive masterplan for defining investment priorities,
rationalizing the use of pharmaceuticals, providing physicians with incentives for improved efficiency, etc.).
* Addressing human resource constraints by improving health services which will reduce loss of productivity due
to morbidity.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Jordan is in the midst of the epidemiological transition with acute respiratory infections and perinatal diseases still
causing a large loss of productive life while non-communicable diseases and illnesses are becoming increasingly
prevalent. Infant and child mortality indicators (e.g., under 5 and infant mortality rates) are favorable compared with
other countries in the region and with other countries at similar levels of income, although they are still high by
OECD standards. Despite significant declines in fertility in recent years (from 5.6 children per woman in 1990),
Jordan's total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.6 children per woman is still high. Population growth is very high (3.6% per
year, doubling by the year 2018), largely as a result of high fertility, low mortality, and migration.
The Health Sector Study highlighted that while the health system performs relatively well in terms of overall access
to health services (financial and physical) and outcomes (as measured by such indicators as infant mortality and life
expectancy), it is expensive and inefficient, and there are geographic maldistributions of resources. Jordan spends
about 8 percent of its GDP on health care, well in excess of most middle income and even some western
industrialized countries. While Jordan provides coverage for its poor and disabled, an estimated 20% of the
population lacks formal coverage, and Government financing for health care could be better structured to reflect
ability to pay. Lack of a coordinated policy apparatus and relevant data for decision-making precludes effective
policy-making across Jordan's multiple public and private financing arrangements and delivery systems.
There are significant inefficiencies in the service delivery system. There is excess overall capacity as evidenced by a
hospital occupancy rate of 63% (69% in the public sector and 49% in the private sector; 80% is the generally
accepted benchmark). Studies indicate that inappropriate hospital use results from lack of an effective referral
system (e.g., patients seek primary care services at higher level facilities) and a hospital-based orientation for
treatment. Research supports that inefficient case management leads to costly inpatient treatment of conditions that
could be treated on an outpatient basis and excessive use of expensive drugs. The centralized allocation process for
supplying and equipping facilities and paying personnel in the public sector provides few incentives for the efficient
delivery of services at the individual institution level. Finally, there are inefficiencies in terms of management,
procurement, storage, distribution, pricing policies, and the rational use of pharmaceuticals, which account for over
one fourth of health spending and 2% of GDP.

Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan                                                           Health Sector Reform Project
There is limited data to evaluate the quality of care and consumer satisfaction. The rapid growth in the private sector
suggests dissatisfaction with the services provided through the public sector and is leading towards a two-tiered
system of care (those who can afford to pay go to the private sector while those who cannot are relegated to the
public health facilities). The lack of management systems (e.g., for patient records, inventory) in the public sector
does not foster good case management and follow-up. Indeed, there are few incentives in the public sector for
providers to be concerned about the quality of services provided. Quality is also jeopardized by the lack of standards
and norms for infrastructure.
Relationship with the Government's strategy. The Health Sector Study proved to be a launching point for reform for
two reasons: (i) the added value of bringing together representatives from the various sectors during the preparation
and discussion of the study underscored the need for a cross-sectoral approach to developing health services; and (ii)
the findings clearly indicate the need for a longer-term strategy which can be implemented incrementally.
As described previously, the Government has developed a longer term strategy for addressing the issues highlighted
above. This project will be used to finance the first phase of this strategy. The components and inputs have been
carefully selected to ensure that they will contribute to the long term goals of improved equity, efficiency,
effectiveness, quality, and sustainability. At the same time, the activities are currently feasible (politically, socially,
financially, and institutionally), technically sound, and will provide a firm foundation for subsequent reform
measures. Other issues, which are more complex and perhaps more politically volatile (such as universal health
insurance, regulation of the private sector) will be put before the HHC once this Commnittee is reactivated in earnest.
For such issues, it will take time to develop the technical soundness of the reform proposals and gamner the cross-
sectoral support required for their adoption and implementation. The project will finance technical assistance and
feasibility studies to support further preparation of these reform proposals. Epidemiological and demographic issues,
such as population growth, are being addressed by other donors (e.g., USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA).
In sum, the Government's strategy is to tackle incrementally the reform agenda which is too vast for one particular
program. The proposed project represents the first step in the development and implementation of concrete measures
to address prevailing cross-sectoral issues identified in the Health Sector Study. The project will strengthen the
Government's capacity for considering and addressing issues from a macro-perspective while providing the means to
address several priority areas of the reform agenda.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
As noted above, this project is part of a series of activities designed to address the prevailing sectoral issues. The
principal issues identified above (para. 6) which will be addressed under this phase of the reform program are:
*  Inefficiency. To be addressed by strengthening management tools and improving resource management,
introducing incentives to providers, rationalizing the investment program, coordinating the different drug
procurement, storage, and distribution systems, developing essential drug lists, and training physicians in the
rational use of drugs.
*  Containing growth in expenditures by aligning the investment program to better utilization of facilities and
reducing wastage, providing managers with tools to track resource utilization, addressing the pharmaceutical
pricing policies, and reducing the improper use of pharmaceuticals.
* Addressing the geographic maldistribution of resources and excess capacity by developing and implementing an
investment strategy for the sector which takes into consideration existing public and private sector capacity and
needs of the catchment population.
*  Quality. Case management will be strengthened through the patient record systems to be developed, educating
providers and the public on the rational use of drugs, and provider payment reform (which will introduce
incentives for improved quality of service delivery). In addition, the norms and standards to be developed for the
investrnent masterplan will enhance the quality and efficiency of infrastructure.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
*  Maintain status quo. Rejected because the current situation is leading to the development of a two-tiered system
of care, is expensive, and not sustainable in the long run.
* Develop a more comprehensive reform program. This alternative was rejected following considerable discussion
on the feasibility of more wide-sweeping reform (e.g., universal health insurance) and the need to establish the
institutional capacity to manage reform (the HHC).
*  Improve public health. Jordan has relatively good health outcomes although its population growth remains high
at about 3.6% per year (a rate well in excess of many other countries in the region and other countries with
comparable income levels) and maternal and child health (MCH) indicators are higher than industrialized
countries (although they have improved considerably over the last few decades). Incorporating targeted
programs to address public health issues, such as population growth and MCH, was rejected under the project
because of Jordan's relatively good outcomes and since the prevailing public health issues are already being
adequately addressed by other donors (USAID, UNFPA) and NGOs (although the impact of these programs has
not yet translated into a low population growth rate due largely to the time lag).
*  Strengthen regulation ofprivate sector. Although there is room for strengthening regulation of the private
sector, it was decided that this issue would be tackled incrementally under the project. Preparation of the
masterplan and development of the national health information system will be the first steps and will serve as
tools for discussion with the private sector. With the masterplan, policy makers will have an accurate assessment
of the existing capacity (public and private), the degree of overlap, and potential areas for collaboration (e.g.,
making use of services in the private sector rather than introducing them in the public sector). In addition, the
Government will be better prepared to introduce a "certificate of need program" (whereby investment decisions
and procurement of major equipment would be based on a demonstrated need), develop a contracting program,
and define the framework for an accreditation program. Strengthening the national health information system
will improve the public sector's capacity to measure and monitor the services provided in the private sector.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposedproject design
* Donor coordination. The implementation experience from other projects (e.g., Jordan Primary Health Care) has
demonstrated that although there are advantages to incorporating the contributions from other donors into a
project, it is critical for the integrity of the project that an efficient and effective mechanism for supervising all
project interventions (including those of other donors) be defined. To address this lesson under the proposed
project, contributions from donors would be welcome to complement the project activities, however the project
will be designed as a "stand alone" operation. If other donors are to support project activities, a prerequisite will
be a commitment to make all relevant infornation available to the PMU, PlUs and the Bank to ensure that these
contributions contribute to the achievement of the project's development objectives. The recently approved
USAID funded PHR Project and the WHO programs in pharmaceuticals serve as models for donor collaboration
under the proposed project. For example, through ongoing discussions between the Bank, Government, and
USAID, the PHR program is being developed to complement the Bank financed project by supporting needed
technical assistance activities.
*  Training. New staff to PIUs must receive adequate training in World Bank procedures. To ensure that such
training is made available, the new staff of the PIUs will be required to participate in the Bank's regional training
activities (e.g., those conducted by procurement and disbursement staff) and in relevant project management
courses during the first year of implementation.
* Monitoring. The specific indicators to be applied and the responsibility for their compilation must be clearly
articulated at the start of the project. To address this lesson learned, a detailed project monitoring and
implementation plan has been developed and agreed upon with the Government for each component (see the
Implementation Volume). In addition, the PMU has been specifically designated as responsible for project
monitoring. Finally, the human resources department, in collaboration with other sectors, is developing standard
reporting templates to ensure consistency and completeness of monitoring across projects.
*  Implementation delays. The bureaucracy of certain Government procedures and weakness of the MOH in
particular continue to hinder implementation (e.g., excessive number of signatures required to process routine
requests, lack of authority of managers). It is expected that the formation of the Steering Committee, which will
draw together the key players, will provide a mechanism for addressing delays and developing solutions in a
timely fashion. The Bank is also working with the Government to develop an action plan for expediting
procurement under all Bank projects. To this end, a Country Procurement Assessment Review was recently
completed in Jordan (December 1998).
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The Government's and other key players' in the sector (e.g., physician associations, private hospital association, etc.)
ownership of the identification of the key sectoral issues as a cornerstone to the reform agenda was assured through
their active participation in the preparation of the Health Sector Study. The Government's agreement to issue the
document in "red cover" underscores their belief in its accuracy and usefulness. Senior level interest in the project is
unprecedented. At the request of the Government, the Pre-AppraisallAppraisal Mission briefed His Majesty King
Hussein and the members of the HHC (the HHC was briefed by the Identification Mission as well). An additional
illustration of the Borrower's commitment to the reform process has been the interest in strengthening the HHC as a
vehicle for developing and implementing a coordinated reform strategy. Further, the Government formed well-
represented counterpart teams to work with the project preparation missions during their visits in January and July
1997. In addition to staff from the public sector (MOH, MOP, RMS, and JUH), the counterpart teams included
representatives from the Social Security Corporation, private hospitals, the Jordan Medical Association, and the
Pharmaceutical Association. Such representation ensured that the views of the stakeholders were considered in
preparing the specific components of the reform program. Finally, the Government is continuing project preparation
activities in expectation of loan effectiveness (e.g., the preparation of the health facility masterplan and drafting of
the national drug policy are ongoing).

In addition to the Government, donors and representatives of the private health sector have expressed considerable
interest in the sector study and project objectives and inputs. Two donors' meetings were held during the mission's
visits to discuss the findings of the sector study and options for involvement within the reform framework. In
addition, the mission briefed the members of the Private Hospital Association on the sector study and project
objectives.
12. Value added of Bank support
The added value of the Bank's involvement in this health reform process includes: (i) continuing the partnership
developed during preparation of the Health Sector Study; (ii) the Bank's access to high-caliber technical experts to
work with the Jordanians in the formulation of the project activities; (iii) the Bank's ability to look at the country
from a macroeconomic perspective (health spending at 8% of GDP accounts for a significant portion of Jordan's
economy); (iv) ability of the Bank to provide the resources necessary to support the effective implementation of a
sectoral reform program; and (v) the Bank has a comparative advantage over other donors in terms of being able to
develop and maintain a dialogue with the private sector whose importance and role in the delivery and financing of
care continues to expand.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4)
Taken together the project components provide a logical set of activities to improve public and pharmaceutical sector
quality and efficiency. Improving public and pharmaceutical sector efficiency are necessary first steps in a longer-
term broad-based reform effort. They will also improve management and policy-making capacity at all levels of the
system. Basing the Government's investment strategy on private sector capacity promotes more efficient use of
combined public and private resources. The provider payment reforms lay the basis for significant gains in efficiency
and sustainability over the longer term. The pharmaceutical reforms will increase efficiency and quality and should
result in significant short-term savings. Given the rudimentary state of knowledge and practice in many of these more
modem health management/software type innovations, large savings in the short run for every project component
should not be expected. However, this project will lay the basis for important systems efficiency improvements and
more effective health system management. In addition, it is forcing coordination across the multiple public programs
that rarely interact as well as laying the groundwork for coordinating public sector investments with private sector
capacity. Other important aspects of the reform agenda that are not included in this project are generally being
handled by other donors (e.g., population growth) and/or are being addressed by the Government as the next phase of
Jordan's health reform agenda (e.g., universal health insurance).
Fiscal impact
Since the Government's counterpart funds (averaging less than US$3.0 million annually) represent only about 1% of
the country's annual investment budget (US$300 million annually), it is not expected that the project will have any
significant fiscal impact. As discussed in detail in Annex 4, it is possible that program costs will increase nominally
in the short run. However, any increases should be offset in the medium to longer term through implementation of
the delivery rationalization and pharmaceutical reform components.
14. FinancialAssessment (see Annex 5)
IBRD and the Government are the project's financiers. The involvement of other donors, in particular for the
provision of agreed upon technical assistance, will be managed by the Project Director to ensure complementarity
with project objectives. As discussed above, the project is not expected to produce any significant financial burden
and in the longer run, cost increases would be offset through efficiency measures.

15. Technical Assessment
The project is based on extensive analysis completed as part of the Health Sector Study. Those priorities of the study
which the Government identified as highest priority and politically realistic have been incorporated into the project
design. Preparation of the project has involved extensive local participation as well as involvement of senior level
technical consultants. Finally, the project design has incorporated the final specification of the project activities (e.g.,
designing the health information systems) through the inclusion of preparatory and feasibility studies which will be
done as a first stage of project implementation.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The MOH has extensive experience in implementing Bank-financed projects, having
previously implemented the Primary Health Care Project and currently implementing the Health Management Project.
The procurement and financial systems of the MOH are acceptable (including for the use of SOEs) and consistent
with Bank guidelines. From a technical perspective, the MOH staff are well qualified to handle implementation.
Bureaucracy continues, however, to hinder implementation (see block 2, para 10). The RMS and JUH however, have
limited experience with working with the Bank. A review of the procurement and financial management systems
(including those for SOEs) of the RMS and JUH has found that they are largely consistent with Bank policies and
guidelines. To ensure timely implementation according to World Bank procedures, resources to support the PIUs'
participation in relevant training courses has been incorporated into the project costs. To ensure clear definition of
tasks, timetables, responsibilities and expected outputs and outcomes, terms of reference for key staff and detailed
implementation plans, as well as performance monitoring indicators, have been prepared.
b. Project management: The Government has limited experience in implementing projects that involve several
different executing agencies. Therefore, the PMU has been designed to provide the cross-sectoral support and to
facilitate coordination and collaboration through the appointment of the Project Director.
17. SocialAssessment
Participation by the stakeholders was sought during project preparation. Counterpart teams included representatives
of all sectors (including the private sector), interest groups (e.g., the Private Hospital Association, the Jordan Medical
Association, and the National Population Commission) were briefed periodically, and working group sessions held
with key staff to solicit their input. Feedback from the stakeholders has been taken into consideration in project
design and their representatives continue to be involved in project preparation activities (e.g., a representative from
the Pharmaceuticals Manufactures' Association is a member of the National Drug Policy Committee). Finally,
feedback from the stakeholders will be solicited during project implementation through, for example, patient surveys.
It is expected that the project will have a positive social impact. The components of the project will support
improved access to and quality of health services overall. In particular, the population will benefit from receiving
care from better trained physicians with incentives to provide quality care in facilities which conform to norms and
standards and are functionally efficient. The drugs used for their treatment will be better targeted to their actual
needs, and they will likely spend less of their resources on purchasing drugs. Any resistance to the project would
likely arise from those people with vested interests in the growth of the private sector, in particular the private
pharmaceutical sector. Finally, one of the Government's goals is to introduce national health insurance which would
potentially have significant benefits from a social perspective. This project would support this goal by improving the
use of resources and quality of health delivery, necessary prerequisites to expanding coverage.
18. Environmental Assessment       Environmental Category: B
The only project input which might have an environmental impact would be the rehabilitation of priority public
health facilities, for which an environmental impact assessment would be required. The capacity to handle medical
and non-medical waste will be incorporated into the norms and standards being developed for the sector. As such,

consideration will be given to the waste treatment/disposal capacity at health facilities during the preparation of the
investment masterplan and during the preparation of facility rehabilitation plans. Based on the findings of the
masterplan (i.e., the degree to which current waste disposal practices are adequate), appropriate regulatory reviews
and staff training would be introduced under the guidance of the PMU.

20. Sustainability
Over the next twenty years, Jordan will need to enhance its social programs to handle its dual disease burden as well
as its transition to and integration in the global economy at the same time that its health sector will face increased
financial pressures resulting from the growing non-communicable disease burden and new and higher cost medical
technologies. If current trends continue, it is estimated that Jordan will be spending 12% of its GDP on health in
2010. This project will promote the long-run financial sustainability of the health care financing system by cost-
effectively improving quality and increasing the economic efficiency of the service delivery network.

Private sector providers could feel threatened by the preparation of a needs based investment masterplan. Similarly,
the private pharmacies and local manufacturers could feel threatened by the pricing policy reforns, the move towards
the use of generic drugs, and the project's efforts to rationalize (reduce) the use of pharmaceuticals.
Block 4: Main Loan Conditions
Prior to negotiations, the Government provided:
- Pharmaceutical reform. Confirmation of the establishment, composition, and terms of reference of the
National Drug Policy Committee.
During negotiations, the Government confirmed that with respect to:

rationale and cost estimates) will be discussed and agreed upon annually. The program will be designed
to enhance the operational efficiency of priority public sector health facilities through the rehabilitation
of MOH, RMS, and JUH facilities according to the findings of the health facility masterplan. The
program for years 2-5 is to be subrnitted by the PMU by October 1st each year (the rehabilitation program
for the first year has been agreed upon (see "status of readiness for implementation", page 5)).
*  Training of MOH Staff The training to be provided to MOH staff under Component 1 will be discussed
and agreed upon annually. The training plan for the following year is to be submitted by October 1st of
each year.
*  Procurement. To ensure full compliance with the Bank's procurement guidelines, the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents will be used for international competitive bidding.
*  Retroactive Financing. Up to 10% of the loan amount (JS$3.5 million) could be made available for
retroactive financing of approved activities eligible for expenditure which are procured according to
World Bank Guidelines.
*  Counterpart Funding. The required yearly project counterpart funding, including construction and
rehabilitation programs, will be allocated to the implementing agency budgets by March 3 lt of each
year.

Jordan Health Sector Reform Project
Detailed Project Description
This project is based on the findings of the recently completed Health Sector Study, prepared jointly
between the World Bank and the Government of Jordan, which identified both the strengths and
weaknesses of the current health delivery and financing system.' Jordan is at a cross-roads in the
evolution of its health system. Passive acceptance of the status quo would likely result in increasing
costs, access gaps for vulnerable populations, wasteful excess capacity, and poor value for money in
terms of health outcomes. Moreover, the rising costs of public programs driven by the epidemiological
transition, population aging, population growth, and clinical and economic inefficiencies in the service
delivery system will hinder efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and growth.
The Government of Jordan has decided against passive acceptance of the status quo and instead is
embarking upon a long term reform program which will, for the first time, draw together all major
players in the sector (the Ministry of Health, Royal Medical Services, Jordan University Hospital, and the
private sector). The first phase of this reform will be supported through this project and will focus on
three key areas: (i) containing growth in health expenditures; (ii) assuring the efficient utilization of
physical facilities; and (iii) improving the delivery and quality of health care services. Building upon this
foundation, the second phase will likely be expanded to address equity (universal health insurance),
quality (medical education, regulation of the private sector), management (in the context of Government-
wide civil service reform), and cost effectiveness (rationalizing the public/private mix). The five
components of the project to support the first phase of the reform strategy are:
* Rationalizing Jordan's Health Delivery System
* Developing and Implementing Health Information Systems
I Improving Hospital Financing and Management
- Reforming the Pharmaceutical Sector
* Continuing the Reform Process2
Project Component 1 - Total Cost: US$35.9 million
Rationalizing Jordan's Health Delivery System
Introduction
The Government is preparing an investment masterplan which incorporates norms and standards, overall
needs, and existing public and private sector capacity. Scheduled to be completed in June 1998, the
masterplan is being prepared with support from international consultants working in partnership with
counterpart teams. The project would provide financing for structural and equipment investments for
public sector.health facilities identified in the masterplan as the highest priority to improve the operating
For additional details on Jordan's health sector (epidemiological and demographic indicators, financing and
delivery systems, principal issues, and options for reform), please see the Government of Jordan/World Bank
Health Sector Study, released in "red cover" in April 1997.

efficiency of these institutions as well as more efficient use of combined public and private sector
capacity. The project would also support training to upgrade the clinical skills of Ministry of Health
(MOH) medical personnel.
Current Situation
Currently, most investment decisions are based on ad hoc investment decisions which do not
systematically consider the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the population and/or the
existing resources available, reflecting a lack of institutional capacity at both the MOH and Royal
Medical Services (RMS), as well as the Ministry of Planning (MOP), which has overall responsibility for
investment plan development and aid coordination. Similarly, there are no standards and norms applied
in the construction of facilities to ensure efficiency in the allocation of space and relative proximity of
services. The trend has been to build new facilities to match population growth, without assessing the
extent to which existing facilities are being used at their maximum capacity. The current hospital
occupancy rate of 63% suggests considerable room for improved efficiency given that 80% occupancy is
the generally accepted standard for optimizing operational efficiency. Rationalizing the investment
strategy for health facilities in Jordan is a priority need and will support improved economic efficiency,
clinical effectiveness and quality of health services.
Project Inputs
As noted above, the masterplan is under preparation by a team of international consultants and a
Jordanian counterpart team. The methodology for preparing the masterplan is as follows:
*     the development of specific criteria and indicators to be applied to measure the need for
health services, of what type, and their relative priority as a tool for the development of
an investment plan based on quantifiable demand (actual and projected). Such indicators
include the current disease/illness profile of the population, health seeking behavior
patterns, and the proximity of existing health services.
*     using these criteria, a "health services map" is being developed, indicating where
facilities, and the corresponding types of services to be offered, should be located to
match the needs of the catchment population.
*     developing norms and standards for health facilities and their individual departments
which maximnize their operational efficiency. Such standards include schedules of
accommodation, basic criteria (e.g., number of beds per ward, number of operating
theaters per surgical bed), and equipment lists.
*     using these norms and the demand indicators as described above, teams are completing
detailed assessments of existing infrastructure to: (i) determine the extent to which these
norms are met and the changes that should be introduced to improve the functional flow;
and (ii) identify the areas where services provided do not match the needs of the
population being served.
*     this data is then to be incorporated into the health services map to delineate the existing
gaps and their relative priority (e.g., rehabilitation prior to expansion of infrastructure) as
the cornerstone for the development of an investment plan based on demonstrated need
and optimal efficiency.



Annex 2
Page 3 of 11
finally, this analysis will be systematized to ensure that subsequent investment plans
accurately reflect the sectoral needs and priorities.
Preliminary estimates suggest that the total costs for rehabilitation (including the provision of needed
equipment) of Jordan's health facilities in the public sector are about US$90.0 million. About 65% of
the rehabilitation needs are in the MOH, 25% in the RMS, and 10% at Jordan University Hospital (JUH).
The proposed Health Sector Reform Project will fund the first phase of rehabilitation of public sector
facilities at a cost of about US$3 1.0 million. Final selection of facilities to be included in the project
would be based on the comprehensive masterplan being developed for the country (the masterplan will be
completed by March 31, 1999). Preliminary results have indicated several rehabilitation projects which
are expected to appear as high priority in the masterplan and for which work could begin immediately
(architectural plans and tender documents are either complete or being finalized). It is therefore expected
that the first year facility rehabilitation program would include the rehabilitation of Al Bashir Hospital
(US$12.0 million - preparation of masterplan for hospital fmanced under ongoing Health Management
Project) and the second phase of rehabilitation of Princess Basma Hospital (US$0.6 million - phase 1 of
rehabilitation financed under the ongoing Health Management Project). In addition, it is expected that
the RMS will request retroactive financing of a laboratory currently under construction (US$7.0 million).
Fhe training program for MOH staff (US$ 100,000) would be based on an agreed-upon action plan, to be
reviewed and discussed annually.
Project Component 2 - Total Cost: US$3.3 million
Developing and Implementing Health Information Systems
hntroduction
This component will address two sets of needs: (i) for improved public health, it will help develop a
national health information system which will provide the Government with relevant and timely
epidemiological data; and (ii) for improved service quality and efficiency at the health facility level, help
develop management information systems for patient records, services, inventory, and personnel.
Current Situation
MOH hospitals have limited information systems. For example, Al Bashir Hospital, the largest public
hospital with over 500 beds, 32 specialities and an enormous campus, has only a few computers. Small
hospitals and primary care sites have nothing. The MOH headquarters has developed a database for
reporting and analyzing utilization and statistical data which is submitted by hospitals manually.
JUH is fairly advanced in its use of information systems. They started development of an information
system but became dissatisfied with the progress and acquired their own internal resources to move the
project along. They have developed a long list of applications. While these applications are shallow in
functionality for a tertiary care facility, an initial examination of them revealed that they might be quite
acceptable for the vast majority of hospitals in this project. The possibility of using this already available
suite of software should be considered.
The smaller hospitals of the RMS have limited computers. The King Hussein Medical Center has a data
center, an obsolete mainframe, and some smaller, acceptable applications, like archiving of medical
records over a fiber optic network.

Issues
Health information systems are necessary because currently it is impossible to perform the proper
epidemiological and public health analysis on a national level. It is also impossible to have significant
decentralization of management authority without appropriate information infrastructure.
No systems are in place at the hospital level which would support efforts to run hospitals more efficiently
by measuring their efficiency (patient flow management, inventory management, cost effectiveness and
quality of physicians, as well as utilization). If the Government intends to decentralize decision making
and to hold organizations responsible for their budget, then information systems are needed.
The few existing management information systems are managed and operated independently, with no
data sharing across institutions, except for the minimal data set submitted to the MOH at periodic
intervals, usually on paper. The network and database systems to be introduced under the project will
encourage data sharing and reduction of duplicate resources.
Project Inputs
Financing would be provided for equipment, technical assistance, software developmentlpurchase, and
training. Specifically, the project will support the collection, analysis, distribution, and storage of
epidemiological data; equip hospital managers with tools for improving quality, efficiency, and physician
effectiveness, and provide an infrastructure that will support decentralization. Databases will be
introduced at the central MOH and directorate level to support the national information database, simple
information systems developed at the facility level for the collection of epidemiological, cost, quality,
utilization, and efficiency data, and a network established for distributing this data. These activities are
closely linked with those being completed under the ongoing Health Management Project (Ln. 3574-JO),
namely computerizing the administration of the central MOH and its directorates.
The project will be implemented in phases. The first phase is an extensive pilot project, which will test
the design of these national health information systems, namely the functioning and interaction of its
main components: databases, networks, and data collection systems. This pilot phase will last from 24 to
30 months and will implement the following set of systems:
1. A "wide area network" will be established among all the participants (MOH, RMS, and
JUH).
2. A data center and preliminary data warehouse will be established at MOH.
3. Data collection software to support the national health information system will be piloted at
MOH, JUH, and RMS facilities.
4. Software to support patient, service, inventory, and personnel management systems will be
piloted at MOH, RMS, and JUH hospitals and health centers.
The second phase would be to introduce the health information systems in all public facilities upon
successful completion of the pilot phase.

Project Component 3 - Total Cost: US$1.0 million
Improving Hospital Financing and Management
Introduction
This component will include the development and implementation of:
*  clear and consistent accounting standards for Ministry of Health (MOH), Royal Medical Services
(RMS) and Jordan University Hospital (JUH)
*  financial management systems for use in public hospitals
*  adopting in RMS hospitals and JUH modem approaches to pay hospitals such as case-mix
adjusted global budgets and various physician incentive arrangements (it was agreed that MOH
would not be included in this initial set of provider payment reforms due to the civil service
constraints which would hinder a hospital director's capacity to introduce fundamental change)
This component of the project will support the development of management tools (for example, financial
and accounting systems), equipment and training necessary to implement these systems.
Current Situation
The current pattern of development in financial management and control is relatively low level, with:
centralized control systems, little effective devolution of responsibilities and authority, very limited
financial skills, and lack of computerization. As a result facility managers do not have the responsibility,
authority, or necessary management tools to efficiently manage their facilities and respond to local
conditions.
Ministry of Health. The financial affairs of the MOH reflect a highly centralized management structure
with limited flexibility for control being exercised by individual hospitals. Key features of the current
position relating to finance are as follows:
Accounting Standards
* Accounting standards and control systems are set by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
* Expenditure is recorded on accruals based principles, but no formal system of capital
accounting is in place.
* Strict capital expenditure controls are in place, with tenders of an estimated value of over
100,000 JDs required to be placed by the Ministry of Works. This adds to the length of time
taken to award contacts and presents problems in effectively spending capital budgets within
the overall expenditure controls.
Financial Systems
* The MOH operates a centralized payroll system on a mini computer.
* All other main financial systems in operation are manually based, although there are plans to
move towards a computerized system for budgeting in the future.
* There is limited access to PCs at MOH level.
* All payments for goods and services are made centrally through a manual system.
* Income from patient charges is collected at all hospitals and health clinics (over 700
locations), involving a large number of staff in the collection and banking of cash. Controls



Annex 2
Page 6 ofll
require banking on a daily basis, or at a frequency that ensures no more than 150 JD is kept
in any location at any time.
Financial Management
*  The annual budget for the MOH is set by the MOF following submissions and discussions
with the MOH. Submissions within the MOH are prepared by Directorates and consolidated
into a total budget submission, reflecting the four main headings: administration, training,
primary care, and secondary care.
*  Although spending levels are only agreed with the MOF on a year by year basis, capital
planning provides assumptions for up to 5 years. This allows planning for larger capital
schemes, but the running costs of such developments cannot be assured until the budget
discussions of the year in which new facilities are to be opened.
*  Strict control of expenditure within budget headings is maintained by the MOF. No
flexibility is allowed to MOH to move funds between the main budget headings, although a
system is in place for such requests to be made to the MOF in exceptional circumstances.
* All budgeting is undertaken at MOH level, with budgets being allocated to the Directorates,
but not to individual service locations.
*  No information is currently provided to local managers on the actual costs of services or
budgets.
*  There is an acknowledged need to decentralize the budget process to allow more local
autonomy, but previous plans to undertake such an initiative have been discontinued.
* The level of financial management skills in local management needs to be improved through
appropriate training and development programs.
Royal Medical Services. The hallmark of financial systems within the RMS is the high degree of
centralization in existence. Key features of the current position relating to finance are as follows:
Accounting Standards
*  Income and Expenditure is recorded on a strict cash basis, with no formal adjustment for
accruals at the end of financial periods.
*  Capital expenditure is recorded in the year of expenditure, with no system of depreciation for
physical assets.
*  Accounting standards and financial instructions are set by the MOF, and enforced through an
"on-site" auditor within RMS who counter-signs all items prior to payment.
* Local procedure manuals set out the financial procedures to be followed by staff.
Financial Systems
*  A computerized payroll system is operated by the Armed Forces HQ for RMS staff, although
consideration is currently been given to introducing a separate payroll within RMS.
*  A computerized payment system designed within RMS and operated on a PC system is in
operation for the payment of Professional Fees at RMS HQ.
*  Consideration is being given to computerizing the main stores system.
*  All other accounting records are produced on a manual basis.
Financial Management
* The MOF allows the RMS to move funds between budget headings within the year.
* RMS operate a formal budget policy, with monthly reports being made to a Budget
Conmmittee headed by the Director of RMS.



Annex 2
Page 7 of 11
* No routine information is provided to hospital managers on the costs of services.
* There are a total of 25 staff within RMS Headquarters involved in financial management and
accounting issues. In addition, staff within administration at each hospital have
responsibility for the charges for patients attending hospitals other than King Hussein
Medical Center.
Jordan University Hospital. JUH operates as a separate part of the University with its own management
and control systems. From a financial viewpoint, the following are the key components of current
practice:
Accounting Standards
* Accounting records are maintained on a full accruals basis.
* Capital expenditure is recorded in the year of spending, and no system of depreciation or
capital accounting is in place.
* There does not appear to be a requirement for accounting records to be audited externally.
Financial Systems
- Currently all financial systems are manually recorded, although the hospital has recently
purchased a computerized accounting system which is expected to be operational by the
middle of 1997.
- The newly acquired financial systems have the capability to integrate with the patient based
systems already in operation within the hospital.
 The new financial systems will also have the ability to operate a form of capital accounting
including depreciation.
Financial Management
*  Detailed budgets are agreed annually by the JUH Budget Committee for all departments. No
shifting is allowed between budget headings without the approval of the committee.
- Financial management skills are not well established within departments.
T The Finance Department has a total of 50 staff, with 18 of these involved in the collection of
fees from patients.
Project Inputs
Developing the new financial system will involve: (i) establishing clear and consistent accounting
standards that would apply to MOH, RMS, and JUH facilities; (ii) setting up financial management
systems for use in public hospitals; and (iii) in RMS hospitals and JUH, adopting modern approaches to
pay hospitals such as case-mix adjusted global budgets and various physician incentive arrangements.
The goal would be to provide hospital managers and employees incentives to be efficient by linking
budgetary allocations to established criteria and giving managers the tools to be more responsive to
current or emerging demands. The project will finance the development of management tools (e.g.,
financial and accounting systems), equipment, and training necessary to implement these systems.
The specific project sub-components are as follows:
1. National Policies and Standards. Three aspects of reform in the national approach to the health sector
are required, which will be coordinated by the MOF:



Annex 2
Page 8 of 11
1.1. Longer Term Resource Assumptions. Enhancement of planning for services through better
forecasting of resources available in future years, through the provision of longer term (3 year)
resource assumptions by the MOF to MOH and RMS. The only resource requirements of this
sub-component is the time of staff within MOF, MOH and RMS.
1.2 . Accounting conventions and standards. Clearer and more consistent means of recording
financial information within the health sector are required to ensure that the real costs of
provision are known with precision, to allow comparison of costs within the public sector and
with private sector health care providers, and to permit the publication of financial information
on a consistent basis. This sub-component will finance technical assistance for the definition and
production of accounting standards for the health sector.
1.3. Financial Control Review. More effective use of resources within the health sector can be
achieved through the implementation of a program of local autonomy and flexibility within an
overall framework of accountability. At present there is limited flexibility for local management
action and a centralized control structure requiring central approval of detailed issues. This sub-
component will finance technical assistance to review the existing financial control procedures
and recommend a program of change for approval by the Minister of Finance.
2. Collaboration Across the Health Sector. Although there are clear differences between the services
provided by MOH, RMS and JTUH, there are major areas where there is benefit in working together to
define common needs and solutions. Two sub-components have been identified in this area.
2.1. Coding Structure Development. Development of a common approach to coding financial
information to ensure compatibility and ability to compare across MOH, RMS and JUH. This
development must be undertaken in conjunction with the coding structure for clinical and other
activity recording proposed under the Developing and Implementing Health Information Systems
Component to ensure ability to produce cost information for management purposes. This sub-
component will finance technical assistance from experts in developing and implementing coding
structures for health services to produce a coding booklet and guidance notes for finance staff in
MOH, RMS and JUH.
2.2. Training. Development of a modular program of financial skills training for key staff,
aimed at promoting a high level of financial skills within the management teams of hospitals in
MOH, RMS and JUH. This sub-component will finance technical assistance from international
experts in the development of financial management training material, supported by local
technical assistance to produce the training packages required.
3. Developing financial management capacity at RMS hospitals and JTUH
3.1. Financial Systems. Existing financial systems need to be reviewed to ensure their
functionality meets the needs for high quality financial information. If necessary, new or
upgraded financial systems will be implemented as a means of enabling enhanced control and
effectiveness in the use of resources. This sub-component will finance the procurement of
technical assistance to undertake the review and the procurement of any necessary computer
hardware and software, together with technical assistance to manage the project and training in
using the financial systems.
3.2. Budgeting. Introduction of global budgets with case-mix adjustments to ensure enhanced
control and effectiveness in the use of resources, linked to further developments in departmental
budgeting and a critical review of existing work in costing services. This sub-component will
finance technical assistance from recognized experts in case-mix budgeting, departmental



Annex 2
Page 9 of 11
budgeting and costing techniques for health services to work with public sector finance staff in
developing the appropriate budget tools and techniques.
3.3. Training. Delivery of the program of financial skills training for key staff promoting a high
level of financial skills within the management team of the hospital. This sub-component of the
project will finance the delivery of training using the packages developed under sub-component
2.2 to identified groups of managers.
3.4. Costing. Developing consistent cost data capable of supporting comparison between
hospitals to allow further gains in efficiency. This sub-component will be developed by finance
staff using the information provided by the new finance systems to publish appropriate cost data
and implement a program of efficiency studies. The only resource requirement for this sub-
component is the time of finance and management staff within RMS and JUH.
Project Component 4 - Total Cost: US$7.4 million
Reforming the Pharmaceutical Sector
Introduction
Pharmaceuticals account for over one-fourth of all health spending (two % of GDP). Such high
expenditures reflect inefficiency, waste, and improper use of drugs. To improve the quality and
efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector, a series of reforms would be undertaken: (i) promoting generic
substitution; (ii) implementing treatment protocols and training in the rational use of drugs; (iii) adopting
essential drug lists; (iv) improving overall sector management and pricing policies; and (iv) reforming the
processes for drug procurement, storage, distribution, and quality control.
Current Situation
Jordan's different health delivery systems are well supplied with pharmaceutical products of good
quality. 69% of all drugs are imported and the remaining 31 % are produced by 12 domestic drug
manufacturers. The cost of these supplies is considerable. In 1996 the total consumption in public prices
was, according to the Drug Directorate's annual statistics, JD 128 million or about JD 28 per person.
The real consumption per person may, however, be less. Some drugs sold in the private sector in Jordan
are in fact destined for neighboring countries. One estimate suggests that this could account for as much
as 20% of private sector drugs.
Drug bill. However, drug costs consume about 25% of MOH's'annual budget. The annual drug bill to
the nation keeps increasing (1995 over 1994: 30%, 1996 over 1995: 14%). Drug consumption is high
when compared with other countries at the same level of development.
Procurement/distribution. There are five different systems of procurement and distribution, each catering
for separate market segments or institutions, although there is some overlap between the segments. The
public sector is generally successful in obtaining low international prices, whereas prices for brand-name
drugs in the private retail sector are high. The pricing system is inflexible and discourages many
companies from keeping their drugs on the market. Fixed wholesale and retail mark-ups tend to favor
high-price brand-name drugs over the cheaper generic products and generic substitutions are not allowed
under the current pharmacy law, which dates from 1972. The market is gradually becoming a branded-
generic market. The public sector tenders for drugs by generic name and the domestic industry mostly
produces copy-products, using their own branded-generic names for both the public and private sectors
and for exports.



Annex 2
Page 10 of ll
Legal framework. Many problems in the pharmaceutical sector will be addressed by the successful
implementation of the recently drafted National Drug Policy and development of additional modem
national drug legislation. Essential drugs lists by level of care are in existence, but have not yet been
implemented. The absence of standard treatment protocols causes much polypharmacy and irrational use
of drugs. Lack of coordination among the country's different procurement, storage and management
systems and ineffective forecasting of drug requirements results in inefficiency, waste and improper use
of drugs.
Institutional arrangements. Finally, the Drug Directorate and Quality Control Laboratory are in need of
upgrading, reorganization and training to bring them up to international standards.
Reform of the pharmaceutical sector has the potential, over time, to reverse the trend in drug costs and
could well provide both substantial savings and improvements in quality of care.
Project Inputs
Financing would be provided for laboratory and computer equipment, studies, technical assistance,
workshops, and materials development (e.g., to support treatment protocols) to support the following five
sub-components:
*  Developing the legal framework - will include the following main activities: implementing the
National Drug Policy and other modem drug legislation, conducting policy studies (e.g., impact of
the use of generic drugs, prescription practices and patient compliance), and training.
-  Modemizing the Drug Directorate and Quality Control Lab - will include the following main
activities: constructing/equipping a suitable quality control laboratory, establishing a national drug
data center, training, upgrading equipment to support revised operating procedures and testing
routines, and updating the national drug formulary.
 Developing essential drug lists/treatment protocols - will include the following main activities:
testing the present essential drugs lists and development of a list of essential drugs for tertiary health
care; developing an enforcement program to ensure the use of the essential drugs lists; establishing a
scientific working group for the development of standard treatment protocols; printing, dissemination
and training (workshops) in the use of treatment protocols; developing a monitoring system for the
rational use of drugs; and training.
* Coordinating drug procurement and distribution - will include the following main activities:
establishing a joint procurement policy and guidelines for the public sector; testing a multi-year
procurement system with the domestic industry; and developing a unified system for receipt, storage,
distribution, and inventory control among the three public sector agencies.
* National Drug Information Center - the project will support the establishment of a National Drug
Information Center through the provision of computers, reference material, and staff training.

Continuing the Reform Process
Introduction
This project is addressing some, but not all, of the issues identified in the Health Sector Study. Sectoral
reform is not a static process; it is instead to be implemented incrementally in response to evolving needs
and demands.
Project Inputs
This component will support the continued preparation, evaluation, and monitoring of the sector reform
program. The Project Management Unit (PMU), in collaboration with the Steering Committee, will
commission studies and recruit technical expertise as needed to explore alternative reform proposals. In
addition, this component will support effective implementation of the project activities by supporting the
PMU and Project Implementation Units to carry out their project management and monitoring functions.

Annex 4
Jordan Health Sector Reform Project
Economic Analysis
Objectives of Health Care Reform in Jordan. The Jordan Health Sector Study posited five objectives for
health reform:
*   improving population health status
*   assuring equity and access
*   promoting macroeconomic and microeconomic efficiency
*   improving clinical effectiveness
*   assuring quality of care and consumer satisfaction
The study also evaluated the performance of Jordan's health system against these health reform objectives.
In summary the study indicated the following:
Health Status. Jordan's health outcomes as measured by such standard measures as infant mortality and
life expectancy are quite good for a lower-middle income country. Compared to other countries in the
region, holding income constant, Jordan performs better than would be expected based on the average
relationships found. Nevertheless, based on a burden of disease/cost-effectiveness study conducted for
Jordan, there is still a significant burden of disease from communicable diseases that can be treated cost-
effectively.
Equity and Access. Jordan is a small country with an impressive health infrastructure. Individuals in all
areas of the country have physical access to health facilities. The small size of the country and its network
of roads and transport makes it quite easy to refer rural populations to highly specialized tertiary care
facilities in the capital for needed care. Regarding financial access and equity of financing, an estimated
80% of the population is covered by public or private insurance. The poor are covered by the
Government's Civil Insurance program. Others without coverage can obtain care at Ministry of Health
(MOH) facilities and are charged nominal fees which are on the order of 10-15% of the true costs. While
equity in terms of the insurance premiums for beneficiaries of the Civil Insurance program and the health
insurance programn run by the Royal Medical Services (RMS) (for military personnel and their dependents)
could be improved somewhat through eliminating caps on salaries subject to premium payments, the fact
that the poor are covered and the MOH facilities in effect act as the safety net insurer of last resort for the
population means that financial access is not a major problem. One could argue that Jordan has universal
coverage since the MOH functions as the insurer of last resort providing a comprehensive set of benefits
for a 10-15% co-insurance.
Macroeconomic and Microeconomic Efficiency. Jordan's health system is economically inefficient. From
a macro perspective the country spends almost 8% of its GDP on health and, if historical spending trends
continue, the country will be spending over 12% in 2010. For its income, Jordan spends far more than
other countries, irrespective of whether spending is measured as a share of GDP or in per capita terms. At
the individual facility level, there are both significant consumption and production inefficiencies. There are
no effective referral systems. Consumers frequently seek care in hospitals because needed drugs and
specialists are not available at clinics. In the public sector, control is centralized, and there is little
coordination among the three major public financing and delivery systems. Facility managers don't have
the responsibility, authority, or management information to manage their facilities. Money does not follow

patients, and there are no incentives for efficiency. The private sector, which accounts for over 30% of
delivery capacity and over half of all spending, is largely unregulated. There is substantial excess capacity
as evidenced by a hospital occupancy rate of 63% (69% in the public sector and 49% in the private sector).
Despite this excess capacity, new public and private facilities are being built, resulting in further waste and
inefficiency. Pharnaceuticals account for 27% of all health spending, 2% of GDP, and from 1994-1996,
pharmaceutical spending increased by over 40%. Lack of a national drug policy, essential drug lists,
standard treatment protocols, and generic substitution lead to overspending on the order of 20-40%.
Clinical Effectiveness. Clinical effectiveness is difficult to measure. While overall the system performs
relatively well, there have been a number of surveys indicating serious quality problems, particularly in the
MOH facilities.1 Also, the large number of primary care visits in the private sector, coupled with the high
level of private spending, indicates serious dissatisfaction with the public sector, especially in the MOH. It
is generally the case that MOH physicians are not as well trained or experienced as those in the RMS,
Jordan University Hospital (JUH), or the private sector. There are also potentially serious misuses of
drugs, since there are no standard treatment protocols, and Jordan's physicians have been trained in many
different countries including many forner eastern bloc countries where both medical practice and
knowledge of modern pharmaceutical practices were quite limited.
Quality and Consumer Satisfaction. As previously discussed, there are quality problems in the MOH and
consumer satisfaction appears to be problematic as significant numbers of individuals seek and pay out-of-
pocket for care in the private sector for covered public sector services. There is no information about
quality in the private sector, where certainly amenities and technology are far more readily available. There
is some anecdotal evidence of unnecessary services being provided to enhance provider revenues.
Rationale for Project Components. The Government has decided to focus on improving the efficiency and
quality of public sector providers and improving efficiency and quality in the pharmaceutical sector. It
chose not to focus on basic public health programs or on universal access/equity issues. The rationale for
excluding these areas are as follows:
* Public Health. Other donors in Jordan (e.g., USAID, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) are heavily
involved in basic public health activities, particularly those dealing with maternal and child
health and population policies. Given Jordan's relatively good health outcomes and the efforts
of other donors, it was decided that this area is being adequately addressed. A more
problematic area is health promotion and disease prevention activities related to non-
communicable diseases and injures. The health transition common to most middle income
countries means that by the year 2020 some 80% of the disease burden will be due to non-
communicable diseases and injuries, compared to just over 50% today. It is generally not cost-
effective to treat these conditions. The cost-effective approach to non-communicable diseases
and injuries is to prevent them. The burden of disease/cost-effectiveness study performed as
part of the Jordan Health Sector Study provided convincing empirical justification. While
several of the project components will improve efficiency and quality in the diagnosis and
treatment of these conditions, the project does not emphasize prevention. However, the
manpower training sub-component of the Delivery System Rationalization component will
upgrade the training and capabilities of physicians. This should provide an important base for
furthering such activities.

Annex 4

Universal Access and Equity. As indicated above both physical and financial access do not
appear to be major problems. While equity, defined as basing use on need and contributions
on ability to pay, could be improved somewhat, coverage of the poor by the Government and
the MOH's role as insurer of last resort suggest that implementing a formal national prograrn
of universal coverage may not be a top priority. Substantial effort and empirical analyses were
undertaken in the Jordan Health Sector Study to model the costs of various universal coverage
proposals. While total health system costs would only increase by 3-5%/o, the potential for
increasing costs for the MOH's budget by 3040%, concerned the Government. It was also
agreed that this area requires a great deal more study. USAID is in the process of assisting the
Govermment in this area. More pertinent, however, was the view that one did not enhance
access in a fundamentally inefficient system as the net result would be very poor value for the
moneys spent.
The four components of the project focus on improving the effectiveness of public sector health
investments, enhancing the efficiency and quality of service delivery, and improving quality and efficiency
in the pharmaceutical sector. Three of the components--delivery system rationalization, implementing a
national health information system, and implementing management improvements and provider payment
reforms address the first two issues, while the pharmaceutical component will both improve quality in
terms of health outcomes as well improve the efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector. An economic
analysis of each component follows.
Rationalizing Jordan 's Health Delivery System. This component will fund the rehabilitation and
equipping of priority public sector (MOH, JUH, RMS) facilities as well as clinical training for MOH
personnel. Decisions on investments will be based on a facility masterplan which will be predicated on
underlying needs and existing public and private sector capacity. These investments will improve both the
quality and internal operating efficiency of public facilities based on efficiency-based structural facility
standards, underlying needs and existing private sector capacity. There are a number of cost impacts from
this component, some of which cannot be quantified. First, if the result of all this is an investment strategy
that achieves and maintains an 80% occupancy rate, then, as calculated in the Jordan Health Sector Study,
over the next 15 years US$130 million could be saved. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be achieved unless
private sector investments could also be subject to this 80% occupancy rate standard. While market forces
have begun to deter enthusiasm for investing in private sector hospitals (and the private sector is arguing
for the government to impose barriers to new entrants), there are no explicit policies or rules that would
enforce achievement of an 80% occupancy rate. Thus, while taking into account private sector capacity
should lead to more rational public investments and internal efficiency will be improved since rehabilitation
will be based on newly established facility norms and standards, it is not possible to quantify the resulting
budget savings, especially since efficiency gains may be re-invested to upgrade quality.
A second cost impact of these investments will be on recurrent costs. Over fourty million dollars in
rehabilitating and re-equipping facilities could generate new operating costs. Similarly, upgrading the
training of physicians could also result in increased costs. Given the general overstaffing and rigidly
controlled salaries of employees in the public sector, large increases in personnel costs, which are the major
portion of a hospitals costs, are not likely to occur. Additional recurrent costs from new equipment may
occur. On the other hand, such costs may be offset by improved internal operating efficiency from better
structural standards as well as more effective diagnosis of patient conditions which could lead to earlier
hospital discharges. Similarly, upgrading of clinical personnel could increase or decrease costs.



Annex 4
Page 4 of 5
A third effect could be increased costs in the public sector with significant reductions in private out-of-
pocket spending for private sector facilities as individuals use the improved public as opposed to the
previously higher quality private facilities. These effects cannot be quantified, but anecdotal evidence
suggests that individuals use private sector providers to diagnosis problems, but if the problem is expensive
to treat, return to public sector facilities for treatment.
Overall, this component will result in a more rational public investment strategy that takes account of
existing private sector capacity. It will improve the quality of the public delivery system, and should
reduce out-of-pocket payments for those who have public coverage but 'flee' to the private sector for
treatment. By explicitly focusing public decision-makers on better using private sector capacity, overall
systems efficiency should be improved and occupancy rates should increase since additional unneeded
capacity will be deterred. These potential benefits should more than offset any additional recurrent costs
generated by these new public investments.
Developing and Implementing Health lnformation Systems. This component will provide the Government
and individual facility managers with needed information both for national policy-making and facility
administration. While this will only be the first phase of a major effort, it will result in the design of a
system and the collection of data that not only provides information for national policy-making, but also
provides the MOH with more timely and complete data to carry out its administrative functions. While the
technical assistance and training sub-components of this component should help assure appropriate and
effective use of the new system, it will be further reinforced by the linkage of these systems to the Provider
Payment component.
Improving Hospital Financing and Management This component includes: establishing financial and
accounting standards for Jordan's health sector; and developing and implementing management information
systems and modern medical care provider payment systems in public sector facilities. This component
will improve the overall management of the health sector by improving financial accountability and more
accurately measure health spending. It will improve microeconomic efficiency by implementing modern
medical care provider payment methods such as case-mix adjusted global budgets, while at the same time
providing facility managers with the responsibility, authority, and information needed to effectively manage
their facilities. It will result in: decentralization of authority to facility managers and experimentation with
new incentive-based methods for paying hospitals and personnel whereby money follows patients.
While experience in western countries indicates that savings of about 10-30% can be achieved, given the
totally centrally controlled nature of the current systems and total lack of experience in this area, this
component should be regarded as experimental. Thus, there should not be great expectations about short-
run savings. On the other hand, when taken together with the delivery system rationalization and the
national information system, longer-term saving should be expected, especially as these provider systems
are modified over the course of the project. Given the lack of effective referral systems as well as the very
high hospital admissions rate (i.e., 11% of the population admitted to a hospital each year), there is great
potential for carefully designed provider payment systems to achieve substantial savings once experience
with these systems is gained.
Reforming the Pharmaceutical Sector. Pharmaceuticals account for 27% of all health spending and two
percent of GDP. Between 1994-1996 pharmaceutical expenditures increased by over 40%. The Jordan
Health Sector Study indicates that savings on the order of 20-40% could be achieved through a series of
policy interventions including: developing a national drug policy, treatment protocols for rational use of
drugs, generic substitution, essential drugs lists, reformed pricing policies, combining public drug



Annex 4
Page 5 of 5
procurement systems, better needs forecasting models, etc. While some investments will be needed to
improve the drug quality control lab and to provide the technical information and training needed to
implement the previously discussed policy interventions, substantial savings could be achieved.
In Jordan there is very limited use of generic drugs compared to 40% in the United States. Some 5,600
different drugs are registered, but only about 2,200 are actually on the market in Jordan, well in excess of
the about 250 that would appear on an essential drugs list. Prescribing patterns of physicians are often
excessive due to different training backgrounds and patients' demand for drugs as well as a lack of
appropriate treatment protocols. In JUH, the adaptation of treatment protocols for inumuno-supressent
drugs resulted in a 90% reduction in prescriptions. While adoption of some of these reform policies will
require difficult political decisions on the part of the Govermnent, serious efforts in this area could reduce
drug expenditures from its current level of 27% of all spending to the 10-15% figure common in OECD
countries. Moreover, generic substitution, more effective private sector procurement, and reformed
government drug pricing policies could result in substantial reductions in out-of-pocket spending by
consumers.
Summarv of Economic Analysis. Taken together these four components provide a logical set of activities
to improve public and pharmaceutical sector quality and efficiency. Improving public and phannaceutical
sector efficiency are necessary first steps in a longer-term broad-based reform effort. They will also
improve management and policy-making capacity at all levels of the system.
Incorporating private sector capacity in the Government's investment strategy would promote more
efficient use of combined public and private resources. The provider payment reforms lay the basis for
significant gains in efficiency and sustainability over the longer term. The phannaceutical reforms will
increase efficiency and quality and should result in significant short term savings. Given the rudimentary
state of knowledge and practice in many of these more modern health management/software type
innovations, large savings in the short run for every project component should not be expected. However,
this project will lay the basis for important systems efficiency improvements and far more effective health
system management. Addressing inefficiencies will correct for the diseconomies related to market failure
inherent in the health system. In addition, it is forcing coordination across the multiple public programs
that rarely interact as well as coordinating public sector investments with private sector capacity. Other
important aspects of the reform agenda that are not included in this project are generally being handled by
other donors and/or are being addressed by the Government as the next phase of Jordan's health reform
agenda.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
A.    Procurement Methods (Table A)
1.    Categories of expenditures and procurement methods anticipated for the components to be financed
by the Bank are summarized in Table A. The estimated procurement schedule is available in the
implementation volume.
2.    All Bank-financed civil works, equipment and materials would be procured in accordance with the
Bank Procuremnent Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 and as
revised in January and August 1996). Procurement of consultant services and technical assistance would
follow the World Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (January 1997 and revised in September 1997).
3.    Civil Works will be procured according to national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures which
are generally acceptable to the Bank, for contracts estimated to cost less than US$7.0 million, threshold
above which ICB would be required. Works contracts would be mostly rehabilitation of small value (from
US$100,000 to US$2,800,000), and would be scattered throughout the country. As demonstrated under
previous and ongoing loans, such contracts do not normally attract foreign firms. Therefore these contracts
will be procured under NCB procedures in order to expedite the process.
4.     Goods and equipment required for the project will consist of hospital and laboratory equipment,
computers, telecommunication and office equipment, vehicles and other small equipment. Contracts for
equipment and materials estimated to cost US$250,000 equivalent or more each will be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB), using the World Bank Standard Bidding Documents. Goods
estimated to cost US$250,000 or less and up to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million shall be procured
through NCB procedures. Contracts valued at US$100,000 or less and up to an aggregate amount of
US$2.0 million may be procured through International shopping. Contracts estimated to cost US$50,000
or less and up to an aggregate amount of US$700,000 may be procured through National Shopping.
5.    Consultant services and detailed engineering and construction supervision services will be contracted in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (January 1997 and revise in September 1997). These services include studies, technical assistance,
engineering designs, and construction supervision services for which proposals wiU be requested from three to six
short-listed firms/individuals.
6.     Training: Training services will follow the same guidelines as described in paragraph 5 above.
B.    Prior Review Threshold (Table B)
7.    All contracts for works exceeding US$0.7 million and contracts for goods and equipment
exceeding US$250,000 would be subject to prior review and approval by the World Bank. In addition, and
regardless of the value of the contract, the first two civil works contracts for each of the three
implementation agencies would also be subject to prior review and approval by the World Bank. For



Annex 6
Page 2 of 6
consultancy assignmnents financed by the World Bank, there would be prior review of conracts worth
US$100,000 and above for contracts with consulting firms and US$50,000 and above for contracts with
individual consultants. For training, the prior review would be for contracts worth US$50,000 and above.
Terms of Reference for all services to be provided would be subject to prior review by the Bank. This
would result in prior review of about 65 percent of Bank-financed procurement. The contract review
arrangements are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
C.    Allocation of Loan Proceeds (Table C)
8.    The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table C. It
was agreed that up to 10 percent of the loan amount (US$3.5 million) could be made available for
retroactive financing of approved activities eligible for expenditure.
D.    Use of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)
9.    Full documentation for expenditures under contracts requiring Bank's prior review will be
submitted with the corresponding application. Disbursements for contracts valued at less than US$700,000
for works, US$250,000 for goods, US$100,000 with consulting firms, US$50,000 with individual
consultants and US$50,000 for training services will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs). During negotiations, assurance was sought that documentation to support expenditures financed
under SOEs or otherwise will be maintained in English by the Project Implementation Units and made
available for review by Bank supervision missions. Furthermore, agreement to the preparation of annual
audit reports of all project accounts and statements of expenditure (SOEs) was also sought. Annual audit
reports are to be submitted in English within six months of the end of each fiscal year and be prepared by
auditors acceptable to the Bank.
E.    Special Account
10.   To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government will establish in the
Central Bank a Special Account (SA) to be managed by the Project Director (or his/her delegate) of the
Project Management Unit (PMU) under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Project
Director and the respective PIU manager would approve payment requests and signatory authority would
be vested with the Chair of the Steering Committee (or his delegate) and the Secretary General of the MOP.
The Bank would, upon request, make an Authorized Allocation of US$1.5 million. Initially, the SA
allocation would be limited to US$750,000 until disbursements had reached US$2.0 million at which time
the full Authorized Allocation could be claimed. Applications for the replenishment of the Special Account
would be submitted monthly or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been utilized, whichever occurs
earlier. The replenishment application would be supported by the necessary docunentation, bank statement
of the special account, and a reconciliation bank statement of the special account against Bank records.
The SA would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.

Government's request that the loan amount be reduced in response to the prevailing fiscal constraints. The
time taken to prepare the project, including the post-appraisal mission, was therefore 22 months (time from
first mission to post-appraisal).
