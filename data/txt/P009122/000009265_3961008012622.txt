MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN
FOR A COTTON SUB-SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for an amount equivalent to US$66.0 million to help finance
the implementation of the Government's programs to improve production in the cotton sub-sector and
facilitate its transition to the market economy. The Cotton Sub-Sector Improvement Loan will be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period.
About 47 percent of the proceeds of the loan will be on-lent to private seed companies and their
associated private seed farms for a maximum of 10 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at the
long term Dollar rate (US 10-year Bond rate) in effect at the time of the sub-loan (the base rate) plus a
margin of 3.0 percent per annum.
2.           Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD in September 1992, IFC in October 1993, and
MIGA in November 1993. The first Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 11683-UZ) was
distributed to the Board in September 1993 and an economic report on Subsidies and Transfers (Report
No. 11683-UZ) was distributed in June 1994.
BACKGROUND
3.           Agriculture accounts for over one third of the country's GDP, generates about three
quarters of the country's foreign exchange earnings, and employs about half of the labor force. Through
a complex pricing system for inputs and outputs, agriculture has been transferring about 50 percent of
the income it generated to the Government and urban sectors. The cotton sub-sector has accounted for
about 40 percent of the gross value of agricultural products. It has been the main source of income,
employment, and foreign exchange earnings. It has also generated about 80 percent of Government tax
revenues.
4.           Improved performance of the agricultural sector, in general, and the cotton sub-sector,
in particular, are two of the most important elements in stabilizing the economy of Uzbekistan and
accelerating its transition to the market economy. Although the sector has potential for higher efficiency
and growth, the overall agricultural production and distribution systems remain inefficient. Cotton
production has declined, yields remain relatively low, physical losses are high in terms of both quantity
and quality, input supply and output marketing systems are inefficient, prices are highly distorted, and
the resulting profitability is low and declining.
5.           The prospects for cotton production are largely dependent on the Government's ability
to enhance economic incentives, and reduce its direct control of, and intervention in the production, input
supply, and output marketing systems. Recent Government policies and associated decrees indicate an
intention to reverse past policies and practices. During 1994, the Government started to translate its
broad reform and stabilization objectives into a comprehensive set of economic policies. In November,
1994, an agreement was reached with the IMF on a program to be supported by the Systemic
Transformation Facility (STF) approved by the IMF Board on January 25, 1995. The World Bank
Rehabilitation Loan was approved by the Board in March, 1995. This loan is designed to assist



2
Government in advancing and implementing its economic reform agenda. Particular emphasis is placed
on privatization, and the deepening of the existing foreign exchange market to increase private sector
participation. If political consensus can be solidified and sustained around the reforms recently initiated
and those agreed under this project, the contribution of the cotton sub-sector to the economy could be
greatly enhanced.
6.            The Bank's medium-term  objective is to assist the Government in the structural
transformation of the Uzbek economy into a market-oriented economy. Given the importance of the agro-
industrial activities, the Bank's lending strategy for agriculture is central to achieving this objective.
Primary foci of the agricultural lending program are to accelerate the sector's adjustment process through
policy changes that are more supportive of private sector initiatives, and support investment projects that
enhance production capacity and improve sectoral efficiency. Another important element in the Bank's
strategy is support for the development of human resources and institutional capacities in agriculture
which are vital for the functioning of a market-based agricultural economy.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
7.           In support of the CAS, this project starts the process of modernizing the Uzbek Cotton
Sub-Sector by supporting selective critical interventions that would open it up to the world market and
build the basis for improving its efficiency.  It supports (i) the elimnination of state orders, the
liberalization of prices, and the privatization of the seed industry in the cotton sub-sector; (ii) the
development/introduction of technology to help avert the negative impact on the environment and on
productivity of past irrigation and pest control practices; and (iii) the enhancement of the cotton sub-
sector's foreign exchange earning capacity.
PROJECT DESCREMON
8.            To help achieve the above development objectives, the project supports the following five
components:
(a)    Seed Industry. This component supports the creation of a capacity in the private
sector to process and market about 25,000 tons of planting seed per year in
association with privatized seed farms. It will also support the strengthening of
seed quality control agencies and help introduce reliable policy and institutional
arrangements in the public sector for seed quality control, seed certification, and
continued development of new and improved cotton varieties;
(b)    Cotton Marketing. This component supports the introduction of cotton grading
technology to determine the characteristics of Uzbek cotton in conformity with
internationally recognized standards. It also supports the development of a
system for the dissemination (to potential buyers, the spinning industry, gin
operators, farmers, and researchers) of the information generated through the
grading system;
(c)    Integrated Pest Management. This is an applied research and development
component.  It supports the development of automated insect rearing and
dispersal technologies that will allow the country to economically broaden the



3
application of biological control of cotton pests. It also supports the development
of improved pesticide spraying equipment. This will allow the integration of
biological and chemical controls of pests with proper cropping practices to
mitigate the negative impact of pest control on the environment. A national
pesticide policy and a Farmers' Pesticide Handbook will be developed under this
component;
(d)   Irrigation. This component provides for equipment and training to support the
introduction of irrigation scheduling technology. These actions will demonstrate
effective ways to reduce water use in cotton production while improving land
productivity and avoiding water-based damage to the environment; and
(e)    Project Management and Program Design.  This component supports the
strengthening and development of institutional capacity in agencies involved in
this project to allow them to implement their respective components and
contribute to the design of future investment programs in agriculture. It also
supports specific preparation activities for investment programs for which
Government intends to seek external financial support.
9.           Total project cost is estimated at US$84.6 million, of which US$62.1 is in foreign
exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$66.0 million will finance 100 percent of foreign exchange cost
and 17 percent of local cost. The Government and the participating private seed companies will finance
83 percent of local costs, including import duties and taxes. About 47 percent of Bank funds will be on-
lent to participating private seed companies and their associated seed farms. These sub-loans will have
a maturity period of 10 years, including a three-year grace period, at an interest rate equal to the long
term Dollar rate (US 10-year Bond rate) plus a margin of 3 percent. Summary of project cost estimates
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
10.          GOSKOMPROGNOZSTAT will be responsible for coordinating project implementation
through a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Actual implementation of public sector components and
sub-components will be the responsibility of Component Implementation Units (CIU) which are part of
the departments serving as executing agencies. The Seed Certification and Seed Law Agency will be
reconstituted and strengthened to allow it to perform its functions independently of any vested interests.
The cotton quality control agency - SIFAT- will also be strengthened with the intention of making it
managerially and financially autonomous to allow it to do its job impartially. The Crop Protection
Institute - UZNIIZR - will implement the integrated pest management program, and the Information
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture - UZAGROINFORM - will implement the irrigation
component. The implementation capacity of these agencies will be strengthened through training and
technical assistance. Responsibility for implementation of the private sector part of the project will rest
with the management of individual seed companies and seed farms. Sub-loans will be appraised by a
Credit Committee constituted in the Finance Department of the PIU. Procurement of goods and technical
assistance will be implemented in accordance with relevant Bank Guidelines. The Bank will review, ex-
ante, procurement procedures, consultant terms of reference, procurement budgets and bidding



4
documentation, as required. Procurement planning for the private sector will be reviewed at the time
business plans and credit applications are submitted for Bank clearance.
PROJECT SUSTAINABILrY
11.          The sustainability of the project depends on: (a) availability of counterpart funds; (b)
implementation capacity of executing agencies; and (c) sustained Government commitment to the
institutional and market reforms underlying project activities. Project design addresses these three
concerns. Government agreed to make counterpart funds available in a timely manner through the budget
process. The project is designed to remove the resource and skill constraints in the public sector, thereby
providing the basis for sustainability of the public sector part beyond the project period. With regard to
the private sector part of the project, analysis undertaken during project design indicates that activities
to be initiated by the private sector will be commercially viable and sustainable beyond the project period.
With regard to market reforms, Government actions clearly indicate a long terni commitment to
advancing and implementing the economic reform agenda.
12.          The project will introduce the concept of "fee for service" for seed certification, cotton
grading, and irrigation. By June 30, 1998, the Government will prepare plans for discussion with the
Bank specifying methodologies and timetables for recovering the cost of seed certification and cotton
grading services. A similar plan for recovery of the cost of irrigation will be prepared and discussed by
June 30, 1997.
LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE
13.          The Cotton Sub-Sector Improvement Project is the first World Bank supported investment
project in Uzbekistan. Given the evolving nature of the legal, political, and economic environments, the
project may face serious problems despite the fact that relevant lessons from past Bank experience have
been reflected in project design in order to improve its chances for satisfactory performance.
14.          Bank experience with seed projects indicates that (i) while the private sector has a
comparative advantage in seed processing and marketing, the public sector should retain responsibility
for seed testing and certification performed by an autonomous agency, (ii) market-based pricing of seed
is essential for the sustainability of the seed industry, and (iii) a favorable legal and policy framework
is essential for attracting long term investments in the seed industry. The experience with irrigation and
pest control indicates that (i) economic objectives of such interventions, even when fully achieved, cannot
be sustained if they are detrimental to the environment, (ii) investments in irrigation and the selection of
a package of interventions for pest control have to be justified on the basis of empirical economic results,
and (iii) farmer support services enhance the profitability of interventions in cultivation, irrigation and
pest control. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of the project tbrough the selection of
inputs, a package of policy and institutional reforms, and individual component interventions.
RATIONALE FOR BANK PARTICIPATION
15.          The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed at the
Board in March 28, 1995. The CAS recognizes the importance of the cotton sub-sector and the need to
preserve and enhance its productivity. Its positive contribution to the economy is a critical factor in the
transition to a market economy. The Government, working with the Bank in the context of the



5
Rehabilitation Loan and with the IMF in the context of the STF, has introduced important reform
measures to accelerate this transition. This project will provide the framework for putting reforms to
work on a sustained basis, thus giving them the chance to have a lasting impact. The project will also
build on the reform measures already adopted and deepen their penetration at all levels of the sub-sector.
It supports the removal of critical institutional constraints which currently impede private sector initiative
and participation in the cotton industry. The project will provide an added medium for maintaining the
policy dialogue and enhance prospects for continuing the policy reform process.
AGREED AcrlONS
16.          The Government confirmed during negotiations that: (i) The State Order system for cotton
will be eliminated before the 1998 crop season; (ii) Privatized seed farms will be exempt from any
obligations under the State Order system; (iii) Sub-loans under the line of credit will be denominated in
US$ and disbursed in US$ or Sum as requested by sub-borrowers; and (iv) It is the intention of the
Governrment to amend the Statute of SIFAT, and the Seed Certification and Seed Law Agency to allow
them to become managerially autonomous and ultimately financially self-reliant. Drafts of the Seed
Policy and the Seed Law were submitted and reviewed by the Bank and agreement was reached that a
revised version will be submitted for Bank review prior to approval by Parliament.
17.          Assurances were given by the Government that: (i) plans for cost recovery will be
prepared by the Seed Certification and Seed Law Agency and SIFAT and submitted to the Bank for
discussion no later than June 30, 1998; (ii) the PIU will prepare and submit for Bank review and
approval proposals for feasibility studies to be funded under the program design component of the project;
(iii) adequate counterpart funds for the public sector components and sub-components will be included
in the approved annual budgets of their respective implementing agencies in conformity with provisions
under the project and will be made available to them at the beginning of each budget year; (iv) a line item
will be introduced in the national budget for the project and the use of all allocations under that line item
will be restricted to project activities; (v) sub-loans will be approved on the basis of eligibility criteria
and terms of sub-loans agreed between Government and the Bank, (vi) responsibility for Credit Line
Administration will be transferred to a suitable banking institution as soon as one becomes ready; (vii)
UZAGROINFORM will, no later than June 30, 1997, prepare and submit for Bank review a plan for the
recovery of the cost of irrigation water; (viii) the PIU will operate on the basis of agreed detailed
organizational structure, functions, staffing plans, procedures, and scope of authority agreed with the
Bank; and (ix) work plans and associated budgets will be prepared and submitted for Bank review before
the beginning of each project year.
18.          Loan effectiveness will be conditional upon: (i) a project account being opened in the
name of the PIU with an initial deposit of US$0.5 million equivalent; (ii) appointment of Deputy
Directors for the PlU and finalization of arrangements for the engagement of a firm/organization to
supply international staff to PIU; (iii) CIUs' managers appointed; and (iv) submission by PIU for review
by the Bank of a work plan and budget for the first project year.
19.          Disbursement against the public sector part of the Seed component will be conditional
upon adoption by Government of the agreed Seed policy and the enactment of the agreed Seed Law.
Disbursement against the private sector part of the seed component will be conditional upon agreement
between the Bank and the Government on an agency bank to service the sub-loans.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
20.           The project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment. The move toward
private sector control of cotton farming is expected to foster more prudent use of water, land and
chemical inputs. The use of pesticides will be reduced and integrated with biological control of cotton
pests. The use of chemical fertilizers will be reduced as a result of more effective irrigation. The rate
of water application will be reduced with beneficial impact on the quality of the soil and the quality of
water leaving the system through drainage. The project has a "B" environmental assessment category.
PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES
21.           The principal program  objectives are private sector development and economic
management. The project supports the transition of the cotton sub-sector to the market economy. In
particular, it helps create the enabling conditions for: (i) market-based, private sector led production,
processing and marketing systems; (ii) improved management and performance of the Seed Certification
and Seed Law Agency, the Cotton Quality Control Agency, the Institute of Crop Protection, and the
Information Division of the Ministry of Agriculture; and (iii) development of a policy, along with legal
and institutional frameworks, for accelerating the formulation and implementation of economic reforms.
PROJECT BENEFITS
22.           The project is expected to have substantial direct and indirect financial and economic
benefits for private enterprises, farmers, and the nation. These benefits include enhanced incentives in
the private sector, increased production and improved quality of cotton, increased farm income, increased
foreign exchange earnings and a better environment. By supporting an acceleration of the pace of
reforms, the project will help lead to more efficient cotton production and marketing driven by market
forces and controlled by the private sector. The marketing component will result in higher foreign
exchange earnings through greater gin turnout and better quality fiber. The seed component will help
improve yields, promote fiber quality and uniformity, and reduce sowing rates. The irrigation scheduling
component will help improve yields, reduce water use, reduce fertilizer use, and reduce environmental
pollution. Integrated pest management will reduce crop losses, reduce foreign exchange expenditures on
pesticides, and reduce environmental pollution. The project will also help develop the country's capacity
to design and implement potential future agricultural projects to be financed by the World Bank and other
international financing agencies. The overall economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 34
percent. Economic rates of return for individual components are estimated at 33 percent for seed
companies, 35 percent for seed farms, 35 percent for marketing and 30 percent for irrigation.
RISKS
23.           The project does not face any significant risk associated with the technology and practices
being introduced. It finances internationally well known and tested seed processing, cotton grading, and
irrigation scheduling technologies. The main risk facing the project relates to the country's capacity to
implement it in an effective and timely manner.  Factors that could cause problems in project
implementation include: the possible delay in Government decision making on liberalizing the cotton
market, limited interest by the private sector in creating seed companies, lack of counterpart funds, and
lack of personnel with the skills needed under the project. The maintenance of a free market for the sale
of cotton seed and lint is critical for the commercial viability of participating private seed companies and



7
seed farms. This is also critical for cotton farmers at large since the profitability of seed companies will
depend on the level of demand for higher priced quality seeds. Availability of counterpart funds and
trained personnel will determine the availability and quality of public services in support of project
objectives. The project introduces the necessary measures to minimize these risks in the form of legal
covenants, provision for training and technical assistance, and provision for close monitoring and regular
review of project activities. The establishment of a strong Project Implementation Unit with appropriate
support for project management, procurement and accounting is expected to help mitigate project risks.
In addition, the project will be intensively supervised (including a Project Launch Workshop, reviews of
annual work programs and a comprehensive mid-term review) in order for timely action to be taken to
overcome implementation problems.
RECOMMENDATION
24.           I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
