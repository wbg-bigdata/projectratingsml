struction of the 48 MW Itutinga hydroelectric project. Cemig's operations
are well managed and from past experience Cemig would be capable of satis-
factorily supervising construction of the project.
iv.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be used mainly to finance
the foreign currency costs of the civ:Ll works contract and the purchase of
equipment for the project which would be supplied partly by foreign and partly
by local suppliers, Awards would be made after international competitive
bidding with participation by qualified domestic suppliers who would be
granted a ]5 percent preference.   Satisfactory arrangements have been made
to provide the balamce of funds required to finance Cemig's program.
v.        lTariffs were increased substantially early in 1965 following new
decrees issued late in 1964 and which allowed for the first time the periodic
revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes. However, due to certain
shortcomings of the regulations and a3lso the high level of electrification
taxes on consumers, utilities have not been able to achieve fully the per-
mitted rate of return on the true value of their assets.   The establishment
of consistent and effective tariff policies and the changes in the level, of
electrification taxes are important questions which will be taken up with
the Federal Goverrnment without delay in the context of the power sector as a
whole, rather than in connection with this particular project.   Separate
provisional agreements covering this i)ro1iect have been obtained to cover
these shortcomings.,
vi.       l'he project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$49 million
equivalent for a term of 25 vears including a grace period of five and one-
half years,

THE JAGUARA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (Cemig), a power utility
owned principally by the State of Minas Gerais, has applied to the Bank for
a loan of US$49 miullion equivalent, :Lncluding US$6.8 million for interest
during construction, to help finance the Jaguara hydroelectric project.   The
total cost is estimated at US$90 mil-lion equivalent, including interest during
construction.  The project would be situated on the Rio Grande 370 kan west
of Belo Horizonte, the State capital and the princiral load center of Cemig,
and would consist of a rockfill type dam and a powerhouse with an installed
capacity of hOO MNW with one transmission line direct to Belo Horizonte and
another connectingr with the existing transmission system serving Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro.
2.        The Bank made a l nan ton tcenig (No 70-FR) of T5.qt7.A millinn in 1951
to assist in the construction of the 48 MW Itutinga hydroelectric project.
Since 1953 rpmng has finnnred its xpan.sion prograi withonh wink a   st.nnce.
The Jaguara project is of high priority in an integrated program of power
expann.rion forY- +the se+th>en-ral region of Brazil,  This program was prepared
under a United Nations Special Fund grant for which the Bank is the executing

of Messrs. Ralph I,. Bloor and John Bruen, which visited Brazil in September-
Octob'er 31"6i'5
II. THE BORROWER
4.        Cemig was organized in 1952 for the purpose of formulating and ex-
pedditlng a public power expansion program for the State.  IT is at presenlt
serving nearly all of the principal towns and industries in the State cmd the
rem-na-inder will be soon connected to its system.  It has been granted a federal
license to build the Jaguara hydroelectric project as a part of its con-
tiuI ing expansion program.
5.        Total share capital, composed of common and preferrea shares, as
of July 31, 1965 was Cr$70 billion (US$38 million). In addition to the
principal State onership of 65.6 percent, shares are owned as follows::
15.5 percent by Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), a Federal
Government-owned limited liability company charged with carrying out a
national electrification plan; and the remaining 18.9 percent by some 35,000
shareholders including municipalities, industrial consumers, insurance
companies, banks, and individuals.
6.        Cemig operates under a Board of Directors consisting of seven
members including bankers, lawyers, and other prominent citizens of thfe State
who determine general management policies and approve budgets and majo:r con-
tracts. There is also an executive group consisting of a President and five



members with extensive utility experience who carry out the decisions of the
Board of Directors and manage the company in accord with the laws of the
State. One of this group is in charge of an Engineering and Construction
Department with 185 employees including d5 engineers; another is in charge
of generation with 610 employees; and a third is in charge of distribution
with 640 employees. The company regularly employs foreign consultants to
improve its practices and to assist in carrying out its expansion progrnms.
With these, it is fully capable of constructing and operating the proposed
project.
7.        Cemig owns and operates 12 hydro and five diesel generating plants
with a total capacity of 528 MW (see Annex 1 for details); and a transmission
system composed of lines totalling 3 600 km in length and operating at voltage
levels of 275, 138, 69 and 34.5-kv. The Cemig system is interconnected at
138-kv with the Peixoto hydroelectric plant on the Rio Grande owned by
Eletrobras and a 345-kv interconnection between the city of Belo Horizonte
and the Furnas systems is now complete, although not yet operating.  Cemig
also owns and operates distributing systems in 157 localities serving some
146,000 customers.
8.        Cemhi has rights to q0 nercent of thp outnut of thp Furnas 900 MW
hydroelectric project on the Rio Grande owned by Central Eletrica de Furnas
S.A. (Furnas). a subsidiary of FP1 trobras. Cemiv has had no need to exercise
this right up to the present time, but it is now negotiating with FurnaS for
a sale Pq ot-ntrant norvring its estiated needs for purc-hased power for the
three-year period 1L966-1968. It is expected that the terms of the contract
i.rill be ae   UpOl h March, 1966.~A * The s- gngof this c        eonta n 1g
provisions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness
for the proposed loan.
III. POWER MARKET AND POWER SUPPLY
9.        Cemig's rnarket area is the State of Minas Gerais, measuring roughly

annually, and about 80 percent of its output is used in industry. The rate
of gro"wh r-opped to abo-u 12 percent in 1964 . due to sluggish buusirness con-
ditions in Brazil. In that year Cemig sold 1,885 million kwh with a maximum
dermand of 359 Mw. (See arinex 2 for iurt]ner detaiis.)
0.V       Tle market for electric power iLn soutr-central Brazil kwhich-i Uincludes
principally the southern half of Minas Gerais and the States of Sao Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro and Guanabara) has been under intensive study over the past
two years by Canambra, a consortium of three Canadian and United States engin-
eering finns. Tne study is financed in part by the united Nations SpeciLal Fund
and the Bank has served as executing agency. The market study has been com-
pleted and Cemig has used the results as a partial basis for a forecast of
sales over the next ten years. Since Cemig has a regular program of expanding
the territory it serves outside the area studied by Canambra, provision has
also been made in the forecast for these added loads.  Predicted sales for
the next ten years are as follows:

1969                                         3896
1970                                         4497
1971                                         5163
1972                                          5900
1973                                         6717
1974                                         7622
The forecast is reasonable assuming an upturn in business conditions in Brazil.
There have recently been some signs of this.
11.       Cemig has always purchased small amounts of power to supplement its
own generation0  The largest amount was 39 million kwh in 1964. Beginning in
1968 it w:ill have to make substantial purchases from Furnas rising to about
1400 million kwh in 1970 before the Jaguara project comes into operation.
Jaguara would be able to meet the load growth for about one year and there-
after purchases of nower would rise again to 2h00 million kwh in 197L, which
wou].d be available from the Furnas and Estreito projects of the F_rnas company.
Cemig wouLd exnect to cnmplete the nnnst¶Iloinn nf additional genemntirip
plants in 1975.
12.       As Cemig purchases larger and larger amounts of power and cornstr-ucts
gepnerating plants which will be further from. its market area, it will be
increasingly important for the south-central transmission grid to which lt
i9 connected to be operated as an integrated sytem to provide reliable
electric energy at; the lowest possibLe costs. A recent decree has given

with a view to assuring a well coordinated system by 1970.
Expansion Program
13.       Cemig's plan for expansion over the next nine years closely follows
the recox4r,endations of the Cana.bra group which has worked out a px u   -um of
additional generation and primary transmission to 1975 for the entire south-
central region. IThe generating project of highest priority in the Caniaumbra
program is the Estreito hydroelectric project, now under construction by
Fu-rnas and the Jaguara project has the second highest priority.   The C'emig
program also includes the installation of two 65 MW (Nos. 5 & 6) units in the
existing Tres Marias plant and the construction of additional plants ort the
Rio Grande below Jaguara. The total estimated cost of these facilities, in-
cluding Jaguara, over the next nine years is US$171 million.   Cemig estimates
that 5,00( km of high voltage transmission lines to carry the increasedc
amounts ofi energy and to reach new areas of the State will also be requLired
at an estimated cost of US$63 million. Distribution systems to serve 500,000
new consumers and 300 new towns are planned at an estimated cost of US$72
million. Cemig haLs also embarked on a rural electrification program orn which
it expects to spend US$14 million.  The total cost of the nine-year program
is therefore US$320 million.  The program is reasonable.



IV. THE PROJECT             L
14.       The Jagaara project will be situated on the Rio Grande, 370 km west
of Belo Horizonte, where the river forms the boundary between tne States of
Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo (see Map). The project will be the fourth in a
cascade development of the river which includes the existing Furnas project,
the existing Peixoto plant of Eletrobras and the Estreito project now under
construction. A1L of the plants are greatly benefited by the large flow regu-
lating reservoir iat Furnas, the upstream project.
15.       The Jagaara project would consist,of a rockfill dam 325 m. long and
40 m. high with a volume of about 800,000 m), a concrete intake structure and
powerhouse, a concrete spillway structure with tainter gates, and transmission
facilities to Belo Horizonte and the Estreito project.
16.       The powerhouse would be designed to contain six units of which four
would be installe,d initially. The units would have a capacity of 100 11W each
with Francis type turbines to operate under a head of 45 meters. The amnual
energy output of the Project has been calculated at 2.4 billion kwh under
conditions corresponding to the driest period of record. Transmission
facilities will o]perate at 345-kv.  The transmission line to Belo Horizonte
will be 3,65 km long. At that point, a 450 MVA substation, designed for opera-
tion at voltages of 345/138 and 13.8-kv, will be built.   The transmissiLon
line to Estreito will be 25 km long and a section bay will be installed at
the Estreito substation to form an interconnection with the Estreito trans-
mission system which serves Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and environs.
17.       The preLiminary planning of the project was done by Canambra. After
its high priorit-y had been established by this work, CeGi rig employed Electro-
watt of Switzerland, working in conjunction with two Brazilian firms, -o carry

cv..pleted a7nd it s,hould be possilble to have a contracitor begin work in Apri;
1966. Completion of the project could then be accomplished in early 1971.
19.       The estimated cost of the project including interest during con-
struction on the Bank loar, is US$90 million equivalent.  The followirng break-
down between local and foreign costs is based on the expected outcome of
international bidding with Brazilian suppliers participating.

(b)  construction equipment;  and
(c)  other direct or indirect foreign exchange components of the
cost of the main civil works contract (except as otherwise
provided in paragraph 28).
23.       Local firms would compete for many of the contracts covering per-
manent materials and equipment and the proposed loan funds would be available
for payments to them, The amount of the loan which would be required for
payments to local firms cannot be determined with accuracy, since it depends
on the outcome of international competitive bidding, but from previous exper-
ience, it is presently estimated at about US$6 million for materials aund
equipment.
24.       The Government and the Ban.k have agreed on procurement procedures
which are quoted in part as follows:
"The Borrower intends to invite firms producing goods in Brazil to
participate in the international competitive bidding. In the case of
goods produced in Brazil, the Blorrower may award the order to the lowest
Brazilian bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions; provided
that his offered price does not, exceed the offered price of the lowest
acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15%. Comparison of bids will
be made for goods delivered at Project site and without taking into
account customs duties. For firms in Brazil, the delivery at the site
price will comprise the F.O.B. plant cost plus freight, insurance and
other costs to the Project site. For non-Brazilian firms, the delivery
price will be based on the C,I.Fo landed cost, port of entry, before
customs duties, plus inland freight, insurance and other costs to the
Project site. As the 15% preference allowed firms in Brazil is in
lieu of customs duties, the 15 will be added to the C.I.F. landed cost
(excluding customs duties) of the non-Brazilian goods, before inland
freieht. insurance and nther cos5ts. Tn the case of bids comnosed of
both Cruzeiros and foreign currency the cruzeiro portion thereof will
be dLealt with as a Prnzili n hid andi the foreign Pxchange portion as a
non-Brazilian bid.

"For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be converted
into cruzeiros at the Bid Comparison - Rate OI Exc'nange. The Bid Comn-
parison Rate of Exchange is understood to be the commercial bank
dollar selling rate plus the exchange surtax (but not to exceed 30/0)
if any, prevailing at the date on which bids are closed.   It is further
understood that the Bank will, at the request of the Guarantor or the
Borrower, reconsider and, if necessary, revise the basis for compu-ting
the Bid Comparison Rate of Exchange, whenever there should be a sub-
stantial change in the Brazilian exchange system which would, in the
judgment of the Bank, render such rate unsuitable for bid comparison
purposes.
"The Borrower will, in the case of civil works contracts, require
foreign bidders to associate themselves with an experienced local firm.
For bid comparison purposes the foreign component of such bids will
be converted to cruzeiros at the rate of exchange mentioned above, but
it is understood that the 15% preference will not be allowed.
"The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary ia
order to facilitate the importation by the Borrower free from all 'Legal
and administrative limitations cr restrictions of goods purchased
outside Brazil in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement..."
In a recent action, the Government has eliminated the exchange surtax and has
established a new Banco do Brasil buying rate of Cr$2220 = US$1 (to becoTme
a new Cr$2.22 during 1966), which has caused the commercial bank dollar
selling rate to be set at annroximatrLv the same level.   At the present time.
therefore, local and foreign bids would be compared as described in detail
above using a bid comparison rntp of exrhange of approximatePy Crt22220
US$1 and allowing a 15 percent preference for local bidders.
25.       Imports into Brazil are habitually accompanied by time-consuming
inveRti gaions ineo +-he need for and the legality of the import. As a public
utility, Cemig has certain privileges as regards imports and furthermore has
acqUiri considerahle skhll in expedi.ting the procureme-nt of import licen+e
As a result, it has become normal for Cemig and other public utilities to

improved if contractors could freely move construction equipment into and
so desired without excessive delays. The Government acknowledges that there
maay be aduVatages r,o doing so. However, it nas pointed out that thie ieicsar-y
changes in import regulations would affect many Government departments and
their effect on many related Government policies and Brazilian industry would
have to be given careful study before the Government could commit itself to
the necessary changes. it has agreed to commence the necessary studies so

beneficial in connection with future Bank loans (exclusive of Estreito II
and distribution loans now under consideration).   In the meantime, the Govern-
ment has requested that the Bank continue to accept the procurement methods
wnich it has accepted in connection with several previous loans.
27.       These procurement methods will provide international competition
on a very large percentage of the goods and services to be covered by the
proposed loan, and the Government's request for time to study the impact on
its economy of the proposed changes in its import regulations is considered
reasonable.
28.       The Bank has accepted the requirement of Cemig that a foreign bidder
for the civil works contract must associate himself with an experienced local
construction contractor since experience has shown that a foreign contractor,
not already established in Brazil, would be likely to encounter difficulties
under the  ecuia, Brazilian economic conditions.    It is intended to compare
local bids for te civil works contract with combination local and foreign
bids by ccnverting the cruzeiro portion of such bids at the bid comparison
rate of exchange mentioned above, but; to allow no preference for local bidders.
Combination foreign and local bidders for the civil works contract are likely
to have larger foreign currency requirements in their bids than local bidders
since in the former case foreign currency may be required to cover a portion
of the profit and services and a foreign bidder may require more equipment
to be purchased by Cemig since he carmot bring his own equipment into the
country.  Because all bids may not be on the same basis, the value of con-
struction equipment to be provided by Cemig to the contractor will be taken
into account in the bid comnarisons.   The estimated foreign currency rEquire-
ment for the civil works contract an(i for construction equipment, amounting
to US$7.5 million. as shown in Annrx 3, is based on an assumed combination
foreign and local contractor. If the contract is awarded to a local ccntractor
with foreign currrncy rev   rman+.q lie9q +han -+hPes estnmates, it. is proposed
that any balance which cannot be disbursed against direct or indirect foreign
currency requiremr-nts woild be mnde availahble for disbursement against local
costs of the contract.

30e       Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Waters Division every three years to yield revenues which cover
(a) operating costs; (b) straight-line depreciation of revalued gross p:Lant
in service at annual rates prescribed by the Wlaters Division, up to 8 percent
for thermal plants and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including
hydro plants; (c) amortization of the total investment of the concession of
up to 5 percent; and (d) a cumulative, return of 10 percent on the revalued
remunerable investment.   Remunerable investment is defined as gross plant in
service (excluding assets acquired through contributions in aid of construc-
tion) less depreciation and amortization reserves plus an allowance for work-
ing capital consisting of operating inventories, the equivalent of two months
billing, and cash excluding cash balances of contributions in aid of con-
struction, reversion or amortization funds. Any shortfall in achieving the
cumulative return of 10 percent in the three-year period may be recovered in
the subsequent three-year period. However, the law permits recovery of short-
falls in a given year by a tariff adjustment over the succeeding twelve month
periodo
31.       Automatic adJustments of tariffs to allow for inflation in the form
of surcharges on the original three-year tariff are permitted (a) month:ly,
for comDulsorv increases in wages, social benefits, cost of fuel and purchased
power and (b) semi-annually, for increases in foreign debt service due lo
chanees in the foreign exchange rate.

of the "sQLe" tax which was created in 1954 are allocated among the Federal,
State, and Mfunicipa authorities. TXhis x has been s-ubsequently increased
due to infLation and is presently based on a percentage of an average monthly
rate per 'v' estab:.Lihed by the National Council of water and Electric Enlergy.
There is also a second tax originally intended as a "compulsory" loan, wihich
was placed in effect beginning November 1962 and wnich is to terminate Ln
1968. The proceeds of this tax go to Eletrobras, which is supposed to issue
to the consumers for the amount of the "compulsory tax" paid, deot cert:Lficates,
redeemable in 10 yfears at an interest of 12 percent. However, arrangements

are far from completed f'or the consumer to obtain such certificates. The rate
of this tanX is the sare as the sole tax and the proceeds can also hb distri-
buted to the States by Eletrobras in the form of loans or share capital.
Th.e combination of these taxes amouznts to between 4O percent and IJ5 Percent
of the consumer's t;otal electric bill, in the case of Cemig.
3l.       The implementation of the revaluation provisions has not been
entire.ly satisfacto,ry Uduring the1~- :L nit:i a 1 year du e t o t. 1ae under s tand-able
complexities involved with the transition, but also to serious shortcomings
cf the ntew ragulations . hevaluation is only- perm issive aiiu thie corresponc.g
tariff adjuastments are, in most cases, obtained with delay. A suitable
procedure has been lackidn  lfor comparing at year-end the actual and perrmitted
i'eturns on the investment, and the three-year basis used for determining
tariffs and recovering past shortfalls in earnings, has been inadequate.
Exces,sive charges are still permitted for depreciation and also for reversion
(or amortization), a reserve which in ef'ect duplicates the depreciatiorn
reserve; and the high level at which both charges are maintained constitutes
an expedient against inflation which in effect duplicates the principle of
revaluation.  In a number of cases the present high electrification taxes have
also hanpered the achievement of the maximum rates of return permitted under
the present rate legislation.
35.       One consequence of the present tariff regulations is that a utility
would not normally be able to achieve fully and currently the permitted return
on the up t;o date vralue of its assets, as long as the rresent inflationary
conditions persist.   Serious consequences may also resul-t from the permissive
character of the re!valuation principle, and the consequent arount of' discretion
left to the aviaters Division and the utilities in agreeing on tarif'fs on
undervalued assets. In 1965 a whole range of tariff policies were used by
utilities; while Pu.rnas and Uselpa, bound by recent agreements with the Bank,
were able to obtain tariffs reflecting, revaluation of assets through 1964,
most utilities, including Cemig, applied tarif'fs reflecting revaluation through
1963. As the rate of inf'lation in 196h was 74 percent, Cemig's assets as
revalued were increased to only about half of their true value.    Depreciation
charges at 5 percent straightline were permitted for all utilities, regardless
of the respective useful lives of their assets; and while Cemig was allowed
to provide for 5 percent amortization, most utilities charged 3 percent. This
latter question takes on considerable importance if it is realized that under
present cornditions the amortization charge is deducted from the asset valuation
as though it were depreciation.   In effect, therefore, the present system
of calculating the rate base for tariff purposes leads to depreciating t'he
basic assets in periods of the order of ten years. Different applications of
the present regulations, when reflected in the apparent Dower costs of i:nter-
connected utilities, may well cause distortions in the relative costs of
important blocks of power especially in the south central system and, as a
consequence, cause important economic decisions to be based on misleading
assumotions.

36.       The Government is aware of these problems but so f'ar its action
has been ll_ teA to a study of +    + t-i ff  ++In n+d then nrenYpartn
of a new schedule of depreciation rates based on the useful lives of the

the Government has agreed that the problem of devising new policies govrerning
Ulhe determuinati.on oi' the le[vel of -rosss rrevnues re Lquired bLiy utilite,
and the related question of electrification taxes, deserve immediate
study and early action.  As this problem affects th'e wnole of the utility
industry ;and there is evidence of' the Governmentta willingness to reso:Lve it,
it was not considered practical or necessary to require more specific
action as a condition f'or the proposed loan to Cemig.
37.       Pending results of the general action contemplated above, the
Minister of Mines and Energy and Cemig have agreed that in order to follow
reasonable standards for the determination of future tariffs, Cemig
would, beginning in 1966, revalue its lixed assets as often as permitted
by the issuance of official cost indices, charge depreciation at rates
commensurate with the useful life of assets, and elimlinate amortization
charges altogether.
38.       A covenant has been included in both the Guarantee and Loan Agree-
ments to the effect that (a) Cemig will maintain tariffs at least sufficient
to provide for a rminimum annual 10 percent return on its revalued net f'ixed
assets in operation at the end of each calendar year after operating expenses
incLuding normal depreciation charges of not less than 3 percent of the
average revalued gross fixed assets in operation but excluding amortization
charges, ('b) Cemig will revalue its ftixed assets in operation as often as
perrmitted by the issuance of official cost indices but at least once a
year, (c) Cemig will promptly obtain any necessary automatic adjustment to
its tariffs as out;lined in paragraph 31, and (d) Cemig will recover any
deficiency in achieving the annual 10 percent return over a 12 month period
starting not later than seven months after the close of the calendar year.
39.       Cemig's tariffs were more than doubled from an average of Cr't6.76
per kwh in 1964 to Cr$15.20 per kwh early in 1965, and taxes were automa-
tically increased in the same proportion.   Annex 4 shows the price paid for
power by the maior categories. including taxes. and the large nercentage
of the consumer's bill which is used for plant investments.
40.       In 1968 Cemig will begin to purchase power from Furnas which is
one of the few utilities in Brazil which has taken full advantage of the new
tariff regulations.  Its tariffs were increased approximately four times
above their 1964 level and currently exceed Cemig's tariff by about Cr$;8.8
per kwh. Under the regulations, Cemig could pass on such a dif'ference to
its consumers, but fears that by doing so it would imnede the growth of'
its market.

L41.      This problem was discussed with representatives of Cemig, Furnas,
and the Minister of lvines and Energy.  Furnas and the Government were a:lso
advised of the possible depletion of Furnas& remunerable investment and the
deterioration of its rate of return that would result from using high
depreciation and amortization rates for an extended period of time.     Pending
results of the act-Lons contemplated in paragraph 36. it was agreed in
principle that, starting 1968, Furnas would lower its depreciation rate from
nereent to a normrl rnte of denreciation estimated to be 2-1/2 percent, and
eliminate its 5 percent amortization ent:irely.  The reason for the delay is
t,wofold:  (2) it. is the PFederal Cover:nm t is desLre that. Furnas generatE
most of its local funds for its expansion during the next two-year peried
rather than borrow or receive equity -ontributions from    letrcbhras; (b) Gemig
will not begin takiLng large amounts of power from Furnas until 1968 (see

equivalent of Cr$2,220 to US11 it was necessary to f'ully revalue its 196,1h
figures using tne 1964 official cost indices plus a revaluation adjustment
for 1965 based on estimated cost indices for 1965. Actual official 1965 cost

46.       Cemig's partial revaluation of its 1964 balance sheet increased
its net plant to Cr$87.56 billion or a little more than half of its true
value. When fully revalued through 1965 it will increase to Cr$227.70 billion
or 2.6 times.
h7.       Investments in associated companies are primarily in Furnas, with
holdings of approximately 4.6 percent of Furnas' stock outstanding. They
also include holdings of annroximatelv 55 nercent of the Eletrificacao Rural
de Minas Gerais (Ermig)*, a subsidiary formed in 1962 to handle the develop-
ment of rural elentrification in the State; and small holdings in the Centrais

revaluing the balamce sheet accounts through 1965 and the additional advances
and stock dividendis declared on 1965 earnings will increase Cemig's share
capital to Cr$L06.37 billion and the Revaluation Reserve to Cr$65.77 b:illion.
The regulations require that the Reserve be converted into share capital
within four months after the revaluationl is completed in 1966.

xl.       Part OI tlhe existing uebt is secured uy mortgages on spec±±ic
plant facilities which have been approved by the Bank in accordance withl
Section 5.05 of Loan 76-BR. Mortgages on the Salto Grande Plant, the Tres
Marias plant and the Barreiro Substation were granted to BNDE as guarantor
of foreign currency contracts between uemig and tne Swiss Bank Corporation,
Siemens Schuckertwerke A.G. and International General Electric. The total
value of these contracts has been reduced by amortization from US$10.35
mnillion equivalent originally, to US$2.77 million as of October 31, 1965.
Another mortgage, on the Piau plant, guarantees a local currency loan from
the Banco do Brasil S.A. of Cr$.O5 billion originally, reduced to Cr$.01
billion as of October 31, 1965. The above contracts will all terminate by
December 1967. The other debts of Cemig, including the debts incurred in
1965, are not secuLred.
Past Earnings Record
52.       Income 'Statements for 1963 and 1964 are shown in Annex 6. Until
early in 1965 Cemig's tariffs were based on historic costs of its remunerable
investment' Although tariff increases were made in the past, they did not
keep pace with the rapid inflation.  Expressed in U.S. mills per kwh by con-
verting Cemig's tariffs at the free rates of exchange then in effect, tariffs
actually cleclined from 6.11 mills per kwh in 1960 to h.52 mills Per kwh in
1964. Cemig has experienced an unusual load growth with its kwh sales in-
creasing 2.5 times during the past five years (see Annex 2). This helped to
slor down the deterioration of its earnings in the period preceding the change
in Goverrnment tariff nolicies in latet 196h. Tariffs were increased in early
1965 to an average of about 8.2 mills per kwh (based on an exchange rate of
Cr$1,850 to US 1 '. The rate of repturn based nn fully revalued remunerable
investment at the end of 1965 is shown as 3.7 percent. This, however, is
after dediieting nbArges for awnxchnncra Mffay-o na-  otio   n Anti amontizatinn

57.       it is expected that Cr..$29.58 billion, or 6 percent of the reauire-
ments will be in the form of Federal grants from the iiinistry of i1ines
and Energy and other Federal sources.
58.       It is expected that the existing shareholders will contribute new
share capital totaling Cr.l-54.20 bi'lion, or about 31.4 percent of the
requirements, in proportions related to their present holdings oi' Cemig shares.
Contributions by the State of Mlinas Gerais would be trom proceeds of a State
sales tax dated October 16, 1964, earmarked for electrification and from
the State's portion of the proceeds of the Federal tax on power consumption.
Although no difficulty is expected in raising the share capital, undertakings
have been obtained from the State and Federal Government covering the pro-
vision of funds for the project (see paragraphs 63 and 6L).
59.       The proposed Bank loan of Cr.0$108.80 billion, or U.S.Lt%9 million
equivalent, would be 22.2 percent of the requirements. It is assumed to have
a term of' 25 yearE, including a 51 -year grace period with an interest rate
of 6 percent.  Other borrowings to finance the Jaguara Droiect would include
an iBletrobras loan of Cr.$22.20 billion to have a term of 12 years, including
a two-year grace neriod with interest at 12 nercent.   This loan would amount
to 4.5 percent of the requirements and is one of the means which is used by
the .tate to ohtai.n additional nroceeds of the Feirnl tax on pnwer consiimnti on.

61.       A future foreign loan for new plants of Cr$66.05 billion equivalent
under terms somewhat similar to the proposed Bank loan is expected to be
obtained in 1970 with Cr$37.87 billion to be drawn during the 1970-71 construc-
tion period and the balance of Cr$28.18 billion to be drawn in the 1972--74
period. The portion of the loan to be drawn during 1970-71 would be 7.'7 percent
of the requirements of the period covered by the construction of the Jag'uara
project.
62.       Under the terms of its Charter, Cemig is obliged to distribute
its profits each year after the necessary amortizations of its debt and appro-
priation of legal reserves have been made.  Under State law, the portion of
the State's share of the net profits are to be reinvested in Cemig's plant
expansion. It has been assumed in Annex 6 that approxirately 61 percent; of
Cemigls annual net profits after legal reserves and small amounts of unappro-
priated surplus will be reinvested.
63.       In order to assure that Uemig will be able to obtain the necessary
funds to complete the expansion orogram, the State has agreed in the Project
Agreement that it will continue to follovw the requirements of existing State
laws which reouire the State to reinvest its nprtion nf Cemig's net proflts
in Cemig's expansion program, contribute new money by purchases of additlional
shnres nnd annunl anpproprin-ritnn fr-m the State's res^nrre=  Under exi4ti_ng
law, the State guarantees a minimum dividend of 6 percent to private share-
holders.  The State shall also transfer to Cemig all funds appropriated by
the Federal Government and paid to the State for the purpose of carrying out
6A.       T'he Federal rGovern-me-nt- has agreed that CeA,g -wll obtain from
Eletrobras, prior to effectiveness of the proposed loan (a) a loan of

inflation and (b) a firm understanding to purchase such amounts of Cemig's
new share c apital as will be required to Umaintain its pa ticipatlon in ,em ig's
total paid-in capital at a level of not less than 16 percent.
Estimated F'uture Earnings
65.       Consolidated forecast Income Statements for the period 1965 through
1974 are shown in Annex 6. It has been assumed that Cemig will maintainl tariffs
to achieve a 10 percent return on its revalued remunerable investment as
defined in paragraph 30, after charging straight-line depreciation at 3 percent,
but no amortization.  Kwh sales have been projected on the basis of the load
requirements forecast outlined in paragraph 10.
66.       Cemigis load growth from 1968 through 1974 will be me t by power
purchased from Furnas. This will constitute a large portion of its operating
expenses. The cost of the power has been projected on the basis on Furnas'
present tariff structure.  The Annex shows the increases Cemig would have to
make in its own tariffs in order to maintain a 10 percent return on its
investment. If Firnas lowers its tariffs in 1968 as has been agreed to in



- 19 -
principle (see paragraph !1l), Cemig would be able to achieve these resulvts
with scmewhat lower tariffs. Cemig will enter into a contract with Furnas
covering purchases of power during the years 1966-1967 and will be in a position
to renegotiate a contract for 1968 and thereafter.  It is proposed to secure
agreements between the Bank and Furnas concerning the level of its tariffs in
1968 during negotiations for a Bank loan for which it has applied.
67.       Net operating income after taxes would cover total interest, including
capitalized interest, b.51 times in 1966 declining to 3.26 times in 1969 and
rising to a maximun of 5.70 times by 197h. Total debt service would be covered
2.11 tirmes in 1966 and decline to 2.0b times in 1967 and rise to a maximum of
4.43 times by 197h. These ample coverages reflect the large proportion of
equi-ty in the proposed financing plan and are very satisiactory.
68.       Cemig will be able to allocate 5 percent of its net profits to legal
reserves and declare dividends of at least 8 percent on both Common and Pre-
arTed stock, the value of which is maintained through revaluation of the!
balance sheet accounts.  This is above the mnimum reouirements of its Charter,
and should be sufficient to attract private capital.
Future Financial Position
69.       Annex 5 shows forecast consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
1966 through 197)'- nliring the period lnder review, P Cemig's total iixed assets
are expected to increase from Cr$240 billion to CrM833 billion, or about four
times.  Its fully ~revTud long-term I- b       ofr47 billion is ex,   o+.r
increase to Cr~l90 billion by 1973 and thien decrease to Crtl79 billion in 1974.
Due to the State's obligation of reinvestment of its dividends and continued
participation in the purchase of new share capital, Cemig's long-term debt is
low in relati on to iL     ty.
70.      rTh_  ark Loan Agr-eer,env Mo.     inc-ues a    L  limitation covenant
which limitls consol]idated long-term debt to an amount equivalent to the total
of its con.solidated capital and surplus.  A debt limitation covenant baEed
on Cemig's revalued net fixed assets would be more appropriate and easier to
applyr as a rmeans of" Teas-uring CenIaig s anriual f inanci al posl-tion.  [le c,unsoli-
dated debt to acquire plant facilities outstanding at the end of any given year,
would bie J1±ue'u 'tu a irmwax'unm oi- two-thirds of the consolidated net revalued
fixed assets including revalued work in progress. Such debt would include
acbuaal debt drawdowns ratner than tne amount of the loan contracts, the current
12-month portion of such debt carried in the books as current liabilities and
any short term loans incurred to finance plant expansion. This debt limi-
tation has been included in the Loan Agreement and replaces Sections 5.0
and 5.10 of Loan Agreement No. 76-.BR.
71.       Annex 5 shows that Cemig could keep well within t}lis limitation
as its percentage of its fully revalued long-term debt to total revalued fixed
assets in 1965 is 23.6 percent increasing to 31.2 percent in 1970 and reducing
to 22.9 percent in 1974. This assumes that Cemig will continue to revalue its
investment to reflect the true value of both its fixed assets and long-term loans.

72.       The projsecti, consist-ing of the Jaguara -ydroelectric pl-ant aLd
transmission lines, is technically and econom.ically sound. Its estimated
cost and proposed construction scneaule are reasonaDle (paragrapns 19 and 21).
73.       Tne Borrower, Cemig, a corporation controlled by the State of iiinas
Gerais, has been in existence since :1952 and has demonstrated its ability to
plan, execute and operate its facilities efficiently (paragraph 6).
74.       The large transmission grid to which Cem-ig is connected will require
integrated operatiLon to secure reliability of supply and the most economical
production of electric energy. The Government has agreed to encourage the
first steps in thiLs direction which are now being taken with a view to
assuring well-coordinated operation lby 1970 (paragraph 12).
75.       Import procedures in BraziL have the effect of interfering with the
most; efficient methods of contracting for the construction of plants such as
Jaguara. The Government has agreed to make a study of this with a viewr to
improving the situation in connection with future projects (paragraphs 27
and 28).
76.       Cemig operates under tariff regulations amended at the end oi 1964
to allow periodic revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes. Due to
certain shortcominigs of these regulations, and also to the present high level
of electrification taxes on consumers, a utility may not be able to achieve
fully the permitted return on the up-to-date value of its assets; and differ-
ent utilities could follow substantially different tariff policies.  Such
differences may well cause distortions in the relative costs of important
blocks of power in the South Central qvstpm. as a consequence. cause important
economic decisions; to be based on misleading assumptions. The Government is
aware of these nrohl Pimn hut sn far i-t aG-.iti-n has hben limitpd to a study of
the tariff structures and the preparation of a new schedule of depreciation
rates base  nn the iiufiil lives of t.he -rm-ios classes of assets.  Tn r:nn-
nection with the proposed loan, however, the Government has agreed that; the
problem of devising new policies governing +he determ.nation of the level
of gross revenues required by utilities, and the related question of electri-
f'i ':~ti nn taxes, deserveimm.edlate study a.d early action   sthis problem
affects the whole of the utility industry and there is evidence of the Govern-
ment' s willngess to resolve it  it was not considered practical or necessary
to require more specific action as a condition for the proposed loan to Cemig.

77.       Agreements have been reached wvLth the Government, Cemig, or the
'tate of 'linas Gerais as follows:
(i) A sales contract satisi'actory to the Bank covering the
purchase of Furnas' power by Cemig will be completed as a
condition of effectiveness for the proposed loan (paragraphs 8
and 66).
(ii)  The Government and Cemig have agreed to a tarif'f covenant which
would provide fcr a minimum annual 10 percent return on Cemig's
revalued fixed assets in operation at the end of each calendar
year, as revalued once a year, after adequate depreciation
charges of at lest 3 percent. They have also agreed that
automatic adjustments outlined in paragraph 31 will be made
and any shortfall in achieving the return in one year will be
recovered over a twelve month period beginning not later than
7 months after the end of the calendar year (paragraph 38).
(iii)  Cemig has agreed to continue to employ auditcrs satisfactory
*to the Rank and to su_bmit vninuallv certified consnlidated
financial statements (paragraph 42).
(iv)  Cemig has agreed not to incur any debt which would increase its
-fixed assets. Short-term debts that might be incurred for
pref-inancing expansi on woulld be included in the indebtedness
so limited (paragraph 70).
