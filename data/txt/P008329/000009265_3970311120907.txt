HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Loan and Project Summnary
Borrower:          Republic of Croatia
Beneficiary:       Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications, and
Croatian Roads Authority (HC)
Amount:            US$80 Million equivalent
Terms:             17 years maturity including a grace period of 4 years at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate
Project Objectives:  The main objcctive of the project is to support and speed up the
modernization and transformation of the transport sector with special
emphasis on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).
In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment
program for the roads sector with the objective of reducing the
deterioration of the network and completing the construction of a few
well justified sections; (b) support the development of modem
management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d)
decrease road vehicle emissions; (e) maintain the present level of road
user charges; (f) support the restructuring of Croatian Railways (HZ)
leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the
elaboration of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port
of Rijeeka.
Description:       (a) Policy and Institutions
The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement measures
to:
fi)    mairntain the road vehicle fuel tax on at least its present level in
real terms;
(ii)  reduce the Governments's budgetary support to HZ;
(iii)  design and implement a road traffic safety program;
(iv)  reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide
availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less than that
of leaded gasoline; and
(v)   continue the separation of civil works contractors from HC and

- Ui -
pursue further implementation of the Pavement Management
System (PMS).
(b) Investments
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of HC's road expenditure
program directed at repairing war damage, reducing the
deterioration of the nretwork and making investments to complete
projects that accommodate changes in transport demand;
(ii)  technical assistance and studies for:
o     HZ restructuring
*     traffic safety
*     implementation of PMS
*     Rijeka --rt master plan
(iii) training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road
maintenance techniques, including pavement and bridge
management systems.
Benefits:          The project will: (i) reduce vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduce future
costly reconstruction by increasing road maintenance; (iii) reduce road
accidents and vehicle emissions; (iv) reduce Government subsidies to
HZ; and (v) contribute to HZ restructuring and uevelopment of Rijeka
port.
Risks:             The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the
GOC would not have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budgets
to implement the project. Although serious tensions still exist in
Croatia and in the region, however, the situation is believed to be
sufficiently st.ble to begin an assistance program, with good chances of
success. The project has been limited to territories which are under the
Government's control, and even if hostilities should resume, it is
doubtful they would extend so far as to prevent project implementation.
In addition, the sector investment loan format, including annual reviews
of the Program, and the experience of the borrower, provide the
flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the Program
according to charging economic and political circumstances. Project
risks are considered to be acceptable given the exceptional conditions in
Croatia.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$80 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
FOR A HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Croatia for the equivalent of US$80 million, in support of a Highway
Sector Project. The ioan would have a term of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years
at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    Background: After the war in late 1991, Croatia emerged with about one-third of its
pre-war territory outside its control, including about 25% of its agricultural land. These
areas have been designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) since January, 1992.
Over the last two years, after the war had ceased in Croatia, limited hostilities continued to
take place from time to time around these areas. However, the cease-fire of March 1994,
reinforced by the withdrawal of personnel and weapons, appears to be holding well. An
agreement was also reached (March 1994) between the republics of Croatia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina on a federation within Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as a preliminary agreement
on a confederal arrangement between the two republics. The Govermment has persevered in
its efforts at economic reintegration within Croatia, and, with the assistance of international
negotators, has succeeded in signing the second in a series of agreements to that end in
December, 1994.
3.    The transport sector's significant potential contribution to GDP and the Governmenit's
budget is not being realized at present due to the disruption of economic activity associated
with the war and the breakup of former Yugoslavia. The main issues confronting the sector
are:
(a)   War damage to transport infrastructure which impedes normal economic
activity, including in the important tourist sector.
(b)   A backlog on road maintenance which was evident before the war, but which
became worse due to subsequent financial constraints.
(c)   Changes in transport demand need to be accommodated which result from the
occupation of territories, the blockage of the trans-Yugoslav corridor, and the
general consequences of economic reform and restructuring.
(d)   The need to proceed with market-oriented institutional reforms, particularly in
the case of Croatian railways which is a significant drain on limited
Government resources.



-2-
4.    Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector: Although the Bank's dialogue with Croatia
started in early 1992, it did not immediately translate into lending operations. Initally, our
restraint was due to the continuing limited hostilities within Croatia; the Bank continued to be
cautious during 1993 and early 1994 because of the situation in the neighboring Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The major breakthroughs of March 1994 allowed the Bank to
adopt a more active cooperation stance. On June 22, 1994, the Board approved the first loan
to the Republic of Croatia (Emergency Reconstruction Loan, 3760-HR). In addition to the
Emergency Reconstruction Project, the Bank has made 12 loans totalling US$711.5 million
equivalent for transport to the former Yugoslavia which contained components benefiting
Croatia. These included eight loans to the highway subsector, three loans for the railway
subsector, and one loan for an oil pipeline project.
5.    The main emphasis in highway lending to Yugoslavia was on improvements to key
links in the primary road network. The First and Second (Highway) Projects which financed
the completion of the coastal section ef the Adriatic Highway; and improvement of roads
connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway with the Adriatic highway, were completed within
the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Completion Report for the Ninth
(Highway) Project indicated that it substantially achieved its objectives. The Completion
Reports for the Tenth and Eleventh (Highway) Projects pointed out that both projects
suffered delays in implementation because of shortages of local funds due to a severe
recession. The First and Second (Highway Sector) Projects were based on a comprehensive
sector lending approach, including a deeper involvement in the important area of road
maintenance. Processing of both projects was initially delayed pending resolution of the road
funding issue, but then proceeded satisfactorily in Croatia. The forner Yugoslavia and the
Bank also prepared the Third (Highway Sector) Project, including US$75.0 million for
Croatia, which included follow-up initiatives on road maintenance, financing and investment
planning. This project was lapsed prior to effectiveness following the breakup of the former
Yugoslavia.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement: The project is consistent with the strategy outlined
in the Country Assistance Strategy, being discussed concurrently with this project, which
identified infrastructure (especially catch-up activities on overdue investment, rehabilitation
and upgrading) as an important priority. Taking financial constraints and the need for
institutional reforms into account, the GOC and the Bank have discussed the following
strategy for the transport sector during the next several years: (a) repair damaged transport
infrastructure over about a five year period, induding repairing the most important tourist
airports; (b) defer most purchases of railway rolling stock, or vehicles for road transport
enterprises owned by GOC, until traffic levels recover; (c) reduce the road maintenance
bacldog; (d) be highly selective with other road investments due to the recent decline in
traffic and fiscal constraints; (e) reduce the railway subsidy and restructure Croatian
Railwavs (HZ) to reduce its losses and increase its commercial orientation; and (f) privatiZe
truck operators and separate road maintenance contractors from the Croatian Roads Authority
(HC). The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMATC) and
Ministry of Finance (MOF) have agreed with these recommendations. In addition, for the



-3-
ports, primarily Rijeka, there is a strong awareness that installations have to be made more
efficient and that an overall development concept has to be formulated. To cope with some
of these problems, primarily road maintenance and to complete some ongoing road
investments, the Government has asked for the Bank's participation.
7.    Project Objectives: The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the
modernization and transformation of the transport sector with special emphasis on the main
road network and HC. In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment
program for the roads sector with the objective of reducirng tie deterioration of the network
and completing the construction of a few well justified sections; (b) support the development
of modern management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d) decrease road
vehicle eraiissions; (e) maintain the present level of road user charges; (f) support the
restructuring of HZ leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the elaboration
of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port of Rijeka.
8.    Project Description:
(a)   Policy and Institutions: The Govemment and HC to adopt policies and
implement measures to:
(i)    maintain road vehicle fuel tax on at least its present level in real terms;
(ii)  reduce Government's budgetary support to HZ;
(iii)  design and implement a road traffic safety program;
(iv)  reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide availability of
unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less than for leaded gasoline; and
(v)   continue separation of civil works contractors from HC and pursue
further implementation of the Pavement Management System (PMS).
(b)   Investments:
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of HC's road expenditure program
directed at repairing war damage, ieducing the deterioration of the
network and completing projects that accommodate changes in transport
demand;
(ii)  technical assistance and studies for:
*     HZ restructuring
*     traffic safety
*     implementation of PMS
o     Rijeka port master plan



-4-
(iii) Training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road maintenance
techniques, including pavement and bridge management systems.
9.    Project Implementation: Specific sub-projects will be prepared on a continuous basis
in time for approval by the Bank and inclusion in annual programs. Feasibility studies for all
sub-projects and all other major investment items would be submitted for the Bank's review
and approval. Preliminary updated investment and financing plans would be made available
to the Bank, so that the program for the following year can be firmed up by the end of
October of each year during project implementation.
10.   HC will be responsible for execution and management of the project, except for the
technical assistance to the railways, for road safety as well as the port study which would be
the responsibility of MMATC. The project is expected to start in the first quarter of 1995
and to be completed by June 2000. HC will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on
project implementation.
11.   Retroactive Financing: A maximum amount of US$8.0 million (10% of the loan
amount) would be eligible for retroactive financing of expenditures incurred after December
31, 1994, to facilitate the prompt execution of Bank-financed operations.
12.   Project Sustainability: the institutional developments are under way, through actions
started by GOC HC is well experienced in managing a program as the one foreseen and has
considerable u;xperience of Bank operations. The project is therefore considered to be
sustainable. The risks associated with institutional development are therefore reasonable.
With respect to intemational political developments see para. 14, Risks, below.
13.   Agreements Reached: During negotiations, agreement was reached regarding:
(a)   maximum level of government subsidies to HZ;
(b)   road vehicle fuel tax to be maintained at least at its present level in real terms;
(c)   HC to carry out action plans covering the reorganization and improvement of
its maintenance operations, including the separation of civil works contractors;
(d)   the carrying out of the proposed traffic safety study; and consultations to be
held with the Bank before December 31, 1995 about the implementation of the
study recommendations;
(e)   the project objectives and the project description;
(f)   arrangements for annual reviews of the 1995-97 Road Expenditure Program;



-5-
(g)   the carrying out of feasibility studies of rn udwork investments proposed to be
included in the Road Expenditure Program in accordance with methods of
economic analysis satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 3.2) and undertaldng of
road works greater than $5.0 million only if they have an ERR greater than
12%;
(h)   the 1995-97 Road Expenditure Program and provisions of budgetary resources
to meet its requirements, in a timely manner;
(i)   all terms of reference;
(I)   the implementation schedule, moritoring, auditing, and reporting
arrangements;
(k)   the procurement arrangements;
(1)   (i) the gasoline lead contents to be reduced to 0.4 % by weight by June 30,
1996; and
(ii)  unleaded gasoline to be widely available at a price equal to or less than
for leaded gasoline;
(m)   PMS to be fully operational by 1997 and that starting 1998 the budget for
HRR and routine maintenance will be prepared and monitored through the
systematic use of PMS.
14.   Environment Considerations: The new construction components, i.e. the Ostravica-
Delnice section, the Solin Klis road and the Split Bypass involve major new highway con-
struction. They have therefore been categorized as "A" projects warranting full
environmental impact assessments. Major environmental issues anticipated in these locations
include water pollution due to carriage way runoff, land acquisition and resettlement,
protection of historical monuments and noise pollution due to proximity to urban areas.
Environmental Impact Assessments have been prepared by HC for these components. They
have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory in the analysis of the
environmental issues and in the recommended measures to mitigate the impact. The
recommendations have been taken into account in the design and construction of these works.
Summaries of the Environmental Impact S.udies have been distributed to the Buard.
15.   Risks: The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the GOC
would not have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budget to implement the project.
It has to be recognized that serious tensions still exist within Croatia and in the region, which
could lead to situations that would derail our assistance. However, several reasons lead us to
believe that Croatia's situation is now stable enough to begin an assistance Drogram, with
good chances of success. First, the Croatian authorities have shown prudence with respect to
both the difficult territorial situation within Croatia and the threatening proximity of



-6-
outbreaks of hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and second, departure from this prudent
stance would have a high cost for the Government in terms of suspension of assistance and
jeopardizing the initial successes towards stabilization and recovery. The project has been
limited to territories controlled by GOC and even if hostilities should resume, it is doubtful
they would extend so far as to prevent project implemertation. In additic.- the sector
investment loan format, including annual reviews of the Program, and the eaperience of the
borrower, provide the flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the Program
according to changing economic and political circumstances. Project risks are considered to
be acceptable given the exceptional conditions in Croatia.
16.   Recommendations: I am satisfied that this loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
operation.
