3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the project was to support and speed up the modernization and transformation of the
transport sector with special emphasis on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).
Specific objectives were to:
(a) assist the Government of Croatia (GoC) in its investment program for the roads sector witi the



objective of reducing the deterioration of the network and completing the construction of a few
well justified sections;
(b) support the development of modern management tools in HC;
(c) help to improve the road safety situation;
(d) decrease road vehicle emissions;
(e) maintain present level of road user charges;
(f) support the restructuring of Croatian Railways (HZ) leading to reduced budget transfers; and
(g) contribute to the elaboration of a master plan and associated investment for the port of Rijeka.
The project supported the April 4, 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives, as well as the May
11, 1999 CAS objectives, namely to improve efficiency of the public sector, improve governance, create
conditions for competitive real sector development, and improve infrastructure through private sector
development and participation.
The objectives of the project were clear and realistic, although there were significant project risks due to the
politically unstable situation in Croatia. The project was appraised and partly implemented in the midst of
the Balkan wars; the Kraina region was not under the government's control, and rockets were launched
onto the center of Zagreb in the summer of 1995. Travel to Dalmatia involved security problems and the
big push and fight in the Kraina region came in late 1995 when the project was underway. There were
concerns about security, provision of sufficient counterpart funds and commitment to institutional reforms.
However, the risks were assessed and mitigation measures agreed upon during negotiation activities were
limited to territories which were under the Government's control. In addition, the sector investment format
with annual reviews of the program, and the experience of the borrower provided for flexibility to adjust
the size, location, and composition of the program according to changing economic and political
institutional circumstances.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
(a)    repair of roads damaged during the Balkan war, reducing the deterioration of the network,
elimination of road accident black spots, and making investments to complete projects that accommodate
changes in transport demand, (US$85 million equivalent including contingencies); and provision of road
maintenance equipment, and spare parts, (US$27.0 million).
(b)    technical assistance and studies for: (i) restructuring HZ; (ii) traffic safety, (iii) implementation of
pavement and bridge management systems (PMS/BMS), and (iv) Rijeka Port master plan; (USS2.8 million
equivalent; and
(c)    training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road maintenance techniques, including
PMS/BMS, (USS0.5 million).
The design of the three components was linked to the objectives and took into account the limited
absorptive capacity of the implementing project agencies and political circumstances.
3.4 Revised Components:
Project components were not revised.
A total of about US$1.5 million was reallocated to the road rehabilitation works component due to the
availability of trust fund financing:
1.    The traffic safety study was financed by the Swedish Government (TF032571) in May 1995, and
completed in August 1996.
-2 -



2.    A PHRD Grant Agreement (in the amount of Yen58,800,000) was signed on November 29, 1995,
for the study on restructuring of Croatian
Railways.
3.    The Government of France provided grant funds (FF3,500,000) for preparation of the Rijeka and
Ploce port master plans.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project's quality at entry was not assessed by QAG. Quality at entry is considered to be satisfactory,
based on the (i) appropriateness of objectives and components given the economic and political situation in
the country; and (ii) the completeness of project preparation. One shortcoming was the lack of agreed
monitoring indicators: agreement on a formal set of indicators was not a Bank requirement at the time of
project preparation. These would have been helpful during project supervision.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement oJ objective:
The overall outcome of the project is considered to be satisfactory.
Objective: (a) Assist Government of Croatia in its investment program for the roads sector with the
objective of reducing the deterioration of the network and completing the construction of a few well
justified sections.
Achievement/Outcome: All the physical investments were successfully completed, contributing to the
successful implementation of the Govermnent's 1995-1997 program and subsequent road programs. At
appraisal (1995), of the 12,000 km of state road network, 4,800 km (or 40%) was in good, 5,520 km (or
46%) in fair, and 1,680 km (or 14%) in bad condition. At the project's completion, of the 6,822 km of the
state road network under HC responsibility about 3,070 km (or 45%) is in good condition; 2,661 km (or
39%) is in a fair condition; and about 1,091 km (or 16%) is in bad condition. This represents a modest
improvement in the condition of the main road network. Further inprovements were limited by the
budgetary allocation to road maintenance discussed below.
Development of Contracting Industry: The civil works contracts, sized for nascent domestic contractors,
enabled a recently privatized domestic construction industry to modernize its technology and to strengthen
its managerial, administrative and commercial practices, improving the efficiency of the road sector. Open
competition lowered the prices for road works contracts by about 10-15% (10% in the Northern area, and
about 15% in Southern Croatia). Fourteen commercialized road maintenance companies were created in
1998 from former HC maintenance departments. These are presently owned by the counties and HC. Each
maintenance company works for HC and the county(s) in which it is located, initially on the basis of a
negotiated contract. Beginning in 2001, maintenance contractors were selected on the basis of a
competitive tender. It is expected that in 2002, four-year routine maintenance contracts will be let in all
counties. This should give more work security, and allow for better planning for the maintenance
companies. The companies have established an association (Hrvatski Cestar), and are negotiating with
their County owners to be privatized. Initially, 50% of shares would go to the workers, 35% to the
county/HZ owners, and 15% would be sold to private investors with the possibility of privatizing the
county/HZ shares at a later date. The companies' assets are being valued by an independent auditor in
accordance with the Croatia privatization law. The maintenance companies are permitted to work for other
clients, and are eaming some money to purchase new equipment, and have some flexibility in adjusting the
size of their work force. Two have invested in an asphalt plant, which will enable them to undertake small
periodic maintenance contracts and compete more effectively for (routine) maintenance contracts outside
the local area. Domestic private construction companies won most of the contracts. The privatization of
maintenance contractors will be further supported under the proposed Rijeka Port and Highway Project.

Road Maintenance Finance: Prior to the project, road maintenance was underfunded due to the diversion
of funds to the war and subsequently for the repair of war damage. The project contributed to a more than
two-fold increase in maintenance expenditures between 1995 and 1998.

Maintenance expenditures fell sharply in 1999 and 2000 due to the diversion of funds to the motorway
program discussed below. The Bank raised this issue in supervision missions and through the preparation
of a sector study (Policy Directions for Transport, PDT Report No.19447-HR, June 15, 1999) and
subsequent White Paper and Public Expenditure Review. Following this dialogue, the government
approved a more disciplined "Program for Construction and Maintenance of Public Roads for the Years
2001-2004", dated February 2001. It proposes a stabilized, US$150 million (or 37 % of the total) road
maintenance budget for the next four years starting in 2001. This is almost in line with the Bank's
recommended US$170 million p.a. needed for the next 6 years for catching up with the backlog.
To sustain the 2001-2004 program, the government foresees the following financial resources:
1.    HC: Maintenance, reconstruction and construction of state, county, and local roads (US$mln):
(i) budgetary resc,irces                          122
(ii) revenues from fuel tax (HRKO.6/liter)        472
(iii) annual revenues from the vehicle registration fees    186
(iv) loans                                        175
Total                                             955
2.     HAC: Motorway program (US$mln):
(i) budgetary resources                            67
(ii) revenues from fuel tax (HRKO.4/liter in 2001,
and HRKO.5/liter in 2002, 2003, and 2004)      496
(iii) toll revenues                               254
(iv) loans                                       1,180
Total                                            1,998
Overall Total                                    2,953
The primary source of revenue for both state (including country and local) roads and motorways is a
dedicated portion of the fuel tax. This makes sense in the case of main roads because of the substantial
maintenance backlog which the governrent intends to overcome. It is a less desirable, although expedient,
solution to the motorway financing problem discussed below. Parliamentary approval of a multi-year road
expenditure program funded primarily from extra budgetary sources increases the probability that the
program will be carried out.
Motorway Program: Croatia has about 593 km of high level tolled roads and motorways. The
Government in power until 2000 initiated a program to construct an additional 1,530 km of motorways by
the year 2013 at a cost of US$6.5 billion. This was partly driven by a desire to join the EU and generate
business for domestic contractors. Few of these motorway proposals were likely to be economically
justified since no roads carried more than 15,000 vpd at that time. The model chosen for financing of
- 4 -



motorways usually consisted of agreeing with a foreign construction company to arrange financing in
return for the construction contract (and sometimes an operating contract). In addition to a direct
contribution, the Government needed to provide guarantees. This increased the Government contingent
liabilities to a significant extent. Since equity funds could not be made available from the state budget,
Croatia was forced to take expensive short-term loans. The concessioning process did not enjoy sufficient
competition, and caused the unit prices for motorway construction to jump up to about 140% of the unit
price in Western Europe. The govemment did not carry out feasibility studies for these investments and
send them to the Bank as required under the Loan Agreement, and appeared to initiate major road
investments with ERRs less than 12%. Decisions were taken at a high level in a non-transparent way and
impl.mented by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) outside of the purview of the project, with little
public information made available.
The new Government elected in 2000 recognized that the motorway program was not sustainable. The
Bank financed an advisor under the project who helped define a reduced program, taking into account that
several motorway contracts were already signed. In particular, the Govemment approved a program to
expand the network of high level tolled roads from 593 km to 1,330 km in 10-15 years. While some of this
construction appears uneconomic (some contracts are committed), and the aggregate level of expenditure is
high and is being financed from extra-budgetary sources, the new program is a significant improvement
over the former one. The pace of actual motorway construction may, in fact, be limited by available
financing. The project consultant has recommended that the next steps are to: (i) prepare a feasibility study
for each proposed new motorway; (ii) finalize the organization and staffing of Hrvatske Autoceste (HAC,
new motorway agency); (iii) prepare a balance sheet and income statement for existing motorway assets;
and (iv) develop a long term capital program for presentation to the international financing institutions and
bond houses with a view to obtaining a satisfactory bond rating and issuing bonds during 2002. This will
provide the financial basis for evaluating existing and prospective joint ventures with the private sector for
motorway development. It is planned to provide further technical assistance for motorways under the
proposed Rijeka Port and Highway Project.
Implementation of the motorway program weakened the administration of the road sector, particularly prior
to 2000. Decisions on major investments were taken at a high level without involving HC. Uneconomic
projects were selected, contracts were negotiated in a non-transparent way at a high price, and funds were
diverted from maintenance/rehabilitation activities. Due to this and low salaries, some HC staff left. These
problems have been partly overcome with the reorganization of the road sector in 2001. The Government
created HAC and reorganized HC, each as a public corporation responsible for motorways and national
roads respectively, with each funded by a dedicated portion of the fuel tax and other sources and obligated
to implement a four-year road expenditure program as described above. It was clarified that HC was
responsible for overall planning of the road network. While problems remain (excessive motorway
program; HC reports to MMATC while HAC reports to MPW, low salaries); there is evidence that
institutional problems are being gradually overcome. Routine maintenance is being contracted out as
discussed, and HC has reduced its staff from 1138 in 2000 to 285 in 2001.
Objective: (b) support the development of modern management tools in HC
Achievement/Outcome: HC's ability to prepare the budget, and plan for road construction and maintenance
was improved. HC is now equipped with a PMS/BMS, supported under the project, which enables it to
base management decisions on more reliable data, evaluated using a decision-making scheme which takes
into account road conditions, user cost and budget constraints. HC's staff has become proficient in modem
computer-based systems (procured under the project), modern management practices, and in the latest
highway management techniques. Investment decisions, particularly for motorway construction, are still
being based to some extent on political rather than technical criteria as discussed above, so that the
- 5 -



established technical capacity of HC is not yet put to full use. However, the PMS/PBS sensitized the
Govemment to the maintenance problem resulting in a significant increase in the 2001-2004 maintenance
budget discussed above. The prospects for using the PMS/BMS system to determine maintenance
priorities during this period are good.
Objective: (c) help to improve road safety
Achievement/Outcome: The trust fund financed traffic safety study was successfully completed in August
1996. The key findings of the study are to: (i) establish a Road Safety Committee; (ii) set up an accident
data system; (iii) establish black spots elimination program; (iv) undertake road safety audits, cost-benefit
studies, revision of standards and regulations; (v) develop safety design manual; (vi) introduce new speed
limits; (vii) revise traffic signals; (viii) carry out safety publicity campaign; and (ix) improve driver
training. Since then, Croatia has carried out some of the less costly recommendations of the study,
including establishing a traffic safety committee, accident prevention fund, adopting urban speed limits
(50km/h), seat belt laws and other traffic measures, improving black spots; and conducting publicity
campaigns. Those efforts, coupled with gradual replacement of old vehicles with more modem and safer
ones, resulted in a 10% decrease in the number of fatalities (from 721 in 1996 to 655 in 2000). Since the
existing road safety legislation is not fully compatible with the European Acquis Communautaire (for
example on the drivers training and licensing system), the Government is now drafting a new traffic safety
law, which is to be presented to the Parliament for approval in February 2002. The implementation of the
study's recommendations is expected to continue under the proposed Rijeka Port and Highway Project.
Obiective: (d) decrease road vehicle emissions
Achievement/Outcome: Through road quality improvement, introduction of unleaded gasoline, decrease of
lead levels to 0.4% by weight, increased price of lead gasoline, and through enforcement of more strict
technical requirements for vehicles, and road worthiness, the Government reports that road vehicle
emissions have been decreased by around 10%.
Objective: (e) maintain present level of road user charges
Achievement/Outcome: Since project appraisal road user charges have increased from US$192 million
equivalent to about US$922 million equivalent. This is due to a major (almost 6-fold) increase in fuel tax,
and introduction of tolls on motorways. The 1994 and 2000 structure of the road user charges is as follows:
1994          2000
US$ million    US$ million
Fuel tax      VAT                           252.36
145 A10
Other                         559.77
Tolls                         16.20         62.62
Foreign Transit Fees          1.40            -
Exceptional Use Charge
Overloading Charges           13.30           -
Parking and Other Fines
Annual Vehicle Tax            16.10         47.40
TOTAL                        192.10         922.15
About 67% of the road user charges was spent on the main roads in 1994. This decreased to 27% in 2000,
following a substantial increase in the fuel tax. This is expected to increase in the future due to the
implementation of the motorway program as discussed above.

Objective: (f) contribute to a restructuring study for the Croatian Railways (HZ).
Achievement/Outcome: The study on Restructuring of Croatian Railways (HZ), financed by the PHRD
grant was successfully completed in 1996. Its recommendations to modemize and restructure HZ to reduce
its deficit and thus railways financial burden on the state budget while creating a company adapted to a
competitive transport market have been adopted, and are being implemented under HZ's current
restructuring program. The Bank is supporting this program through the ongoing Railway Modemization
and Restructuring Project (Ln. 44330-HR).
Objective: (g) contribute to the elaboration of a master plan and associated investment for the port of
Rijeka.
Achievement/Outcome: The Master Plan for the Port of Rijeka financed by France was completed in 1996.
It is being used to help prepare the proposed Rijeka Port and Highway Project. The project will assist the
port in implementing study recommendations (concession terminals; privatize services; reduce excessive
staff; and prepare financing plans).
4.2 Outputs by components:
Road works and equipment
The project permitted road maintenance, strengthening, and rehabilitation of about 1,600 km, or about 20%
of the main road network (including elimination of black spots; Map IBRD 31647, and 31648). About 28
km of trunk roads, and 17 km of primary and regional roads were constructed. It was proposed by the
Government, and agreed by the Bank that the construction of one km, and pavement strengthening of 9 km
of Solin-Klis highway, and construction of Split Bypass would be financed by the Government's budget.
Since most of the 658 road works contracts were small, to enable local finns to compete, they were
procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Since the only new construction contract was
taken out from the Bank-financed program, no Environmental Impact Assessment was needed for this
component. Therefore only the provision of the equipment for Ostrovica-Delnice road financed by the
EBRD required a comprehensive environmental assessment that was prepared, and approved by the Bank.
Due to the additional government's investments (betterment and massive motorway construction), the total
1995-2000 road expenditures were three times higher than forecasted at the appraisal. The average cost of
road works was about US$890,000 per km of road constructed, and about US$100,000 per km of road
rehabilitated.
EBRD cofinanced the project through parallel funding (US$47.5 million equivalent) of the construction of
Ostravnica-Delnice trunk road, and some parts of the road betterment program. EBRD operated
individually and followed its own procurement practices. This component was successfully completed.
Equipment and vehicles for road maintenance (electrical, telephone, traffic, tunnel, lighting, summer/winter
maintenance, traffic counting, and monitoring) and PMS/BMS software and equipment (scales,
prophilograph, deflectometer, grip tester, information and communication equipment, software, weather
monitoring, and cartography equipment), procured using ICB, NCB, and direct contracting procedures,
were delivered as scheduled, and is in use by HC. Implementation of only one sub-component - PMS/BMS
system - has experienced some delays, which caused a half year extension of the project closing date.
Technical Assistance & Studies
The studies for restructuring Croatian Railways (para 4. If), preparing a master plan for Rejeka Port (para
4.19) and improving road safety (para 4. 1c) were all successfully completed. The technical assistance to
help rationalize the Motorway Program was well utilized (para 4.1 a).
- 7 -



Training
Training of the HC staff, required for the installation of PMS/BMS system was successfully completed.
The use of the PMS/BMS management tool helped put investment decision making on a technical rather
than political basis. In particular, it helped HC to convince the Government to focus more attention on
maintenance of the existing network. As a result, HC's road maintenance budget has increased significantly
during the last stage of the project implementation (para 4.la).
4.3 Net Present Valute/Economic rate of return:
Economic re-evaluation was done by HC and the Civil Engineering Institute for both new construction, and
rehabilitation/betterment contracts:
*   new construction: At appraisal, the ERR for the three road construction contracts
(Ostravnica-Delnice; Solin-Klis; Split Bypass) were estimated to be 19%, 20% and 25%
respectively. At project completion the ERR for EBRD-financed Ostravnica-Delnice is estimated
to be 19.7%. Since the Sloin-Kliss and Split Bypass sections were financed by the Government's
budget, the ERRs were not re-calculated.
*  rehabilitation/betterment: The ERR for rehabilitation/betterment contracts was at appraisal
estimated to be between 39% and 77%. At project completion the ERRs are estimated to be
between 34%, and 98%. This is higher due to the higher traffic levels and lower cost estimated at
appraisal.
The weighted average ERR is estimated to be about 45%, slightly higher than the appraisal estimate of
40%.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial rates of return were calculated since none of the borrowing institutions are revenue-earning
entities.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact achieved in the project is mixed, and is best viewed as a work in
progress with a good prospect of continuing progress in the future.
Road Expenditure Program
(i) The Government increased road maintenance expenditures during 1996-98, catching up with the
maintenance backlog. It then initiated a large program of mostly uneconomic motorway construction and
reduced maintenance expenditures close to pre-1996 levels, an institutional setback. The new Government
adopted a reduced multi-year motorway and increased road maintenance program, and funded both from
extra-budgetary sources. While further rationalization of motorway expenditures is required, the
Government is now moving in the right direction.
Privatization of the Contracting Industry
(ii) Prior to independence, contracts were publicly owned and some rehabilitation works were done by
force account. Today contractors are commercialized, all rehabilitation works are carried out by contract,
and routine maintenance operations have been separated and are in the process of being privatized. Design
Institutes and laboratories are also in the process of being privatized.
Introduction of Modern Management Tools
(iii) Road Sector: Modem management tools like PMS/BMS and economic analysis are now used to
support decisions on both investment and maintenance projects, contributing to a more efficient allocation
of HC's budget.
(iv) Railway Sector: A study on Restructuring of Croatian Railways to assist the Government and
- 8 -



Croatian Railways (HZ) helped prepare the Railway Modemization and Restructuring Project which is
currently under implementation. Institutional reforms and project implementation were slow and the
project was categorized as a problem project for 30 months. Following a change of Government and
railway management, progress has now improved.
(v) Port Sector: The Rijeka Port Masterplan prepared under the project contributed to the dialogue on the
port sector and preparation of the proposed Rijeka Port and Highway Project.
Road Safety Improvement
Recommendations included in the road safety study carried out under the project resulted in a reduction in
the road fatalities.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were no adverse factors outside of the Government's control that affected the project.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Two substantial factors affected project implementation which were under the control of the Government.
Road Maintenance expenditures were low prior to the project due to the diversion of funds to the war and
the repair of war damage. They initially improved, but then fell as the Government initiated an uneconomic
motorway program. The new Government is addressing these issues by significantly increasing road
maintenance expenditures which are now financed off budget, and reducing the motorway program.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The HC performed well in all aspects of project implementation (procurement; environment; supervision;
financial management; monitoring).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Actual contract prices were about 15% lower than the appraisal estimate on average. The main reason for
this is competition, since an increasing number of contractors were able to meet the bid qualification
criteria. Lower than expected contract prices enabled the implementing agency to further reduce the
maintenance backlog by undertaking additional road rehabilitation works in East Slavonia, the poorest
region of the country.
The Bank loan of US$80.0 million equivalent was fully disbursed with the exception of about US$47,000,
which was cancelled, and accounted for 63.3 percent of the total required financing, slightly lower than
estimated at appraisal. The EBRD US$47.5 million equivalent loan was also fully disbursed. The
Government's counterpart funds were provided in a timely manner. Planned retroactive financing did not
take place because it was not needed.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for stustainability rating:
The project is on balance considered to be likely sustainable:
* The recent increase in the four year maintenance funding approved by Parliament and financed
from extra budgetary sources provides increased assurance that project roads will be maintained.
* Institutional improvements in the road sector suffered a setback with the creation of a large
uneconomic Motorway Program and subsequent reduction of maintenance funding in the late
1990s. However, the new Government has taken steps to reduce the size of the Motorway
Program, increase maintenance funding, and improve the organization of the road sector. Further
-9-



rationalization of the motorway program may well occur as funding limitations become more
apparent. This will be followed-up with TA expected to be financed under the proposed Rijeka
Port and Highway Project.
*   The privatization of maintenance contracts is expected to continue, which has reduced the cost of
road works.
*   The PMS/BMS systems introduced under the project are being utilized to prioritize road
maintenance expenditure.
*   A number of study recommendations developed under the project concerning railway reform are
being implemented under the ongoing Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project.
*   Recommendations for improvements in Rijeka Port, rationalizing the Motorway Program and
reducing road accidents are being implemented, and will be further addressed under the proposed
Rijeka Port and Highway Project.
*   The Emergency Transport and Mine Clearing Project, partly prepared under this project was
successfully implemented and completed on December 31, 2001.
The Government implemented more reform actions than planned under the project. They are of high
importance for the future market-oriented road management in the country. One of these reforms was
that the management of about 5,000 km of roads be decentralized from the national road administration
to the local government. The sustainability of this very important reform calls for the strengthening of
the technical, institutional, and fiscal capacity of the local government.
6.2 Transition arrangenment to regular operations:
Road Maintenance administration has improved (staffing, management, policies). It is planned using the
PMS/BMS system, and is being implemented with a more secure budget by a contracting industry which
was further privatized, under the project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing, and appraising the project was satisfactory. The
Bank staff were qualified and there were few changes in staffing during preparation and supervision
(Annex 4). Preparation took place in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in Croatia and with
other international organizations, particularly EBRD. Appraisal was carried out satisfactorily, and covered
all aspects of evaluation including the commitment by the Government, implementing agencies and
beneficiaries, evaluation of the implementing agencies capacity, sustainability, project design, and its
complexity. The project was consistent with the CAS, and with the Government's transport policy at the
time (the extent of the motorway program was not known at appraisal), and the project's components
supported both objectives. The Bank assisted the Borrower to identify trust fund financing. The project
was prepared quickly, i.e.,.identified in October 1994 and the loan agreement was signed on April 27,
1995.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. Skill-mix and continuity of the supervision teams were
satisfactory. The few changes which occurred including the change in Team Leader in early 1999 did not
affect the quality of supervision. Mission's documentation and briefing to the Government were
appropriate. Two supervision missions a year were fielded regularly. When the motorway and maintenance
issues emerged, the Bank initiated an eventually effective dialogue through the preparation of a sector
study, white paper, public expenditure review, and review of a proposed motorway investment which it
declined to finance (Zagreb-Gorican Motorway).
- 10-



7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
In summary of the above, Bank performance was highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower was represented through the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and
Communications (MMATC) and the HC. The Borrower participated in a very constructive and cooperative
manner in project preparation. The selected implementing agencies were highly competent, and motivated
to carry out the project. The Borrower's performance is considered to be highly satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The decisions regarding project implementation were taken in an appropriate and timely manner. A
number of questions dealing with proposals for modifications and changes to the contracts, ideas for new
contracts, etc. were discussed and resolved efficiently at HC level. The Government privatized contractors
and carried out a useful reorganization of the road sector in 2001.
However, road maintenance funding was decreased in 1998 and 2000, and the project covenant that
major road works (more than US$5.0 million) be demonstrated to have a satisfactory ERR (more than
12%) was ignored for the motorway program. These were political decisions over which neither HC nor the
MMATC seemed to have any influence. Therefore, the Government's implementation performance would
have been judged unsatisfactorily were it not for the improvements which the new Government made
beginning in 2001. On balance, the Government's implementation performance is considered to be
satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
HC implemented the project in a satisfactory manner. There was only one minor shortcoming, slow
implementation of the PMS/BMS systems, which caused a half year extension of the project closing date.
The PIU accounts were audited periodically, and were considered satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
On balance, the overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
There are several lessons to be learned from this project:
(i) Strategy for addressing motorway issue. The Government initiated a major uneconomic motorway
program and reduced the road maintenance budget, a major potential waste of scarce resources. Decisions
were made at a high level in a non-transparent way, and implemented by MPW which was not directly
involved in the project. It is unlikely that the Bank could have influenced these actions directly, for
example by suspending disbursements due to the violation of the ERR covenant. The Bank instead
intensified its dialogue through sector work and discussion on a proposed Bank guarantee for the
Zagreb-Gorican Motorway. This more patient approach bore fruit when the newly elected Parliament
approved a more disciplined "Program for Construction and Maintenance of Public Roads for the years
2001-2004", funded largely from extra-budgetary sources. Major sector issues of this type require
continuous dialogue with the authorities over a long period (and a change of Government). Further work is
required. The next steps are planned for implementation under the proposed Rijeka Port and Highway
Project.
(ii) A commercialized/privatized construction industry leads to higher competition implying reduced costs.
- 11 -



Cost reduction is estimated to be at least 10%.
(iii) Modem management tools improve budgetary allocations. The establishment of PMS/BMS permits
identification/preparation of projects based on technical and economic criteria. However, PMS/BMS
results won't substitute for political decision making.
(iv) The Government and implementing Agencies should keep the following points in mind:
*   Economic evaluation provides a sound basis for decision making for both motorway construction
and rehabilitation/maintenance of the existing road network.
*   Further efforts may be required to rationalize the motorway program taking into account existing
contracts, e.g., semi-motorways, postponement, and/or staged improvements to existing roads on
the alignment of eventual motorways.
*   The 1998-1999 division of responsibilities between the Motorway for main roads and the MPW for
motorways complicated efforts to address the motorway and road maintenance issues and
coordinate the administration of the road sector. This was partly addressed by the recent decision
to make MMATC responsible for the overall planning of the road network.
* The Government needs to find ways to expedite land expropriation, which can delay the start of
works and is not under the control of the implementing agency.
(v) The EU accession plays an accelerating role in institutional reforms. In the road sub-sector, the
following key issues lend themselves for comprehensive cooperation:
*   Establishing an EU compatible system of Road User Charges, including heavy vehicle charges;
*   Improving traffic safety; and
*   Designing new pavements and strengthening existing pavements in accordance with the
EU standard axle-load (11.5 ton/axle).
(vi) A project design, where issues of several modes are being realistically addressed, provides for: (i) a
continuous sector-wide dialogue between the Bank and the Borrower, and (ii) good basis for follow-up
projects.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Borrower prepared the first draft of this report which is retained in the project file, and their comments
have been incorporated. Their main comments are as follows:
*   Project components corresponded well to actual needs with respect to transport reconstruction, as
well as for economic recovery of Croatia.
*   The efficiency of the HC is deemed to have been important for the project preparation and
implementation.
*   Local consultants and contractors provided competent, adequate and timely services.
*   The increased competition in the construction industry let to lower than expected prices, which in
turn allowed a higher than foreseen quantity of reconstruction to be carried out.
(b) Cofinanciers:
The EBRD prepared a completion report for their project on September 1, 1999 which is retained in the
project file. They rate this project performance and fulfillment of objectives as excellent as shown in their
summary table:

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
Economic re-evaluation was done by HC and the Civil Engineering Institute for both new construction, and
rehabilitation/betterment contracts. Construction costs were based on actual contract prices. Traffic
counts were taken from the 2000 traffic surveys carried out by HC, and traffic growth rates re-estimated
based on recent trends. Vehicle operating costs were estimated using the HC OPCOST Model which is
generally consistent with HDM3. Details are retained in the project file. Results are as follows:
*   new construction: At appraisal, the ERR for the three road construction contracts
(Ostravnica-Delnice; Solin-Klis; Split Bypass) were estimated to be 19%, 20% and 25%
respectively. At project completion the ERR for EBRD-financed Ostravnica-Delnice is estimated
to be 19.7%, close to the appraisal estimate. Since the Sloin-Kliss and Split Bypass sections were
financed by the Government's budget, the ERRs were not re-calculated.
*  rehabilitation/betterment: The ERR for rehabilitation/betterment contracts was at appraisal
estimated to be between 39% and 77%. At project completion, fourteen sample betterment
contracts were selected, and ERRs re-calculated. They are estimated to be between 34%, and
98%. This is higher due to the higher traffic levels and lower cost estimated at appraisal.
The weighted average ERR is estimated to be about 45%, slightly higher than the appraisal estimate of
40%.
