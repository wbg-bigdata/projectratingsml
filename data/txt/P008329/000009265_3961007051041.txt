CROATIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Croatia
Beneficiary:       Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications, and
Croatian Roads Authority (HC)
Amount:            US$80 Million equivalent
Terms:             17 years maturity including a grace period of 4 years at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate
Project Objectives:  The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the
modemization and transformation of the transport sector with special
emphasis on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).
In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment
program for the roads sector with the objective of reducing the
deterioration of the network and completing the construction of a few
well justified sections; (b) support the development of modem
management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d)
decrease road vehicle emissions; (e) maintain the present level of road
user charges; (f) support the restructuring of Croatian Railways (HZ)
leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the
elaboration of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port
of Rijeka.
Description:       (a) Policy and Institutions
The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement measures
to:
(i)    maintain the road vehicle fuel tax on at least its present level in
real terms;
(ii)   reduce the Governments's budgetary support to HZ;
(iii) design and implement a road traffic safety program;
(iv)  reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide
availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less than that
of leaded gasoline; and
(v)   continue the separation of civil works contractors from HC and



- 11 -
pursue further implementation of the Pavement Management
System (PMS).
(b) Investments
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of HC's road expenditure
program directed at repairing war damage, reducing the
deterioration of the network and making investments to complete
projects that accommodate changes in transport demand;
(ii)  technical assistance and studies for:
*     HZ restructuring
*     traffic safety
*     implementation of PMS
*     Rijeka port master plan
(iii)  training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road
maintenance techniques, including pavement and bridge
management systems.
Benefits:          The project will: (i) reduce vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduce future
costly reconstruction by increasing road maintenance; (iii) reduce road
accidents and vehicle emissions; (iv) reduce Government subsidies to
HZ; and (v) contribute to HZ restructuring and development of Rijeka
port.
Risks:             The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the
GOC would not have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budgets
to implement the project. Although serious tensions still exist in
Croatia and in the region, however, the situation is believed to be
sufficiently stable to begin an assistance program, with good chances of
success. The project has been limited to territories which are under the
Government's control, and even if hostilities should resume, it is
doubtful they would extend so far as to prevent project implementation.
In addition, the sector investment loan format, including annual reviews
of the Program, and the experience of the borrower, provide the
flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the Program
according to changing economic and political circumstances. Project
risks are considered to be acceptable given the exceptional conditions in
Croatia.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Background
1.1   After the war in late 1991, Croatia emerged with about one-third of its pre-war
territory outside its control, including about 25% of its agricultural land. These areas have
been designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) since January, 1992. Over the
last two years, after the war had ceased in Croatia, limited hostilities continued to take place
from time to time around these areas. However, the cease-fire of March 1994, reinforced by
the withdrawal of personnel and weapons, appears to be holding well. An agreement was
also reached (March 1994) between the republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina on a
federation within Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as a preliminary agreement on a confederal
arrangement between the two republics. The Government has persevered in its efforts at
economic reintegration within Croatia, and, with the assistance of international negotiators,
has succeeded in signing the second in a series of agreements to that end in December, 1994.
1.2   The war in Croatia severely disrupted the economy and cost thousands of lives, with
many more missing and wounded. Physical infrastructure and buildings suffered
considerable damage, estimated by the Govemment at about US$ 20 billion. For example,
virtually every major bridge along the Sava river was destroyed; houses, churches, schools
and hospitals were particularly hard hit; and looting and theft of machinery and equipment,
and the placing of land mines on agricultural land increased the level of destruction and
disruption. The war caused the displacement of some 350,000 people from within Croatia,
while more than 360,000 Bosnian refugees settled in Croatia. Although many families have
now retumed to their homes, the remaining displaced persons and refugees continue to
constitute a heavy financial burden for the Government.
1.3   Prior to the war, Croatia was, after Slovenia, the second richest republic of former
Yugoslavia with a per capita income of about US$3,350 equivalent. It enjoys a good
geographical location -- close to Italy and Hungary, a considerable potential for tourism
along the Adriatic coast, and a well-educated workforce. Croatia has a well-developed, open
economy, with manufacturing (electrical machinery, textiles, foodstuffs and chemicals)
accounting for about 30% of GDP, services for about 60%, and the total of imports and
exports for about 50% of GDP. The disruption of inter-republic trade resulting from the
break-up of former Yugoslavia, and the war impact on production and tourism activities
brought about a 25% drop in output, with per capita income falling to about US$2,500. The
most affected sectors were those which suffered either from the disruption of trade with
former Yugoslavia (e.g., shipbuilding, metalwork, and chemicals) or from the war-related
destruction and traffic disruption (tourism, construction, transportation). The decline in
production was accompanied by a significant reduction in the level of employment, by about
25 % over the whole period, and by the near-doubling of the unemployment rate, from about
9% at end-1990 to about 18% in early 1994. In addition, Croatia suffered from the loss of
all foreign exchange reserves that were kept by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and is not



- 2 -
expected to have ready access to foreign financing due to the outstanding dispute on the
allocation of part of former Yugoslavia's foreign debt.
1.4   In addition to the problems related to the war and the break-up of the former
Yugoslavia, Croatia also had to tackle simultaneously the problems of a transition economy.
Poorly run enterprises, which were formerly socially owned, accounted for the bulk of
industrial and agricultural output. Losses of the enterprise sector were some 7-8% of GDP
in 1993. Pressures on fiscal accounts, as well as the financing by the banking system of the
losses of the more inefficient public and formerly socially-owned enterprises, fuelled inflation
which reached an annual rate of over 1400% in 1993. Croatia has been addressing these
challenges courageously, in two distinct phases. During most of 1992 and 1993, it
endeavored to maintain its external competitiveness while trying to avoid falling into
hyperinflation. Building on initial success, the authorities launched a comprehensive
stabilization package in early October 1993 that has delivered impressive results so far.
After an initial surge due to the devaluation of the currency, inflation was curbed in one
month, and has remained slightly negative between November 1993 and June 1994 (minus
4% in cumulative) The negative real effects of the stabilization have been quite limited so
far: a moderate decline of industrial production in January-February 1994 was offset by
increases in April-May and GDP is projected to grown by 2-3% in 1994, after three
consecutive years of decline. The Croatian authorities are aware that, in spite of these early
successes, sustaining stabilization and resuming growth will now require more aggressive
measures in support of the systemic transformation of the economy, i.e., enterprise and bank
reform.
1.5   The Republic of Croatia became a member of the International Monetary Fund in
January and the World Bank in February 1993. It became a member of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in April, 1993. The Bank approved an
Emergency Reconstruction Project as its first operation in June 1994. The proposed project
provides an important input into the Government's reconstruction program, by assisting in
high priority reconstruction activities and institutional reforms in the transport sector which
are needed to restore the basic conditions for renewed economic growth. A loan in support
of the Government's enterprise and banking reform efforts is under preparation.
B. Transport System and Demand
1.6   Transport System: Croatia normally provides an important transport link between
Western and Southeastern Europe and on to the Middle East, but this has been disrupted by
the war. Croatia has three main transport corridors (see Map, IBRD No. 26152). The main
northwest-southeast corridor runs through the Sava river valley and is served by the Trans-
Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the main trunk railway, both of which are currently blocked
since sections lie within areas not accessible to the Government. A second corridor, also



-3-
served by main roads and the railway, links the main port of Rijeka and the Dalmatian Coast
with Zagreb and Hungary. This corridor has taken on increased importance due to the
blockage of parallel routes through Bosnia and the reorientation of central European traffic to
the West. The third corridor serves the 1,700 km Adriatic coast which is the center of
tourism.
1.7   The Croatian transport system, including what is now situated in the UNPAs
comprises: (a) a 27,000 km road network and around 700,000 domestic road vehicles
(discussed in Chapter II); (b) a 2,664 km railway network (described below); (c) the main
sea port of Rijeka, four secondary ports on the Adriatic, and numerous river ports on the 918
km of the Sava and Drava rivers which are navigable; (d) ocean-going vessels totaling 5.9
million dead-weight tons (dwt); (e) river boats, barges and tankers with a capacity of 90,000
dwt; and (f) seven international airports and an international airline.
1.8   Traffic: Croatia was more transport-intensive than Western Europe prior to
independence, although less so than other socialist countries in the region. Croatia generated
about 0.6 ton-kilometers (tkm) of freight transport per US$ of GDP in 1989, compared with
0.3 in France, 0.4 in West Germany, 0.5 in the Netherlands, 1.7 in Hungary and 2.1 in
Poland, at about the same time. Croatia, like other former socialist countries in the region,
is expected to become less transport intensive in the future, and to move an increasing
proportion of goods by road. This is because: (a) the manufactured goods and service
sectors, for which the speed and reliability offered by trucking is important, is likely to
grow; (b) competition from a deregulated trucking industry will increase; and (c) economic
activity will increasingly decentralize, which requires the door-to-door service which can
more easily be provided by road transport.
1.9   Recent traffic developments are as follows:

1.10   Freight traffic (measured in ton-kilometers, tkm) grew 3.6%  p.a. from  1960 to 1980,
and then declined slightly between 1980 and 1990 as Croatia began to restructure its
economy. Passenger traffic (measured in passenger-kilometers, pkm) grew by 5.4% p.a.
from 1960 to 1980, and then remained constant between 1980 and 1990. The rail share of
freight traffic, not including own-account or private road transport which are significant,
declined from 89% to 65%, and passenger traffic from 79% to 32%, between 1960 and



-5-
1990. Traffic fell sharply and transport patterns were reoriented as a result of the war,
which began in mid-1991. Road traffic has fallen about 40% and rail traffic by more than
70% from their pre-war levels in 1990. The main northwest-southeast corridor, served by
the TYH and main trunk line railway, are presently blocked. East-west transit traffic has
increased, and concentrated on the Zagreb-Rijeka road and rail line due to the destruction of
bridges and subsequent closure of parallel routes through Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
UNPAs. Many ports have been damaged and traffic has decreased by about 75 %. Air
traffic was disrupted by the closure of airports and the withdrawal of Yugoslav Airlines.
C. Croatian Railways
1.11   Croatian Railways (HZ), as an entity in its present form, was founded when Croatia
became independent in 1991. The 2,664 km railway network includes 248 km which are
double track, and 910 km which are electrified, including 784 km connected to the
25kV/50 hz system and 126 km to the 3kV/DC system. The major part of the network and
stations are connected to a signalling system which functions well. At present 40% of the
system is operating normally, a further 25% is damaged but in operation and the remaining
35% is in areas not currently accessible by the Government. The traction system includes
315 diesel and 147 electric locomotives (56% are 20 years old or less), and 35 electric and
79 diesel multiple units. Rolling stock includes 13,418 wagons (74% are 25 years old or
less) and 824 passenger cars (72% are 25 years old or less). As a result of war damage and
lack of spare parts only 60% of traction equipment and 30% of wagons are presently
available for operations.
1.12   Railway traffic is not likely to recover to pre-war levels, even if all lines are
reopened, due to the restructuring of the economy, the permanent diversion of some transit
traffic, and the probable decrease of mining and heavy industry activity. The Government
budget supported HZ with $130 million in operating subsidies and capital grants in 1993.
Even with this support, HZ incurred a net decapitalization of about $15 million. Projected
operating subsidies and capital grants for 1994 of US$154 million amount to 1.6% of
Croatia's GDP, a level of support which does not appear sustainable. HZ needs to be
radically downsized and restructured to reduce its losses and enable it to survive in a market
economy without major Government support.
1.13   Following participation in the Railway Roundtable sponsored by the Bank in 1991,
the GOC and HZ have become increasingly cognizant of the likely size of future deficits.
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMATC) and HZ have
taken some steps to address the railways' financial problems, including reducing railway staff
by 7,000 (25% of its staff), and reorganized its maintenance and manufacturing units into
separate enterprises. In 1993, the Government Office for Restructuring and Economics of
State-Owned Enterprises (GOR) was assigned responsibility for restructuring HZ in addition
to 9 other major state enterprises. In November 1993, GOR issued its report on HZ,
proposing that a restructuring should be undertaken in three phases:



-6-
Phase I      Preparation of new legal framework.
Phase II     Increase in equity, privatization of subsidiaries, reduction in
workforce and reconstruction of war damaged infrastructure.
Phase III    Transformation of HZ into a joint stock company eventually
privatized with infrastructure remaining under state ownership.
The first phase was implemented in July 1994 with the enactment of the law on Croatia
Railways. Phase II is scheduled to commence in 1994 and take 10 years, with phase III
commencing in the year 2000. No details are presently available on Phases II and III. As
an interim measure to reduce the current level of subsidies for HZ, the Bank has obtained
agreement with the Government during negotiations regarding the maximum level of
government subsidies to HZ (para. 3.9).
D. Organization, Investments and Transport Policy
1.14   Organization The Yugoslav economy, including the transport sector, was organized
as a self-management system until shortly before Croatia's independence. Under this system,
economic decision-making was achieved through a consensus of managers, workers, and the
social-political community, primarily through intra- and inter-firm agreements on long-range
cooperation (self-management agreements). These agreements were enforced through a
complex system of laws and social checks and balances. This resulted in a "soft budget
constraint", where firms did not have sufficient incentive to reduce costs, and did not invest
efficiently.
1.15   Croatia has made good progress on enterprise restructuring. Clear state ownership
has been established for most enterprises, workers' councils have been eliminated, and a well
designed privatization program has begun. However, implementation has been slowed
because the GOC has to do too much simultaneously, i.e. address territorial issues, care for
refugees, take on tasks previously done by the former Yugoslavia, and implement market
reforms. The GOC initiated a comprehensive privatization and restructuring program with
the 1991 Act on Transformation of Social Enterprises. This Act provides for the eventual
privatization of social enterprises, including giving 30% of their value to certain categories of
citizens, although it did not cover all economic activities (e.g. the important banking sector).
The project includes actions to reduce the GOC's financial support for the railways, and a
study to support their restructuring. (para. 1.13).
1.16   Investments Prior to independence, most transport investments were made by the
social sector. Their level varied considerably because of the need to complete the basic
transport network in the 1960s and 1970s, ex-Yugoslavia's relatively easy access to credit in
the 1970s and early 1980s, an economic slowdown in the late 1980s, and the disruptions
caused by the war since 1990. At present, the situation is being consolidated and a medium



- 7 -
term investment planning framework is emerging. This process is rather advanced in the
roads subsector; the Croatian Roads Authority (HC) has a three year investment plan
(para 3.4) which the present project supports. For the railways the situation is much less
clear because of the overall unclear and unsettled financial situation (para 1.11-13). For the
aviation and ports subsectors, the attention up till now has been on repairing the most urgent
war damages. For the major port, Rijeka, the project includes a component aimed at
proposing an administrative/managerial structure and developing a master plan for its
development (para. 3.10(a)).
1.17   War Damage: It is difficult to estimate the extent of war damage in the transport
sector because most damage is in inaccessible areas. The 1995-97 road expenditure program
allocates about US$30 million for direct war damage repair and replacement. In addition, an
important part of the pavement resurfacing and rehabilitation component, which is the biggest
one in the program, is attributable to the destruction caused by the war. HZ has already
made temporary repairs to the railway, and estimates that it will need to spend an additional
US$32 million to repair damage in accessible territories. MMATC estimates it needs to
spend US$20-30 million to replace the most urgently needed air traffic control equipment; it
is proposed that this be financed by the EBRD. The Bank has lent US$128 million for an
Emergency Reconstruction Project, including US$12 million for roads and US$10 million for
railways.
1.18   Sector Strategy: Taking financial constraints and the need for institutional reforms
into account, the GOC and Bank have discussed the following strategy for the transport
sector during the next several years: (a) repair damaged transport infrastructure over a period
of about five years, including repairing the most important tourist airports; (b) defer most
purchases of railway rolling stock, or vehicles for road transport enterprises owned by GOC,
until traffic levels recover; (c) reduce the road maintenance backlog; (d) be highly selective
with other road investments due to the recent decline in traffic and fiscal constraints; (e)
reduce the railway subsidy and restructure HZ to reduce its losses and increase its
commercial orientation; and (f) privatize truck operators and separate road maintenance
contractors from HC. MMATC and Ministry of Finance (MOF) have agreed in principal
with these recommendations. In addition, for the ports, primarily Rijeka, there is a strong
awareness that installations have to be made more efficient and that an overall development
concept has to be formulated.
E. Previous Bank Projects
1. 19 Although the Bank's dialogue with Croatia started in early 1992, it did not
immediately translate into lending operations. Initially, our restraint was due to the
continuing limited hostilities within Croatia; the Bank continued to be cautious during 1993
and early 1994 because of the situation in the neighboring Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The major breakthroughs of March 1994 allowed the Bank to adopt a more
active cooperation stance. On June 22, 1994, the Board approved the first loan to the



- 8 -
Republic of Croatia (Emergency Reconstruction Loan, 3760-HR). In addition to the
Emergency Reconstruction Project, the Bank has made 12 loans for transport to the former
Yugoslavia totalling US$711.5 million equivalent (Annex 1) which contained components
benefiting Croatia. These included eight loans to the highway subsector, three loans for the
railway subsector, and one loan for an pipeline project.
1.20   The main emphasis in highway lending to Yugoslavia was on improvements to key
links in the primary road network. The First and Second (Highway) Projects which financed
the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway; and improvement of roads
connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway with the Adriatic highway, were completed within
the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Completion Report for the Ninth
Highway Project indicated that it substantially achieved its objectives. The Completion
Report for the Eleventh Highway Project pointed out that it suffered delays in
implementation because of shortages of local funds due to a severe recession. The First and
Second Highway Sector Projects were based on a comprehensive sector lending approach,
including a deeper involvement in the important area of road maintenance. They proceeded
satisfactorily in Croatia. The former Yugoslavia and the Bank also prepared the Third
Highway Sector Project, including US$75.0 million for Croatia, which included follow-up
initiatives on road maintenance, financing and investment planning. This project was lapsed
prior to effectiveness following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
1.21   The Project Performance Audit Report for the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-
YU) noted that the project was successfully completed, albeit with some delays and local cost
overruns, that it was economically justified, and that it succeeded in making operational
improvements. This project, and its successors, also succeeded in introducing cost-benefit
analysis as the basis for investment selection. The railway projects were only partly
successful in improving railway financial performance because of an underlying difference
of view between the Government of the former Yugoslavia and the Bank about the function
of the railways (the Government of former Yugoslavia viewed the railways as serving
important non-commercial functions which required continued subsidization). The Bank also
prepared the Seventh Railway Project, including US$32.5 million for Croatia, which included
further initiatives in the areas of finance, coordination of investments, and the
computerization of rail operations. This project was also lapsed prior to effectiveness due to
the breakup of Yugoslavia. Project Completion Reports are under preparation for the First
and Second Highway Sector Projects as well as for the Sixth Railway Project.

II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. Road Network
2.1.  The Croatian public road network comprises about 26,732 km which are
administratively classified as main, regional or local roads (Table 2.1). Of these, 21,541 km
are paved and 5,191 km are gravel surfaced. The density of the road network is about 48
km per 100 square kilometers, compared to an average of about 77 km per 100 square
kilometers in Western Europe. Presently, about 5,600 km of roads are not under
Government control or accessible. Paved road standards vary from high quality four-lane
toll facilities with grade separated interchanges to narrow country lanes.  All classified roads
are administered by HC.

2.2.  The main road network carries around 75% of road traffic. The GOC desires to
rehabilitate and upgrade these roads to a level consistent with the network of countries in the
European Community. While the GOC would like to improve a number of roads, it gives
high priority to the Zagreb-Karlovac-Rijeka highway which is a part of the Trans-European
Highway network.

B. Traffic
2.3.  The road vehicle fleet grew at a rapid 10.1%  p.a. from  1972 to 1980, and a modest
2.6% p.a. during the 1980s, to 896,800 vehicles in 1990 (Annex 2. 1). The passenger car
fleet totaled 795,400 units in 1990, or 182 passengers cars per 1,000 persons which is a
higher motorization rate than most Eastern European countries, but lower than Western
Europe. The number of passenger cars has thereafter fallen by close to 20%. The average
traffic levels on main roads were about 4,500 vehicles per day (vpd) in 1990, but fell to
about 3000 vpd in 1993, ranging from 1,800 vpd to 15,800 vpd. HC estimates that there
were about 4,000 km of roads with traffic levels exceeding 3,000 vpd, and that the average
traffic level on regional roads was about 1,600 vpd, ranging from about 500 vpd to over
7,000 vpd. Road traffic has fallen overall by around 30% since the beginning of the war in
mid-1991 but with some roads, e.g. Zagreb-Rijeka showing substantial increases, and traffic
patterns are re-oriented (para. 1. 10). Traffic has considerably decreased on the Adriatic
Highway, especially on its section leading from Zadar to Sibenik, owing to the war
circumstances, while the traffic on the roads running toward Bosnia and Herzegovina relates
only to humanitarian aid activities. The roads running through the UNPAs are still closed to
traffic. Traffic is expected to eventually recover to pre-war levels, but only over a period of
several years in parallel with the expected economic recovery.
2.4.  HC carries out regular detailed origin-destination traffic surveys on main roads, and
monitors traffic volumes on main and regional roads at 238 locations with automatic and
manual traffic counts. These provide detailed information on annual and hourly fluctuations
in traffic volumes. In normal years, there is a significant seasonal traffic variation due to
tourism, with traffic flows on roads along the Adriatic Coast increasing from 4,000 vpd in
the winter to 12,000 vpd during the summer.
C. Road Transport Industry
2.5.  There were three types of trucking in the former Yugoslavia, which partly remain in
Croatia: social sector enterprises, own-account trucking (mostly social sector), and private
sector operators. Public social sector firms specialized in long distance and international
traffic, competing with the railways. Own-account and private operators until recently
specialized in local transport. Trucking is increasingly the major freight transport mode,
with the private sector showing strong growth.
2.6.  The road freight industry was heavily regulated until about 1989, through various
laws which limited the participation of the private sector (e.g. barriers to entry, prohibitions
against international transport, more favorable tax rates and customs duties for social sector
firms). These formal regulations were reinforced by various Government agencies and
associations and informal arrangements which served to divide the market, and by accounting
and managerial practices which permitted social sector firms to operate inefficiently and



- 11 -
sustain losses over the long term. However, the regulations were unevenly enforced, which
coupled with a relatively dynamic private sector, resulted in the private sector increasing its
share of the market (measured in tkm) from 13% in 1970 to 28% in 1988. The regulatory
framework also resulted in the inefficient growth of own account fleets, which accounted for
21% of the market at that time. Vehicle utilization was also inefficient, e.g., trucks were
estimated to average only 50,000 km in 1990:

Transport and Communications Bulletin
2.7.  The bus industry was organized in a similar way as trucking, and heavily regulated
prior to independence. Intercity buses carried 31.7 billion pkm in 1987 (about three times as
much as railways) with an average length of haul of 31 km (i.e., mostly suburban) at an 83%
load factor which is high. In 1990, 5,836 buses were registered, of which 2,477 participated
in public transportation. Private buses are now estimated to account for 10% of the fleet.
2.8. Internal trucking is now essentially deregulated, with vehicles only required to have
an annual technical inspection. International trucks and buses are subject to a system of
bilateral and multilateral permits which have been partially liberalized in recent years.
Croatia prohibits trucks or buses older than ten years to participate in international transport.
Intercity bus transport has been partly deregulated since independence, while urban bus
services remain regulated by the respective municipalities. Maximum intercity bus tariffs are
set by MMATC, which also limits the number of buses working in some intercity corridors.
2.9.  The main difficulties facing the road transport industry are: (a) implementing the
privatization program (para. 1.10); and (b) operators' lack of familiarity with operating as
commercial enterprises. Only one company (Casina-Trans, 2,000 employees) has been



- 12 -
privatized to date. Privatization is difficult because the GOC valued vehicles and other assets
at their replacement cost less depreciation, whereas their earning potential is much less at
present due to the decline in traffic. The question of road transport privatization will be
addressed through the Bank's work in support of enterprise reform and privatization.
D. Highway Administration
2. 10. HC was established in 1991 as the successor of the Self Managing Community of
Interest for Roads. It is in charge of planning, constructing and maintaining all public
interurban roads in Croatia. Since July 1, 1994 most of HC financing resources come from
the Government's centralized budget. HC is governed by a managing board of nine
members, of which six are appointed by the Government and three are selected by HC. HC
is headed by a manager and his deputies, all appointed by the Government. The
Maintenance Department is the largest of the three departments in which HC is organized.
The Department is responsible for road maintenance with the actual work carried out by 17
district offices covering the entire road network. The other two departments deal with
planning and engineering, and administrative functions. The organization of HC is shown in
Chart 1.
2. 11. The previous road organization carried out not only road maintenance but also road
construction, employing about 5,050 workers. HC is in the process of separating road
construction activities by establishing Government-owned construction companies with the
objective of eventually privatizing them. So far, four construction companies have been
established and the remaining one is expected to be established in the near future. As a
result, HC's manpower and equipment have been reduced. Presently, HC employs about
3,750 persons, of which some 3,250 are in the Maintenance Department. HC's headquarters
in Zagreb is staffed with about 500 persons, mainly engineers and technicians and has a
management role focusing on policy, budget and technical issues. Furthermore, HC is
implementing its budget as much as possible through contracting; all new construction works
are contracted as well as most of the highway resurfacing and rehabilitation, and about 30%
of the routine maintenance activities.
E. Planning and Engineering
2.12. HC is responsible for planning and programming of the road network. The
institutional framework and procedures are generally adequate for formulating rational and
efficient road development plans. HC currently prepares annual and multi-annual road
expenditure programs for submission to MMATC and MOF. Feasibility, environmental and
detailed studies for road works are commissioned from local highway institutes and
consulting firms. Most of these organizations are connected to the major universities. The
quality of these studies has improved over the years, most recently with the preparation of



- 13 -
new feasibility study guidelines in connection with the lapsed Third Highway Sector Project.
Environmental studies and engineering design standards (Annex 2.2) generally follow
European norms, and are adequate. GOC intends to harmonize its vehicle standards with the
European Union, and to adopt an 11.5 ton axle load limit. Work on drafting the necessary
regulations as well as defining the administrative and technical implications is underway in
MMATC.
2.13. Further improvement in the utilization of HC's planning tools in its decision making
process is needed, particularly given the emphasis on highway rehabilitation, resurfacing and
maintenance and current budgetary constraints. To improve cost effective maintenance
planning, HC requires a "systems" approach by means of which reliable data are collected
periodically and evaluations are performed using a decision-making scheme that, among other
factors, considers road performance, user costs and budget constraints. HC would be
assisted under the project to improve the utilization of the Pavement Management System
(PMS), as discussed below (Para 2.22).
F. Financing and Expenditures
2.14. HC has derived its revenues primarily from a sales tax on road fuel, as well as other
taxes and charges on road users. In 1992, HC revenues came from the fuel tax, vehicle
registration fees, tolls, foreign vehicle taxes and other sources. Most of these revenues were
earmarked for HC, but Parliament set the level of the fuel tax and other road taxes at the
same time it approved the annual road expenditure program. De facto, this was equivalent to
an annual budgeting process. On July 1, 1994, the earmarking of the fuel tax for HC was
abolished and substituted by direct budget allocations.
2.15. Vehicle fuel price levels and structures are:

RETAIL PRICE                   0.73       52      0.59        51
The amount of fuel tax collected from road users is about two times higher than what is
required for a reasonable road expenditure program and can thus be considered to cover the
economic cost of road use. Agreement has been reached that Government will maintain at
least this level in real terms (para. 5. 1(b)).
2.16. The present level of road expenditure is acceptable given the severe budgetary
constraints which the GOC now faces (paras. 1.2, 1.4). The 1995-97 Road Expenditure
Program (para. 3.4-9) that the project supports, foresees average annual expenditures of
about $200 million with a strong increase foreseen for maintenance related items. Given the
possibility of economic developments, which might influence the Program, its size and
composition will be adjusted annually, in consultation with the Bank, to adopt to changing
circumstances, as discussed below.
G. Construction
2.17. Building and construction are an important industry in Croatia. In 1992, the industry
employed 76,200 persons distributed in about 1970 companies. Recently, the number of
newly established small private businesses has increased significantly due to the privatization
process. The output capacity of the industry is estimated at about US$3,000 million per
year, of which some 10% is taken by the highway sector. However, the industry is only
working at about 60% of its installed capacity because of the serious economic and financial
burdens resulting from the war and the transforming of the economy.
2.18. Road construction, reconstruction and improvement is normally executed by means of
unit-price contracts. In the past, under contracts financed by the Bank under international
competitive bidding (ICB), no foreign contractors have been successful in presenting the



- 15 -
lowest responsive bid except in one case. This is due to the very competitive prices of the
local contractors. With the emphasis on rehabilitation and strengthening programs, and with
the intention of encouraging the smaller local contractors, local competitive bidding (LCB)
was introduced as an acceptable procurement procedure under the Second Highway Sector
Project, and will be continued under the proposed project. The quality of the construction
work, though generally good, could certainly be improved through more demanding
construction supervision and the use of more advanced equipment in some enterprises which
are presently equipped with worn-out mechanical plants.
H. Maintenance
2.19. HC's technical road maintenance' capability is considerable but the physical condition
of the road system is deteriorating and the backlog of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing
(HRR) is increasing, because of the lack of adequate funding, and more recently the
significant destruction and damage caused by the war. To improve planning of HRR and
routine maintenance, HC is stepping up the implementation of its Pavement Management
System (PMS). The proposed project, by supporting the 1995-97 Road Expenditure Program
(para. 3.4-9) and further developing and implementing the PMS (para. 2.22), would support
the Government effort of preserving the condition of the road system.
2.20. The condition of the road network and therefore the maintenance and rehabilitation
requirements can at present only be roughly estimated. In order to get an overview of the
situation and as part of the development of the PMS, HC conducted, in the spring of 1994, a
visual road condition survey on the major and regional roads. Local roads were not
surveyed but their condition is probably no better than that of regional roads. According to
the survey, 27% of the network is in poor condition, about 39% in fair condition, and 34%
in good condition. This distribution does not however take into account the importance of
the roads as measured by traffic density. Doing so would probably improve the estimate of
the road network condition.
2.21. Under some assumptions it can be estimated that about 2,600 km require
rehabilitation works and that some 3,000 km are affected by the accumulated backlog of
deferred resurfacing. It is thus likely that the maintenance problem is a serious one. If the
orders of magnitude indicated above prove to be correct, the maintenance problem will not
be resolved with the proposed project. There is even the possibility that the condition of the
network will continue to deteriorate. To remedy the situation will thus require sustained
efforts over a longer time than what one Bank project covers. However, to get a reliable
)&/    The term maintenance includes regular routine, periodic and winter maintenance,
including pavement strengthening, and rehabilitation.



- 16 -
assessment of the situation and an efficient planning tool, it is of central importance that the
development of the PMS be accorded high priority.
2.22. To improve efficiency of HRR and routine maintenance operations and preparation of
the budget, HC has agreed that cost-effective maintenance planning requires a PMS approach
by means of which reliable data are collected periodically and evaluations are performed
using a decision-making scheme that, among other factors considers road performance, user
cost and budget constraints. In this respect a series of actions is needed to continue the
development and implementation of PMS in Croatia (Annex 3.3). During negotiations HC
confirmed that PMS would be fully operational by 1997 and that starting 1998 the budget for
HRR and routine maintenance would be prepared and monitored through the systematic use
of PMS (para. 5. 1(m)).
2.23. The Govemment has taken several initiatives in recent years to improve maintenance.
HC is being reorganized, and only routine road maintenance operations will be carried out by
force account. HC also commissioned a pilot maintenance study which was completed by the
Construction Institute in 1989. The Study had two main findings: (a) the current method of
rating pavement condition was inconsistent and technically inadequate for use in a PMS; and
(b) the road rehabilitation backlog was substantial and growing. Using HDM III, the study
demonstrated the advantages of using economic analysis to plan periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation, and concluded that such works typically yield economic rates of return (ERRs)
in excess of 50%. Based on these findings, HC decided to proceed with the full-scale
implementation of a PMS in Croatia. Technical assistance would be provided under the
project to assist HC with its reorganization, including separating civil works contractors, and
in further implementing the PMS. HC agreed at negotiations to carry out an action plan
covering the reorganization and improvement of its maintenance operations, including the
separation of civil works contractors (para. 5. 1(c)).
I. Human Resources
2.24. The education, capability and experience of HC staff is high, although motivation
appears to have declined due to low salary levels resulting from inflation. HC staff is highly
qualified and experienced, with technical diplomas required for road foremen and engineering
degrees for higher level staff. At the regional and local level, training sessions take place on
the organization and techniques of road maintenance. The primary training needs, which
would be assisted under the project, are those relating to adopting computer-based systems,
modem management practices, and the latest highway maintenance techniques.

J. Traffic Safety
2.25. Road traffic accidents have become a serious problem in recent years. In 1991, there
were 14,471 accidents, injuring 19,791 persons and causing 1,020 deaths. The number of
fatalities is three to six times higher than in Western European countries:
Table 2.4: Traffic Accidents and Fatalities in 1991

Italy                  453                     12.9                   28.5
Germany                506                     13.4                   26.5
Great Britain          422                     9.2                    21.7
2.26. The government views the high accident rate with deep concern, and has taken steps
to reduce the number of accidents. These include road improvements, as well as signalling
and marking, construction of bypasses around towns and villages, more rigorous vehicle
inspection, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, improving driver education, and public
awareness campaigns. Croatian traffic safety laws are in line with international standards.
Presently, traffic safety is under the responsibility of four Ministries (MMATC, Internal
Affairs, Education and Health) and the Croatia Committee for Traffic Safety. The GOC
recognizes that more needs to be done to reduce the accident rate.
2.27. There is a large number of administrative entities involved in road safety in Croatia
today and a significant amount of road safety work is already being undertaken. A National
Road Safety Council exists and it has elaborated a road safety plan. This is a reasonable
plan which provides a sound basis for improvement of the traffic safety situation. There are,
however, elements in the plan which need further review and/or elaboration and the project
therefore includes technical assistance for such a review (Annex 3.7). During negotiations
agreements were reached that the proposed traffic safety review be carried out and that
consultations with the Bank be held before December 31, 1995 about the implementation of
the study recommendations (para. 5.1(d)).

m. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.1. The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the modernization and
transformation of the transport sector with special emphasis on the main road network and
HC. In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment program for the roads
sector with the objective of addressing the road maintenance situation and completing the
construction of a few well justified sections; (b) support the development of modem
management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d) decrease road vehicle
emissions; (e) maintain or increase the present level of road user charges; (f) support the
restructuring of HZ leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the elaboration
of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port of Rijeka. To achieve these
objectives, GOC and HC will develop and implement policies covering:
(i)    maintenance of fuel taxes and charges at least at their present levels in
real terms (para. 2.15);
(ii)  reduction of Government's budgetary support to HZ (para.1.11-13 and
3.9);
(iii) design and implementation of a road traffic safety program (para.
2.27);
(iv)  reduction of lead content in vehicle emissions and availability of
unleaded fuel (para. 3.32); and
(v)   HC action plan, including continued separation of civil works
contractors and further implementation of the PMS (paras. 2.22, 2.23).
B. Project Description
3.2.  The project components are summarized below and described in more detail in the
following paragraphs.
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of Croatia's HC road expenditure
program directed at repairing war damage, increasing HRR and routine
maintenance and completing projects that accommodate changes in
transport demand;



- 19 -
(ii)   a total of 110 mm of TA and studies distributed as follows:
*     HZ restructuring study, 30 mm
*     traffic safety, 20 mm
*     implementation of PMS, 30 mm
*     port study, 30 mm
(iii)  training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road maintenance
techniques, including pavement and bridge management systems.
The Road Expenditure Program
3.3.  The aggregate three-year (1995-1997) Road Expenditure Program of Croatia (the
Program) is estimated to cost $566 million including contingencies and administration but
excluding the debt service. Including the debt service, the total figure amounts to US$638
million. The Program is summarized in Table 3.1 below, with the details shown in Annex
3. 1. The Program, as well as necessary budgetary resources for its execution, were agreed
on during negotiations (para. 5.1(h)).

3.4.  The 1995-97 Program has been drawn up in consultation with the Bank, and is a
reasonable basis for the project. It represents a sizeable increase in HC's budget, being on
average about 40% higher per year for the 1995-97 period than for the 1991-94 period. The
balance of the program and its structure are reasonable and prudent as shown in the
distribution given below. The program indicates a substantial shift toward HRR and highway
maintenance as ongoing commitments for new construction will be completed. Maintenance
expenditures will increase by close to 90% per year for the program period as compared to
the previous four years.

3.5.  Provided economic viability is confirmed, the Bank could support any construction,
betterment or HRR component included in the Program. HC has tentatively identified the
components for Bank and other foreign financing, as shown in Annex 3.1. Components and
levels of expenditure for 1996 and 1997 are tentative at this stage. The program will be
reviewed annually with the Bank. This provides the flexibility to adjust: (a) the volume of
expenditures annually according to economic circumstances; and (b) the composition of the
Program if priorities change, e.g. if the issue of occupied territories is resolved. During
negotiations, the GOC provided assurances that not later than October 15 of each year, it
would furnish to the Bank a report on the progress achieved in carrying out the Road
Expenditure and Financing Program and proposed revisions to the Program for the period
through 1997; afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposal; and
thereafter introduce any revisions so that the Program is satisfactory to the Bank (para.
5.1(f)). Also, during negotiations, the GOC agreed: (a) to carry out feasibility studies of
roadwork investments proposed to be included in the Road Expenditure Program in
accordance with methods of economic analysis satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 3.2); and (b)
to undertake road expenditures greater than $5.0 million during 1995-97 only if their
estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is greater than 12 % (para. 5. 1(g)).
3.6.  The Program includes $152 million, about 24% of the Program, for the capacity
investments category. Practically all of this is allocated to complete projects which have
been delayed due to the lack of funds. This category decreases rapidly with less than 20%



- 21 -
left for 1997. There are four items in this category. The first item is the completion of
construction of trunk roads including about US$71.6 million for the Ostravica-Delnice section
of the Zagreb-Rijeka road, where traffic has concentrated due to the closure of other roads
through Bosnia and Herzegovina and the territories. It is now the only road available from
the capital Zagreb to the port of Rijeka, and with one alternative over part of its length, the
only road between the main part of Croatia and Dalmatia. Two other major ongoing projects
are the Split by-pass and the Solin-Klis road, with an estimated total completion cost of about
US$40 million. The other items consist of the completion of ongoing minor projects, the
repair of war damages and a betterment and black-spot program. This is a modest
investment program given the changes in transport demand which need to be accommodated,
but is appropriate under the severe budgetary constraints which Croatia now faces. It is
envisaged that the proposed Bank loan would help finance the highway equipment (for
signalling, tunnel ventilation and other miscellaneous equipment) for the three mentioned
major ongoing projects as well as a contract to construct one km of highway and the
pavement of the 9 km of the Solin-Klis road. Also, it is envisaged that EBRD would
partially finance the completion of works of the Ostrovica-Delnice road as well as the
betterment program.
3.7.  The maintenance and war repair category accounts for 49% of the Program or
US$310 million. The routine maintenance allocation is adequate. HRR accounts for an
important share of this category, US$173 million or about 55%. However, the HRR
allocation is insufficient to remove the backlog of maintenance in the short run. If the
preliminary estimates referred to (paras. 2.20-21) are correct, the backlog of deferred
maintenance might be around $270 million, requiring about $55 million a year over a five-
year period to be eliminated. As the foreseen maintenance expenditures roughly correspond
to the estimated requirements, there would not be sufficient funds to reduce the backlog and
hence a higher HC budget might be warranted. However, taking into account: (a) the
uncertainty of present estimates of maintenance needs and backlog; and (b) the very
substantial increase in HC's budget, particularly for maintenance, that the Program provides
for, the planned maintenance expenditures are considered reasonable. The Loan would
finance a portion of the HRR program. The project also supports the completion of
implementation of the PMS which would be operational by 1997 and should provide the basis
for making better HRR and maintenance decisions. It is envisaged that starting 1998 the
annual HRR and maintenance program will be prepared on the basis of a Pavement
Management System, supported under the project. In the meantime, the selection of
individual road sections to be included under the program would be made using a simple
system based on reported road conditions and traffic as well as local cost and remedial
measures obtained from engineering experience (Annex 3.3). During negotiations the GOC
confirmed that the above maintenance and HRR program will be carried out and that HC will
make PMS operational by 1997 and that the 1998 budget for HRR and maintenance will be
prepared and monitored through the systematic use of PMS (para. 5.1(m)).



- 22 -
3.8.  HC administrative costs including salaries of headquarters personnel, consultants for
technical services and purchasing of highway maintenance equipment and parts are about
10% of the program. The 10% share of these items in the program is considered a normal
and adequate level of expenditures. These costs include expenditures of about US$6 million
for equipment, technical assistance and training required for the installation of the PMS
supported by the project (Annex 3.3). They also include about US$20.7 million for
acquisition of highway maintenance equipment of which some US$11.7 million equivalent is
provided under the Emergency Reconstruction Project (Report No P6360-HR) and a portion
of the remaining US$9 million would be financed by the proposed Loan. Annex 3.4 presents
a tentative list of equipment to be financed under the proposed project.
Croatian Railways
3.9.  As described in Chapter 1 (paras. 1.11-13), the financial situation of HZ is
unsustainable. Therefore, during negotiations the Bank reached agreement with Government
about the maximum level of subsidies to HZ not to surpass:
a)    1995 - US$105.0 million plus debt service
b)    1996 - US$ 90.0 million plus debt service
c)    1997 - US$ 75.0 million plus debt service
As the Government is meeting the debt service on HZ loans, any additional borrowing by
HZ will, for the purposes of this agreement, be counted as part of Government subsidy. In
addition, HZ will be required to maintain the level of payables, in real terms, including debts
to the social welfare fund and suppliers, at not greater than the level of June 30, 1994
(para. 5.1(a)). Based on projected debt service levels the annual cost to Government for
support to HZ would be as follows:
a)    1995  - US$150.0 million
b)    1996  - US$120.0 million
c)    1997  - US$ 90.0 million
To achieve these targets while ensuring that HZ will have sufficient cash flow to meet
operating needs will require a major effort on the part of the Government and HZ. The
Government will have to authorize reduction in current service levels in line with the reduced
demand, increase tariffs etc., and HZ will have to improve efficiency. To assist in
developing an appropriate short-term strategy for the purpose, the Bank proposes to provide
financing under the proposed loan for technical assistance as outlined in the draft terms of
reference in Annex 3.6.
Studies for the Rijeka Port and Road Safety
3. 10. The project also provides for two additional studies:



- 23 -
(a)   The Rijeka Port Study would draw up a master plan and associated investment
plan and would propose an administrative/managerial structure for the port
including its relationships to the national and local governments as well as to
the private sector. The study would be based on the work already carried out
by French consultants. The Terms of Reference, a draft of which is included
in Annex 3.5, were agreed upon before negotiations. The cost of this study is
estimated at about US$600,000.
(b)   Road Safety. Although the Croatian services related to road safety are
relatively well organized there are some elements of the system, not
immediately obvious, which are restricting the effectiveness of the current
arrangements. To identify those elements and outline potential remedial
measures a review of an existing road safety plan (para. 2.27) Local
Competitive Bidding would be carried out under the project. This, plus
possible follow-up TA, would have an estimated cost of about US$400,000.
Draft Terms of Reference are in Annex 3.7.
C. Project Cost
3. 11. The total project cost is estimated at about US$568 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$238 million, based on 1994 prices and including physical and
price contingencies (Annex 3.8). Identifiable taxes and duties are about US$85 million and
the total project cost, net of taxes, is US$483 million equivalent. The cost estimates for the
civil works under the Road Expenditure Program are based upon reported local costs and
engineering experience, and are similar to those obtained in recent contracts. The costs of
equipment and technical assistance are estimated on the basis of recent experience.
D. Project Financing Plan
3.12. The Borrower will be the Republic of Croatia. The proposed loan of $80 million
equivalent would finance 34% of the foreign exchange cost or about 14% of the total cost of
the project. Another 8% of project cost, or about US$47.5 million equivalent, is expected to
be financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The
remaining US$441 million equivalent would be financed by the Government. This would
necessitate HC budgets of about US$190 million p.a. excluding the debt service.
3.13. In accordance with the above, the Project cost and financing plan is as follows:

Total Financing                330.11        237.70        567.81
Retroactive Financing: A maximum amount of US$8.0 million (10% of the loan amount)
would be eligible for retroactive financing of expenditures incurred after December 31, 1994.
The reasons for including retroactive financing in the project are: (a) the project covers three
construction seasons, the first being 1995 and unless procurement is undertaken early 1995,
thus could delay the start-up of the project; and (b) the project is cofinanced by EBRD and
an important consideration has been to keep the implementation schedules of both IBRD and
EBRD more or less parallel, since both institutions are financing different parts of the
Ostravica-Delnice road.

E. Status of Project Preparation
3.14. All necessary studies for construction of the Ostravica-Delnice section of the
Karlovac-Rijeka highway, for the Split by-pass, and for the Solin-Klis road are completed.
Feasibility studies for the betterment of 235 km and pavement strengthening of about 1,000
km are done based on HDM III. However, given the fact that Croatian conditions are not
always suitable for HDM III, a simpler model for analysis of HRR is proposed in Annex 3.3
while Annex 3.9 shows the grouping of HRR works for 1995. Supervision of construction
would be carried out by HC professional engineers assisted by consultants as needed.
HC has completed detailed engineering and draft bidding documents for items related to the
trunk highways included in the 1995 Program.
F. Implementation and Monitoring
3.15. Specific sub-projects will be prepared on a continuous basis in time for inclusion in
the annual programs. Preliminary updated investment and financing plans would be made
available to the Bank, so that the Program for the following year can be firmed up by the
end of October of each year during project implementation. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that prior to bidding the Borrower will submit and agree with the Bank on the
following year's program and adhere to the criteria of project selection (paras. 3.6 and
5. 1 (f)).
3.16. HC will be responsible for execution and management of the project, except for the
technical assistance to the railways, for road safety as well as the port study which would be
the responsibility of MMATC. The Implementation Schedule for project activities is shown
in Annex 3. 11. The project is expected to start in the first quarter of 1995 and to be
completed by June 2000. The Implementation Schedule would be updated during the annual
review. HC will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on project implementation.
Monitoring indicators for project activities are given in Annex 3. 10. The above
arrangements were agreed during negotiations (para. 5.1(j)).
G. Project Procurement Arrangements
3.17. Procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. To the extent practicable, items to be procured under the project
will be grouped into major packages to encourage competitive bidding, permit bulk
procurement, and to ensure standardization. Under the project, the proposed methods of
procurement would include International Competitive Bidding (ICB); Limited International
Bidding (LIB); Local Competitive Bidding (LCB); and Direct Contracting (DC). The
proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3.



- 26 -
3.18. International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Procurement packages for civil works
exceeding the equivalent of US$2 million per contract would be procured through ICB except
if a bidding group contains a road section, the cost of which is estimated to exceed US$1
million, in which case that group would be bid under ICB procedures, even if the estimated
cost of the group is less than US$2 million. It is estimated that the equivalent of at least
US$10.3 million for at least 2 ICB packages would finance civil works.' All ICB packages
for civil works will be prequalified. Procurement packages for goods and materials
exceeding the equivalent of US$300,000 per package, US$24.99 million for 8 packages,
would also be procured through ICB. In the case of procurement of goods through ICB,
eligible domestic firms would be provided a preference margin equal to 15% or the
prevailing duty, whichever is lower, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
3.19. Limited International Bidding (LIB). Equipment for bridge maintenance, traffic
counting, weighing scales and road monitoring as well as the services for monitoring
pavement behavior, which are of very specialized nature and are supplied by a limited
number of suppliers, will be procured following LIB procedures in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. It is estimated that the above mentioned equipment and services will be
procured in approximately 5 LIB packages at an aggregate cost of about US$2.0 million.
3.20. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). Civil works for HRR are dispersed, are of small
value (the equivalent of less that US$2 million per contract), and in which foreign bidders
are unlikely to be interested because of their limited sizes and often remote locations and
because of the existence in Croatia of competitive and strong civil works contractors, would
be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures. It is expected that the
loan proceeds would be used to finance about 30 LCB contracts, ranging from US$ 1 million
to US$ 2 million at a total estimated cost of US$67 million equivalent. To facilitate contract
administration, the Bank would only finance civil works contracts with a cost greater than
US$1.0 million.
3.21. Direct Contracting. Spare parts for existing research equipment which the Bank
agrees can be procured only from the original suppliers would be procured through direct
contracting at an estimated cost of US$35,000.
3.22. Procurement Review and Use of Standard Bidding Documents. The Bank would
conduct a prior review of procurement documentation, including prequalification of
contractors, for all ICB packages in accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the
Bank's Guidelines. Prior approval will also be sought for the use of the LIB procurement
method. The Bank would also conduct prior review of bid documents for all LCB contracts.
The use of Bank's Bidding Documents for Goods and Civil Works (ICB) is mandatory, and it

is recommended for Civil Works (LCB) to facilitate preparation and review. These
documents were made available to the Borrower during negotiations. The project includes
technical assistance and training at an estimated total cost of US$3.20 equivalent. The
selection and employment of consultants would be done in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, dated August 1981. All documents related to
procurement of consulting services would be subject to prior review and approval by the
Bank. A public procurement law in Croatia is under preparation. Therefore, a Country
Procurement Assessment would be scheduled only after the law has become operational and
its implementation is well underway. However, preparation of a Country Procurement
Strategy is planned for the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, for the procurement to be
financed with its own resources, the Borrower will follow procedures consistent with the
Bank's Guidelines. The Project Implementation Plan includes the schedule of major
procurement steps (Annex 3. 11).
3.23. Implementation arrangements. HC will be responsible for procurement under the
project. It has acquired substantial experience in procurement of works, goods and services
through previous experience with Bank projects in former Yugoslavia. It is familiar with
ICB, LIB, LCB and Direct Contracting.
3.24. Procurement information provided to the Bank would include: (a) prompt reporting
of contract award information; and (b) comprehensive explanation of revised cost estimates
for individual contracts and the total project, revised timing of procurement actions, and
compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government on all procurement arrangements
(para. 5.1 (k)).

H. Disbursements
3.25. The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as
follows:
(a)   Civil Works: 60 % of expenditures for new construction, road betterment and
pavement strengthening;
(b)   Goods: 100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory
cost) and 60% of expenditures for other items procured locally; and
(c)   Training and Technical Assistance: 100% of expenditure excluding taxes.
3.26. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for eligible
expenditures under civil works and equipment supply contracts valued at $1.5 million and
$300,000 equivalent or less respectively. Supporting documentation would be retained by the
borrower and made available for the required audit as well as for Bank supervision missions.
The annual audits of project accounts would include a separate opinion on the disbursements
made under the SOE procedure. All other disbursements would be made against full
documentation submitted to the Bank.
3.27. To facilitate disbursements, the Bank's share of the project would be financed through
a Special Account (revolving fund) which would be opened by the Borrower in a bank
acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account would be $5.0
million, equivalent to about four months of the Bank's share of estimated project
expenditures during the four-and-one-half year disbursement period for the project. Funds
for goods would be withdrawn by the Borrower from the Special Account after approval of
the ICB or international shopping procedures and related contract awards by the Bank.
Replenishment for technical assistance and for consultants services would be made on the
basis of appropriate documentation. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow
Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review and
approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
3.28. The disbursement forecast, based on the Project Implementation Schedule, is given in
Annex 3.12. Croatia being a new IBRD member country, there are no disbursement profiles
available. Croatia was a republic of the former Yugoslavia and therefore, the disbursement
forecast is based on the disbursement profile for transportation projects in the former
Yugoslavia. The project is expected to be presented to the Bank's Board of Directors in the
first quarter of 1995, and to be completed by June 2000, and to be fully disbursed six
months later or by December 2000.



- 30 -
I. Accounting and Auditing
3.29. HC maintains a satisfactory accrual accounting system. The annual accounts,
including the SOEs as well as the special account would be audited each year by auditor(s)
acceptable to the Bank. The accounts and the auditor's report thereon would be received in
the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The arrangements for accounting
and auditing were agreed at negotiations (para. 5.1(j)).
J. Environmental Considerations
3.30. Croatia introduced Environmental Assessment requirements for Highways and High
Speed Roads in 1984 and this formed the basis for granting of location and building permits
in the Highway Sector. More recently, Croatia has passed laws requiring detailed environ-
mental impact assessments for any new highway constructions. The assessment must address:
(i) land acquisition and resettlement issues (ii) protection of air, land and water resources,
historical and cultural monuments (iii) mitigation of noise pollution (iv) management and
disposal of construction waste.
3.31. The new construction components, i.e. the Ostravica-Delnice section, the Solin-Klis
road and the Split Bypass involve major new highway construction. They have therefore
been categorized as "A" projects warranting full environmental impact assessments. Major
environmental issues anticipated in these locations include water pollution due to carriageway
runoff, land acquisition and resettlement, protection of historical monuments and noise pol-
lution due to proximity to urban areas. Environmental Impact Assessments have been pre-
pared by HC for these components. They have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory in the analysis of the environmental issues and in the recommended measures to
mitigate the impact. The recommendations have been taken into account in the design and
construction of these works. Summaries of the Environmental Impact Studies have been
distributed to the Board.
3.32. In regards to air pollution due to traffic, Croatia is in the process of preparing legisla-
tion on regulating air pollution, specially targeting traffic pollution. The legislation is expect-
ed to be passed during 1994. The state owned oil company (INA) is committed in bringing
down lead and sulfur contents its gasoline. INA expects lead levels in gasoline to be reduced
to 0.15% by weight within the next two years. All new stations commissioned sell unleaded
gasoline and leaded gasoline will be phased out. However, the extent of Government
commitment to fulfill the above mentioned objectives needs clarification. Nevertheless, the
Government has taken steps in reducing the use of leaded gasoline by taxing leaded gasoline
more than unleaded. During negotiations, the GOC agreed to cause: (a) the lead contents to
be reduced to at least 0.4% by weight by not later than June 30, 1996; and (b) unleaded
gasoline to continue to be widely available at a price equal to or less than leaded gasoline
(para. 5.1 (1)). The transport of hazardous waste is strictly controlled by government law,
which is in compliance with the European Agreement on Transport of Hazardous Waste
(1982).

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.1.  The transport sector has an important contribution to make to Croatia's economic
recovery, including improving road maintenance, repairing war damage and accommodating
changes in transport demand associated with the war, the reorientation of trade and the
restructuring of the economy, and reducing the severe financial losses of the railway. As
described in Chapter III, the HC 1995-97 expenditure program is a reasonable basis for
meeting the above objectives given the present financial circumstances. The program gives
increasing emphasis to routine and periodic maintenance and to the reduction of accident
black spots. It is very modest with respect to new construction, basically only completing
projects which have been under construction for a long time and which should be opened to
traffic as soon as possible. It is reasonable to assume that the implementation of the
measures foreseen in the HC expenditure program are necessary, but not sufficient conditions
for economic growth to take place. This makes it difficult to quantify the full benefits of the
project. Project benefits were quantified on the basis of road user cost savings only, which
probably understate the contribution of the project to the economic recovery.
B. New Construction
4.2.  Of the four main items under this heading, the project will finance three items as
described below. The fourth item consists of minor ongoing projects, the repair of war
damages and a betterment and black spot program. The three project financed items account
for 75% of total investments for new construction and are evaluated below. For the
remaining expenditures included in the program the project includes provisions to: (a) carry
out feasibility studies of road work investments proposed to be included in the Road
Expenditure Program in accordance with methods of economic analysis satisfactory to the
Bank; and (b) to undertake road expenditures greater than $5.0 million during 1995-97 only
if their estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is greater than 12% (para. 5.1(g)).
4.3.  Ostravica-Delnice: Traffic grew by almost 7% p.a. between 1983 and 1990. The
war led to a significant decrease in 1991 but traffic grew very rapidly thereafter; the 1990 to
1993 growth rate was practically the same as for the preceding years. For the future, an
increase of 4% p.a. has been assumed. The ERR has been estimated, using conventional
road user cost methods approved by the Bank, at 19% on a sunk cost basis. About 50% of
the investments have already been done. Construction started in 1990 and has been delayed
because of the war and the ensuing difficult financial situation.
4.4.  Solin-Klis and Split By-pass: Both of these components represent basic elements of
the development strategy for the Split urban region. These projects have a background
similar to Ostravica-Delnice with respect to long construction times and delays. On a sunk
cost basis, their ERR's are 20% and 25% respectively.



- 32 -
C. Rehabilitation and Pavement Strengthening
4.5.  The ERR for betterment works costing more than $3 million equivalent, and
representative pavement strengthening works, were estimated using HDM III. The 'without
case assumes that only routine maintenance will be performed as in the past, and the model
estimates that the international roughness index (IRI) will deteriorate to 11.0 m/km in about
eight years, following which drivers would be forced to accept very high vehicle operating
costs or the road would have to be reconstructed at high cost. The "with" case assumes the
improved road would be resealed after five years and rehabilitated again when the IRI had
deteriorated to 7.0 m/km. HC and the Croatian Road Institute evaluated ten road sections,
considering ten different betterment strategies. Of these, 68 km are proposed for
rehabilitation, with the estimated ERRs ranging from 34% to 136%. HC similarly evaluated
1000 km of primary roads for pavement strengthening, with the ERRs estimated to range
between 39% and 77%. These roads are considered to be representative of their respective
expenditure categories under the Program.
D. Conclusion and Risks
4.6.  The weighted average ERR, based on the above estimates, for items which cover
almost 90% of the Program, is estimated to be above 40%. This very high ERR reflects the
typical high returns of betterment and strengthening of existing roads and the high share of
these categories in the Program, about 60%.
4.7.  The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the GOC would not
have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budget to implement the project. It has to be
recognized that serious tensions still exist within Croatia and in the region, which could lead
to situations that would derail our assistance. However, several reasons lead us to believe
that Croatia's situation is now stable enough to begin an assistance program, with good
chances of success. First, the Croatian authorities have shown prudence with respect to both
the difficult territorial situation within Croatia and the threatening proximity of outbreaks of
hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and second, departure from this prudent stance would
have a high cost for the Government in terms of suspension of assistance and jeopardizing
the initial successes towards stabilization and recovery. The project has been limited to
territories which are under GOC's control, and even if hostilities should resume, it is
doubtful they would extend so far as to prevent project implementation. In addition, the
sector investment loan format, including annual reviews of the Program, and the experience
of the borrower, provide the flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the
Program according to changing economic circumstances. Project risks are considered to be
acceptable given the exceptional conditions in Croatia.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
CROATIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
Previous Projects
1.          The Bank has lent US$711.5 million to ex-Yugoslavia for projects which
benefited Croatia in the transport sector, including US$389.5 million for eight road projects,
US$273 million for three railway projects, and US$49 million for an oil pipeline project.
Highway Projects
2.          The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU), US$35 million) in 1963 financed
the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway (422 km) and parts of the
Belgrade-Nis road (174 km). The Second Highway Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million),
financed in 1967, was for the improvement of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-
Belgrade highway via Sarajevo and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were
completed within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third Highway
Project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, comprised about 120 km of roads
in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974 with a 20-month
delay, primarily due to delays in completing an access road. This project had an 8% cost
overrun because of inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The Ninth project comprised
construction of four highly congested sections of TYH in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia,
totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of equipment for maintenance and for monitoring
loadings of vehicles using the primary highway network, including TYH. All road works
and the delivery of highway maintenance equipment and weighing scales were completed in
1982.
3.          The loan for the Eleventh Highway project (Loan 1819-YU, US$125 million)
was made in 1980. It comprised the construction of six sections of the TYH totalling about
164 kin, and the procurement of highway maintenance and road monitoring equipment,
technical assistance, a highway safety program and the preparation of a Toll Study.
Although execution was delayed by up to two years because of the shortage of local funds,
most construction items were completed by the revised loan closing date of June 30, 1985.
The Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented during a period of
economic difficulty and budgetary reductions. Because of the severe shortage of local funds,



- 36 -
Annex 1.1
Page 2 of 3
both the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were included under the Bank's Special
Action Program in 1983. The investment plans were revised, and the projects were then
implemented as planned, albeit with a two year delay. Re-estimated economic returns for
both projects were satisfactory. Several institutional improvements were incorporated in the
project including the creation of FARP, the carrying out of a road user charges study, and
training.
4.          The First Highway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU, US$121.5 million) was
made in 1986. The project financed a time slice of the road investment/maintenance
program of four Republics of ex-Yugoslavia with the emphasis on removal of bottlenecks,
rehabilitation, and completion of the basic network. The project emphasized investment
planning, a systematic approach to road maintenance operations, sound financial planning
under conditions of budgetary constraint, and strengthening of the new coordinating body for
roads (FARP). Project preparation was delayed due to slowness in reaching agreement on
the Republics to be included in the project and the composition of investment plans, and
delays in adjusting road user charges. Project signature was delayed about six months due to
Government delays in providing bank guarantees to the borrowers. Following substantial
increases in road user charges in 1986, the project was signed, and became effective in July
1987. The project was completed satisfactorily.
5.          The Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 2878-YU, US$68 million) was
made in 1988. The project financed a time slice of the investment/maintenance programme
of three Republics/Provinces not covered under the First Highway Sector Project. The
project emphasized investment planning, a systematic approach to road maintenance
operations, sound financial planning under conditions of budgetary constraint, and
strengthening the role of FARP. The project included a road maintenance management study
for Croatia, which was completed with delays, and served as a basis for improving the
pavement management system.
Railways
6.          The Secon Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in 1964
to help finance the modernization of 1,509 km of main lines traversing Yugoslavia from the
Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border. It included electrification, signalling,
telecommunications, and the improvement of six key marshalling yards. This project ran
into major difficulties because after the 1965 political and economic reforms, the railways
internal funds fell substantially below expectations, and also because of deficiencies in project
planning and preparation which resulted in an underestimate of quantities and of time needed
for completion of such an extensive project. With hindsight, this was too ambitious a project
in relation to the railways' resources. The Bank loan was fully disbursed in 1972. The
project was refinanced from the fourth railway loan and was completed in 1981 at a total cost
of about US$410 million, over twice the original cost estimate.

Annex 1.I
Page 3 of 3
7.          Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement with the
Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the railways with the assistance of
consultants. This prepared the ground for the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU,
US$93 million), agreed in 1974, under which the Bank's loan was allocated to the
completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and to "Related Investments" needed to
maximize its benefits, all to be completed by the end of 1976. However, in contrast with
earlier projects which consisted only of investments to which the Bank loan had been
allocated, the fourth project was defined as the totality of the railways' investments in 1974-
76, whose cost was estimated at US$1,138 million. The Bank loan thus amounted to about
12% of the cost of the project. Agreement was reached on measures to help overcome the
railways' financial problems, principally through tariff increases. An important feature of
the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans which, given Yugoslavia's
decentralized system, were designed to contribute to a common understanding of objectives
and responsibility by all concerned. Only about two-thirds of project investments were
executed under the project; however, they were reasonably balanced to maximize system
effects, and the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment Plan. Execution of
Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially better (about three quarters). Except
for the section from Skopje to Gevgelia on the greek border, the electrification of the main
line traversing Yugoslavia was completed under the 1964 Modernization Program. Works
were completed satisfactorily and the loan was closed in 1981.
8.          The &9h Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU, US$110 million) was made in
1983. The project consisted of a four year time slice (1983-86) of four RTOs investment
plans, including the overhaul of 545 km of track, signalling and telecommunications on about
320 km of line, electrification of the Bosanski-Novi Knin line, spare parts for locomotives,
and technical assistance and training. Project effectiveness was delayed by one year due to
delays in increasing tariffs, but the project then proceed on schedule and within the cost
estimate. The RTOs have complied with the tariff covenant; however, compensation
payments initially declined, but then increased due to the effect of high inflation. US$3.7
million in project funds were cancelled due to exchange rate fluctuations. The project was
completed in 1988.

Annex 3.2
CROATIA
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Guidelines for the Level of Economic Analysis
Needed for Different Road Works
I.           Major New Construction (Level 1)
For such work full-fledged feasibility studies must be carried out in accordance
with the Guidelines (revised) for road investrnent projects. While no specific lower estimated
value can be given for this type of work, we envisage that such studies should apply to all
roadworks above $5.0 million equivalent and bridgeworks above $1.5 million equivalent.
II.          Rehabilitation and Betterment Works (Level 2)
For such road projects with a total cost of between $1.0 million and US$5
million equivalent detailed feasibility studies are not required. However, adequate
information and analysis should be carried out to indicate the economic viability of the
proposed work. These should include traffic projections, benefit calculations (both vehicle
operating cost savings and travel time savings), economic cost of the proposed project and
discounted streams of cost and benefits giving the expected internal rate of return.
HI.          Minor Work (Level 3)
For minor works with a total cost of less than $1.0 million equivalent, the
economic assessment of the project should be confined only to the relationship between
traffic volume and the rate of return expected at that volume. Such relationships can be
established from the results of existing feasibility studies carried out for road projects with
different types of terrain and hence unit costs.

HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
PAVEMEENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
1.    The purpose of this Annex is to assess the status of PMS development in H.C. and to
recommend further actions for its full implementation by 1997.
2.    Although H.C. started to implement its PMS in 1987, full implementation still
requires the Government confirming the adoption of the PMS as a highway management tool
and committing to a timetable for a) completing the road data base system, b) purchasing the
computer hardware, c) providing and installing decision making models and d) assignina and
training a team to operate PMS.
3.    To assess the status of HC's PMS, this annex will review first its scope and
development of its components and explain the reasons for its slow implementation. Then it
will present an action plan, including a timetable, to make PMS operational. Finally, it will
propose a methodology to be used until PMS is operational.
SCOPE AND DEVELOPMENT
4.    PMS is a process to coordinate and control a series of activities with the objective of
optimising resources for highway maintenance and rehabilitation (including reinforcement)
particularly of pavements, and to generate the corresponding budgets and work programs.
5.    The Croatian PMS essentially seeks to encompass the following aspects, which are in
different stages of development and implementation:
(a)    A unified address system, identifying and denotincg classified roads, sections
and intersections in the road network to detect road data unambiguously. This
identification system was completed in 1992. It is being complemented with a
Geographical Information System (GIS).
(b)    A road data base with objective, reliable and timely information on the
structural and functional condition of pavements, traffic volumes, maintenance
and highway rehabilitation costs, and user cost.' As a first step of the road
data base development a data dictionary was completed by end of 1991. The
dictionary provides terminology standards and procedures and methods for data
collection. In addition to the dictionary, the data base system would cover the
collection and entering into the system of data related to: Pavement Surface
l.While this annex covers the data for a PMS, 'Hrvatske Ceste' has been developing an
Integrated Information and corLmmunication System (ISAR) since 1990, which includes and
Integrated Management and Technological Information System (IMTIS) and a Business
Information System (BIS). These systerns cover not only information for the PMS but for
other aspects of Hrvatske Ceste responsibilities such as adrninistrative matters, road safety,
bridges, etc. Nevertheless, Hrvatske Ceste' is giving priority to the subset of data files,
aoslications softw'are and documentation aoolvine to PMS.

Condition, Pavement Unevenness (Roughness), Pavement Strength, Traffic,
and Unit Cost on vehicle operating cost and civil works involved. Collection
of the above data has been slow because of the lack of adequate equipment.
(c)   A computer system that continuously updates and monitors the database. The
system is in the early stage of development due to inadequate computer
hardware.
(d)   Computation models for network and project analysis that can manipulate data
on pavement conditions, the cost of vehicle operation and various strategies for
maintenance and rehabilitation, to formulate annual and multiannual pavement
maintenance and rehabilitation programs. On the basis of a small pilot study
done in 1989, it was decided to try the HDMUI and EBM models, developed
by the World Bank, as computation models. The HDM, however has some
limitations and needs to be adapted to local conditions, particularly to existing
climatic conditions (freezing and thawing) that influence pavement
deterioration. Ongoing research includes the local calibration of 11DM and
connecting the HDM and EBM systems to the database system.
(e)   Institutional and technical aspects, including the assignment and training of
staff to operate PMS. The functions of PMS staff include the coordination of
the various units participating in the PMS, such as consultants, monitoring
services contractors, engineering institutes, and universities to carry out
specific tasks including possible multiannual contracts to monitor pavement
surface condition, roughness, and deflexion through the use of multifunctional
vehicles. Also, they would include the preparation and implementation of staff
training programs.
6.    Implementation of several of the above aspects have been hampered by the war.
Acquisition of the necessary computer hardware and software, and of the communication and
measuring equipment required were delayed. In addition, parts of the network are
inaccessible and traffic on the entire network has significantly reduced, making data
collection difficult and sometimes unreliable.
ACTION PLAN
7.    A PMS should be considered implemented only when the recommendations of the
software are routinely used in selecting pavements to repair, allocating funds among
competing pavement requirements, determining overall network needs, and justifying funding
needs to governing authorities and the public. In this respect, a series of actions are needed
to continue the development and implementation of PMS in Croatia and to ensure its
systematic operation. First, H.C. should prepare a policy statement confirming the adoption
of the PMS, as well as its objectives and organization. The statement should be well
published and distributed among H.C. staff and other interested groups. Second, H.C.
should carry out the action plan that it has prepared for strengthening the further
development and implementation of its PMS. The action plan envisages that HC's PMS will
be fully operational by 1997 and that starting 1998 the budget for highway rehabilitation,
resurfacing and maintenance will be prepared and monitored through the systematic use of
PMS. Table I presents the timetable for the action plan indicating the main actions and their
timing, and tables 2 and 3 detail the equipment, services, and technical assistance needed.

PROVISIONAL METHODOLOGY
8.    Considering the present conditions in Croatia (para. 6) and that PMS will only be
operational by 1997, the Bank's appraisal mission proposed that HDMIII voc in conjunction
with pavement deterioration, based on Croatian engineering experience, be used for
pavement analysis until PMS is fully operational. Table 4 presents a matrix with provisional
standards for pavement rehabilitation, resurfacing and maintenance that would be used for the
selections of Hrvatske Ceste's 1995-97 Highway Rehabilitation and Resurfacing Program.

CROATIA
RIJEKA PORT STUDY
Draft Terms of Reference
I. BACKGROUND
1.    The Croatian ports have been subjected to fundamental changes in the conditions
which affect their operations. The independence of Croatia, the war in former Yugoslavia,
the ensuing political and economic changes have contributed to dramatically reduced traffic
volumes and changes in hinterlands. Also, the questions of ownership, relations between the
state and the port administrations, privatization, financial performance, etc. have to be
redefined, taking into account the changes that have already occurred, as well as the new
directions for economic and political developments.
2.    Rijeka is by far the most important of the Croatian ports, accounting for about two
thirds of total port activity. Although traffic has dropped by about 70% from the late 80's, it
is a port of great importance, not only to Croatia, but also potentially to neighboring
countres.
3.    A preliminary study of the situation of the Croatian ports (Les ports croates, Apis &
Sofremer, Paris, January, 1994) has been carried out.
II. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
4.    The purpose of the present study is to recommend actions for and by the port of
Rijeka so that it would make an optimal contribution to the development of the Croatian
economy. The overall policy foresees the ports being transformed into so-called landlord
ports, with as much scope as possible for private participation in the investments and
operations of the ports. Within this framework the study would investigate and propose the
following:
(a) based on internationally observed trends and development with regard to
shipping, trade facilitation, port equipment and operations, as well as ikey
development scenarios for Croadan trade, a perspective of what functons and
capacities the port of Rijeka will have to provide for 2000, 2005 and 2010;
(b) a report on current and prospective land tenure situation in the port and maritime
industries areas based on site visits and interviews with authorities and enterprises

(e) based on an analysis of the efficiency of port operatons, as well as an
identification of constraints and bottlenecks affecting the smooth flow of goods
and documentation through the port system, recommendations for operational
improvements that could be introduced with no or minor alterations to dxisting
facilities and equipment;
(f) suggestions for adapting the organizational structure and management systems
based on a critical review of the suitability of the existing organiztional elements
for achieving efficient administration and operation of the port;
(g) an overview of the present financial situaton, as well as financial forecasts under
various assumptions;
(h) master plan for the broad long-term development of the port based on foreseen
future traffic, an assessment of the capacity and service provided by existing
facilities, as well as likely competing ports' volumes and capacities. The master
plan shall include inte U : (1) recommendations on the uses and regulaon of
land and water areas within the port; (ii) access and circulation plans for
maritime, road and rail trafc; (iii) outline of the principal port instlations
proposed; and (iv) recommendations to reduce the negative impact of port related
activities on the environment;
(i) feasibility studies for recommended investment program for rehabilitation and
development, including preliminary engineering, environmental assessments, cost
estimates, economic analyses and financial plan; the program shall rate the
alternatives for development, indicate the implementation tme schedule and
specify the professional services needed to expedite the next steps required to

various departments; and (iii) review current orientations and recent decisions of the
Government regarding ownership of ports assets, degree of Government participation, and
future role of the private sector. The Consultants shall also provide an assessment of the
current trends regarding the legal and constitutional basis on which ports arc managed in a
number of countries of direct relevance, as well as on recent measures and proposaIs to
increase the involvement of the private sector in the management of ports. Based on the
above analyses, the Consultants shall: (a) discuss the pros and cons of various alternatives
for ownership and organization of the Rijeka port with their financial, economic and other
consequences; and (b) provide recommendations regarding the respective roles of the
Government, local authorities, and the public and private sector, as well as the necessary
conditions for arriving at an optimal solution.
15.   Port Policies. Based on a review of the socio-economic changes and discussion with
decision-makers concemed, the Consultants shall assess the broad impact of economic
policies on port development and policies. The Consultants shall review the current situation
regarding financial responsibilities, planning responsibilities, land-use poL;cies, labor policies,

position. This assumes access to all relevant materials, including past financial reports. The
Consultants shall also assess the extent to which comparison of revenues with costs for each
service rendered and by cost centers is obtainable as a basis for devising appropriate cost-
based tariffs. Based on the foregoing, the Consultants shall recommend appropriate actions
that may be required to help management make sound financial decisions.
22.   The Consultants shall review the systems of port statistics and performance indicators
and recommend any improvement deemed necessary in view of the trends in traffic and
changes in the organizational structure. They shall also indicate required developments in
the marketing function and recommend a program of appropriate actions in this regard.

Consultants shall indicate the basis on which these estimates have been calculated.
31.     onormic Studies. The Consultants shall carry out an economic evaluation of
alternative development schemes with a view to determine: (a) the optimum size; and (b) the
optimum time. For this purpose, the Consultants shall evaluate the economic feasibility of
each investment proposal by a comparison of the economic benefits to be expected from such
improvements in the context of the overall tiansport system with the capital, maintenance and
operation costs involved. The benefits to be considered shall include: (i) decreased
maintenance, operation and servicing costs for the existing and proposed facilities; (li) lower
inventories and/or cargo losses in transit; (iii) savings in cargo handling costs, ship operating
costs and transport costs (due to the use of larger ships); and (iv) savings in truck and train
operating costs related to inter-modal operations. The costs to be considered should include
the costs of improvement, equipment purchase and maintenance of facilities and
infrastructure associated to the proposal.
32. Financial Studie. The Consultants shall make a forecast of the financial situation of
each of the three target years. Revenues shall be based, in the first instance, on the latest
applicable port tariffs; costs shall include all port operations, terminal facilities, repairs and
maintenance, administration, depreciation and financing charges. The analysis shall forecast
the incremental expenditure and revenue arising from the implementation of the project.
33.   Taiffs. Based on the financial analysis above, the Consultants shall recommend
changes in the structure and level of port charges that are in their opinion justified to achieve
sound financial results. The Consultants shall also recommend revisions in tariff policy to:
(i) create incentives for the efficient use of port facilities; Cii) distribute the perceived benefits
from the investments made between users and the port authority; (iii) maintain the port in a
healthy financial position; and (iv) provide a satisfactory return on investments. The tariff
policy shall be applied in a recommended structure and level of port charges, taking into

CROATIA
FIRST HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Terms of Reference (TOR) for Consultant Assistance
for Hrvatske ZeUjeznice (HZ-Croatian Railways)
I. Background
1.     Over the past three years (HZ) traffic has declined by about 73% from 10.0 billion
traffic units in 1990 to 2.7 billion units in 1993. In addition, operations on an extensive part
of the railway system have been interrupted as outlined in Attachment I (HZ to provide map and
description). These changes have had a major impact on HZ's financial position requiring major
contributions from government to enable HZ to continue it's operations. It is essential that the
level of these subsidies be substantially reduced as soon as possible. To assist HZ in this task.
proposals are invited from consultants to review HZ's operations, make recommendations on
methods for reducing costs and increasing productivity and assist in the implementation of the
agreed recommendations.
H. Objective of Study
*2.    The objective of the study is to identify and irnplement a program of actions to improve
HZ's financial performance and reduce its reliance on Government subsidies to cover operatin
expenditure. The fall in HZ's traffic due to the economic transformation of the former socialis
economics compounded by the damage and disruption to the rail infrastructure and equipment
has had disastrous effects on HZ operations and financial results. To minimize the fiancial
impact of these events on the economy, it is necessary to review all aspects of HZ's operations
including train formation and scheduling, staffing, tariff levels etc. with a view to reducing HZ's
cost to a minimum, increase productivity and enhance revenue. The consultant is required to
assist HZ in undertaking this review and assist in the implementation of approved
recomnnendations.
3.    To undertake this study, it is envisaged that the Consultant's team would consist of two
or three specialists who have wide experience in the following fields:
-     railway tariff setting
-     railway and government public service obligation (PSO) contracting procedures
-     evaluation of the economic viability of railway lines
-     railway traffic operations/management
-     repair and maintenance of rolling stock and some knowledge of track mainteance

year approximately 60,000 accidents are registered. There are about 900 fatalities and
16,000 injuries in those accidents. Persons have been crippled or injured as a result and
will have a continuing drain on the economy of the country because of their inability to
work and their need for extended medical care.
2.          Although in terms of fatality rates per vehicle Croatia does not rank
amongst the worst countries worldwide, its fatalities per 10,000 vehicles rate is high in
terms of industrialised economies where rates of around 2 deaths/10,000 are typical.
With a rate of about 9 deathsl10,000 vehicles Croatia has a higher rate thlan some
developing countries such as Philippines (7) and'.%lalaysia (6).
3.          A significant amount of road safety work is already being undertaken in
the country. A National Road Safety Council (NRSC) exists and has initiated a road
safety plan. This plan sets out a number of proposed actions and calls upon organisations
such as the Minhry.of the Interior and Road Authority, together with the Education
sector, to co-operate with the implementation of the plan.
