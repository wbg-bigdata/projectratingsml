PRIVATIZATION TECHIMCAL ASSANCE PRO.lECT
SrAFF ASAL REPORT
ClAlTR1? QJZ(LC&SUMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Cape Verde
hnglernenting Age^:        Ministry of Finance and Planning
Credilt Amount:           SDR 3.1 million (US$4.2 million equivalent)
Tems:                      Standard IDA terms, with 40 yemrs maturity
Proeet Obiectives
and Description:          The major objectives of the proposed operation are to assist the
Government of Cape Verde to: (a) build its capacity to implement a
wide-ranging public eriterprise reform program; and (b) implement its
policy of promoting 'he private sector as the main vehicle for
economic deve!cprnent. The project would provide technical
assistance to the Government and would include five components
described below.
The Institutional Development component would assist the
Government to: (a) strengthen the capabilities of the Finance and
Planning Ministry to design, implement and monitor reforms in the
public enterprise sector; (b) train Finance and technical Ministry staff.
The Privatizaton and Ligaidation component would support the design
of a divestiture strategy and action program and initiate its
implementation. Ihis would be achieved through the provision of: (a)
srecialized short-term divestiture advisory services; (b) legal,
accounting and valuation services; and (c) specialized services to
identify and attract foreign investors' interest in companies selected for
divestiture. In addition, a public reladons campaign would be
organized by the Government to explain the objectives of the public
enterprise reform and privadzation program to the general public, and
to mobilize interest un the part of local and foreign investors.
The PE Performance IJ=r mnt component would assist the
Government to: (a) devise and implement a restructuring and
performance improvement program for selected public sector
ezterprises performing economically or socially strategic activities
which may not lend themselves to privatization during the course of
the project; and (b) improve the legal and insdtutional arrangements



- ii -
governing the relations between the Government and public enterprises
maintained in the state portfolio. This would be achieved through: (i)
the establishment of clear financial and operational performance
objectives; (ii) provision of short term specialized assistance to
improve the operational, technical and financial management of those
enterprises; (iii) training of PE managers and key PE staff; and (iv)
improvements in the legal and institutional arrangements governing the
relations between the Government and the public enterprises to ensure
the autonomy and accountability of adequately qualified and motivated
boards of directors and PE managers in the context of an efficient
Government supervisory arrangement.
Accompanying  measures. The implementation of a program of
improvement of the productivity and efficiency of the public
enterprises and of divestiture will likely lead to retrenchment of excess
or redundant staff in a narrow labor market. To cushion the impact
and to facilitate the process, the project will support the organization
of a program of transfer of human resources from the public
enterprises to the private sector through: (a) the provsion of advisory
services to match the supply of labor created by reduction of staffing
in the restructured public enterprises and the demand of labor in the
private sector, and to evaluate the potential for creation of business
enterprises by former public enterprise employees; (b) the provision of
financial resources to promote the on-the-job retraining of retrenched
PE staff recruited by private employers; and (c) the provision of
financial resources to promote the orgmmization of private sector-
operated, demand-driven, work-oriented training workshops and
evening courses for PE staff.
Promotion of the private sector lbis component would consist of
studies and advisory services to: (a) further review and adapt the legal
environment to make it more responsive to private sector development
needs, particularly with regards its administrative implementation
procedures; (b) design and/or refine the legal, institutional and
:egulatory framework required to open up additional sectors of the
economy to private sector participation and induce competition; and
(c) to promote private sector development in areas offering good
prospects for growth and potential for export, such as (J) the tourism
sector; (ii) the fisheries sector; (iii) non-traditional, labor intensive,
high value added light manufacturing industries requiring litde of
energy; and (iv) accounting and auditing services.



- iii -
EM3ect Benefits
and Risks:                 The project will assist Cape Verde in achieving z better allocation of
its limited resources, and a more streamlined, efficient and business-
oriented PE sector. This would reduce the financial and
administrative burden on the Government and on the banking sector.
The closure of uneconomic enterprises would also reduce resource
waste, while the sale of viable ones to the private sector and the
rehabilitation of those remaining under Government control are
designed to maximize the economic benefits of those enterprises.
There is the risk with regards to the failure of the Government to
further pursue the implementation of adequate macro-economic
policies and reforms warranted in the areas of trade, pricing, finance,
and labor that would underpin and/or complement the envisaged
public enterprises reform. Secondly, as the operation involves broad-
ranging and complex reforms both at the sector and enterprise levels,
there is a risk that vested interests within Government and the affected
enterprises will resist reform measures as these may imply increasing
PE autonomy and replacing some existing PE managers. Given the
statements and positive actions of the Government to date, thes. risks
are not considered high. A third risk relates to the privatization
program. The financial situation of some of the enterprises, coupled
with a small domestic market may make them unattractive to private
investors. Further, domestic capacity to mobilize funds in favor of
privatization may be limited. The recent experience with privatization
and the interest shown by both local and foreign investors suggest that
these risks are acceptable. Finally, there is the risk that the
implementation of the reform program may be slowed down by the
limited capacity of the Government administration to carry out the
policy reform package and to monitor the execution of enterprise
restructuring programs. These risks are addressed through the
strengthening of an existing team in the Ministry of Finance and
Planning which will coordinate implementation of the reforms, and the
provision of technical assistance and consulting services to help Cape
Verdean institutions to carry out the tasks envisaged under the project
as well as the impending preparation of a public institutional
development and management project designed to complement and
deepen some of the actions initiated under this project.

S_AFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC SEFTING
1.1          Cape Verde consists of ten islands located 650 kilometers off the coast of Senegal,
with a land area of about 4,000 square kilometers. Only nine islands are populated with a resident
population of less than 400,000. The annual population growth rate averaged at 2.7 percent, or 1.5
percent per annum adjusted for emigration in the 1980s. Austere living conditions and limited
emptoyment opportunities in Cape Verde have traditionally induced immigration of Cape Verdeanr in
the United States, Europe and continental Africa where the emigrant community is now estimated at
more than 600,000. Nearly one third of the resident population is concentrated in Praia, the capital,
and Mindelo, the industrial city. The country has a poor natural resource base. Lack of water
resources severely constrains most economic activity, and is especially severe in the urban centers:
Mindelo relies entirely on desalination, and Praia on distant and dwindling ground watee sources.
Although the country is self-sufficient in vegetables, fruits and some basic foodstuffs, the limited
agricultural land available and meager and erratic rainfall result in a strong dependence on cereals
imports provided as food aid.
1.2          Despite these limitations, the country has achieved strong economic performance, with
an average real GDP growth of 5.7 percent per annum in the 1980s. This performance, however,
deteriorated in 1989 and 1990, and internal and external imbalances emerged. A source of these
imbalances was the poor economic and financial performance of the public enterprises involved in
manufacturing, fisheries and services, which account for more than a quarter of GDP. The previous
Government's policy of assigning to the public sector a key role in productive activities, which could
have been performed more efficiently by the private sector, proved increasingly inappropriate in
recent years and resulted in low efficiency, poor financial results, and high share in the overall
external debt. In 1989, the previous Government of Cape Verde recognized these shortcomings and
adopted an outward-looking development strategy. It fa' d, however, to implement this strategy.
This in turn contributed further to the deterioration in economic performance and affected adversely
the Government's political credibility. The export-oriented strategy in fact stood little chance of
success given continuing economic instability and failure to define clearly an appropriate government
role vis-a-vis public enterprises. A new Government took office in April 1991, following its election
in the first multi-party elections since independence on a platform of reform and liberalization of the
economy. A priority activity has been the definition of a decisive outward-looking development
strategy, aimed at promoting a market economy, and the undertaking of specific actions towards its
implementation. The Government has begun to design and implement a wide range of policies to
restructure and modernize the economy. A major priority is the reform and rat,onalization of the
public enterprise sector.

B. C RACTERJSTICS OF THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR
1.3          Public enterprises in Cape Verde consist of: (a) Empresas Migtas (mixed companies)
which are joint ventures between the Government and/or other public enterprises and private domestic
or international investors; and (b) Empresas Publicas (public enterprises) which are wholly state-
owned public shareholding companies. All companies in Cape Verde, wholly state-owned enterprises,
mixed companies and private firms, are subject to the same legal frame*..k (business law, labor law,
commercial code, etc.). Government control in the mixed companies is exercised through its
representation in the decision-making bodies (board of directors and shareholders' meetings).
Government supervision of the wholly-owne public enterprises is defined in specific public enterprise
legislation (aw 53/89 and decrees 15-B/90 and 196/91). This law institutes a double "tutelle", with
the technical ministry in charge of the enterprises sector and the Finance and Planning Ministry
(MOFP). Both have considerable and to a large extent overlapping a priori pcwe,r on key decisions
such as budget, pay scale, tariffs, investment and borrowings. In addition to this double "tutelage",
other ministries also have a say in other matters affecting enterprises such as prichig, administrative
allocation of foreign exchange ard personnel management. The law applicable to wholly state-o%%tied
public enterprises establishes a board ol directors of a maximum of five members, among which the
general manager as president of the board, and two other directors. This gives the management of the
enterprise absolute majority in the board. In several instances, however, the board members have not
been appointed and the general manager reports directly to the ministers.
1.4          The present public enterprise-dominated economy is a result of deliberate efforts to
promote a central role for the Government in economic development since independence. This was,
in part, the result of a practically non-existent private sector. Government policy, based on creating
an inward-looking economy, resulted in the rapid growth of the public enterprise sector which
currently occupies a monopoly or major role in virtually all sectors of the economy: electricity,
water, road, air and marine transport, imports, tourism, manufacturing and fishing. The public
enterprise sector now comprises 32 companies, 21 of which are wholly state-owned and 11 are mixed
economy enterprises. In 1990, the sector employed over 6,400 persons and generated about 25
percent of GDP. It accounted for 42 percent of the value added in manufacturing, 61 percent in
transport and communications, 87 percent in energy, 15 percent in commerce, 40 percent in fishing
and 45 percent in tourism. A breakdown of the public ente: prises by economic sector is presented in
Table 1 below.

1.5            A review of the First (1980-85) and Second (1986-90) Economic Development Plans
shows that the public enterprise sector absorbed a sizeable amount (A public resources over the past
decade. In 1990, credit extended by the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV), to the wholly state-owned
public enterprises (excluding mixed companies) totalled 2.6 billion escudos (US$40 million), or an
increase of 86 percent since 1985. This amounts to 32 percent of the total credit extended by the BCV
to the economy (excluding credit to the Government), up from 26 percent in 1985. The share of total
available bank credit extended by the BCV to the entire public enterprise sector (including mixed
companies), amounted to over 50 percent in 1990. The sector also received over 40 percent of foreign
exchange allocations for the same year, excluding foreign exchange allocated for invw'tment, oil
imports and intermediate goods for export. ForeigiL oans to public enterprises constitute one-half of
Cape Verde's external debt, with principal and intevtst obligations of the public enterprise sector
amounting to over 60 percent of public and publicly-guaranteed debt serviee obligations in 1990.
C. FINANCIAL PERFORMArJCE OF THE SECTOR
1.6            In the early 1980s, the public enterprise sector contributed a large portion of
govermment revenues, but in the late 1980s, the financial performance of the PEs deteriorated
significantly, resulting in lower contributions to the budget revenues and increased budget deficits,
escalation of borrowing and internal and external arrears. While no public enterprise, except for the
electricity and water utility, receives any direct subsidy from the Government, a significant number of
enterprises have been sustained only thanks to: (i) indirect subsidies in the form of Government



onleniding of foreign loans or grants orn soft terms; (ii) increased credit (albeit now declining) from the
Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) and suppliers, including other public enterprises; avd kiii) using all
availabie revenue to meet current operating costs, without allowing for depreciation.
1.7          Many enterprises have been unable to honor internal and external debt amortization
and interest obligations, thereby putting considerable pressure on Gov:.rnment's budget and/or
threatening the health of BCV. Between 1990 and 1991, onlending of foreign grants and loans by the
Ministry of Financt; and Planning to public enterprises increased by 9 percent to 2.5 billion escudos
(US$38 n..lion). Arrears decreased from 8 percent to 4 percent of the total during the same pe-;od,
but still amounted to over 87 million escudos (US$1.3 million) at end 1991. At the same time, the
principal and interest arrears of the public enterprises vis-a-vis the Bank of Cape Verde reached over
65 million escudos (US$1 million).
1.8          A spectacular decline in profitability in a large number of public enterprises has led to
a crisis in the sector. From 1985 to 1989, employment in the public enterprise sector grew from
5867 to 6436, or by almost 10 percent, and turnover by 42 percent, to 13.4 billion escudos (US$200
million). Consolidated after tax profitability of the sector, meanwhile, decreased by 275 percent.
Cumulative losses totalled more than 242 millions escudos (about US$3.6 million) in 1990. The
wholly-owned state enterprises registered the highest decline in profitability, turning an after tax profit
of 163 million escudos (US$2.4 million) in 1985 to a loss of 301 million escudos (US$4.5 million) in
1989. Over the same period, the fi.,ancial results of the mixed companies improved, turning a
consolidated loss of 24 million escudos (US$0.4 million) in 1985 into a profit of 58 million escudos
(US$0.9 million) in 1989.
1.9          The decline in profitability was especially severe for public enterprises in some of the
most important sectors of the economy: fishing, air and maritime transport, petroleum, agriculture
and agro-processing. During the per.od 1985 to 1989, Enacol (petroleum product distribution) went
from a profit of 39 million (US$0.6 million) to a loss of 123 million escudos (US$1.9 million);
TACV (airline) from a profit of 8 million (US$0.1 million) to a loss of 289 million escudos (US$4.4
million); FAP (animal feed) from a profit of 0.9 million (US$10.000) to a loss of 19 million escudos
(US$0.3 million); ENAVI (poultry farm) from a profit of 1.3 million (US$20,000) to a loss of 2.8
million escudos (US$40,000); Arca Verde (shipping) increased its losses from 10 nillion (US$0.15
million) to 123 million escudos (US$1.7 million); CABMAR (shipyard) increased its losses from 140
million (US$2.2 million) to 233 million escudos (US$3.5 million), mainly due to the faL t.hat
CABNAVE did not fully honor the pre-determined payment schedule for the use of the shipyard
facilities; while PESCAVE (industrial fishing) registered a loss of 58 million escudos (US$0.9
million) in 1990. Between 1985 and 1989, the profit after taxes of ASA (airport authority) more than
halved, decreasing from 171 million (US$2.6 million) to 72 million escudos (US$1.1 million).
1.10         During the same period, however, CTT (telecommunications) increased its profits
from 22 (US$0.3 million) to 120 million escudos (US$1.8 million); and Electra (electricity and water)
cut its losses under a Bank project (Credit 1954-V) from 157 million (US$2.4 million) to 10 million
(US$0.15 million), before operating subsidy provided by the Government, which itself decreased
from 78 (US$1.2 million) to 45 million escudos (US$0.7 million). Sonacor (vehicle repair services)
turned a loss of 19 million (US$0.3 million) to a profit of 17 million escudos (US$0.25 million); and,
under the above-mentioned Bank project, Transcor (urban transportation), turned a loss of 8.5 million
(US$0.13 million) to a profit of 6.5 million escudos (US$0.1 million). Table 2(a) below presents

D. MAJOR ISSUES IN PUBLIC ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE
1.11             The major issues in public enterprises performance in Cape Verde include: unclear
definition of role and objectives; poor economic and financial analysis of investment projects at the
design stage; legacy of inappropriate and constraining macro policies and/or procedures (pricing,
investments, "soft budget' constraints, labor, etc...); poor internal management (ack of incentives for
performance, overstaffing, shortage of qualified personnel in key areas, inadequate cost control, high
financing leverage, etc..); and weak and confusing legal and institutional framework
(Government/enterprise relations).
1.12             In the manufacturing sector, policies of import substitution resulted in a limited
development of small and medium scale manufacturing plants serving exclusively the domestic
market. Although operating under considerable tariff and quantitative protection, they nevertheless
suffer from excess capacity and weak capital structure. In most instances, they have not had
incentives to develop an export potential to supplement a limited domestic demand. Given the
Government's policy of liberalization of the economy, their future viability is now at best uncertain.
In other instances, public enterprises have financed their initial investments with disproportionately
high borrowing, as their initial capital base was inadequate. Some investments also proved
substantially overdimensioned from the start, while the economic and financial viability of others is



now in question, following a dramatic reduction in the market they were set up to serve (on-the-
ground assistance to airlines and shipyari services for instance). Common characteristics of most
enterprises are extremely high level of receivables, due to weak commercial management, and
overstaffing.
1.13         An inadequate legal and institutional framework has also resulted on poor PE
performance. Government-Public enterprise relations are ill-defined and governmental supervision is
diffused and prone to crisis management style. This results in a lack of co-ordinated approach and
clear rules regarding the authority, responsibility and accountability of the various government
agencies and of PE management. In several instances, the double "tutelage", and the unclear role and
level of authority of boards of directors, has led to direct and disturbing interference in day-to-day
management. In several other cases, board members have either not been appointed (including in the
case of representatives of the State in some mixed companies) or the Board (because the law gives
PEs' managers a majority representation in the board) has acted more like an internal advisory council
to the General Manager rather than as a proper board of directors. In addition, non-executive board
members are civil servants, often with insufficient business experience and technical familiarity with
the enterprise's production process. Although the technical tutelle ministries are supposed to monitor
the performance of the public enterprises within their portfolio, in practice, they have lacked adequate
human capacity to perform these responsibilities and have rarely played an efficient supervisory role.
As shown by the poor administrative and financial performance of most public enterprises, they have
not provided the kind of support needed to the enterprise's board of directors and its managing
director.
1.14         The current situation in the public enterprise sector is unsustainable in the
medium-long term. If not addressed, it will strain an already burdened budget and lead to a
continuous inefficient allocation of resources. More important, the public enterprise sector could
continue to command a disproportionate share of bank credit and foreign exchange resources, and
could effectively: (a) crowd out the existing private sector; and (b) compromise Cape Verde's chances
to seize new private sector-led development opportunities. As the Government is committed to
ensuring the most efficient use of the national resources, it is endeavoring to reorient the economic
system by shifting towards a competitive market structure with a greater role for the private sector.
The Government policy of promoting the private sector role in the economy gives the highest priority
to: (i) privatizing every activity presently in the domain of public enterprises that can be operated
more efficiently by the private sector, and in which there will be competition; and (ii) promoting local
and foreign private investments as essential requirements to the development of the economy.
E. CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR
1.15         The private sector in Cape Verde is dominant in agriculture and construction, and
actively involved in food production, commerce, personal services, housing, fishing and some light
manufacturing activities (bakeries, rum distilleries, furniture manufacturing, etc.). Available data on
the private sector in Cape Verde is sketchy but it is expected that the ongoing USAID study on export
promotion and the private sector will provide, among others, pertinent statistical data. Limited data
shows that, in the manufacturing, trade and service sectors, there are an estimated 300 small- and



-8-
medium-scale enterprises in the formal sector employing about 7,0C: persons, or approximately the
same number of people as the public enterprises. Private individuals own some 1,200 artisanal boats
which supply the domestic market with about 11,000 tons of fish a year. Passenger road
transportation is provided solely by private companies (except in the towns of Praia and Mindelo) and
private operators are active in maritime inter-island cargo transportation. Petroleum import and
distribution is equally shared between Enacol, a wholly state-owned public enterprise, and a
subsidiary of Shell. The modem private sector remains rather small and underdeveloped. Its
emergence was restrained over the years by the inward-looking policies relying predominantly on the
public enterprise sector, and its development is constrained by lack of indigenous capital, limited
access to bank credit, and shortage of skilled labor force in general, and managerial and marketing
skills in particular. The informal sector, on the other hand, has always played an important economic
function, and it is on the rise. Traditionally, it has ensured commercialization of agricultural products
from the surplus to deficit islands, and within islands. More recently, entrepreneurs have shown
dynamism in developing their activities in consumer goods distribution and in construction, in
response to inefficiencies in the operation of the state enterprises involved in these activities.
Relatively high levels of private transfers has kept the informal sector buoyant. As the informal
sector has played an important role in alleviating the pressure of unemployment, Government has not
tried to restrict its development, even when it competed with state monopolies.
1.16         The potential for further private sector development in Cape Verde rests on: (i) a
relatively low cost of labor (given the existing productivity) with a potentially high training absorption
capacity due to the basic literacy rate (47 percent of the adult population), but rigidities in the labor
market due to lack of flexibility in the administrative implementation of the labor law, and shortage of
certain categories of personnel (mostly at the middle management level); (ii) stability of the exchange
rate, but administrative allocation of foreign excbange (except for export-oriented industries where it
has been abolished); (iii) negligible export barriers to other countries (ECOWAS membership, Lome
Convention, preferred treatment), but significant impediments in the form of low frequency and high
cost of air and maritime connections with the neighboring countries, Europe and, esr-cially, North
America; (iv) potential for the mobilization of local household and emigrant savings, hampered by the
extreme weakness of the financial sector, and lack of capital market; (v) adequate foreign investment
laws which, in addition to incorporating the usual clauses of non-discrimination and fair treatme.it,
arbitration of conflicts and safeguards for the transfer of profits and interest, capital and
supplementary shareholders contributions, provide generous tax incentives (exemption of customs
duties in case of export activity, grace period of at least 5 years on profit taxes, non-taxation of
retained earnings) and a realistic level of profit taxes (about 30 percent), balanced by slow and
cumbersome administrative procedures. Foreign investors are also likely to consider favorably the
political stability and openness of a country strategically located at the crossroads of three continents:
Europe, Africa and Latin America.
1.17         Private local and foreign investment, including from the sizeable emigrant community
which retains extremely strong links with the country, faces the risks and opportunities which typify
an economy in transition from a policy of state intervention in most productive sectors to a policy of
promotion of private ownership and management. The local private business community is showing
dynamism in responding to new challenges and opportunities, as demonstrated by its response to the
liberalization of imports, the recent appearance of new accounting, auditing and computer support
services, and the creation of a privately organized and sponsored training center, which, from the
start, was able to attract more than 57 students for evening courses in accounting and marketing



- 9 -
management, despite high tuition fees ($170/month equivalent). Recendy, local private companies
have also successfully entered into joint ventures with foreign engineering firms on internationally-
financed construction and civil works projects in other Portuguese-speaking countries (mainly Angola
and Mozambique). The potential for mobilization of private capital was also recently tested
successfully in two cases: first, the establishment of a soap manufacturing company at Mindelo,
which resorted to the private placement of equity. The offer of CV Esc. 25 million was increased to
CV Esc. 50 million because of the very high demand. Second, an insurance company (IMPAR) was
established as soon as the monopoly of the public sector was removed. Again, demand was
overwhelming. Total quity of about US$3 million, with about 50 percent subscribed to by foreign
partners and 50 percent by 400 Cape Verdeans. However, the local business community is sti1l
predominantly oriented towards the domestic market, because it lacks experience, n-tworks and
marketing skills to develop export-oriented activities. As the Government is pursuing an open policy
with regards foreign investment, this shortcoming could be addressed through the promotion of joint-
ventures between local investors and foreign partners.
1.18         Foreign private sector investors have been showing interest in Cape Verde. Ihe
Centro de Promogio do Investimento e das Exportag6es' (PROMEX) was created in 1991 to
promote investments in export-oriented activities is a major development in setting up the institutional
structure for the promotion of private sector development. PROMEX reports direcdy to the Prime
Minister and is receiving support from the Swedish Government (technical assistance) and US.AID
(technical assistance and funds for training and studies). PROMEX is still in the process of
organizing itself and defining a strategy to attract investment but, in the first 12 months of operation,
it has already received a total of 86 requests for information from potential investors from 10
different countries (55 percent from Portugal, 15 percent from Scandinavian countries and 5 percent
each from the US, Germany, France, Switzerland and France). Of these, however, 64 were
preliminary contacts and only 9 were at a relatively more advanced stage, with potential investors
submitting investment or pre-investment projects. In terms of sectors, garment manufacturing and
tourism elicited the greatest interest (13 percent each), followed by fishing, food processing and
building materials (6 percent each), and various services (off-shore banking, teleport-related
information processing activities, solid waste collection and treatment, etc...).
1.19         Ihe financial sector represents a major constraint to the development of private sector
activities in Cape Verde. It is almost entirely state-owned, and is to a large extent administratively
managed and a provider of noncompetitive financial intermediation. The sector is made up of two
state-owned institutions, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) and the Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde
(CECV). There is also one government-owned and one recently established private insurance
companies. The Bank of Cape Verde is the dominant financial institution. It is a monobank-with
central, commercial, and development banking functions-and is responsible for some 90 percent of
the total domestic credit, the remaining amount being extended by CECV. Under the constitution, the
BCV is the only commercial bank authorized to operate in Cape Verde. The Caixa Economica de
Cabo Verde is a savings and loan institution for consumer credit (mostly salary advances for public
sector employees) and mortgage financing (for owner-occupied housing) whose source of funds are
deposits and lending funds from the BCV and from the Treasury. The publicly-owned insurance
company had no autonomous existence prior to the last quarter of 1991, as it was previously the
insurance department of the social security and insurance agency of Cape Verde. To overcome



- 10-
inefficieu ' s in the banking sector, the Government is designing a wide-ranging reform program and
has reqi . ed assistance from IDA.
F. GOVERNMENT SIR13GY AND REFORM EF
1.20         The current Government of Cape Verde was elected on a platform of political and
economic change ("A Mudanga") and liberalization. It has adopted the principles of equal access to
resources, econordic competition, and private sector development with only a limited role for the
state. Reform of the public enterprise and financial sectors, therefore, is a high priority in the
Government's adjustmedt and reform program. The Government is committed to carrying out a
privatization program "as fast and far reaching as market will allow'" and has clearly indicated that, in
the future, its portfolio should consist only of those enterprises which are strategic jnf for which no
private operator can be found; it seek to privatize outright most of the public enterprises. Foreign
investments are being encouraged, including joint ventures with foreign capital. Public enterprise
reform and divestiture is an important component of the new economic program of the Government
which was published in the Official Gazette soon after it took office (ResolugIo NW. 61IV/91 in Boletim
Oficial NW. 31 of August 8, 1991). The Government has also submitted a more detailed policy
statement to confirm its committment to PE reform and privatization. This document is included as
Annex 2.
1.21         The Government has already stamted to implement a number of reforms of the public
enterprise sector to promote its new strategy. It has liquidated two public enterprises: SCAPA
(artisanal fishing) and EMEC (civil works), and sold its shares in SOCAL kshoe manu&cturing) to a
Portuguese company. It also removed the import monopoly of EMPA (except on a limited number of
basic items). The Government has conducted preliminary studies of two agro-industrial public
enterprises with a view to determining a suitable privatization strategy (management/employees buy
out or purchase by an association of the existing clients are being envisioned) and is considering
contracting out to the private sector a number of activities presently carried out direcdy by the
Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, such as road maintenance. It is also presently engaged in
negotiatons with local and foreign investors to privatize a garment making factory (MORABEZA), a
drug manufacturing company (NPHARMA) and the state fishing company (PESCAVE). In addition,
it is planning to sell quicldy its minority shareholding in a number of mixed companies.
1.22         The Government is also committed to radically transform and improve the financial
sector in Cape Verde. The authorities have defined a two-year time frame for the first stage of the
reform of the banking sector, starting in mid-1991, and have opened up the insurance industry to the
private sector. The agenda for the reform of the monetary sector comprises the creation of a two-tier
banking system and the opening up of the sector to private Cape Verdean investors, including
emigrants. With the assistance of IDA, the Government is already engaged in the first steps of the
planned reform which consist in the separation of accounts of the central bank and
commercial/investment banking functions of the BCV. The separation of accounts will be facilitated
to a certain extent by the fact that the investment department of the BCV has been managed under
administrative and financial autonomy since its creation in 1986. The next step will be the creation of
the central bank and of the first commercial bank of Cape Verde. ITis step will require the setting
up of: (a) a new modern central bank; (b) adequate systems of monetary control and banking



- 11 -
supervision before the commercial bank starts operation; and (c) a new commercial bank adequately
endowed in terms of its initial asset/liability structure and managed according to market principles.
The authorities also intend to restructure the CECV as soon as possible in order to make it a viable
financial institution. With these changes, the financial sector in Cape Verde should become more
responsive to the needs of private sector development and efficient operations.
1.23         Finally, a number of measures to correct structural weaknesses and to create an
enabling environment for private sector development are being undertaken to improve: (i) the
incentive system (trade and price liberalization, tax reforms, export promotion, import and foreign
exchange allocation liberalization, etc.); and (ii) the legal and regulatory framework (abor law,
investment code, commercial code, bankruptcy code). The Government is gradually implementing a
policy of import liberalization, in the context of the overall foreign exchange availability. A partial
removal of quantitative restrictions was introduced on January 10, 1992 for a number of consumer
goods and construction materials, accounting for about 33 percent of the average value of imports of
goods over the period 1989-1991. Pending a favorable assessment of the first phase results, the
second phase is expected to follow before the end of 1992. In parallel, the price control system has
been virtually abolished with the ongoing trade liberalization. The price control system in Cape
Verde was limited to regulating the profit margin of imported products and food aid (as a percentage
of c.i.f. prices), while the prices of locally produced products have always been market determined.
The price controls have now been reduced to: (i) only four basic staple food products (maize, rice,
sugar and cooking oil); (ii) imported petroleum products; and (iii) inter-island maritime transport
services, as an instrument of social policy aimed at securing traffic at reasonable cost among the
various islands. The Government has also taken a number of steps to create the right legal
environment for the promotion of new investments in export-oriented activities, and export-promotion
zones (EPZ) in particular. A new legal framework has also been prepared to promote the
development of tourism, and the labor code is being revised. Streamlining of the administrative
procedures is still the weakest point in the ongoing policy reforms, and further improvements are
warranted to ensure effectiveness of generally well designed legislation.
1.24         The Government would like to further stimulate local and foreign investments by: (a)
putting up for sale its interest in a number of enterprises; (b) encouraging private entrepreneurs to
manage and operate a number of activities presently carried out by large public enterprises; and (c)
developing the legal and regulatory framework required to open up new economic activities to private
enterprise. In addition to transferring state ownership, the Government intends to pursue other
courses for the development of private enterprise, suu;.i as contracting out activities and services of
large public enterprises or removing public enterprise monopoly, where feasible and advantageous,
or promoting private investment in activities not presently conducted in Cape Verde. However, given
the present fragility of the economy of Cape Verde, characterized by the high level of unemployment
(more than 25 percent of the active population) and the still limited employment opportunities in the
private sector, the Government would like to proceed cautiously and faces a special challenge in
conducting the implementation of this policy in such a way as to minimize its potentially socially
disruptive effects in the short term. The Government also recognizes that it has limited institutional
capacity to implement its reform objectives and needs assistance and expertise to carry out further its
PE reform and privatization policy.

G. IDA's ROLE
1.25         IDA has been involved in key public enterprises in Cape Verde, such as in ENAPOR
(Cr. 1322-CV), ELECTRA and TRANSCOR (Cr. 1954-CV), with good results in terms of
improvement in the quality of service provided, overall efficiency of the operations, and financial
performance of these enterprises. It has also provided BCV with a line of credit (now fully
disbursed) for the promotion of private industry (Cr. 1579-CV). In the past, the Government relied
to a large extent on bilateral assistance, and did not systematically invite coordination among donors.
In addition, much of the assistance did not address necessary institutional reforms, focusing rather on
the provision of equipment, goods and financial resources. Both the Government and the various
donors have realizeA these shortcomings. Hence the new Government, with the full support of all
donors present in Cape Verde, has made a deliberate decision to seek IDA's assistance in designing
and implementing a comprehensive program of public enterprise reform. Because of the nature of the
challenge and the complexity of the issues involved, IDA is well placed to assist the Government of
Cape Verde. IDA has had experience and has taken the lead in similar operations in the Region.
The proposed operation would complement IDA's past involvement in the sector, and other IDA
operations planned for the transport, financial/private, and human resources sectors. It would also lay
the ground for the future institutional development and management project being contemplated.

II. THE -PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBIECIVES
2.1          The major objectives of the proposed operation are to assist the Government of Cape
Verde in: (a) building its capacity to implement a wide-ranging public enterprise reform program; and
(b) implementing its policy of promoting the private sector as the main vehicle for economic
development. Specifically, the project seeks to assist the Government to: (a) develop its capacity to
design, implement and monitor a portfolio policy and a public enterprise reform program; and (b)
increase the overall efficiency and promote the growth of the economy. These objectives will be
pursued througn: (i) organization of the divestiture of some of the public enterprises wnich can be
privatized; (ii) initiation of the liquidation of non-viable ones; (iii) improvement in the operational
performance and profitability of s,elected viable public enterprises that may not lend themselves to
privatization during the course of the project; (iv) creation of a legal and regulatory framework
conducive to private sector development; and (v) identification and promotion of new private sector
activities.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.2          The project would build on the reforms currently being undertaken by the
Government, supported in part by USAID, ani provide assistance to the Government to help carry
out its reform program in the following five areas: (a) development of the institutional capacity to
design, implement and monitor PE reforms, including policy reforms; (b) improvement in the
performance of enterprises that may not lend themselves to privatization under the project; (c)
privatization and liquidation of those to be divested; (d) implementation of accompanying measures to
facilitate the transfer and retraining of retrenched PE staff in private companies; and (e) promotion of
the development of the private sector, including through improvements in the legal business
environment (bankruptcy, investment and privatization laws, and liquidation provisions, for example)
in order to make it more supportive of Government's policy for the sector. The project comprises
five components as described in the following paragraphs and the key project activities are
summarized in Annex 3.
2.3          Institutional development component. This component would involve: (i) reorganizing
and strengthening an existing unit within the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) to conduct PE
reform and divestiture, and to monitor the performance of the enterprises which would remain for the
time being in the Government's portfolio; and (ii) training of Government officials in the MOFP and
technical Ministries, responsible for monitoring PE performance. In order to a&ist the MOFP to
formulate and implement the PE sector rationalization and improvement program, as well as to
develop its capacity as the central oversight agency for the government's portfolio, a team of three
experienced professionals and two support staff will be positioned in the PE Reform and Privatization
unit (PERP). The major function of the PERP unit will be: (i) to advise the Finance and Planning



- 14 -
Minister in all policy and technical aspects of the PE sector rationalization program; (ii) to promote
and supervise the conduct of a program of performance and efficiency improvement in a number of
PEs remaining in the state portfolio; and (Ui) to organize and conduct a privatization program for a
number of mixed companies and for the peripherical activities of selected public enterprises. As the
Government does not possess all the technical expertise and relevant experience to conduct such a
wide ranging program of PE reform and divestiture, one lorg term advisor to the Director, PERP,
will be recruited for a period of two years. In addition PERP will be able to call upon short-term
consultants specialized in divestiture, as needed. The organization chart of PERP is presented in
Annex 4; the description of the role and responsibilities of the the Director, PERP, in Annex 5; and
the terms of reference for the long-term advisor in Annex 6. Provision is also made in the project to
finance office equipment, iehicles and operational support for the unit. In addition, financial
resources will be made available under the project for training of the staff of the PERP unit in the
MOFP and for its counterparts in the technical Ministries to improve their ability to effectively
monitor PE performance. This training will consist of locally organized seminars on public enterprise
reform issues, short-term professional courses overseas (in such areas as audit principles, management
information systems, financial analysis, etc.), as well as on-the-job training which would be provided
by the long-term advisor.
2.4          Privatization and liguidation compnent. Provision is included under the project to
provide assistance to the PE Reform and Privatization unit (PERP) in the Ministry of Finance and
Planning for the design and Implementation of the Government's privatization and liquidation strategy
and action program. Ihe content of the state portfolio has been reviewed with the Government and a
preliminary assessment of potential candidates for privatization under the project would ide: (a)
mixed companies where the Government has a minority shareholding: CERIS (brewery a soft
drinks), CABETUR (travel agency), SODIGAZ (oxygen and acetylene), FAMA (pasta), SITA
(paints); (b) hotels: HOTELMAR and Hotel ATLANTICO; (c) public enterprises or majority state-
owned mixed companies in the manufacturing or service sector which are not performing a crucial
economic activity: METALCAVE (metal furniture and aluminum products), ONAVE (wood and
plastic boat repair), ANV (travel agency); and, (d) agro-industrial public enterprises: FAP (animal
feed), ENAVI (poultry) and JUSTINO LOPEZ (banana plantation and pig-sty). In addition, ARCA
VERDE could sell its 50 percent shareholding in CONCHAVE (mter-island petroleum transport) and
MAC its shareholding in MACSOBEL (cut glass). Further, the Government is considering the
privatization of a further 2 key profitable enterprises: EMPROFAC (drug import), and MOAVE
(grain milling). It also intends during the project to evaluate options for opening up the capital of
CIT (telecommunications) and TACV (airline) to the private sector, concurrently with the
implementation of performance improvement measures. However, as these enterprises provide an
important economic or public service, the conditions of service to be provided by the private operator
need to be carefilly specified prior to privatization. The ocean shipping activities or ARCA VERDE,
and possibly CGTM (international maritime freight shipping), are likely candidates for liquidation.
Ite strategy with regards ENACOL (petroleum import and distribution), and CABMAR/CABNAVE
(shipyard), would be decided after the completion of a viability assessment referred to below. The
strategy with regards PESCAVE (industrial fishing) would be decided in the context of the design of
an overall strategy for the promotion of private activities in the fishing sector, including a viability
assessment of the enterprise. No action or measure of any kind will be directly or indirectly financed
under the project with regards the tobacco manufacturing mixed economy compari.



- 1S -
2.5          The assistance under the project will consist in: (a) a long term advisor in PERP to
assist In the design/implementation of the strategy and action plan for privatization (already mentioned
in the Institutional Development component above); (b) approximately 6 person-months of specialized
short-term advisory services; (c) legal, accounting and valuation services; and, (d) specialized services
to identify and attract foreign investors' interest in companies selected for divestiture. The short term
advisory services would provide PERP, as needed, with specialized expertise in such areas as the
elaboration of the initial documentation regarding the enterprises, the establishment of regulations
and/or guidelines for the organization and conduct of the sales (including in such arrears as pre-
qualification conditions, form of tender submission, award criteria, obligations of the winning
tenderer, etc...), the preparation of the bidding documents, the conduct of the evaluation process and
the closure of the sale. The terms of reference for these services are presented in Annex 7. Short-
term advisory services will also be financed, as needed, to conduct environmental audits of those
companies selected for privatization which might pose an environmental hazard. In addition, a public
relations campaign aimed at explaining to the general public the objectives of the PE reform and
privatization program, and mobilizing interest on the part of local and foreign investors, would be
organized by the Government and financed under the project.
2.6          PE performance imDrovement component. This component would consist of
furnishing advisory services to: (a) help devise and implement a restructuring and performance
improvement program for selected public sector enterprises performing economically strategic
activities; and (b) improve the legal and institutional arrangements governing the relations between the
Government and public enterprises maintained in the state portfolio. Approximately 29 person
months of short-term consulting services for a total of 12 public enterprises or majority-owned mixed
companies, and the audit of selected caterprises, will be financed under the project. The target group
includes those enterprises which play an important role in the economy of Cape Verde and may not
lend themselves to privatization during the project, either: (a) because they provide an essential public
service; or (b) because they are in critical financial condition and may prove not to be viable. The
public enterprises in the first group would include: TACV (air transportation), ASA (airport
management), ARCA VERDE (inter-island shipping), EMPA (import, storage and distribution of
basic products, including food aid), CTT (telecommunications). If needed, additional support could
be provided to ELECTRA (electricity and water) to complement the actions already undertaken under
the existing IDA project (Credit 1954-CV). ENAPOR (port authority) would not be included in this
group as it would he covered under the planned Transport and Infrastructure Project for which IDA
financing has bee   quested. For this group, consultants specialized in business analysis, corporate
restructuring and ule design of performance improvement programs will be financed under the project
with the objective of: (a) evaluating the potential for the divestiture or contracting out of peripherical
activities (e.g., meter reading, fleet maintenance, handling, transport and warehousing of imported
goods, etc..); and (b) developing operational and financial performance targets for the remaining core
of their activities, which could be implemented in the form of performance agreements between the
Government and the management of the public enterprises. The terms of reference for these advisory
services are presented in Annex 8. The second group of enterprises comprises: (a) three important
enterprises in difficult financial situation: CABMAR/CABNAVE (shipyard), ENACOL (petroleum
distribution), and PESCAVE (industrial fishing); and (b) four loss-making small mixed economy
companies: METALCAVE (metal workshop), ONAVE (wooden and plastic boat repair yard), MAC
(construction materials), and ANV (travel and customs agency). For these, consultants will be
financed under the project to conduct a viability assessment and develop recommendations regarding



- 16-
their future. Based on this assessment, the Government will then be in a position to decide on a
restructuring, privatization or liquidation strategy.
2.7          As part of the implementation of a PE performance improvement program, the long-
term advisor In PERP will assist the Government in developing a commercialization program for the
public enterprises. This would entail, in particular, a reorganization of the tutelle system as well as
changes in the composition, functioning and character of the boards of directors. Under this
program, the ownership and management functions would be separated, and management autonomy
and accountability would be reinforced through: (a) the introduction of an improved system of
selection/appointment of board members and managers; and (b) the design and implementation of a
reward system based on performance.
2.8          To assist the enterprises implement their rehabilitation action plans and achieve their
objectives of performance improvement and overall efficiency, the project will finance approximately
25 person months of short-term technical and managerial advisory services. This will enable the
enterprises to contract for certain ad hoc technical or managerial expertise for the design and
introduction of specific processes, methods, or upgrading skills on the job in defined areas of the
company's operations (e.g., management information systems, marketing, production, etc...).
2.9          In addition to financing ad hoc technical and managerial short term advisory services,
the project will finance a comprehensive training program aimed at building up local capabilities for
improving PE performance. The training program will address primarily PE executives and senior
officers. It will cover the following core areas: corporate planning, setting up -nd monitoring
performance objectives and performance contracts; financial management, audit and control;
management information systems; marketing; and personnel planning and administration. Training
will take the the form of practical short-term courses, seminars and workshops, followed by on-the-
job training, rather than extended overseas training or long-term consultants. It is envisaged that the
training will be provided through: (i) the technical specialists and consultants as an essential
component of their PE reform and divestiture assignments; and (ii) short-term training experts
recruited for the purpose. For the former, training objectives and actions, as well as monitorable
progress indicators, will be set forth in each technical assistance contract and supervised by PERP.
Efforts will be made to associate local private or public training institutions, wherever feasible.
2.10         Accompanying measures. The implementation of a program of divestiture and of
improvement of the productivity and efficiency of the public enterprises will likely lead to
retrenchment of excess or redundant staff in a labor market characterized by an already high level of
un- and under-employment. To cushion the impact and to facilitate the process, the project will also
support the organization of a program of transfer of human resources from the public enterprises to
the private sector through: (a) the provision of advisory services to match the supply of labor created
by reduction of staffing in the restructured public enterprises and the demand for labor in the private
sector, and to review options, and recommend an action plan, for promoting the creation of business
enterprises by former PE employees; (b) the provision of financial resources to promote the on-the-
job retraining of retrenched PE staff recruited by private employers; and (c) the provision of financial
resources to promote the organization of private sector-operated, demand-driven, work-oriented
traiLng workshops and evening courses for PE staff As regards the retraining costs, funds available
under the project will be used to reimburse the private employers 40 percent of the salary they will
pay to a retrenched PE staff they would hire, for a period not exceeding six months. This payment



- 17-
will contribute towards the cost, to the private employer, of providing on-the-job training/retraining to
an emptoyee which, coming from the public sector, might not immediately prove operational or fully
productive when operating in the context of a privately-managed firm. At the end of this period, it is
expected that the private employer would confirm the appointment and assume the full salary cost of
the retrained employee. The terms of reference for the provision of advisory services to organize the
placement of retrenched PE staff are presented in Annex 9.
2.11         To fPrther facilitate the implementation of its divestiture program, the Government
intends to set up a "oivestitu,; account" which will collect the gross proceeds and disburse the gross
costs of privatization and liquidation actions. Its purpose is to use the revenues from privatization to:
(a) prepare PEs for sale; (b) clean up enterprise liabilities; and (c) create and sustain a safety net for
employees detrimentally affected by the divestiture process. It will be operated and accounted for as
a separate account from any other accounts and will be placed under the direct control and
supervision of the Director, PERP, in the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The divestiture
account's principal revenue items will be the proceeds of the sale of: (i) enterprise equity in whole or
in part; and/or (ii) assets, in unit or broken-up forms, of enterprises that it proved to be impossible to
sell as a going concern. Any other revenues resulting from divestiture will also be included in this
account. The divestiture acccount's principal cost items will be: (i) for liquidation: the compensation
of special receivers that may be appointed to dispose of the enterprise, the settlement of all arrears
and other obligations that are payable in whole or in part according to the applicable laws, and
severance and other termination pay as well as any other monies payable consequent on the
termination of employment of personnel as a result of the liquidation/closure; and (ii) for
privatization: the costs of sale of equity and assets, including the payment of obligations whose
settlement was made a condition of sale in the applicable instrument of sale. Such obligations may
include such items as: arrears of taxes and debts; changes to reduce environmental damages and
installation of pollution abatement technologies; severance pay and other monies payable consequent
on personnel reductions agreed on in the instrument of sale; as well as any other obligations which
were included in that instrument. Other cost items may include the cost of canvassing, identifying
and negotiating with interested potential buyers of the divested equity or other assets. The divestiture
account wiUl be managed on the basis of an initial working fund advanced by the Treasury, which
shall be refundable to that agency as soon as such repayment is considered feasible, which will be at
the time the divestiture account is considered self-supporting on a net basis. At an appropriate time in
the progress of the project, arrangements will be made with and through the Director, PERP, to
dispose of any net surpluses resulting from the divestiture account's operations, or to fund any net
deficits so resulting.
2.12         Promotion of the Private Sector Component. This component would consist of studies
and advisory services to: (a) further review and adapt the legal business environment to make it more
responsive to private sector development needs, particularly in terms of administrative procedures
governing the implementation of the laws and regulations; (b) design and/or refine the legal,
institutional and regulatory framework required to open up new sectors of the economy to private
sector initiative (based on a review conducted with the Government, drug import and distribution,
telecommunications, including teleports, off-shore banking, and international maritime registration
activities appear to offer the most promising prospects for generating local and foreign private sector
interest in the short- to medium-term); and (c) to promote private sector development in areas offering
good prospects for growth and a potential for export, such as: (i) in the tourism sector; (ii) in the
fishing sector; (iii) in non-traditional, labor intensive and high value added, light manicn or

2.14         The proposed financing glan includes an IDA Credit of US $4.2 million equivalent,
which will finance 89% of the estimated project costs. This will cover all of the foreign exchange
costs (US $3.4 million) and 61% of the local costs (US $0.8 million), a large proportion of which
represents the retraining costs of retrenched PE staff. The Government would finance the remainder
of the costs (US $0.5 million).
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
2.15         Organized collection of data on the public enterprise sector "egan in 1989 with the
establishment of a unit, the Gabinete de Apoio as Empresas (GAEP), in the Ministry of Finance and
Planning. The GAEP began io analyze the performance of the sector and recorded the financial
transactions between the Government and the enterprises, such as subsidies, loans, dividends, etc.
This group was supported by three foreign technical assistants financed by the Portuguese
Government. More recently, a diagnostic of the financial situation of a majority of the public
enterprises was carried out by cornsultants financed by USAID. In designing the project, close
attention was given to this preparaory work, to the new policy orientations of the Government and to
ways in which these could be operationalized.
2.16         The Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization (PERP) unit in the Ministry of
Finance and Planning will implement the project in close collaboration with the technical Ministries
involved. PERP would work in close collaboration with PROMEX, the agency set up with the
assistance of USAID to encourage foreign private sector investment in the country. PROMEX will be
particularly useful in marketing the privatization program of the Government among foreign investors,
and in assisting in the investment process. Selection of the Director of PERP, with qualifications and
experience acceptable to IDA will be a condition of effectiveness. The Government is considering the
possibility to recruit abroad a Cape Verdean with suitable qualifications and experience to head the
technical unit and combine the functions of Director and of long-term advisor. If this can be worked
out, funds could be relocated for additional short-term support to PERP. As the appointment would
initially be on a contract basis and would involve payments in foreign exchange that would be bome
by the project, the Government would advertise internationally for the position, and select the
incumbent in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for selection of consultants. A list and tentative
timetable for key actions under the project has been agreed with Government (Annex 3). The
Government also agreed to submit to the Association, for review and approval, its draft annual PE
sector refom and privatization program and action plan three months before the start of the calendar
year. The action plan would include explicit and monitorable targets and indicators such as: the
names of enterprises to be offered for sale or liquidated in that year, and an indication of their overall
weight in the economy; the expected budgetary implications (costs and revenue) of the rehabilitation
and privatization actions; the divestiture techniques envisaged; the number of employees likely to be
affected by the restructuring of the PE sector and the compensation and reinsertion policies envisaged;
and the performance improvement targets to be achieved in the restructured public enterprises. The
approved action plan wo,uld form the basis of the yearly work program of PERP. Agreement has
been reached that the wod- programs will include detailed proposals including justification, terms of
reierence, and relevant budget for the training to be provided under the project.



-21 -
2.17         In the course of the project, the issue of confusing lines of authority and
responsibilities resulting from the "double tutelle" is expected to be resolved through implementation
of an improved institutional framework defining Government/PE relationships. The Government is
committed to ensure that public enterprises which shall not be privatized under the project will be
managed according to generally accepted private management norms and stai lards, and that they will
enjoy complete autonomy in the context of clearly defined contractual arrangements with Government.
2.18         The Government is committed to ensuring the maximum transparency in the design
and implementation of its divestiture program, as reflected in its Statement of Policy. To this effect,
the Government: (a) decided to set up a Public Enterprise Sector Reform Advisory Board (PESRAB);
and (b) agreed to adopt a Procedures Manual governing all phases of the divestiture process. The
Government has decided that PESRAB will consist of the Minister of Finance, as Chairman, the
Director, PERP, as Secretary, and representatives of the public and private sector selected "intuitu
personae" on the basis of their independence, technical competence and experience. PESRAB will:
(i) provide policy guidance to the Minister of Finance and Planning on the direction and pace of the
PE rationalization program, including the detailed divestiture proposals and the proposed programs
for assistance to PEs, proposed by the Director, PERP; and (ii) review the conduct of the
implementation of that program, with a view of ensuring effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of
the process. The creation of PESRAB and the appointment of its members is a condition of
effectiveness. The description of the role, responsibilities and composition of PESRAB is presented
in Annex 12. Agreement was reached with the Government that a detailed Procedures Manual would
be prepared early in the project, to serve as guidance to PERP concerning all downstream phases of
privatization: from invitation to bid, to bid evaluation, and finally to the actual sale of public
enterprises. The submission of terms of reference and the selection of a consultant for the preparation
of the Procedures Manual, both acceptable to the Association, is a condition of effectiveness.
2.19         To further promote and facilitate the implementation of its PE reform and
privatization policy, the Government also agreed to launch early in the project a public relations
campaign aimed at: (i) developing understanding and securing wide support among the general public;
and (ii) at mobilizing local and foreign potential investors' interest. In addition, the Government
intends to broadly disseminate information about each case of privatization to the general public.
2.20         Two mechanisms will be applied to ensure close monitoring and evaluation of project
performance, conformity with project objectives and adequate supervision by Government and IDA:
(i) semi-annual reports, and (ii) annual and mid-term reviews. Semi-annual reports will be prepared
by PERP and will include brief but substantive documentation on project implementation progress and
expenditures. Agreement has been reached that the annual and mid-term reviews would be conducted
jointly between the Government and IDA on the basis of a report prepared by PERP and reviewed by
PESRAB in such a maimer as: (i) to assess progress in the implementation of key actions and
performance indicators; (ii) verify the continued validity of the design assumptions in light of the
implementation experience and the evolving environment; and, (iii) to identify any remedial actions
that might prove necessary to achieve the objective of the project. Agreement has been reached that
the reviews would address, in particular: (i) the performance of the consultants under the Project and
their record of training and technology transfer; (ii) the implementation of the training ana retraining
programs and the results achieved; (iii) the progress of the pivatization program and its actual record
of transparency; and (iv) the performance of the public enterprises that have been rehabilitated. In
addition, agreement has been reached that the Government will submit a Project Completion Report to



-22 -
IDA no later than six months after the closing date of the credit. The project is expected to be
completed over a period of four years. The supervision plan of the project is presented in Annex 13.
E. ROCUREMEN
2.21         Procurement under the project would cover the cost of consultant services for
technical assistance and training, equipment and operational support. Consultants and technical
assistance personnel to be financed by IDA would be appointed in accordance with the Bank Group
Guidelines dated August 1981, and would be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Most of the consulting and advisory services financed under the project, except for the Project
Director who might be individually selected, will be selected on the basis of terms of reference and
short-lists acceptable to IDA and procured according to the World Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Agreement has been reached during negotiations on the utilization of Sample Bank
Bidding Documents, Letter of Invitation for se!ection of consultants, and Sample Consultants'
Contract modified, as appropriate, with regards taxes, liabilities, and payment terms. Vehicles,
equipment and other material (US $0. 15 million) would be grouped whenever possible, into bid
packages of not less than US $20,000 and procured through international and local shopping after
receipt of price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers, in accordance with Bank Guidelines
dated May 1985. IDA financed contracts for amounts over US $20,000 equivalent would be subject
to prior review and approval by IDA. Other contracts will be subject to selective ex-post review.
The financing of the retraining costs of employees to be redeployed poses a special case. It involves
paying private firms part of the costs of on-the-job retraining of employees discharged from public
enterprises that they would hire. These costs will not be subject to standard procurement procedures,
but will require prior approval by IDA and will be carefully monitored, documented and audited. For
this purpose, evidence of salary payments would be used. The procurement arrangements are
presented in Table 4 on the following page.

2.22         As of FY 1992, IDA's portfolio of on-going operations in Cape Verde comprises
three projects. The FY 1991 ARIS review revealed an average overall performance rating of 1.75,
primarily because of delays in contracting the construction of a pedagogic institute under the Primary
Education Upgrading Project (Cr. 1853-CV). A procurement specialist visited Cape Verde in January
1992 and the problem has now been resolved. Progress on the other two projects (Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Industrial Promotion) has been satisfactory. Now that the political transition period
in Cape Verdo is over and a new Government is in place, implementation of projects is expected to
improve still further.
F. DISBURSEMENTS
2.23         The project is expected to be implemented over a four year period, as the Government
wishes to proceed rapidly with its PE reform and privatization program and aims to complete all
activities within that period. Accordingly, while the average disbursement profile in the African
Region is seven years, the credit is forecasted to be disbursed over five years, and to be closed in
July 1997.
2.24         All disbursements of the IDA credit would be based on prior documentation except
for contracts of less than US $20,000 equivalent, for training and retraining, and for operating costs,
which will be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs). The project Director would have the
responsibility for the preparation of withdrawal applications for all components. The documentation
for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at the Ministry of Finance and Planning for review by
IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular semi-annual audits.
2.25         To facilitate disbursement, the Government would establish a Special Account in the
Bank of Cape Verde to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures. An initial deposit of US $200,000
equivalent would be made from the proceeds of the proposed credit upon effectiveness. IDA would
replenish the special account monthly, upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible
expenditures. Details of the establishment and operations of the Special Account and other
disbursement procedures have been discussed and agreed upon during credit negotiations. An
agreement was also reached that adequate budgetary provision for local costs will be inscribed in the
annual operating budgets of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The estimated disbursements and
allocation of the proposed IDA credit is shown in the next page.

G. ACCOUNTING. AUDITING AND REPORTING
2.26         The technical unit in the Ministry of Finance and Planning would establish and
maintain, to the satisfaction of IDA, separate accounts and records to be used exclusively for the
project. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA would audit these accounts in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles and in such detail as IDA may request. The selection of the auditors
of the project will be a condition of effectiveness. The audits would be undertaken annually, on the
basis of a three year contract, with the report submitted to IDA no later than three months after the
close of the year. In addition, the Special Account would be audited annually, and the SOEs semi-
annually, and audit reports submitted three months after the end of each audit period.
2.27         Agreement has been reached that the technical unit in the Ministry of Finance would
submit to IDA: (a) a semi-annual report on progress of project implementation; (b) annual work
programs and budgets for the following year (including with regards the Government's contribution to
the financing of the project), no later than October 31 of any one year; and (c) a project completion
report within six months of the credit closing date.

H. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECIS
2.28         Cape Verde's environment is very fragile, given: (i) exposure of its predominantly
bare surface to wind and water erosion; and (ii) fast growth of urban areas. Inadequate fresh water
supply and lack of sanitation and satisfactory system of collection and disposal of hazardous and solid
waste pose immediate health hazards to the fast growing population in the urban areas. These
problems are particularly acute in Praia and Mindelo. Environmental problems are well identified
and recognized by the Government. The Government has adopted an active approach in carrying out
some concrete actions to address different aspects of the environment (e.g. allocating increasing
financial resources to improve urban living conditions, massive reforestation efforts, etc.). It has also
recently established an inter-agency National Council on the Environment (CNMA). CNMA has
embarked in the design of a strategy, the identification of policy measures coherent with other policy
reforms, and in the preparation of a legislation package and institutional framework to deal with
environmental issues on a more comprehensive basis. The Bank is assisting this process through the
preparation of a Country Environmental Strategy Paper (CESP) in FY92 which would identify more
systematically the issues, underlying causes, and suggest options and a medium-long term agenda.
2.29         The project does not present the prospect of any detrimental environmental impact.
Nevertheless, given the absence, at the present time, of comprehensive measures to deal with
environmental problems and, in particular, those that could result from industry, understandings have
been reached during negotiations with the Goverment: (i) that an environmental audit would be
carried out for those enterprises selected for privatization which shall be classified by CNMA as
potentially hazardous for the environment; and (ii) that such measures as may be required would be
taken in order to mitigate the potentially adverse environmental impact of their activities. Funds for
such audits are included in the project.
I. PROJECT BENEFTIS AND RISKS
2.30         The project will assist a business-oriented Government at a critical time in the
implementation of its public enterprin reform which is expected to reduce the financial and
administrative burden on the Government and on the banking sector. The closure of uneconomic
enterprises would also reduce resource waste. But more importantly, the Government expects the
renewal of sound economic growth to be brought about by higher investment by the private sector,
particularly in export-oriented activities. The proposed project would help initiate and accelerate the
dialogue with the private investors both locally and from abroad.
2.31         There is the risk with regards to the failure of the Government to further pursue the
implementation of adequate macro-economic policies and liberalization reforms warranted in the areas
of trade, pricing, finance, and labor that would underpin and/or momplement the envisaged Public
Enterprises Reform. Secondly, as the operation involves broad-ranging and complex reforms both at
the sector and enterprise levels, there is a risk that vested interests within Government and the
affected enterprises will resist reform measures as these may imply increasing PE autonomy and
replacing some existing PE managers and/or board members. Given the statements and forceful
actions of the Government to date, these risks are not considered high. A third risk relates to the



- 27 -
privatization program. The financial situation of some of the enterprises, coupled with a small
domestic market may make them unattractive to private investors. Further, domestic capacity to
mobilize funds in favor of privatization may be limited. Given the recent experience with
privatization and the interest shown by both local and foreign investors, these risks are considered
acceptable. Finally, there is the risk that the implementation of the reform program may be slowed
down by the limited capacity of the Government administration to carry out the policy reform package
and to monitor the execution of enterprise restructuring programs. This risk is addressed through the
strengthening of an existing team in the Ministry of Finance and Planning which will be in charge of
implementing the reforms, provision of technical assistance and consulting services to help Cape
Verdean institutions to carry out the tasks envisaged under the project and the impending preparation
of a public institutional development and management project designed to complement and deepen
some of the actions initiated under this project.
mll. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.1          The Government has submitted a Statement of Policy on its commitment to public
enterprise sector reform and privatization (para. 1.20). This policy statement endorses the following
principles governing the PE rationalization program:
(a)   that the program of liberalization of the economy would be pursued;
(b)   that a sound institutional framework for the PE sector would be put in p!ace,
including an efficient supervisory arrangement by the Government;
(c)   that no new PEs would be established in the productive sectors.
(d)   that, barring exceptional circumstances duly justified, no new major
investments or physical rehabilitation (exmept for regular maintenance) would
be carried out by the Government in enterprises which are targeted for
privatization in the short-term;
(e)   that PEs slated for privatization would not be sold, merged or otherwise
purchased by other PEs, if the net result would be a redistribution or an
increase of direct or indirect state ownership in the economy;
(f)   that, in all cases, Government will encourage fair competition and ensure that
the privatization of public monopolies will not result in the emergence of
unregulated private monopolies;
(g)   that, unless it has been agreed after consultation with IDA that special
circumstances warrant it, the Government will not grant market protection or
other measures detrimental to fair competition to investors buying PEs;



- 28 -
(h)   that, unless they are demonstrably essential to promote local shareholding and/
or domestic participation in the privatization process, no special privileges
such as Government financing, loan or loan guarantee, direct or indirect
subsidies will be granted to investors buying PEs. In all cases, such measures
shall be financed through exceptional revenue created by the divestiture, and
not from the general budget;
3.2          Agrements were also reached during negotiations on the following:
(a)   that, no later than December 31, 1992, the Government will adopt a
Procedures' Manual, acceptable to IDA, governing the conduct of the
privatization of the public enterprises, or sales of their assets under the project
(para. 2.18);
(b)   that, no later than March 31, 1993, the Government would launch a public
relations campaign aimed at explaining to the general public the proposed PE
Reform and Privatization program and at mobilizing investors' interest
(para. 2.19);
(c)   that the Government would submit to the Association, by October 31 of each
year of the project, starting in 1992, for review and approval its draft annual
PE Sector Reform and Privatization program and action plan, including a
schedule for the implementation of key actions in the sector, based on explicit
and monitorable targets and indicators (para. 2.16).
(d)   that the Government and the Association shall, not later than October 31,
1993 and, thereafter, not later than October 31 of each subsequent year,
undertake a joint review of the Project or, as the case may be, not later than
October 31, 1994, a mid-teLm review, during which they shall exchange views
generally on all matters relating to the progress achieved in the
implementation of the objectives of the Project. Following each such review,
the Government shall undertake to take corrective actions deemed necessary to
remedy any shortcoming noted in the implementation of the Project, or to
implement any other measures as may have been agreed upon in furtherance
of the objectives of the Project (para 2.20);
(e)   that, not later than one month prior to each such review, the Government shal
furnish the Association, for its comments, a report, in such detail as the
Association shall reasonably request, to undertake the above-mentioned yearly
and mid-term review (para. 2.20);
(f)   that, as a general rule, consulting and advisory services would be selected on
the basis of short-listing, and that Sample Bank Bidding Documents, Letter of
Invitation for selection of consultants, and Sample Consultants' contracts,
modified as appropriate, would be used (para. 2.21);



-29 -
(g)   that the Government shall provide appropriate local financing for the PE
Reform and Divestiture unit for each budget year (para. 2.25);
(h)    on the establishment and operations of the Special Account and other
disbursement procedures (para. 2.25 and 2.26);
(i)   that the Government shall have an environmental audit carried out for those
public enterprises selected for privatization which have been classifled by the
National Commission for the Environment as potentially hazardous for the
environment, and shall take such measures as may be required In order to
mitigate the potentially adverse environmental impact of their privatization
(para. 2.29).
3.3           Effectiveness of this credit will be subject to the following conditions:
(a)   restructuring of the Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization (PERP) unit in
the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and selection of its Director and
national professional staff with experience and qualifications acceptable to the
Association, as well as appropriate secretarial support (para. 2.16);
(b)    establishment of a PE Sector Rationalization Advisory Board
(PESRAB) and appointment of its members (para. 2.18);
(c)    submission of Terms of Reference acceptable to the Association for the
provision of advisory services to prepare a Divestiture Procedures' Maual,
and selection of the advisor with qualifications and experience acceptable to
the Association (para. 2.18);
(d)    adop..on of a model consultancy contract, acceptable to the Association,
including a sample letter of invitation, for the recruitment of consultants and
advisors under the Project (para. 2.21)
(e)    selection of an independent auditor, acceptable to the Association, to audit the
Project accounts (para. 2.26);
3.4          As a condition of disbursement for expenditures made under the category of training,
the Goverament has agreed to submit to IDA, for its review and approval, detailed proposals
including justification, terms and reference and relevant budget for the training to be provided under
the project (para. 2.16).
3.5          Recomendia. With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be
suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 3.1 million (US$4.2 million equivalent).

RATIONALIZATION OF TH PUBLIC
ENTERPRISE SECTOR IN CAPE VERDE
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT POLICY
I.    INTRODJUCTION
As stated in the Government Program approv I by the National Assembly,
restructuring of the parastatal sector is one of the principal economic policies of the
Government of Cape Verde (GOCV). This political commitment stems from a clear option
for an economic model dominated by market forces, where private initiative is recognized as
the driving force behind economic progress. The poor performance of State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) in terms of economic and financial indicators as well as product
price/quality relationship further lend credence to the necessity to move away from a state
dominated economy. Hence, restructuring the SOEs means a drastic reduction of the State's
presence as a direct economic agent within the context of recasting the state's new role in
macroeconomic management.
Restructuring of the SOEs has two principle dimensions: privatization of parastatals
and mixed enterprises, and turning around the SOEs which might remain in the public domain
during the course of the project because of lack of interest on the part of the private sector in
key social or strategic enterprises. Rather, it must be seen in the context of a broader process
of ecr-nomic and political liberalization with a clear view to creating a more favorable climate
for private sector development. Broadening private sector participation must occur through
foreign private sector participation must occur through foreign investment privatization,
deregulation and support of private enterprise development.
II.    OB.JE-CTIVE
The key objectives behind SOE restructuring are:
(a)    General increase in the level of economic efficiency and the development of a
more rational economy;
(b)    Reduction of the State's role in the ecot omy and a corresponding increase in
the leadership role of the private sector;
(c)    Promotion and development of the domestic entrepreneurial capacity; and
(d)    Broadening equity participation of domestic investors.

m. PRINECIPLES GOVERNING THE PRIVATIZATION PROGRAkI
In the conduct of his privatization program, the Government Intends to observe the
following principles:
(a)    no new public enterprises would be established in the productive sectors.
(b)    barring exceptlonal circumstances duly justified, no new major investments or
physical rehabilitation (except for regular maintenance) would be carried out
by the Government in enterprises which are targeted for privatization in the
short-term;
(c)   in all cases, Government will encourage fair competidon and ensure that
privatization of public monopolies will not result in the emergence of
unregulated private monopolies;
(d). unless it has been agreed after consultation with MDA that special
circumstances warrant it, the Government will not grant market protection or
other measures detrimental to fair competition to investors buying PEs;
(e)    unless they are demonstrably essential to promote local shareholding and/or
domestic participation in the privatization process, no special privileges such
as Government financing, loan or loan guarantee, direct or indirect subsidies
will be granted to investors buying PEs. In all cases, such measures shall be
financed through exceptional revenue created by the divestiture, and not from
the general budget;
(f)    PEs slated for privatization would not be sold, merged or otherwise purchased
by other PEs, if the net result would be a redistribution or an increase of
direct or indirect state ownership in the economy;
1V. PRINATIZATION METHODS AND APPROACHES
The following are the principal privatization methods and approaches:
(a)    Transfer of parastatal ownership and state share in mixed enterprises to
private investors;
(b)   Increase of paid in capital of former SOEs through the issue of new shares to
private investors;
(c)    Fragmentation of SOEs and sale of privatized segments;
(d)    Management contracts and leasing; and
(e)    Liquidation of unviable SOEs.



- 35                             ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 4
Privatization will be done on a case by case basis in order to determine the best
approach for the particular enterprise under consideration as well as the particular
circumstances surrounding the SOE. The specific objective and approach to be used will take
into consideration various factors including the nature and sector of the enterprise, its size,
economic and financial health in addition to other factors of national Interest.
As a matter of routine, transfer of ownership shall be done through public offering,
with open public bidding.
Limited bidding and direct negotiations with domestic or foreign investors shall be
used in special circumstances, when the normal procedure above are clearly determined to be
unproductive or has demonstrably failed to result in an acceptable privatization settlement, or
when "know-how" and technology transfer are clearly determined to be prerequisites for the
development of the enterprise to be privatized.
Fragmentation of SOEs will take place in those cases where autonomous economic
activities exist within the SOE and when these activities, once separated from the SOE, can be
more efficiently operated by the private sector.
Liquidation will be used for those enterprises which are considered economically
inviable under a restructured scenario.
V.  CREATING STABLE INVESMNT GROUPS
The creation of stable investment groups shall be promoted in certain cases,
particularly in those enterprises where technological and know-how factors are preponderant.
Efforts will be made to promote the creation of domestic investor groups able to contribute to
management stability as well as serve as partners for foreign investors.
While measures will be taken to assure the stability of the investor groups chosen, at
the same time, limits will be established to prevent concentration of capital and power in too
few hands. Through the promotion of investor groups, the GOCV will have one means of
promoting the development and enhancing the capacity of domestic investors.
VI. SMALL INVESTORS
Broadening the private ownership base is one of the important objectives of SOE
restructuring in Cape Verde. Special provisions will be made to set aside a percentage of the
ownership pie for the small investor, especially workers in the SOEs to be privatized and
potential emigrant investors. Thus, broadening the ownership base of the candidate SOE will
be balanced by the creation of stable investor groups. Efforts will be made to create
mechanisms and promote an investor mentality that supports a broader ownership base,
thereby preventing excessive concentration of ownership exclusively in the hands of the bigger
investors.
vH. FREIGN ESTMENT
Foreign investors will be encouraged to participate in the privatization process,
especially in those enterprises where know-how is a determining factor for the well being and



- 36 -                 ~~~~ANNEX 2
- 36 -                           Page 4 of 4
development of the privatized SOE. Joint ventures with domestic partners will be especially
encouraged.
Percentage ownership or foreign participation in SOEs will be fixed and determined
on a case by case basis.
VII. REHAMSG SOE
SOEs which are not able to be privatized shall be managed by generally accepted
private management norms and standards. They shall enjoy complete autonomy and their
relationship with the Government shall be on a contractual basis in the context of a sound
institutional framework for the PE sector. Tutelage relationship will no longer exist between
the SOE and the State, as is the case today. As part of this commercialization objective,
Government also intends to phase out, over time, all direct or indirect subsidies to SOEs that
will not be privatized.
IX.   IPLEMENTATION OF THE PROCESS
The privatization process will be implemented with complete transparency in all
phases. To safeguard this transparency, the Government shall (i) establish a Public Enterprise
Rationalization Advisory Board made up of highly qualified, key individuals who will
accompany the entire privatization process, and (ii) design a detailed Privatization Procedures
Manual to serve as guidance for all downstream phases of privatization and adhere to its
provisions. Information about each case of privatization shall be broadly disseminated to the
general public.
Each case of privatization shall be preceded by a thorough evaluation by qualified
entities.
X.    OTHER ISSUES
SOE restructuring are constrained by the poor economic and financial state of the
majority of these parastatals as well as excess in the number of workers employed. With
national unemployment figures above the 25% mark, it is difficult to disassociate SOE
restructuring from the broader question of unemployment. Hence, the privatization process
must be conducted within the context of a broader economic reform to include training of
displaced workers as well as identification and creation of new employment opportunities in
the private sector.

ADVISORY SERVICES FOR THE DESIGN
OF A DIVESTffURE AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
IN STRATEGIC PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
BACKGROUND
1.           The Government of Cape Verde has made a commitment to ensure the most efficient
use of the national resources, by shifting towards a competitive market structure with a greater role
for the private sector. With the assistance of IDA, the Government is implementing a wide-ranging
reform program which gives the highest priority (i) to privatizing every activity presently in the
domain of public enterprises that can be operated more efficiently by the private sector, (ii) to
systematically improve the operational and financial performance of those public enterprises which
might not lend themselves to rapid or full privatization, and (ii) to promote new private sector-led
export generating and employment creating activities.
2.           As part of this program, the Government wants to commercialize the large public
enterprises performing a crucid1 economic or social service which may not lend themselves quickly to
privatisation. Under this program, the enterprises would be reorganized and would be required to
operate as profit-making commercial ventures without direct or indirect subsidies from the
Government, except in such cases as may be necessary and duly recorded in a performance
agreement, as compensation for loss-making public service for instance.
OB.ECTIV
3.           The objective is to develop a culture of efficient, goal-oriented, cost conscious and
accountable enterprises, whose management and staffs future would be linked with the fortunes of the
organization they operate.
4.           The enterprises slated for full commercialisation would be expected to operate
profitably and efficiently and be able to raise funds from the capital market purely on strength of their
own balance sheets. They would be expected to adopt private sector procedures in running their
business, subject to the regulatory powers of the Govermnent. They would be expected to earn a
minimum rate of return on the investment to be negociated each year.
5.           The enterprises slated for partial privatization will be expected to generate enough
revenue to cover their operating expenditures. The Government may then, where a demonstrable case
has been made, give them capital grants to finance their capital intensive projects.



-52-                                  ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 3
6.           Where the enterprises may need to receive financial support from the Government, the
relationships between the Government, board of directors, and management of the enterprises will be
governed by a performance agreement. Essentially, this will be an undertaking by the enterprise's
management garanteeing the attainment of certain clearly stated levels of financial, operating and
management performance on the conditions that the Government grants it adequate operational
autonomy and, if necessary as compensation for loss-making public service, adequate resources. The
performance agreement should: (i) help in giving a positive orientation and ensure that the enterprise
is able to fulfill efficiently its role in the national economy; (ii) identify a number of performance and
efficiency indices which the enterprise should, as a minimum, achieve annually taking one year with
another, whilst recognizing that subsequent events may not permit such an exact achievement in any
one year; (iii) provide an independent monitoring process whereby the actual performance by both
parties of their obligations under the agreement can be effectively monitored; (iv) provide the means
by which the magnitude and scope of the financial support by the Government to the enterprise can be
adjusted to meeting requirements; and (v) subject the enterprise to public scrutiny by the provision for
periodic publication of its accounts and reports.
7.           The enterprise which would continue to receive Government financial assistance under
partial commercialisation would be subjected to a time-bound program of withdrawal of such
assistance.
CONTENT OF THE ADVISORY SERVICES
9            Advisory services will be retained to perform a thorough business analysis of the
enterprises slated for commercialisation with a view to (i) evaluate the potential for gradual cession of
such activities of the public enterprise as can be more efficiently and profitably operated by the
private sector, and (ii) recommend the privatisation strategy for the transfer of activity (through
contracting out of the service for instance); second, the advisors will (iii) develop an action plan to re-
orientate the enterprise towards a new horizon of performance improvement, viability and overall
operational and financial efficiency and (iv) assist in the preparation of the performance agreement.
9.           During a first phase, the advisors will:
(a)    perform an operational audit of the enterprise, including (i) an analysis of the
operations, the organization and staffing, the accounting system and procedures, the
financial management, resources and outside operational constraints; and (ii) an
evaluation of the key personnel including the first level of management and/or
supervision.
(b)    divide the enterprise into its various economic components, such as profit or costs
centers, and evaluate the operational and financial contribution of each part of the
enterprise as a whole.
(c)    define the nature and extent of the public service to be offered, if any.



- 53 -                               ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 3
(d)   identify the part of the enterprise best suited to carry such a type of service and justify
the choice.
(e)   identify the components that should be left in the portfolio of the state, and specify the
components that should be privatized or liquidated.
(f)    develop recommendations for the privatization of the activities that could best be
operated by the private sector.
10.          The advisors will then assist in the preparation of a performance agreement to be
entered into between the Government and the management of the enterprise. Such an agreement will
detail:
(a)    The nature and extent of the service(s) to be offered.
(b)    The labour and other productivity targets to be achieved, over a period of three years,
for the technical as well as the administrative parts of the operation.
(c)    The economic and financial performance targets to be achieved over a period of three
years. These may be broken down for each profit or cost center of the enterprise, as
needed.
(d)    The expected return on investment before interests and taxes.
(e)    For products and/or services which might need to be subsidized: the amount and
timing of the payment by the Government of the subsidy needed to cover the
provision of a loss-making (even under conditions of good enterprise efficiency)
public service.
(f    The incentives to be offered to management including the board members for efficient
and profitable performances.
(g)    The content and periodicity of interim reports to be submitted to the Board and to the
Government to monitor the achievement of the performance targets.

maximum extent possible during the mission of the consultant(s).

BACKGROUND
1.           The Government of Cape Verde has made a commitment to ensure the most efficient
use of the national resources, by shifting from an inward-looking and largely administratively-
managed economy towards a competitive, market-driven economy with a greater role for the private
sector. With the assistance of IDA, the Government wishes to implement a comprehensive reform
program which will give the highest priority to: (i) privatizing a wide range of activities presently in
the domain of public enterprises that can be operated more efficiently by the private sector; (ii)
systematically improving the operational and financial performance of those public enterprises which
might not lend themselves to rapid or full privatization: and (ii) promoting new private sector-led
export-generating and employment-creating activities.
2.           As part of this program, the Government wants to commercialize the large public
enterprises performing a crucial economic or social service which may not lend themselves quickly to
privatisation. Under this program, the enterprises would be reorganized and would be required to
operate as profit-making commercial ventures without direct or indirect subsidies from the
Government, except in such cases as may be necessary and duly recorded in a performance
agreement, as compensation for loss-making public service for instance.
3.           One of the major issues in the inprovement of the efficiency and financial
performance of public enterprises lies in productivity improvements and the reduction of overstaffing,
which is prevalent. However, given the present fragility of the economy of Cape Verde, characterized
by the high level of unemployment (more than 25 percent of the active population), the Government
faces a special challenge in implementing this policy in such a way as to minimize its potential effect
on unemployment.
4.           To facilitate the process, the Government wants to recruit an advisor to organize a
program of transfer of staff from the restructured public enterprises to the private sector.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONSULTANT(S):
5.           Conduct an analysis of the existing and emerging private business activities, with a
special focus on private businesses in sectors related to public enterprises undergoing a restructuring

6.           Review the results of the operational audits performed in the PEs, and assist the

REPUBLTC OF CAPE VERDE
PRIVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TEWRMS OF REFERENCE
STUDY OF 1TMH LEGAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
BACKQROUND:
1.           The Government of Cape Verde has made a commitment to ensure the most efficient
use of the national resources, by shifting from an inward-looking and largely administratively-
managed economy towards a competitive, market-driven economy with a greater role for the private
sector. With the assistance of IDA, the Government wishes to implement a comprehensive reform
program which will give the highest priority to: (i) privatizing a wide range of activities presently in
the domain of public enterprises that can be operated more efficiently by the private sector; (ii)
systematically improving the operational and financial performance of those public enterprises which
might not lend themselves to rapid or full privatization: and (ii) promoting new private sector-led
exp'ort-generating and employment-creating activities.
2.           As part of this program, the Government wants to ensure that the legal business
framework is conducive to efficient business operations, and to promotion of the development of local
and foreign investment in Cape Verde.
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:
3.           The objective of the study is (i) to prepare a detailed diagnostic of the legal business
environment in Cape Verde, including an extensive review of all relevant laws and regulations and of
the operation of the judiciary system, to the extent that it has a direct or indirect impact on business
operations; and (ii) to develop recommendations to mak-e the legal environment more supportive of
the development and efficient operations of the business operators.
ROLE OF THE CONSULTANT:
4.           Taking stock of the review and diagnostic work already conducted, the consultant will
Identify and review all applicable laws and regulations governing the business operations in Cape
Verde. These include, but are not limited to: the commercial code, the investment code, the labor
law, the company law, the tax code, the real and intellectual property laws (including such aspects as
land registration and title security), the financial sector legislation and credit regulations, the laws and



- 57 -                                 ANNEX 10
Pagze 2 of 2
regulations governing market access and pricing, as well as relevant components of the civil code, as
it relates, for instance, to fraud or check bouncing. To this effect, the consultant will:
(a)    take stock of the present legal business environment, both regarding the laws
themselves and the administrative regulations and procedure governing their
implementation;
(b)    identify possible disfunctions and constraints, and assess their real or nominal impact
on the business sector;
(c)    analyze the causes thereof; and,
(d)    develop recommendations for improvement.
5.            In addition to an analysis of the legal provisions referred to in 2. above, the consultant
will also conduct an assessment of the organization, operation and practices of the judiciary system
affecting business. In this context, the consultant will, in particular, evaluate the capacity of the public
institutions responsible for planning and implementing the laws and regulations to efficiently and
predictably administer and enforce the laws and regulations and tne motivational effects on investors,
entrepreneurs and business operators. The review will include, but not be limited to such issues as:
the settlement of commercial disputes, the cost and delays in legal redress, arbitration, etc. The
consultant will (i) identify the aspects of the operating legal system which cause the most difficulties
for business operations; (ii) assess whether they adversely affect some sectors of activity (e.g. legal
barriers which inhibit the mobilization of savings, enforcement of contracts, informal and small scale
sector activities, financial intermediation) or some segments (e.g. foreign vs. local investors) more
than others; and, of the identified problem areas, (iii) evaluate which are the most amenable to change
and who are the major actors to be mobilized to initiate reforms
6.            To this effect, the consultant will conduct a survey among representatives of the
business community to evaluate the knowledge, understanding and confidence of the business
operators in the legal business framework and in the operation of the judiciary system in general. In
light of the feedback, the consultant will (i) classify the problem areas (roles and functions, structure,
access, procedures, costs, etc.) in these institutions; (ii) identify those most in need of reform; and
(iii) develop recommendations to improve both the knowledge and understandings of the laws and
regulations, and the implementation procedures of legal business framework.
