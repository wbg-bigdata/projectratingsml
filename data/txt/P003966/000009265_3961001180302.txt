MEWORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE, PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A THIRD NONFORNAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Repubilic of Indonesla for the
equivalent of US$69.5 million to help finance a Third Nonformal Education
Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace.
2.         Backaround.  Reduction of poverty is a major objective of the current
Indonesian Five-Year Plan (Repelita V). The recent Poverty Assessment and
Strategy Report indicated that poverty was closely correlated with low
educational attainment, and that low incomes reflected low productivity, also
associated with lack of basic education and vocational skills. Despite rapid
expansion of formal education, rates of literacy and of school enrollment and
completion are still lower for the poor. As part of its poverty alleviation
strategy, the Government (GOI) plans to use nonformal education (NFE) to reduce
the incidence of illiteracy and incomplete primary education, estimated to
affect 45% of adult males and 60% of females, and to supplement formal lower
secondary education and vocational training programs.
3.         The NPE programs of the Directorate of Community Education (Dikmas)
of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), which have been supported by
the Bank under two loans (Loans 1486- and 2355-IND), have proven an effective
vehicle for reaching large numbers of adults who have been bypassed by the
formal education and training systems. The Second Nonformal Education Project
supported programs of functional literacy training ("Paket A%), as well as
providing technical assistance and funds for income-generating groups ("Kejar
Usaha"), informal apprenticeships ("Magang"), and private vocational training
("Diklusemas"). Although the project met or exceeded quantitative goals,
insufficient attention was paid to program quality, as outlined below.
4.         Rey Sector Issues and Lessons of Experience.  As highlighted in the
PCRs for the first two NPE projects, Dikmas has demonstrated the capacity for
effective nationwide outreach and for efficiently implementing large-scale NFE
activities. However, nearly universal access to primary education and the
success of Dikmas' basic literacy program has shifted the priority to post-
literacy programs. In addition to continuing to provide basic literacy, new
learning materials and training techniques are needed to consolidate literacy,
improve community, family life and vocational skills, and offer differentiated
programs for varying educational and skill needs. Moreover, a pilot nonformal
alternative to lower secondary education (as part of efforts to meet GOI policy
objectives of universal access to nine years basic education), needs further
testing and revision. The existing NPE income-generating programs need to be
modified to offer more systematic, structured training and to use existing
credit programs rather than direct funding to assist micro-enterprise
beneficiaries. NPE programs should target poverty areas and beneficiaries more
effectively, including special efforts to increase the benefits of NFE for
women, and seek more active involvement of NGOs and community groups.



Improvements in the quality and focus of NFE programs have been hampered by
insufficient and inadequately qualified staff, particularly at the field level,
despite considerable investment in inservice staff training. Unnecessary
duplication between project and routine management structures and inadequate
c1oodination with activities of other government agencies and NGOs, have also
constrained program quality. In addition, insufficient operating budgets,
especially for travel, have hindered the effective field outreach that is the
core of NFE and undermine the sustainability of project investments. Finally,
greater attention needs to be paid to monitoring the effectiveness and impact of
NFE programs, in order to adjust program content and delivery.
5.         Government Strategy.  Reduction of the incidence of poverty in
Indonesia is one of the main goals of Repelita V. Investment in the human
capital of the poor is an important element of the Government's poverty
alleviation strategy, as a way of raising both their quality of life and social
welfare, as well as increasing their ability to participate effectively in the
benefits of economic growth.  Nonformal education and training is an integral
part of GOI's poverty strategy, as one of the basic social services to be
provided to the "poverty pockets" that have been left behind iu the overall
growth process, as well as a key feature of its strategy for women-in-
development (WID). Human resource development, through increased access to
education and training, is also a cornerstone of current GOI policy. Universal
basic (nine years) education is a central policy objective, to be provided
either through formal schooling or out-of-school equivalents. Nonformal
education is an attractive basic education alternative, due to many young
persons' economic inability to study full-time as well as the current lack of
places in formal secordary schools. Nonformal skill training also complements
the more structured vocational education provided in technical and commercial
secondary schools and in Ministry of Manpower vocational training centers.
6.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Promcting poverty reduction,
including special attention to particular problems of women, is a major element
in the Bank's overall strategy for Indonesia. The proposed project would
support this strategy by providing a basic service, nonformal education and
training, to disadvantaged areas and groups who have been bypassed by formal
systems, to improve their quality of life and productivity. As basic literacy
becomes more widespread, the Bank has encouraged Dikmas to reorient the content
and delivery of its NE! programs to fill new training needs and to target them
more effectively to poverty beneficiaries. While Dikmas has extensive
experience in basic literacy training, its new programs, which focus on post-
literacy and income-generating skills and require targeted delivery systems,
could benefit from international experience. Bank financing would therefore be
concentratad on the latter activities.
7.         Project Objectives end Description.  The project would contribute to
improving the human capital of the poor, through enhancing their basic education
and inacome-generating skills, by assisting Dikmas to improve and expand its
existing NYE programs and to develop and test new programs to meet the changing
needs of its clientele. The project would have three parts: the Basic Program,
the Intensive Program, and National Support Services. The Basic Program (BP)
would continue the provision of basic literacy training ("Paket A") to
illiterates and primary school dropouts throughout the country. The Intensive
Proaram (IP) would implement a special strategy comprising modified and new



programs and test a more intensive delivery system in about one-quarter of the
poorest subdistricts, especially targeted to low-income beneficiaries. The IP
would comprise: (a) a strengthened version of the Paket A literacy training
program aimed at consolidating basic literacy and developing higher leels of
functional literacy; (b) development, testing, revision and limited
implementation of an out-of-school equivalent ("Paket B") to lower secondary
education; (c) upgrading of private vocational courses, including scholarships
for low-income trainees; (d) expansion and improvement of an informal
apprenticeship program; (e) training in small business management skills and
technical assistance to "KeJar Usaha" (KU) income-generating groups. The
National Support Services (NSS) component would strengthen Dikmas' capacity to
design, manage, deliver, monitor and evaluate the new strategy to be implemented
through the IP, as well as to carry out its ongoing NFE programs. The NSS
component would support: (i) improvement _f the quality of preservice and
inservice staff training for NFE staff, and training of trainers for staff of
private vocational courses; (ii) construction/renovation and equipment of NFE
support facilities, including Dikmas hes3quarters, district and regional
resource centers; (iii) improved project management and implementation systems
for the IP areas; and (iv) strengthened capacity for project monitoring and
evaluation of project implementation and program impact.
8.         The proposed project will be implemented by Dikmas over a five-year
period. The project cost is estimated at US$99.3 million equivalent, including
contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$15.1 million (15%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amouxits and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9805-IND, dated
November 8, 1991, is being distributed separately.
9.         Atreed Actions.  A Ministerial decree to integrate project management
and routine management structures has been signed and an NFE Staffing Action
Plan has been approved by the MOEC. During negotiations, the following
agreements were reached: (a) IP subdistricts and beneficiaries, private
training institutions, apprenticeship enterprises, technical assistance resource
persons, and civil works sites, would be selected according to satisfactory
criteria and procedures; (b) scholarships would be provided to trainees at
private training institutions and apprentices at enterprises, and learning plans
for KU groups and Magang apprentices would be provided or developed, according
to satisfactory model contracts and formats; (c) implementation of Paket B under
the project would be based on a satisfactory revised program; (d) inservice
staff training (including the intensive training program), would be based on a
satisfactory Master Training Plan which would be reviewed by GOI and the Bank by
October 31, 1992 and updated annually; (e) the necessary authorizations for
establishment of new learning and-resource centers (SKBs) would be obtained
prior to completion of construction; (f) project-financed equipment and vehicles
would be allocated on the basis of a satisfactory plan; (g) the Staffing Action
Plan would be implemented including appointment of 12 additional staff to the
Project Management Unit by June 1, 1992; (i) a revised system for monitoring and
evaluation would be put into place by April 1, 1993; (j) annual project
implementation plans and budgets would be reviewed jointly by GOI and the Bank;
and (k) potential suppliers of foreign vehicles would be notified that they can



- 4 -
bid on project contracts and the necessary import licenses would be made
available in a timely manner to firms awarded contracts for procurement of
foreign vehicles. Provision of a field supervisor and additional field workers
to key IP su'1districts would be a condition of loan disbursement for key IP
expenditures in those subdistricts.
10.        Benefits and Risks.  The project would contribute to the Government's
poverty alleviation, human resource development and WID strategies. It would
improve and consolidate the basic education and family life skills of about 1.5
million adults, through provision of the "Paket A" literacy training program.
Most of these would be illiterates or primary school dropouts who have been
bypassed by the formal education system, and are expected to be below the
poverty line. The income-earning opportunities of about 400,000 disadvantaged
beneficiaries from poor target areas would be improved, through provision of
vocational and income-generating skills. Improved basic and income-generating
skills would allow poor people to increase their productivity and incomes,
improve their access to public services, and participate more effectively in the
overall growth process. Women are expected to account for at least 602 of
literacy learners and over half of income-generating program beneficiaries, and
their participation would have important benefits in terms of improved family
health and nutrition, acceptance of family planning, encouragement of their
children's education and increased interest in community development. The
project would strengthen Dikmas' capacity to develop, test and implement new
programs to meet changing needs for nonformal education. New approaches for
reaching the poor, such as working with NGOs, would be tried out.
11.        Previous strong implementation performance under two Bank-financed
projects and provision for annual project reviews reduces overall implementation
risk. However, ineffective targeting of project services could undermine their
poverty impact. This risk would be reduced through agreed selection criteria
and procedures and strengthened project monitoring systems. Lack of sufficient
staff, particularly at the field level, and inadequate recurrent funds would
impede improvement of program quality and targeting. Approval of a Staffing
Action Plan and financing of incremental recurrent costS, including honoraria
for additional contract field staff, under the loan would reduce this risk.
12.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
