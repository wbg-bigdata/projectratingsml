FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
SECOND PDFCI PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $15 million to the
Republic of Indonesia for relending to the Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Interest on the loan would be at 8.5 percent
per annum. The proceeds of the proposed loan would be onlent to PDFCI at an
interest rate of 11 percent. The amortization schedule will be adjusted
to conform substantially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of
subloans made by PDFCI, whose maturity will not exceed 15 years including 3
years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Public Sector Investment
and Financial Resources in Indonesia" of May 24, 1976 (1187-IND) evaluated
and analyzed Indonesia's public sector investment programs in relation to
the resource availabilities in the next three years. An economic mission has
recently visited Indonesia and its report is expected to be ready about the
middle of March 1977. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        In most respects, Indonesia's economic performance in the past
eight years has been impressive. GNP growth has averaged 7.5 percent. The
rates of investment and national savings have risen rapidly, and net foreign
transfers have correspondingly declined as a proportion of GNP. Agricultural
output has expanded at an average rate of 4 to 5 percent (with rice production
expanding in step). The beginnings of modern industry have been set up and
the country is already virtually self-sufficient in fertilizer and is likely
to be so in cement within the next two or three years. Transport, power and
telecommunications systems and other infrastructure have been improved and
strengthened. In short, in its third year of the Second Development Plan
(1974-79), the economy is basically robust and provides a sharp contrast to
the situation less than a decade ago.
4.        However, very difficult and serious problems remain.   The country
and the overwhelming majority of its people are very poor. Average per
capita GNP is now estimated at $180 and 59 percent of the population lives

of their official duties. Its contnts may not otherwie be disclosd wthlout World lek authorization.

at levels below the absolute poverty base. The population growth rate is
rising and is currently estimated at 2.5 percent, and population pressure on
Java has been growing. Many new employment opportunities have been created
but much more needs to be done to provide employment for all the new entrants
into the labor force and reduce existing unemployment and underemployment.
General nutrition standards have probably improved, but real wage rates for
unskilled labor are still among the lowest in the region, and have shown only
a modest improvement. The Government is committed to the alleviation of
these problems. Projects to shift population from Java to unused cultivable
areas in other islands to increase productivity and incomes of farmers in
Java, to provide employment in a large rural works project and to improve
public education, health, water supply and other conditions in both rural and
urban areas are going forward.
5.        The country's resource position, balance of payments and the
Government budgetary situation have been dominated in the last two to three
years by the developments in the oil sector. First, there were the successive
increases in the price of oil in 1973 and 1974, which resulted in its quadru-
pling to $12.60 per barrel within a matter of months. With this increase, by
mid-1974 the balance of payments and revenues of the Government were improved
sustantially.
6.        In the course of the 1974/75 fiscal year, the Government adjusted
its expenditure plans. As a consequence, most expenditure elements in the
development budget were revised upwards, some very substantially, to utilize
the unanticipated revenues. On the current expenditure side, a large and
much needed increase in the civil servants' salaries was granted. Over the
first six months of the fiscal year, the country's foreign exchange reserves
registered an increase of $650 million from a level of $930 million at the
start of 1974/75.
7.        In October 1974, however, the first signs appeared of what turned
out to be a substantial financial over extension by PERTAMINA, the national
oil company. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment
program financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing and in part
not financed at all. With the initial signs of a recession, monetary insti-
tutions in the industrialized countries became restrictive, credit became
more difficult to obtain and PERTAMINA began experiencing serious financial
problems. In the third quarter of 1974/75, it started withholding part of
the corporate oil tax it had collected on behalf of the Government from the
foreign oil companies; by the end of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 bil-
lion ($830 million) had been so withheld and used to meet PERTAMINA's
financial obligations. Early in 1975, PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due
to some foreign banks, and the Government stepped in to stem an incipient
crisis and took decisive action. All independent foreign borrowing by
PERTAMINA and other public enterprises was banned and Bank Indonesia was
given sole authority to contract foreign obligations on behalf of the public
sector. The Government instructed Bank Indonesia to provide the funds needed
to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, undertook a comprehensive review of



- 3 -
the oil company's investment projects and began the process of reducing and
replanning the company's investment program and of cancelling and renegoti-
ating many of the related procurement contracts. In the course of 1975, the
Government also initiated the reorganization of the oil company, and in March
1976, replaced its top management.
8.        At about the same time, the recession in the industrialized coun-
tries began to affect petroleum consumption and oil sales from Indonesia
began to suffer. Non-oil exports, particularly those of timber and rubber,
also began to decline. The volume of oil production declined sharply, to
less than 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) compared to 1.45 million bpd in
the first six months of 1974. In the 1974/75 fiscal year, there was a
shortfall of about $200 million in net oil exports from the levels projected
early in the year, and non-oil exports failed to increase at all.
9.        These factors combined to create considerable financial diffi-
culties for the Government of Indonesia. The foreign exchange reserves
gained in the first half of the year were lost in the second; by March 31,
1975 these reserves had declined to the level of a year earlier (i.e.
$920 million). On the domestic front, the Government, after the promise of a
very large expansion in development expenditures, had to resort to financing
by Bank Indonesia of much of the investment programs of public enterprises
which were expected to be financed by increased tax revenues. Nevertheless,
total development expenditures in 1974/75 amounted to Rp 770 billion ($1.9 bil-
lion) about 60 percent (about 20 percent in real terms) higher than the
level in the previous year.
10.       In the first half of 1975/76, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves
declined by a further $480 million, despite substantial capital inflows,
which included two syndicated public borrowings (totalling $575 million) from
the international capital market. With continuing recessionary conditions in
Indonesia's principal markets, exports failed to increase while imports rose
again in 1975/76 (about 30 percent on an annual basis). Payments on behalf of
PERTAMINA were also very large (about $1 billion). In the second half of
1975/76, there was no appreciable change in export earnings, but imports and
debt service payments were lower and there was only a small reduction in
capital inflows (two more cash loans, amounting to $475 million, were raised).
The country's foreign exchange reserve position was, therefore, relatively
stable in this period and the decline in the reserves for the year as a whole
amounted to $360 million.
11.       Public sector investments continued to rise rapidly in 1975/76.
The Government's development expenditures amounted to over $3 billion
(Rp 1.27 trillion), including foreign project financing totalling $925 mil-
lion and fertilizer subsidies amounting to $320 million. This is more than
two and one-half times the expenditures in 1973/74; when adjusted for price
changes it still represents an increase of about 60 percent. A further
increase of 50 percent in development expenditures was budgeted for 1976/77.



- 4 -
12.       As stated above, the Government has had to borrow over $1 billion
on commercial terms and has had to divert substantial additional financial
resources to completing PERTAMINA's investment projects which could not
economically be reduced further or abandoned. A considerable share of these
investments was also financed through domestic credit expansion. Despite a
substantial decrease in foreign exchange reserves, money supply increased by
40 percent in 1974 and 30 percent in 1975. This contributed to domestic
inflation which was at the rate of 20 percent in 1975/76, a rate higher than
that prevailing in Indonesia's principal trade partners and competitors.
13.       The recent financial difficulties will affect Indonesia's external
public debt service obligations during the rest of the decade. Debt service
payments over the next several years will be much larger than previously
envisaged as a result of large commercial borrowings in 1975 and 1976 (most
but not all of which related to PERTAMINA's obligations and projects) by the
Government. Debt service in 1976 is now estimated at about $800 million,
which would be about 14 percent of the value of projected exports, with oil
exports on a net basis, i.e. net of the foreign exchange costs of production,
refineries and domestic distribution and of foreign investment income. Debt
service payments on all loans contracted up to December 31, 1975 are likely
to reach $1.25 billion by 1978, before declining as shorter-term maturities
are paid off. This excludes obligations contracted by PERTAMINA on account
of oil tankers which the Government is currently attempting to renegotiate.
This enlarged debt service will, in future years, sharply reduce net resource
transfers which were of the order of $500-600 million in 1973 and 1974, and
between $1 and $2 billion in 1975 and 1976. To keep the debt service burden
manageable, recourse to medium-term commercial borrowing in the next few
years will, therefore, have to be kept to a minimum, and certainly much below
the 1975 and expected 1976 levels.
14.       Confronted with these problems the Government has taken a series
of important, far-reaching and difficult decisions. It has decided that
foreign borrowing must be cut back sharply from the 1976 projected level of
about $3.4 billion to about $2 billion in each of the years 1977 and 1978
before being allowed to rise again to about $3 billion in 1980. With a view
to keeping the debt service burden manageable, it aims to effect most of the
reduction through a sharp cut in the least concessionary borrowings, especially
in the early years. On this basis, the debt service ratio is expected to
reach 18 percent in 1980 and would be at about the same level in 1985.
15.       In view of the expected sharp decline in net foreign resource
transfers, the Government has also decided to increase domestic revenues in
the next few years much faster than was originally contemplated and to levels
much higher than those likely to result from a mere continuation of the
existing tax policies and procedures. The Government also plans to reduce
selectively the aggregate size of the proposed public sector investment
program. This action is aimed at shifting the balance of the public sector
investment program towards a greater emphasis on directly improving the
income earning opportunities, productivity and living conditions of the mass
of the population.
16.       The balance of payments performance in the first half of 1976/77
has been better than expected earlier and the outlook for the second half



- 5 -
is very good. Non-oil exports have risen faster and imports have risen more
slowly than expected and the Government has not resorted to excessive borrow-
ing. The Government-has virtually completed its negotiations with the foreign
oil companies which will increase its share in the profits from oil production.
The recent drought in Indonesia is likely to have reduced rice output, but
stocks are normal and imports have been ordered in time so that no pressure
on prices is expected.
17.       The country has a substantial potential for productive investment,
employment and income growth. In agriculture vigorous pursuit of ongoing
programs in irrigation, development of new plant varieties and technical
services, provision of credit and current inputs, etc. promise to yield
high returns. In addition, there are opportunities for the development of
new areas of food and plantation crops, partly in conjunction with a grow-
ing transmigration program. The industrial potential is good, both for
modern, capital intensive natural resource-based activities and for more
labor intensive, partly export-oriented industries.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
18.       The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for
a development program which provides productive work opportunities (with
resultant increased incomes) for Indonesia's presently underemployed and
growing labor force. To assist the Government in attaining its goals the
Bank is planning to maintain or increase its lending to Indonesia and
in particular to support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit,
research and extension; rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems; improve
nutritional levels; assist transmigration and other land development outside
Java and Bali for and by smallholders; increase nonagricultural employment
in the rural areas and small towns through the establishment of small-scale
industries, rural credit schemes, vocational and nonformal education programs;
develop the electric power system; construct urgently needed water supply and
transport facilities; and expand the national family planning program.
19.       As of November 30, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits
totalling $561.8 million and 20 Bank loans amounting to $1,011.5 million.
At that date, IFC investments totalled $59.6 million. At the end of 1975
the Bank Group accounted for about 5 percent of Indonesia's total (disbursed)
outstanding public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent
of total outstanding debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations.
A summary statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of
November 30, 1976, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects are
contained in Annex II.
20.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
seven Bank loans and IDA credits for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
irrigation systems, two for fisheries, and one each for seeds production, beef



- 6 -
cattle, sugar, smallholder tea, smallholder rubber, agriculture research,
food crop extension services and transmigration. In the industrial sector,
the Bank has assisted in three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer pro-
duction and distribution capacity, three for development finance companies
(Government-owned and private) which play a major role in fostering the
growth of industrial enterprises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial
estate. Loans and credits have also been extended to the education, tele-
communications, tourism, power, transportation (including highways, inter-
island shipping and ports), population, urban and water supply sectors. Also
a loan was extended for a national resource survey and mapping project and
four credits for technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and
formulating its development programs and projects.
21.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June
1974. Disbursements on loans and credits are now at satisfactory levels.
The Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the cost to
the country of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome pro-
cedures and the need to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS
(the National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request,
the Bank has arranged for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance
Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system, which
it is hoped will lead to better project administration.
22.       The proposed loan is the fourth presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year and would bring total lending to Indonesia this
year to $129.5 million. Negotiations for a loan of $116 million for a
proposed sixth power project have been substantially completed and it is
expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in the near future.
Projects for another DFC (BAPINDO), nucleus estate smallholder development,
education, rural credit, small business development, irrigation and nutrition
are expected to be ready for presentation in the next several months.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
The Role of Industry
23.       In Indonesia, over the long term, heavy reliance is being placed
on industrial expansion to achieve income and employment growth targets.
In view of the necessity that the industrial sector provide substantially
increased employment opportunities, the Government is attempting to encourage
the development of small and medium-scale industries using labor-intensive
methods of production.
24.       Industry (manufacturing, mining and construction) represents the
third largest sector in the Indonesian economy (after agriculture and services),
accounting for 27 percent of the gross domestic product in 1974 and providing
employment for around 8 percent of a labor force that totalled about



- 7 -
40 million in 1971. The industrial sector has assumed increasing importance
in recent years, with value added growing in real terms at an average rate of
about 17 percent per annum between 1971 and 1974. However, during 1974 and
1975 the growth of the industrial sector slowed down to an annual rate of
about 11 percent; mining output expanded by 3 percent, manufacturing by 16
percent and construction by 22 percent in 1974. More recently, the industrial
sector has shown signs of recovery. Demand for petroleum and forest
products has strengthened in export markets and textile production is on the
rise.
25.       Although in recent years a number of new types of industrial
enterprises have been established, such as industrial chemicals, steel
products and motor vehicle and radio and television set assembly, their
direct contribution to employment creation has been minimal. Very small-
scale enterprises /1 represent an overwhelming majority (97 percent of the
total number of industrial firms); in 1972, they accounted for 64 percent of
industrial employment even though they were responsible for only 17 percent of
manufacturing value added. Even within the group of establishments exceeding
the definition of small-scale enterprises, firms with up to 100 employees
accounted for 90 percent of the number of such establishments, employed
around 32 percent of the labor force and contributed 18 percent of value
added in manufacturing. Geographically, manufacturing activity is concen-
trated in Java, particularly in the Jakarta area.
26.       The Government's polices on industrial investment are partly reflected
in the incentives it provides under the Domestic and Foreign Capital Investment
Laws which are administered by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB).
These incentives usually apply equally to domestic and foreign companies but
are not automatically granted as a package. The main elements of the incentive
system include initial tax holidays, reduction or exemption from import
levies and accelerated depreciation allowances. The Government also influences
the course of industrial development through the tariff system, some
direct import controls and, to a lesser extent, the interest rate policy.
The Financial Sector
27.       In terms of structure, diversity of institutions, financial services
offered and the variety of financial instruments available for mobilizing
savings, the financial system in Indonesia is still in its early stages of
development. Indonesia's financial sector consists of Bank Indonesia, 5
large State commercial banks, 4 national development banks (the Government-
owned Development Finance Company (BAPINDO), the Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI), the Indonesian Development Finance Corporation
(IDFC), P.T. Bahana, 26 regional development banks (RDBs), 11 branches of
foreign banks, 97 small private domestic commercial banks, and about 5,000
savings and small village and rural banks. There are also 11 merchant banks
and a dormant stock exchange. Overall, the financial system remains princi-
pally geared to serving short-term financing needs.
28.       Over the last few years, the Government has attempted to remedy
some of the shortcomings of the financial sector. BAPINDO, the State-owned
/1 Defined by the Government as those employing 10 workers or less without
power equipment, or 5 or less with power equipment.



- 8 -
development bank, was reorganized with Bank Group assistance, with a view to
making it the predominant source of medium and long-term finance for both
public and private industry. It is the only State bank allowed to grant term
loans with maturities of over five years. A program to upgrade the five State
commercial banks was initiated and is still underway. In 1972 IDFC was
reorganized as a joint venture between the Government (through Bank Indonesia)
and the Netherlands Overseas Finance Corporation, in which the Dutch Government
has a majority interest. IDFC specializes in assisting small industries and
extends term loans, participates in equity financing and provides a limited
amount of technical assistance to its clients. In 1973, again with Bank Group
assistance, the Government was instrumental in establishing a third, largely
privately-owned development bank (PDFCI), which is empowered to make medium
and long-term loans, invest in equity and provide technical and managerial
consultancy services. The same year (1973) a specialized institution, P.T.
Bahana, was set up to provide equity financing and managerial assistance to
financially weak enterprises. Since 1973 when a law was passed governing the
establishment and operations of non-bank financial intermediaries, 11 merchant
banks have been set up as joint ventures between foreign and local banks.
Finally, to help meet the need for term financing and assist in small-scale
industrial development, the Government has instituted two investment credit
schemes, the Medium-Term Investment Credit (INVESTASI) and the Small Invest-
ment Credit (KIK and KMKP) programs, administered by Bank Indonesia and
handled by the state commercial Banks. Both types of credits carry a maximum
term of five years.
29.       The main source of medium-term credit (up to five years) remains
the INVESTASI program which was introduced by the Government in 1969. Under
this program, term loans are available for almost all sectors from State
banks and RDBs, with Bank Indonesia refinancing 65 to 80 percent of the loan
amounts. Loans under the program bear an interest rate ranging from 12 to
15 percent per annum and carry maturities of between one and five years.
30.       Financing for Small Scale Industries is provided by two credit
schemes, the Kredit Investasi Kecil (KIK) for financing fixed investment and
the Kredit Modal Kerja Penanaman (KMKP) for working capital financing. Both
schemes are handled by State banks and selected RDBs, with the Bank Indonesia
refinancing 70 to 80 percent of the loan amounts disbursed. All productive
activities in industry, agriculture, trade and services are eligible for KIK
and KMKP financing. A limit, however, has been placed on the maximum loan
amount which may be approved for any single project. It is presently Rp 5
million ($12,000 equivalent) under both KIK and KMKP. Maturities range from
one to five years including a grace period of up to two years, with interest
rates of 12 percent for KIK and 15 percent for KMKP loans. As of February
1976 over 60,000 loans had been approved under both schemes for an amount
exceeding Rp 65 billion ($157 million), of which Rp 46 billion had been
disbursed. Bank financing for a small business development project has been
requested by the Government and the appraisal report is being prepared.
31.       In 1972 the Government established P.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia
(ASKRINDO) to insure bank loans made to small businesses for up to 75 percent



- 9 -
of the total risk. This automatic insurance was introduced to induce State
banks to pursue more vigorously their term lending to small scale enterprises.
The premium for this insurance, which is a flat fee of 3 percent of the loan
amount, is paid equally by the participating State bank and Bank Indonesia.
Interest Rates
32.       While interest rates applied by State banks are set by Bank
Indonesia, the private banks are free to set their own rates. At present,
deposit rates range from 6 percent per annum for one month time deposits with
State banks and for demand deposits with private banks, to 21 percent for
18-month and 24 percent for 24-month time deposits. Rates on certificates
of deposit range from 7 percent (two weeks - private banks) to 13 percent
(12 months - State banks). Lending rates applied by State banks range from
12 percent for INVESTASI loans below Rp 100 million and for special short-term
agricultural credits, to 24 percent for all other short-term loans. Lending
rates charged by private banks are slightly higher than those charged by the
State Banks and, if the loans are financed from foreign exchange sources,
they usually carry a floating rate plus a fixed margin with the exchange risk
being assumed by the borrower. When compared with deposit rates, term lending
rates in Indonesia are low. However, term lending rates, including the
standard rate of 15 percent per annum, are not low in relation to prevailing
overseas market rates (para. 34), nor in relation to the expected rates of
future inflation in Indonesia (para. 35).
33.       This interest rate structure does not unduly affect the State banks
financially as they receive direct interest rate subsidies from Bank Indonesia
for their time deposits (e.g. 6 and 9 percent for 18 and 24 month time deposits
respectively) and a substantial portion of their lending is refinanced by Bank
Indonesia at a low rate (4 to 10 percent). But this rate structure affects
the profitability of private domestic banks and their ability to compete with
State banks for long-term deposits, since they are not eligible for interest
rate subsidies. The Government is reviewing the present structure of interest
rates and the Bank intends to join with the Government in discussion of
this matter in the near future.
34.       The convertibility of the rupiah also exerts some influence on the
domestic interest rate structure. Bank lending rates have remained rela-
tively low, in part because of the proximity of the Singapore and Hong Kong
financial markets which are prepared to lend, at least to the better estab-
lished companies, at rates about 2 or 3 percentage points above the Asian
dollar market rates. In general, Indonesian companies have been willing to
accept the foreign exchange risk because the risk was perceived as acceptable
in light of the stability of the rupiah. In previous borrowings from the
Bank Group by BAPINDO and PDFCI, and in the case of the proposed loan, the
Government has insisted on assuming the foreign exchange risk on the grounds
that the Indonesian rupiah was a relatively stable currency and because many
of the smaller, indigenously owned enterprises were not sophisticated enough



- 10 -
to appreciate the complexities and risks associated with assuming obligations
in a variety of currencies. The Government did not raise term lending rates
during the recent period of very high inflation since it was feared that
this would hurt the smaller and financially weaker enterprises (mainly
indigenous) which are unable to obtain offshore loans on their own, while
larger and stronger companies (usually non indigenous joint ventures) would
still be able to borrow from financial markets abroad, i.e. Singapore and
Hong Kong. The cost of borrowings from the Singapore and Hong Kong markets is
at present below 10-11 percent (with foreign exchange risk borne by the
borrower).
35.       The rate of inflation was 40 percent in 1974 but declined to 19
percent in 1975 and is likely to be about 17 percent in 1976. As a result
of curbs on the expansion of total liquidity and other policies to combat
inflation the Government expects to be able to further reduce the rate of
inflation to an average of about 10 percent over the 1976-80 period. In this
case the 15 percent standard rate for medium and long-term credits would
represent a positive real rate of around 5 percent which is satisfactory.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The proposed loan is the fourth Bank loan for financing industrial
investment in Indonesia. One credit (Cr. 310-IND) and one loan (Ln. 1054-IND)
were made for relending to BAPINDO. The third (Cr. 436-IND) was made in
1974 for PDFCI. Progress on Cr. 436 was slow in 1975, but commitments have
risen very satisfactorily in 1976. As of December 31, 1976, out of the
credit of $10.0 million, about $9.9 million was committed. (More details are
included in Annex II.) The proposed project was appraised in July 1976 and
negotiations were held in Washington on December 13 to 15, 1976. The leader
of the Government delegation was Mr. Irzan Tanjung, Secretary to the Director-
ate General of Monetary Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The appraisal report
No. 1293-IND on the project is being distributed separately and a loan and
project summary is contained in Annex III.
37.       Apart from replenishing PFDCI's resources the proposed loan will
further strengthen PDFCI's efforts to become an efficient and innovative
financial intermediary. PDFCI is expected to make a significant qualitative
contribution to the Indonesian financial system, which was the basic objective
underlying the initial decision in 1973 by the Government and the Bank
Group to create PDFCI. PDFCI enjoys a good reputation in the business
community for the integrity of its business methods and, on the basis of its
appraisal standards, is a suitable allocator of Bank funds for industrial
projects in Indonesia.
38.       As in the case of previous credits and loans to Indonesia, the
proposed loan would be made to the Government which, in accordance with its
policy, would also bear the foreign exchange risk. The Government would
relend the proceeds of the proposed loan to PDFCI at a rate of 11 percent per
annum under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank. The signing
of the subsidiary loan agreement is a condition for the effectiveness of the



- 11 -
proposed loan (Section 6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement). PDFCI intends to
relend the proceeds of the loan at a rate of 15 percent per annum, as long
as this remains the standard rate for medium and long-term credits charged by
state banks and financial insitutions in Indonesia. If this rate should
change, PDFCI could be expected to adjust its lending rate accordingly, but
in no case might its spread on the use of the loan proceeds exceed 4 percentage
points. The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance 100 percent of the
cost of directly imported machinery and equipment, 100 percent of the total
expenditures for the services of an expatriate adviser (see para. 42), 60
percent of the expenditures for capital goods domestically procured and 40
percent of the expenditures for civil works and locally procured vehicles.
The free limit for subloans will be $400,000, with an aggregate limit of $4.0
million. With this free limit, it is estimated that subloans accounting for
at least 70 percent of the proposed loan in terms of amount would require the
prior approval of the Bank, which would enable Bank staff to continue to
review subprojects carefully. As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the proposed
loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to
the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the subloans made by PDFCI. The
maximum term for subloans would be 15 years, including a grace period of 3
years.
39.       PDFCI is an institution predominantly owned and managed by the
private sector. At PDFCI's inception, IFC made an equity investment of
$482,000 accounting for eight percent of the company's share capital.
IFC was also primarily responsible for securing the participation of PDFCI's
present foreign shareholders. Of its paid-in share capital of Rp 2.5 billion
(about $6 million equivalent), 60 percent or Rp 1.5 billion is owned by
Indonesian shareholders including Bank Indonesia; the balance is owned by IFC
and eight foreign commercial banks. Bank Indonesia, with 21.8 percent of
PDFCI's share capital, is its largest shareholder. Bank Indonesia is likely,
in due course, to sell part of its shares to private Indonesian shareholders
in order to enlarge private ownership of PDFCI. As part of PDFCI's initial
capitalization, the Government also agreed to provide PDFCI with a subordinat
ed loan of Rp 2,075 million, of which Rp 1,660 million had been disbursed to
PDFCI as of June 30, 1976. This loan, which is repayable in 30 years includi
ng 15 years of grace, at an interest rate of 4 percent per annum, was designe
d to attract private Indonesian shareholders into PDFCI by improving PDFCI's
earning prospects, and gave evidence of the Government's commitment to and
concrete support of a private development bank in Indonesia. As of June 30,
1976, PDFCI's total assets stood at Rp 6.4 billion ($15.5 million).
Functions and Organization
40.       The main functions of PDFCI, as outlined in its policy statement
are to assist in the creation, expansion and modernization of private industr-
ial enterprises, to foster the development of the capital market, and to help
improve the technical, financial, managerial and administrative practices of



- 12 -
private enterprises in Indonesia. The policy statement specifically empha-
sizes promotional work as one of PDFCI's basic functions. PDFCI seeks to
provide a broader range of financial services to industry than those made
available by BAPINDO and IDFC, both of which concentrate mainly on straight
lending. PDFCI is empowered to make medium and long-term loans, to invest in
shares (normally up to 25 percent of the share capital of an enterprise),to
provide guarantees, to underwrite debt and security issues, and to supply
technical and consultancy services. It also intends to extend refinanc-
ing facilities in selected cases to improve the capital structure of viable
enterprises that are burdened with excessive short-term and medium-term
debt. At this early stage of its existence, owing to its limited managerial
and staff resources, PDFCI confines itself largely to basic development
financing functions (e.g. selection, appraisal and supervision of projects),
but, as it develops its institutional strength, it intends gradually to
broaden the scope of its operations to include the diversified activities
referred to above.
41.       PDFCI's Board of Directors comprises 13 members of whom 5 represent
the foreign shareholders and IFC. The Board lays down policy guidelines and
has the ultimate responsibility for all investment decisions. The authority to
approve individual investments and loans up to Rp 200 million ($482,000) has
been delegated by the Board to the Executive Committee, which is composed of
five members of the Board. Bank Indonesia plays an important role in the
overall direction of PDFCI's affairs on account of its broad influence over
the Indonesian financial system as well as its sizeable shareholding.
IFC is also represented on the Executive Committee.
42.       Overall, PDFCI's management is adequate and    the integrity of PDFCI's
business practices are well recognized in the business community of Indonesia
but there is still need for PDFCI to considerably strengthen its Indonesian
staff, both quantitatively and qualitatively. PDFCI will achieve this
objective by appointing a Deputy Chief Executive Officer to coordinate the
work of the project units, recruiting additional staff of good caliber and
continuing the training and technical assistance program which was started
with Credit 436-IND. As a result of financial constraints, UNDP could not
finance PDFCI's foreign advisors beyond October 15, 1976. Therefore, at the
request of the Government, Credit Agreement No. 436-IND was amended to
finance the services of these advisors up to June 30, 1977. The proposed
loan would finance the services of an advisor for two years after June 30,
1977 to assist PDFCI in development banking policy and project work.
Operations
43.       PDFCI opened its doors for business in March 1974.    As of
June 30, 1976, 14 loans and 4 equity investments had been approved by PDFCI
for 14 projects. These projects included a fairly broad range of indus-
trial activities, including agro-industries and services (tea plantations,
cassava pelletizing, tile manufacturing, hotel) and amounted to an aggregate



- 13 -
fixed investment cost of Rp 22.6 billion, including PDFCI's financing of
Rp 5,741 million ($13.8 million) of which Rp 343 million represented equity
investments. The average size of loans was Rp 385 million ($0.9 million).
The additional direct employment generated by the subprojects approved by
PDFCI is estimated to be about 3,400, at an average investment cost of
$16,000 per employee. The estimated economic rate of return of these pro-
jects is satisfactory, ranging from 14 percent to 42 percent.
44.       Although PDFCI's capitalization was completed in March 1974, its
first disbursement for a term-loan was made in April 1975. As of June 30,
1976, PDFCI's assets still consisted mostly of bank deposits and short-term
investments. The total assets of PDFCI stood then at Rp 6,447 million
($15.5 million) and had increased by over 35 percent over the preceeding
twelve months because of the growing volume of long-term lending operations.
Net income has also risen from Rp 235 million ($570,000) in 1975 to about
Rp 300 million ($723,000) on an annual basis for the first six months of
1976. The liquidity position remained sound; the current ratio was 7.5 as
of June 30, 1976.
45.       PDFCI's long-term loan and equity investment portfolios are still
very new but appear to be sound. As of June 30, 1976 total arrears stood
at Rp 80 million or 3.6 percent of the total loan portfolio. The portfolio
affected by arrears accounted for 23 percent of the total outstanding portfolio.
However, PDFCI is confident of resolving the difficulties of its two
overdue accounts and, at present, does not expect any portfolio losses.
Provisions for doubtful accounts at 2 percent of the outstanding portfolio is
adequate. The soundness of PDFCI's short-term investment portfolio is more
difficult to ascertain. By using its temporary surplus funds (its own equity
funds and the government subordinated loan) PDFCI has undertaken a variety of
money market operations, some of which appear to be potentially risky. As
of June 30, 1976 PDFCI held Rp 3,473 million ($8.4 million) or 54 percent
of its total assets in short-term commercial papers with maturities from 15
days to 13 months. Papers endorsed by certain financial institutions have
been rolled over many times which may indicate difficulty in collection.
An assurance has been obtained that PDFCI will not undertake short-term
money market operations using borrowed funds without consulting the Bank
(Section 4.07 of the Project Agreement).
Resource Requirements
46.       Because of the convertibility of the Indonesian currency, PDFCI,
in principle, can utilize its domestic currency funds for financing imports.
Furthermore the proceeds of Credit 436-IND are being relent by the Government
to PDFCI in rupiahs and, from PDFCI's standpoint, these funds can be treated
as domestic currency resources in the strict sense. However, it is the
Government's policy, based on balance of payments considerations, that
financial institutions such as BAPINDO and PDFCI should, as a rule, finance
imports with foreign borrowings, not with their rupiah funds. PDFCI follows
this policy in managing its overall resources by utilizing the proceeds of
the IDA Credit (Credit 436-IND) for financing imports (plus the estimated



- 14 -
foreign exchange components of domestically procured goods) and its rupiah
resources for financing local currency expenditures. Therefore, despite the
fact that the proceeds of external borrowings are relent by the Government
to PDFCI in rupiahs, such borrowings have been treated as foreign currency
resources.
47.       As of June 30, 1976 PDFCI's available domestic currency resources
totalled Rp 5.129 billion, enough to cover its projected commitments of
domestic currency loans and investments until mid-1978. The foreign currency
resource position is, however, much tighter. Credit 436-IND ($10 million)
constitutes PDFCI's only existing source of foreign exchange. As of December
31, 1976 about $9.9 million had been committed. It plans to process 12
projects in 1976, 16 in 1977, 20 in 1978, 27 in 1979 and 32 in 1980. PDFCI
expects to increase the volume of its annual commitments from Rp 5.1 billion
in 1976 to Rp 17.9 billion in 1980 with term loans accounting for about 90
percent of total approvals. Its local currency requirements are estimated at
Rp 17.3 billion for the period from January 1, 1976 through December 31,
1980. For its term lending PDFCI plans to commit about $75 million in foreign
exchange from January 1, 1977 through December 31, 1980, of which $15 million
would come from the proposed loan. The balance is expected to be obtained
from other external sources, which may include IFC, KfW and loan syndication
with the help of IFC. It is estimated that the proposed Bank loan would
cover PDFCI's foreign exchange requirements, on a commitment basis, until the
end of 1978.
48.       Net profit represented 7.2 percent of average equity for the first
six months of 1976. This ratio is expected to increase gradually to 12.2 per-
cent in 1980 as volume of lending increases. Personnel and administrative
expenses as a percentage of average total assets are expected to peak in 1976
at around 4.1 percent on account of staff build-up; this percentage should
decline gradually and reach about 1.5 percent in 1980, a level comparable to
that ultimately achieved by most DFCs associated with the Bank. Debt service
cover, calculated on a current annual basis, is expected to remain at or above
1.3 throughout the period 1976-1980, which is adequate. PDFCI will maintain
its debt/equity ratio below 3.0:1 which is satisfactory.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANiD AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the
Bank, and the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and PDFCI, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 15 -
50.       Features of the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 38 and 45 of this Report. The
execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and PDFCI
providing for relending of the proceeds of the Loan to PDFCI has been
made an additional condition of effectiveness of the Loan (Section 6.01(b)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
51. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation: U$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
All civil works were completed on March 31, 1976 and the credit is
fully committed.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates: US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The credit is fully commited.
Cr. No. 194 Second Agricultural Estates: US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is good in the oil palm group which has sur-
passed the appraisal report target for new planting by 100%. Progress in the
rubber group has been unsatisfactory with only 50% of the appraisal report
target for new planting achieved. Planting costs are excessive and investment
planning weak. The project has suffered from management deficiencies and
shortage of funds for investment. Following several representations by the
Bank, the Minister of Agriculture has recently made the necessary changes in
management of the rubber group. The Government is expected to review its
financial policies, particularly with regard to dividends and finance, to
ensure sufficient finance to implement investment programs.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 195 Second Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1977.
Progress has been delayed by initial difficulties in equipment
procurement and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction
costs. Project completion will therefore be about 2-1/2 years behind
schedule. The rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and
hydraulically adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is
expected to improve following the allocation by the Central Government of
operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than last year's
levels, as part of its commitment under the seventh irrigation project.
The credit is about 96% disbursed and the remaining funds will finance all
outstanding civil works. The estimated project cost has more than doubled
since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in contract quan-
tities, but the economic rate of return remains satisfactory because rice
prices and yields have been higher than those projected during appraisal.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries: US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
The credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 219 Education: US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970:
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
All civil works have been completed and the Credit fully committed.
Cr. No. 220 Third Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Overall project completion is expected by July 1977, about two
years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties
in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations, heavy
rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently high inflation rates
and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been mainly overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is expected to improve following the allocation by the Central Government of
operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than last year's levels,
as part of its commitment under the seventh irrigation project. The esti-
mated project cost is about twice the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and
yields substantially higher than those projected at appraisal enable the
project to retain an economic rate of return over 20%.

Cr. No. 246 Seeds: US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Construction of the irrigation infrastructure and the seeds pro-
cessing plant has been completed satisfactorily. The Credit is due to close
by September 30, 1977. It is likely that land development at Sukamandi will
be limited to about 1,600 ha (65% of appraisal estimates) by that date to
enable the project authorities to consolidate production and other operations.
Significant results for 1976/77 expressed as percentages of appraisal esti-
mates are expected to be: (a) area under production - 1,800 ha (58%), (b)
yields of rice seed - 3.5 tons per ha (87%), and (c) production of certified
seed - 4,900 tons (42%). It is clear that due mainly to the delay in the
development of irrigation infrastructure, and partly due to overly optimistic
assumptions during appraisal, the targets for per ha yield and certified seed
production will not be achieved by September 1977. The project also envisaged
the development of 2,000 ha in three districts for seed multiplication. Due
to cost escalations and implementation difficulties, only one district,
Klaten, has been developed, and the total area developed to-date is about 200
ha out of a total of 500 ha. Based on present levels of production the
National Seeds Corporation (NSC) is not commercially viable and will need
continued financial support from Government. The future of the project and
of NSC depend on Government policy for implementation of the further develop-
ment of the seed industry.
Cr. No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded appraisal expec-
tations necessitating constrlction and rehabilitation of three additional
factories. Project completion, estimated for December 1977, can probably be
advanced. Rising costs are creating pressure on available funds and the main
challenge for the two PTPs will be to reduce working capital requirements, as
well as overhead and indirect costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260 Second Highway: US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31,1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overrun has been relatively
small despite sharp price increases due to efforts to reduce construction
quantities, and to cost savings for consulting services. Construction work
is completed and final certifications and acceptance of work will be accom-
plished before the current Closing Date of December 31, 1976. A second
postponement of the Closing Date to December 31, 1978 has been agreed however
to permit payments for the completion of detailed engineering for the Padang-
Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to reconsider road design
standards in relation to those recently developed for the highway betterment
program and to take into account IDA s recommendations regarding standards
for urban portions of the road.

Cr. No. 288 Second Education: US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 30, 1978.
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of late
appointment of consultant architects and lack of funds to meet cost overruns.
The main causes of delay have ben overcome and significant progress is being
made. All civil works and about 90% of the furniture and equipment have been
contracted. The expert service is virtually completed. Progress of the
fellowship program and teacher training is satisfactory. The shortage of
full-time teachers, however, continues because of a Government embargo on new
recruitment. The Government has now made budgetary provisions to meet the
cost overruns. Disbursements have improved. Delayed implementation required
postponement of the closing date by 15 months to March 30, 1978.
Cr. No 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and
price escalation due to unexpected inflation. The bulk of the remaining work
will be accomplished largely with Government funds, since all but about $1
million of the credit has been disbursed. Postponement of the closing date
for the credit beyond June 30, 1977 may be required. Feasibility studies
included in the project have been completed and groundwater investigations
are nearing completion; interim reports were received in November 1976.
Cr. No. 300 Population: US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
General progress of this project is satisfactory. All vehicles
have been procured and are in the field; population education is now being
worked into formal and non-formal curricula; the lay field workers program
is fully operational; mobile information units are in use and more audio-visual
material is being prepared; support for a variety of family planning research
topics continues; and advisors have been provided for specific program needs.
Implementation of civil works is now proceeding well after initial delays;
the Government has provided funds for MCH/FP centers from other sources, and
is expected to propose a corresponding reduction in project content. The
national family planning program, of which the project is an integral part,
continues to expand in terms of new acceptors recruited annually and the
program is effectively reaching rural villages.

Cr. No. 310 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I): US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Prior to the original Closing Date which was December 31, 1976,
about $700,000 remained uncommitted and the Closing Date has therefore been
postponed to March 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation: US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Progress on this project is slow but funds are expected to be
fully committed by September 30, 1977. Due to substantial cost increases,
only about half of the anticipated tonnage will be rehabilitated.
Cr. No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Physical progress of the project which is being executed by PNP/X,
a Government-owned estate group, continues to be satisfactory, with plant-
ings of rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent
condition. Coffee is a promising crop, and cloves planted in 1974 are
growing well. A hybrid coconut seed garden has been established, the first
in Indonesia. PNP/X management need to pay more attention to cost control
and to financial planning. Substantial cost increases have taken place
largely due to an expansion in the size of the program compared with appraisal
estimates. The Government has agreed to provide part of the short-
fall in project funding and discussions with the Government are proceeding
on a proposed increase in the budgetary allocation. PNP/X will participate in
the execution of smallholder development under the Transmigration and Rural
Development Project (Loan 1318-IND.)
Cr. No. 334 Second Electricity Distribution: US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND and
334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays due to procure-
ment problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result the project is
two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties have been resolved
and recent progress is encouraging and no further delays are expected. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.

Cr. No. 355 Beef Cattle Development: US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date:  MIarch 31, 1980.           -
Several problems have seriously delayed project implementation.
Government s budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. The last supervision mission undertook
a thorough project review and its recommendations, which include major changes
in project scope and objectives, are presently under discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358 North Sumatera Smallholder Development: US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The full project program of oil palm and rubber planting by small-
holder participants should be completed by the end of 1977 at the present
rate of progress, which is now ahead of schedule. Costs of the project have
increased from $10 million estimated at appraisal to about $26 million by the
completion of the project. However, higher than anticipated output of and
prices for rubber and palm oil and changes in project development techniques
have more than compensated the cost increase and the project s return to the
economy is likely to be higher than anticipated at appraisal. In spite of
the impressive physical progress achieved, it has not proven possible to
develop any effective credit mechanism for the credit assisted portion of the
project. The Government will supply the funds for maintenance of plantings
through project completion at end of 1981. Supervision by IDA will continue
up to this date.
Cr. No. 387 Third Education: US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
school teachers. Distribution of the first 31 million textbooks has been
completed in all but the most remote areas. Teacher training continues to
proceed on schedule and teaching equipment has been procured and is being
repackaged in Jakarta for delivery to teacher training centers. Project manage-
ment has been strengthened by addition of Indonesian staff to a reorganized
project unit, and by-recruitment of specialists under a technical assistance
contract signed with UNESCO.
Cr. No. 388 Third Highways: US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections included in
the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts. Contractors have
been delayed mainly because of long mobilization periods and heavy rains; Closing



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 15 pages
Date is likely to be postponed by one year. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates by 70 percent mainly due to sharply escalated prices. The
training program has been successfully completed. Feasibility studies and
detailed engineering for the betterment program are nearing satisfactory com-
pletion.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara Karang
were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an
increase in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Government
will provide the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the
initial targets in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms
of the Credit Agreement.
Cr. No. 400 Smallholder and Private Estate Tea: US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Due to a late start, only 734 ha of smallholder tea has been
replanted or rehabilitated instead of 860 ha and thus the project is about
15% behind appraisal targets. It is estimated however that physical devel-
opment will be on target by the end of 1977. During 1975/76 the spin-off of
project to non-project smallholders has been excellent; about 350 ha of tea
was rehabilitated or replanted using funds outside the credit program.
Estate development has not yet started but it should also be on schedule by
the end of 1977. Tea prices for project farmers are well above appraisal
estimates. Project costs are estimated to be about 90% above appraisal
estimates and Government and project participants will have to finance the
overrun; alternatively project targets may have to be reduced.
Cr. No. 405 Sugar Industry Rehabilitation: US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The scope of the project has been reduced by the deletion of six
minor rehabilitations from the project description due to cost overruns.
The revised project consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories
and the construction of a new factory. Due to late project start-up and
delays in arranging consultancy services, project completion will be delayed
by one year. Civil works construction and installation of equipment is on
schedule and progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate: US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is developing satisfactorally and project completion
is scheduled for December 1981. Of 430 ha earmarked for the project, about
270 ha had been acquired by September 1976, and 128 ha had been developed
for occupation. Seventy-four factories are located on the estate of which
37 are operating and 37 are in various stages of construction or commission.
Factory employment is 16,275 and an estimated 1,400 are employed on average
in both factory construction and land development. Overall, operations are
profitable.
Cr. No. 436 Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorally. As of December
31, 1976, the Credit was almost fully committed.
Cr. No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial difficulties.
The evaluations of project tenders have been approved by IDA. Infrastruc-
ture construction started in July 1976 and completion is scheduled for
October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the Bali Tourism Devel-
opment Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Preliminary discussions
with three potential hotel investors are underway.Promotional efforts to
attract additional investors and tourists have been intensified during early
1976, and additional flights from Sydney and Hong Kong to Bali have been
approved by the Minister of Communications and Tourism.
Cr. No. 480 Fisheries Credit: US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the project has been making satisfactory
progress. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon has begun, and contracts
for boat construction and equipment have been awarded. Fishpond construction
is proceeding well. Bidding for ice plant construction should start soon.
The justification for the trawler subproject is being reviewed by the Govern-
ment.

Cr. No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Due to initial procurement difficulties and delays in the appointment
of the Jatiluhur Authority's President Director and the engagement of consultants,
execution of the first of four civil works contracts will start in February
1977, about a year behind the original schedule. A review of the latest project
cost estimate indicates substantial cost overruns which will be verified after
the evaluation of bid prices for the first civil works contract early in 1977.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been slow due to poor
organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now improved. The bulk of the
contracts have been signed. Passenger traffic in 1975 was slightly lower than
in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued to
decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and freight revenues
by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further,
as operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
Loan No. 1040 Jakarta Urban Development: US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program has been very good; costs
were less than estimated, allowing additional work to be undertaken. Execution
of the Klender Sites and Services Scheme is one year behind schedule due to
delays in obtaining approval of project design, but tenders for construction
have now been issued.
Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is running
13-18 months behind schedule. This delay together with higher rates of infla-
tion than anticipated is expected to increase project costs 25-30 percent above
the appraisal estimate. Detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents
have been completed and the project has reached its construction phase. The
reorganization of the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering and the establishment
and development of local water enterprises are proceeding satisfactorily.

some $30 million less than the original estimate of $130 million as a result of
lower foreign exchange and local costs than had been anticipated.
