(LOAN 1363 - IND)
Preface
This report reviews the achievements under Loan 1363-IND to the
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI) and covers PDFCI's
progress and its relationship with the Bank Group, particularly during 1980-
83. The period 1973-79, from PDFCI's inception uncil final disbursement and
closing of the first Credit (436-IND) to PDFCI was essentially covered by the
previous Project Completion/Performance Audit Report (No. 3862). The Bank
loan was approved on January 25, 1977, declared effective on April 21, 1977
and disbursed until April 30, 1982. The undisbursed amount of US$17,000 was
cancelled. This PCR was prepared by the Industrial Development and Finance
Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office,
based on a draft PCR prepared by PDFCI and file review. Comments received
from the Borrower are reproduced as Annex 25.
This project has not been audited by the Operations EvaLuacion
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA: PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA (PDFCI)
(LOAN 1363 - IND)
Highlights
PDFCI has been actively assisted by the World Bank Group since its
inception in 1973, and it obtained an IDA credit ($10 million) in conjunction
with an IFC capital subscription, ($0.48 million) in 1973, a Bank Loan ($15
million) and technical assistance in 1977. At its creation, it was intended
not merely to set up another financial institution, but one which wouLd
introduce innovative financial services and make significant contributions to
the Indonesian financial system.
PDFCI's principal objectives for the IDA credit were consequently
very broad. It was expected to influence Government policy related to the
financial sector, particularly capital market development, in addition to the
objectives of mobilization and transfer of resources and institution build-
ing. With hindsight it is now much more apparent that the unconducive
financial environment in which PDFCI was operating made the achievement of the
broader term goals extremely difficult, if not impossible. In the second Bank
operation, these broader sector objectives were relegated to long-term goals,
while special emphasis was given to sound development of Indonesian industry
by providing funds on suitable terms and strengthening PDFCI as an institu-
tion. Even so, the broader sectorial expectations for PDFCI were too
ambitious (para. 3.02).
Regarding the narrower institutional objectives of providing sound
term financing to industry, PDFCI's performance has been mixed. PDFCI was
largely able to establish the necessary technical capacity for project evalua-
tion, but was less successful in assessing the qualitative aspects of project
risk, due to difficuLties in recruiting and keeping experienced staff
(para. 5.06).  This in conjunction with ineffective project supervision has
resulted in poor overall portfolio quality, high arrears and relatively poor
loan collections (para. 5.07). The Bank loan proceeds, on the other hand,
were transferred to relatively sound industrial projects, whose financial and
economic impact were generally satisfactory (paras. 4.05-4.06). PDFCI's
equity financing program did not bear out expectations and was curtailed
(para. 5.11). PDFC' was also not able to introduce innovative services such
as syndication and underwriting and raise any resources either in the domestic
or international capitaL markets largely due to circumstances beyond its
control, however. It remained exclusively dependent on resources from Bank
Indonesia (BI) for its term lending operations (para. 5.09).
By and large, PDFCI has remained a small institution with a limited
capital base, working from the head office in Jakarta without the support of a
branch network, and an asset base not large enough to influence the financial
or industrial sectors or make a significant impact on development banking. In



-iv -
view of these constraints on its development banking activities, PDFCI saw
greater potential for further growth and development in money market
activities. These activities rapidly grew into PDFCI's mainstay and by the
end of 1983 accounted for 56Z of total assets and 65Z of gross revenue, but
were not profitable particularly in view of the need for large write-offs and
provisions for potential losses (para. 5.12).
Lessons to be learned from the project are (para. 7.05):
-    PDFCI's original objectives were too broad and ambitious in the
light of the environment in which it was operating and should have
been further modified in the context of the second Bank operation in
1977;
-    PDFCI was organized as a predominantly private institution.
However, it needed strong Government support in order to grow and
prosper and after the Government's decision not to guarantee its
foreign borrowings from multilateral financial institutions, it was
unable to find other sources of external financing. Strong
Government support is a condition sine qua non for the development
of an institution of this type, particularly in the early stage of
development;
-    a private institution like PDFCI is not likely to be able to play a
major role in mobilizing domestic resources, unless the overall
policy environment and state of capital market development are
conducive;
-    a major involvement in short-term money market operations for a
relatively inexperienced institution like PDFCI is inherently risky
and great prudence should be exercised and proper guidelines should
be in place before becoming involved in such activity on a major
scale; and
-    while PDFCI has developed some project appraisal capability as
evidenced by the relatively effective utilization of Bank funds, it
needed to give more attention to projects financed from other
sources and to more systematic project supervision.
In addition to short-term measures to improve its operational and
financial performance, PDFCI is faced with the major issue of whether to
continue focussing on development banking given the constraints it is exper-
iencing or broaden its scope of financial activities. Recent work done by the
Bank on the financial sector in Indonesia indicates that there is a need for
specialized development banks such as PDFCI to provide longer term finance. A
major issue concerns the steps necessary to enable such institutions to reach
greater commercial scale either through adjustment of Government policy or

INDONESIA: PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA (PDFCI)
(LOAN 1363 - IND)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Project History.  The Private Development Finance Company of
Indonesia (PDFCI), incorporated in 1973, was sponsored by a group of leading
private Indonesian investors and Bank Indonesia, and actively supported by the
Bank Group which participated in its initial capitalization with an IDA Credit
(Cr. 436-IND) of $10 million and an equity investment by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) amounting to 8Z of PDFCI's original share capital.
IFC was instrumental in organizing a group of foreign financial institutions
which, together with its investment of US$482,000, brought foreign participa-
tion in PDFCI's share capital to 40Z. In 1977, IBRD approved a Loan of
US$15 million to PDFCI (Ln. 1363-IND) which became effective in the same
year.  Both the Credit and Loan were for the financing of industrial projects
and technical assistance to PDFCI. In line with the general guidelines, this
PCR covers the achievements under Loan 1363-IND, PDFCI's progress and its
relationship with the Bank particularly during 1980-83 and focusses on the
performance of the subprojects financed under the Loan.
1.02      Evaluation of ResuLts of Previous Bank Group Assistance.  A Project
Performance Audit Report (PPAR) (No. 3862), covering IDA Credit 436-IND, was
prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department in 1982, on the basis of a
Project Completion Report prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office. The PPAR report covered in detail PiFCI's evolution, the relation
with the Bank Group and institutional developments from PDFCI's inception
until late 1979. The principal findings and recommendations of this report
were as follows: (i) the introduction of a western-style corporate management
structure instead of the traditional collective two-board system impeded
rather than supported the management process and was not in consonance with
the cultural background, attitudes and the way business is normally conducted
in Indonesia; (ii) PDFCI's set of corporate objectives, such as a pace-setting
role to influence financial sector policies and introduction of an array of
novel activities, were far too ambitious in the light of the lack of the
caliber of staff needed and the long lead time to develop such expertise;
(iii) in-house project supervision is a critical ingredient of development
banking and must not be commissioned out to a consulting firm which PDFCI did;
and (iv) given the Indonesian interest rate regime at that time, PDFCI was not
able to raise any domestic resources on its own to supplement those supplied
by BI. Moreover, the expectation that PDFCI would raise foreign currency
funds abroad from comercial resources in addition to official resources did
not materialize and PDFCI remained a conduit for official resources. After
the Government changed its policy and decided not to issue anymore guarantees
for the borrowing of private institutions (such as PDFCI) from international



institutions,!' PDFCI became exclusively dependent on the supply of long-term
funds from Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Government.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
2.01      General.  The period of project implementation was marked by politi-
cal stability and economic growth. During the seventies, Indonesia
experienced strong and diversified economic growth with GDP rising at a rate
of almost 8% per annum. This was associated with rapid increases in public
expenditures, total investment and savings. The dominant influence was the
huge expansion and large variability in foreign exchange from oil. Oil
receipts provided about 70Z of Central Government receipts and helped finance
the sustained increase in demand via the budget. In 1982, however, there was
a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook with real GDP stagnating
(showing a 0.1% decline in constant 1981 prices) - the worst performance in a
decade. Total export revenues fell by 15%, while imports recorded an increase
of 9% over the previous year. The decline in oil prices in early 1983
accentuated these difficulties. To address the balance of payment problems
and enable continued economic growth on a sustainable basis, the Government
took a number of steps: in March 1983, it devalued the Rupiah by 28% against
the US dollar, in May 1983, it announced the rephasing of many projects to
reduce imports and in June 1983, it deregulated the financial sect r by
freeing lending (except for selective priority programs) and deposit rates and
eliminating credit ceilings.
2-.Ok     The Manufacturing Sector.  Following the 1973 increase in oil
prices, the industrial sector, including mining and energy, became the fastest
growing sector in the economy with an average annual rate of growth of 11% be-
tween 1971 and 1980. It now accounts for 33% of GDP as compared with 20X in
1970 and for 12Z of total employment, 80X of the Latter in small enter-
prises. Manufacturing exports, which in the late 1970s and early 1980s grew
rapidly from a very low base, now account for 14% of non-oil exports and about
5% of total exports. The industrial and manufacturing sectors account for
about 12% and 9Z respectively of total employment. Small enterprises provide
about 80% of total employment, while medium- and Large-scale, capital-
intensive enterprises, which employ only 132 of the labor force in the sector,
contribute about 80% of the total value-added.
2.03      During the 1970s, industrial policies were inward-oriented.  A high
level of protection and quantitative restrictions favored import substitu-
tion. The industrial sector which emerged from these policies did not
generate sufficient employment opportunities or export revenues and is charac-
terized by relative inefficient, capital intensive firms. However, the early
1980s saw a policy shift and the Third Five Year Development Plan (1979180-
1983/84) places greater emphasis on the manufacturing sector and focuses on
structural changes, employment generation, protection of fledgeling enter-
I/   PDFCI was precluded from approaching IBRD and ADB for new financing since
about 1980.



-3-
prises, promotion of labor intensive manufactured exports and export financ-
ing. In addition to the Rupiah devaluation, the Government introduced, over
the past two years, initiatives in the areas of export finance, guarantees,
credit and insurance. Terms of payment for exports were liberalized and
exporters' access to working capital eased.
2.04      The Financial Sector.  The financial sector in Indonesia consists of
Bank Indonesia (BI), the country's central bank, 5 state-owned commercial
banks, the state-owned development bank (BAPINDO), 79 private national commer-
cial banks, 10 foreign banks, 3 development finance companies and 26 Regional
Development Banks (RDBs). Despite the apparent diversity of financial
institutions, the financial sector is characterized by a poorly developed
capital market, asset concentration (the five state-owned commercial banks
account for almost 80% of the assets of all deposit money banks and BAPINDO
for 33Z of outstanding term loans to the industrial sector), and a dearth of
long- term credit. The degree of monetization is lower than that in compar-
able LDCs and access to banking facilities outside urban areas is limited.
Until recently, the sector was tightly controlled by BI with a regulated
interest rate structure for both deposits and loans (with interest rates
generally being lower than prevailing inflation rates), credit ceilings and
special rediscount windows for a number of Government-sponsored credit
programs which accounted for about 25% of credit outstanding. Although this
system generaily satisfied credit demand and succeeded in channeling resources
to priority sectors and programs, it depended on continuing windfall oil prof-
its and did not provide incentives for mobilizing financial savings. In June
1983, the Government introduced a far-reaching financial reform including the
liberalization of interest rates for the majoricy of deposits and lending and
the discontinuation of credit ceilings. The scope of rediscounting facilities
was reduced and rediscounting rates unified at 121. These moves resuLted in a
sharp rise in interest rates, an increase in time deposics of the banking
system and in substantial capital inflows. The Bank has agreed to a
Goverament request to provide a financial sector mission which visited
Indonesia in May/June 1984 to review a number of financial sector issues.
III. PDFCI's ROLE AND BANK LOAN OBJECTIVES
3.01      Background and PDFCI's Role.  While in the late 1960s and early
1970s the financial system in Indonesia was able to provide short-term credit,
almost no medium or long-term credit was available. The introduction of the
INVESTASI program in 1969 was aimed at dealing with this constraint and making
medium-term loans available to all sectors through the state-owned commercial
banks and Regional Development Banks (RDBs) with Bank Indonesia financing a
significant proportion of the program. Furthermore, Bank Pembangunan
Indonesia (BAPINDO) was also reorganized into a more active and effective
source of industrial finance. At the same time it was recognized, however,
that BAPINDO would only be able to service a limited segment of the industrial
sector and that there would be need for other development finance institu-
tions. Therefore, the Government and the World Bank Group (WBG) decided on
the desirability of establishing a predominantly private-owned development
finance company with the capacity to attract funds from various sources,
finance private sector enterprises and provide them with a wide range of



financial and technical services. As a result of these considerations, PDFCI
was established (incorporated) in 1972 and started operations in 1974. Its
paid-in share capital of Rp 2.5 billion was owned by Indonesian shareholders
(602) including Bank Indonesia, and foreign shareholders (40%) including IFC
(para. 5.08). Total Bank Group assistance to PDFCI comprised the following:
(i) an IFC subscription in 1973 of about $482,000 or about 8% of PDFCI'S
common stock; (ii) an IDA Credit of $10 million, including $105,000 for
technical assistance (TA) in 1973; and (iii) a Bank loan of $15 million,
including $213,500 for TA in 1977. However, the Government decided in 1979 to
change its policies so that private institutions (such as PDFCI) could no
Longer receive Government guarantees for borrowing from multilateral
international institutions.  The Bank was therefore unable to continue to work
with PDFCI in the context of new loans.
3.02      Objectives of the Bank Loan.  PDFCI was originally created not
merely as another financial institution, but one that would make a significant
contribution to the Indonesian financial system. It was expected to: (i}
transfer resources particularly to private sector enterprises; (ii) mobilize
resources on its own in the domestic and international markets, thus gradually
reducing its dependence on funds from official sources such as BI and the
Bank; (iii) provide a wide range of technical and promotional assistance; and
(iv) introduce new financial services such as syndication and underwriting.
rn addition, it was expected to influence government policies reLated to the
financial sector and contribute to capital market development. At the time
the Loan was made, PDFCI had already made significant progress in resource
allocation and institution building, but further actions were needed to
transform it into an efficient and innovative financial intermediary
(paras. 5.01-5.02). Largely due to the unconducive environment, PDFCI was
Less successful with respect to the remaining objectives. However, under the
second Bank operation the broad objectives were relegated to long-term goals,
while specific emphasis was given to short-term objectives such as
contribution to sound development of Indonesian industry by providing finance
on suitable terms and strengthening PDFCI as an institution. Even so, the
broader sectoral objectives were too ambitious given -he overall economic and
poLicy environment.
IV. UTILIZATION OF THE BANK LOAN
Rate of Utilization
4.01      PDFCI's projected and actual disbursements are shown in Annex 1.
Commitments and disbursements under the loan were initially (1977/78) very
slow due to internal problems in PDFCI such as staff constraints, but picked
up from 1979 or.ward. The period for the commitment and submission of subloans
had nevertheless to be extended by 18 months (to December 31, 1980), while the
Closing Date was postponed by six months (to December 31, 1981). A total of
29 subprojects were financed under the Bank loan, 15 of which, accounting for
77% of the total loan (Annex 2), were above the free limit (US$400,000) and
consequently fully revieuad by the Bank. The agreements reached during
negotiations and PDFCI's compliance with them are shown in Annex 3.



Subproject Characteristics
4.02      Average subloan size was about $510,000 ranging from about $120,000
to $1.8 milLion. No maximum loan size was set under the Loan. Most subloans
went to whoLly Indonesian-owned companies, except 5 subprojects which were
joint ventures with foreign partnership. Twenty five subprojects were jointly
funded by Bank funds, domestic resources (Bank Indonesia's special funds), and
owners' equity, while the remaining four were fully financed with Bank loan
funds and equity. In conjunction with loan financing, PDFCI also made three
minority investments in a joint venture and two indigenous firms. PDFCI's
loan financing accounted only for some 32Z of total project cost,- ranging
from 0.51 to 93Z, of which Bank funds accounted for some 18%. The remaining
68Z was contributed by financing from other institutions and owners' equity.
The Bank loan had also a technical assistance (TA) component of $213,000 to
cover the cost of the services of an expatriate technical expert until June
1979.
4.03      The sectoral and geographical distribution of subprojects financed
under the loan are shown in Annex 4. The sectoral distribution of subprojects
was reasonably diversified. Light industries predominated, accounting for
about 34Z and 42Z by number and loan amount. The textile industry was next
(14% and llZ), followed by metal products (10% and 19Z)and chemicals (10%
each). Geographically, 79% of all subprojects were located in Java (59Z in
West Java, 3Z in Central Java and 17% in East Java), 14Z in Sumatra and 7Z (2
subprojects) in Kalimantan. The skewed distribution in favor of West Java,
which includes metropolitan Jakarta, partly results from PDFCI's operating
from its Jakarta head office without a branch office network (the
characteristics of PDFCI's overall portfolio are dealt with in paras. 6.02-
6.03). However, this geographical distribution is largely consistant with the
general pattern of industrial investment in Indonesia.
4.04      Cost and Time Variance of Subprojects.  Of the 29 total subprojects,
18 experienced cost overruns in excess of 10%, six of which in excess of 30%
of the original cost estimates. The remaining projects have more or less
borne out appraisal expectations (Annex 5). Eighteen subprojects were not
completed on schedule, of which 8 had serious delays of between 6-24 months.
According to PDFCI, most of the delays were attributable to problems in
obtaining government licenses, customs clearance, residual financing or the
inability of the sponsors to raise the necessary equity funds on time (Annex
6). However, only two of the subprojects with serious implementation delays
were also faced with serious cost overruns. On the whole, PDFCI's data
indicate that its project appraisals were apparently based on optimistic
assumptions regarding investment cost estimates and implementation schedules.
21   Excluding one exceptionally large subproject (P.T. Semen Andalas).  If it
would be included, the share of loan financing would only account for 8%
of total project cost.



Operational, Financial and Economic Performance of Subprojects
4.05      The financial performance of subprojects is shown in Annex 7.  Du/
to the delays in project completion and start-up of commercial operations,-
operational results were only available for some 55Z of all subprojects.
Actual sales of these subprojects exceeded original appraisal estimates in
502 of all cases, some by a considerable margin, another 23% were in line with
original estimates, while the remaining 27Z have failed to realize appraisal
expectations. On the whole, these results are satisfactory. PDFCI's profit
projections, however, turned out to be less reliable. About 70Z of the
reporting firms have not achieved the original targets for the first year of
full operation and two of them have even incurred losses in excess of 100% of
net worth. About 50Z of all firms were on target in the second year of full
operation. As of June 30, 1983, 8 subloans were in arrears for more than 3
months, of which 5 were classified as serious problem cases while one subloan
was under foreclosure. Revised financial rates of return (FRRs) for a sample
of 20 subprojects yielded an average of 21.6% as compared with the originally
projected average of 26.5Z for the same sample; revised rates ranged from 10-
38Z.
4.06      Economic Performance.  The economic performance of subprojects is
shown in Annex 8.  Twenty-four -  of the 29 projects resulted in the creation
of 6,983 new jobs at an average investment cost of Rp 26 milLion (about
$26,000) per job, as compared with the original appraisal estimate of 6,183
jobs from all projects at an average cost of Rp 24 milion per worker. The
number of newly created jobs is likzly to increase even further when all 29
projects have come on-stream. Eighe subprojects were expected to export their
entire production, but only one had actual export sales at this time (76% of
total sales). Actual value added bore out appraisal expectations in 7 cases
out of 12 for which data are available. Revised economic rates of return
(ERRs) for a sample of 20 subprojects yielded an average of 21.5%, ranging
from 1OZ-40Z, as compared with the original average of 25.2:.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Overall Perspective
5.01      PDFCI was established in 1972 in recognition of the need and scope
for an additional source of development financing in Indonesi:. However, the
basic objective was not merely to create another financial institution, but
one that would make significant contributions to the Indonesian financial
system in addition to the usual resource allocation, mobilization and
insitution building objectives. PDFCI's objectives are dealt with in detail
in para. 3.02. However, the objectives set for PDFCI, even the longer term
3/   As of December 1983, six projects were under construction, while another
5 were not yet fully operational.
4/   The remaining projects were not yet fulLy operational.



-7-
objectives, proved to be overly ambitious, particularly in view of the
unconducive financial environment in which it was operating. PDFCI could not
mobilize domestic and foreign,resources, introduce a wide range of financial
and technical serivces and fost-r capital market development without major and
sustained Government support and major changes in the overall policy
environment.
5.02      In retrospect, PDFCI remained a relatively small institution with an
equity of some $6.5 million and asset base of less than $100 million, roughly
a tenth of BAPINDO's size. PDFCI was nevertheless able to establish the
necessary technical capacity for project evaluation, but it was less success-
ful in the quaLitative judgement of project evaLuation and project
supervision. LargeLy due to circumstances beyond its concrol (see
para. 5.09), PDFCI has not been ab\e to raise domestic resources, except for
short-term interbank funds, nor tap'..international capital markets and has
become exclusively dependent on BI f%r its term resources. As a result of
these constraints, PDFCI steered away from its original development task and
ventured into money market operations. These operations started as short-term
investment of liquid funds, but have now become a major activity, accounting
for about 56Z of PDFCI's assets and 62X of its income. Initially, these
operations were confined to the highly secured interbank market. However,
PDFCI subsequently expanded into the more risky corporate sector without
setting-up strict internal policy guidelines and control mechanisms, which
resulted in a deteriorating portfolio. These shortcomings were dealt with :n
conjunction with a supervision mission to PDFCI in August 1982.
Management, Organization and Staffing
5.03      PDFCI was established with a western-type corporate structure
comprising the Board, an Executive Committee and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
in deviation from the traditional Indonesian two-tier Board structure. The
composition of PDFCI's Board of Directors as of December 31,1983 is attached
as Annex 9. Since the Board structure proved unconducive for its development,
PDFCI agreed in principle to the Bank's suggestion of adopting the two-tier
Board system and as a first step promoted two of its senior managers to the
position of Deputy Managing Directors. The understanding was that once the
Deputy Managing Directors demonstrated their management capabilities, a full
move towards the formation of a full Board of Managing Directors would be
warranted. In the interim, PDFCI continues with the current arrangement of a
Board of Directors, an Executive Committee and a CEO. lrhen PDFCI's CEO
retired in 1982, the Chairman of the Board took over on an emergency basis
until a new manager can be found. Since almost three years have passed
without the identification of a new manager or a more permanent arrangement
for the present CEO, this issue should now be dealt with.
5.04      In April 1982, PDFCI's revised its organizational structure:  the
four Project Departments were merged into two larger Project Departments, one
each for Eastern and Western Indonesia. Each new Project Department has
separate units for project appraisal and supervision. Originally, project
appraisal and supervision units were jointly supervised by the two Deputy
Managing Directors with some risk of overlapping of authority. In 1984, this
arrangement was changed. One Deputy Managing Director was assigned



- 8 -
responsibility for a special group in charge of problem projects. Both
Project Departments are now supervised by one Deputy Managing Director.
Project supervision, originally assigned to an outside consultating firm:/
requires further strengthening. PDFCI's management is considering the
establishment of a separate supervision department. The other features of the
1982 reorganization were: (i) the separate Engineering Department was merged
with the two Project Departments; (ii) a separate Research and Development and
Staff Training Department was set up; and (iii) the separate Money Market
Department waas made a unit of the Accounting and Finance Department.
5.05      Staffing.  Staffing has become a major problem.  Due to Low staff
morale in view of PDFCI's unclear future and emerging competition particularly
from a large number of newly established leasing companies, PDFCI has had a
high staff turnover, particularly in 1982 (182 as compared with 13.2% in
1981). Although PDFCI has been able to increase its staff from 96 (1983) to
101 (1984), of which 59 are professionals (Annex 10), current staff strength
is still inadequate both in terms of number and experience. PDFCI is finding
it increasingly difficult to attract capable and talented staff.
Appraisal Procedures and Standards
5.06      As a result of the training provided by expatriate advisors during
the early years, PDFCI was able to introduce project appraisal methodology and
develop good analytical capabilities in its staff. It was less successful in
the qualitative aspects of assessing project risk due to difficulties in
recruicing and keeping experienced professional staff. The quality of PDFCI's
reports, which was varied at times, has generally deteriorated due to the
recent high staff turnover and the recruitment of inexperienced staff.
Project Supervision
5.07      PDFCI discontinued its previous practice of using Panca Bina Esa, an
outside consulting firm, for supervision of its subprojects. Supervision is
now done by sep9rate units in the Project Departments, while problem projects
are referred to a special unit headed by a Deputy Kanaging Director. PDFCI
has taken a number of steps to streamline and improve project supervision:
problem accounts are closely monitored and where necessary and feasible, legal
action is taken and efforts are made to comply routinely with the requirements
of project visits, progress report and monitoring. Moreover, PDFCI is cur-
rently considering the establishment of a separate supervision department.
These measures are affected, however, by lack of staff, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, and managers tend to give preference to making new loans
over project supervision. PDFCI should take appropriate corrective steps to
overcome these problems.
5/   This practice has since been discontinued (para. 5.07).



-9-
Capital Structure
5.08      PDFCI's authorized capital was increased in 1980 from Rp. 5 billion
to Rp. 7 billion and its subscribed capital from Rp. 3.7 billion to Rp. 6.95
billion. However, at that time PDFCI's Board decided to defer the calling of
the capital.  Subsequently, in 1983, two existing Indonesian shareholders (BI
and AJB Bumiputera 1912) and the Chairman of PDFCI voluntarily paid in
Rp. 839 million against their uncalled share subscriptions, raising the total
paid-in capital to Rp. 4,539.5 million. IC has since sold 25% of its orig-
inal equity holding in PDFCI and did not exercise its subscription rights in
1980. Consequently, its holding has been reduced from the original 8X to 2.2%
of subscribed capital and 3.4% of paid-in capital. The original proportion of
domestic to foreign holdings changed from 60:40 to 68:33 (Annex 11). As of
December 31, 1983, PDFCI's cotal equity stood at Rp. 6,871 million including
reserves and retained ernings of Rp. 2,238 million (originally projected Rp.
6,942 millions).
Resource Mobilization
5.09      Resource mobilization in the domestic and international capital
markets was one of PDFCI's principal objectives, to reduce over time its
dependence on official funding from sources such as BI and IBRD. However, due
to circumstances beyond PDFCI's control, it continued to function merely as a
conduit for official resources. The failure to mobilize any new resources on
its own was due to the fact that until mid-1983, PDFCI's lending rates were
determined by BI at a level not high enough to cover borrowing costs and allow
PDFCI to earn an adequate spread. As a consequence, it was not feasible for
PDFCI to depend on capital market resources even if it could have raised
them. BI provided PDFCI with the needed funds at subsidized rates. Even
after the liberalization of interest rates in June 1983, resource costs have
been too high and the capital market too rudimentary for PDFCI to mobilize
term resources through the issue of debt instruments. In addition to the
constraints in the domestic capital market, PDFCI has also not reached the
necessary size and financial stature which would enable it to raise foreign
currency funds in the international capital market. Moreover, since 1979, it
has also been precluded from IBRD financing due to a change in Government
policy, whereby private institutions such as PDFCI were not able to secure
Government guarantees to support their borrowing from multilateral
international institutions. Hence, PDFCI wiLl continue to depend on BI for
its entire term resource needs, unless the financial environment changes. By
and large, however, BI has supplied PDFCI with adequate local currency funds.
5.10      Since inception, PDFCI obtained long-term domestic currency
resources of about Rp. 57.5 billion (outstanding 46.9 as of Dec. 31, 1983)
from the Government including subordinated loans of Rp. 5.9 billion. Bank
Indonesia's special Funds, Liquidity Credits and Liquidity Credits for equity
financing, carrying interest rates of between 3% and 11.6%, accounted for
about 71%, 24X and 5% respectively. PDFCI's foreign exchange resources came
from the IDA Credit ($10 million) and Bank Loan ($15 million).



- 10 -
Operation Strategy Modifications
5.11      Equity Investments.  PDFCI generally maintains equity options up to
20% of all loan financing, but has not exercised them. However, PDFCI made 20
direct equity investments in conjunction with loan financing, amounting to
Rp. 3.5 billion. About 80% of these investments were approved during 1980-
82. Its total equity portfolio of Rp.2,936 million as of December 31, 1983,
was invested in 15 companies. Most of these companies did not do well. Nine
of them, accounting for about 50% of total equity investment, incurred
losses. PDFCI also absorbed substantial losses from the liquidation of one
company and the restructuring of another. PDFCI's auditors estimated the
potential loss from equity investments to be in the vicinity of Rp. 800 mil-
lion as compared with provision of Rp. 1,873 million including provisions for
possible loan losses (Rp. 1.6 billion). Owing to this unsatisfactory
experience with its equity operations in the past, PDFCI decided to curtail
this activity and made only one small investment in 1983 (Rp. 80 million).
5.12      Money Market Operations.  Money market placements, which started as
short-term investment of liquid funds, has now become a major activity of
PDFCI's for which it borrows in the market. Between December 31, 1979 and
1983, total placements (maturities up to 6 months) jumped from Rp. 9.7 billion
(39% of total assets) to Rp. 58.2 (56% of toal assets), while borrowings
(mainly on the basis of promissory notes issued to banks) increased from Rp.
5.4 billion to Rp. 42.3 billion. Initially, PDFCI's money market investments
were confined to highly secured interbank operations which provided modest but
safe returns. SubsequentLy, lured by higher yields, PDFCI starteg,buying
promissory notes from the more risky non-banking corporate sector-  which
accounted for 77% of total money market transactions as of June 30, 1982. In
expanding its money market operations, PDFCI did not pay proper attention to
setting-up strict internal policy guidelines and control mechanisms to ensure
growth of a sound portfolio. Consequently, PDFCI experienced a major
delinquency problem on its money market operations. As of June 30, 1982,
money market advances amounting to Rp. 7.0 billion (32.90% of total) and
uncollected interest of Rp. 2.0 billion were in jeopardy. As a consequence,
the spread between the yield on advances and borrowing cost, which was
positive in 1979 (8.5%) and 1980 (4.8%) became negative in 1981 (-0.5Z) and
1982 (-4.8%). On the basis of a rough estimate, write-offs of Rp. 1.4 billion
were expected for which provisions of only Rp. 589 million were available.
5.13      PDFCI's Board and management were aware of the alarming status of
the money market operations and have taken the following remedial actions:
(i) formation of a high powered task force to closely supervise salvaging of
24 problem accounts; (ii) procedural changes in the approval process through
establishing of an Investment Committee; weekly reviews of the entire
portfolio and renewal of accommodations only after 2-4 weeks; (iii) efforts to
improve PDFCI's colateral position; (iv) more selective approach such as
6/   Approval by the Bank of these substantial changes was not formally
sought, but all papers submitted to PDFCI's Board and Excom were also
copied to us.

loans to be made to banks or against bank guarantees; and (v) strengthening of
PDFCI's legal position.  The Bank's supervision mission which visited PDFCI in
1982 (Report dated Nov.1, 1982) made the following additional recommenda-
tions:  (i) extensive training of staff involved in money market activities in
Indonesia as well as abroad; (ii) hiring of a money market expert to assist in
training and organize operations on a more systematic basis; (iii) revision of
policy guidelines governing money maket operations which require updating;
(iv) stipulation of ceilings for money market advances, strict criteria for
placements, specific minimum time hiatus between full settlement and renewal
of facility; refusal of insecured placements and more frequent reporting to
Board/Executive Committee on status and compliance with guidelines.
5.14      The recommendations resulted in a noticeable improvement.  As of Dec
31, 1983, Rp. 9.61 billion or 16.5% of PDFCI's placements were past due (13%
of which for more than 60 days) as compared with 26.1% in 1982. Provisions of
Rp. 2.21 billion were available to cover possible losses (para. 6.08)
VI. Operational and Financial Performance
6.01      Operations.  Although it was PDFCI's objective principally to
provide private enterprises with medium, long-term and equity financing, and
technical and managerial services, money market and short-term lending opera-
tions have become increasingly important for PDFCI, providing more than 60% of
its income. Equity financing, on the other hand, has remained very limited
and PDFCI has not been able to undertake other forms of financial services
such as underwritings and syndications.
6.02      Since inception (until 1983), PDFCI has committed Rp. 65.12 billion
for 117 loans and Rp. 3.44 billion for 20 equity operations (Annex 13). New
projects accounted for about 56% of all loans. Geographically, PDFCI's
operations were heavily concentrated in Java, which absorbed about 82% of
total assistance (by amount as well as by number). West Java alone (including
Jakarta) absorbed about 55Z. Light industry received 22% and 27% of total
assistance by amount and number, followed by agribusiness (20% and 18%) and
textile industry (13% and 171).
6.03      Details of PDFCI's operations during 1977-83 are given in
Annex 14. PDFTI initially had a slow start and was affected by a high rate of
cancellations_ due to ill-puypared project proposals and constraints in its
organization and procedures.-   During 1979-81, a period of strong growth
followed, but could not be sustained, due to PDFCI's running out of foreign
currency funds (in 1982) although there were rupiah funds available. Actual
operations did not bear out original appraisal expectations and accounted for
7/   During inception until 1983, 23% (33 projects) were cancelled out of 145
applications.

- 12 -
only about 78% and 67X of approvals and commitments, respectively, during
1980-83. Foreign currency loans accounted for almost 34% during 1977-80 and
about 39X and 20% by number and amount since PDFCI's inception. As of
December 31, 1983, about 90% of PDFCI's approvals were committed and 94% of
total commitments were disbursed, reflecting a very satisfactory rate of
project assistance.
6.04      Financial Performance.  PDFCI's projected and actuaL summarized
income statements and financial indicators for 1977-83 are shown in Annexes
15, 16 and 19. Total income during 1980-83 grew at a faster pace (about 43%
p.a.) than originally expected (about 35% p.a.) due to PDFCI's increased
expansion of its money market activities which contributed an increasing share
to PDFCI's gross income (64% in 1983). However, PDFCI's costs increased even
faster (about 51% p.a.) during this period and particularly during the last
two years, when PDFCI's management decided to write off part of its short-term
assets (Rp. 596.9 million in 1983) and provide adequate provisions for
potential losses from its long-term/equity portfolio and money market
placemet:ts. During 1980-83, actual income and costs exceeded projections by
42 and 13X, respect-vely. When the new CEO took over PDFCI's management on an
emergency basis in 1982 (para 5.03), he introduced a new strategy which was
aimed at maximisation of profits from money market transactions to enable
PDFCI to vet aside sufficient provisions to cover its potential losses from
the portfoLio.
6.05      Although its provisions at the end of 1983 were not yet fully
adequate, PDFCl's profit performance showed signs of recovery in 1983 despite
the formation of large amounts of provisions for doubtful accounts. Net
profits which declined from 1.8% of total average assets in 1980 to 0.3% ini
1982, recovered in 1983 to 0.6% (projected: 0.9%). Return to equity showed a
similar trend; declining from its peak of 13.8% in 1981 to 3.5Z in 1982,
recovered to 9.2% in 1983. PDFCI's spreads followed a similar trend, but were
still ahead of the appraisal expectation.-   Largely due to an increased asset
base, PDFCI's general and administrative expense decreased from 2.1% in 1980
to 1.4 in 1983 (projected 1.6%).
6.06      Financial Structure.  PDFCI's summarized projected and actual
balance sheets and financial indicators for 1977-83 are attached as Annexes
17-19. %uring 1980, PDFCI's assets growth (about 39%) has outperformed pro-
jections (about 16%), particularly due to its fast growing money market
operations. Total assets were financed by short-term liabilities (43Z), long-
term debts (52%) and equity (5%) as compared with a projected 33Z, 59% and
8%. Although no dividends were paid during 1982-83, the growth of PDFCI's
equity base lagged behind projections particularly due to its rather poor
showing during the past two years. PnFCI's liquidity as welL as debt service
cover were satisfactory throughout.10 Although its equity base had grown in
line with projections, PDFCI was nevertheless faced with gradually increasing
9/   Actual spread in 1983:  5.4% as compared with a projected spread at 4.6%.

leverage and its long-term debt/equity ratio stood at 4:2:1 in 1981. In view
of the management and financial problems, it might have been prudent for PDFCI
to maintain its gearing ratio to a minimum. However, it seemed impossible
that PDFCI could have convinced its shareholders or outsiders to contribute
any additional capital. Moreover, a substantial part of PDFCI's long-term
debts came from BI on favored terms and therefore servicing of debts is not as
much a burden as it would be if PDFCI were to borrow on market terms. Another
important factor was that PDFCI had no foreign exchange risk exposure. Under
these circumstances the Bank agreed (in 1982) to the requested raise of the
long-term debt/equity ratio to 6:1. Its actual leverage stood at 3.7:1 as of
the end of 1983, due to the capital increase and agreement with the Govern-
ment, whereby the repayments falling1due on the IDA credit and IBRD loan would
be converted into subordinated loan-   repayable on a longer term.  This is
expected to help PDFCI to remain within the approved 6:1 ceiling for some time
to come.
6.07      Quality of Term Loan Portfolio.  Details on the quality of PDFCI's
term loan portfolio (collection performance, analysis of loans in arrears,
loan reschedulings and status of portfolio) are shown in Annexes 20 to 23.
PDFCI is facing a high default rate on both its term loan portfolio and short-
term placements. Arrears on term loans increased until 1981, when they
accounted for 14.7X of loan portfolio outstanding. Thereafter they were
brought under better control and declined, partly due to an increase in
portfolio, to 9.6% as of December 31, 1983 when some 18.3% of PDFCI's
portfolio was affected by arrears. The arrears relate to 24 accounts, or
26.4% of total portfolio in terms of number. PDFCI considers 14 cases,
accounting for about 132 of its portfolio, to be in the serious category.
PDFCI has so far rescheduLed 24 (Rp. 11.7 billion) of its 91 accounts, 16 of
which (4.6 billion) were rescheduled during 1982-83. PDFCI's collection
performance was mixed during 1980-83. After a decline from about 66% in 1978
to 52Z in 1981, a drastic improvement was achieved in 1982 (71Z) but could not
be sustained in 1983 (64%). PDFCI's auditors have reviewed 10 of the largest
arrears accounts, 4 of which agount for alm ,t 50% of total arrears.  PDFCI's
provisions for potential loan-  and equityl-  losses of Rp.1,873 million (end
-83) were obviously still inadequate in view of potential losses in the vicin-
ity of Rp. 2.4 billion as identified by PDFCI's auditors, who have not commen-
ted on the adequacy of provisions. A combination of factors has contributed
to PDFCI's high default rate. In addition to a difficult economic environment
and a depressed business climate, supervision needs to be improved and only
recently has PDFCI's management taken steps to remedy the situation. More-
over, weaknesses in the legal arrangements have Led to disputes with

1983.
121 Potential losses were identified on the basis of collateral values; no
loans were written off in 1983 (Rp. 154 million in 1982).
13/ Potential losses from PDFCI's equity portfolio were estimated (by PDFCI's
auditors) to be in the vicinity of Rp. 800 billion.

borrowers. Last but not the least, some of the portfolio problems are
indicative of poor decisions made in PDFCI's initiaL phase, when both
management and staff lacked experience and maturity. PDFCI is now trying to
tackle these problems and increase provisions so that they would adequately
cover potential portfolio losses.
6.08      Quality of Short-term Portfolio.  The problem is even more serious
with respect to PDFCI's short-term portfolio. Total arrears acounted for
16.5Z (Rp. 9,607 million) of total short-term placements oustanding, of which
12.9Z was overdue for over 60 days. On the basis of a portfolio review in
1983, PDFCI's auditors have indentified potential losses of Rp. 2,687 million
over and above actual write-offs of Rp. 596.9 million. Total provisions to
cover potential losses from money market operations stood at Rp. 1,911 million
as of the end of 1983. The auditors have not commented on the adequacy of
such provisions. The reasons which have led to this development and steps
taken to improve the situation are dealt with in paras. 5.12-5.14.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      When PDFCI was created, it was intended not merely to set up another
financial institution, but one which would introduce innovative financial
services and make significant contributions to the Indonesian financial
system. The basic objectives for the IDA credit consequently were very
broad. In addition to the objectives of resource transfer and mobilization
and institution building, PDFCI was expected to influence government policy
related to the financial sector and particularly capital market development.
With hindsight it is now obvious that the unconducive financial environment in
which PDFCI was operating made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
achieve the broader goals. These expectations were only relegated to long-
term goals. Special emphasis was given in the second Bank operation to sound
development of Indonesian industry by providing funds on suitable terms and
strengthening PDFCI as an institutiond Nonetheless, the longer-term objec-
tives for PDFCI were too ambitious.
7.02      Regarding the narrower institutional objectives of providing sound
term financing to industry, PDFCI's performance has been mixed. PDFCI was
largely able to establish the necessary technical capacity for project
evaluation, but was less successful in assessing the qualitative aspects of
project risk, due to difficulties in recruiting and keeping experienced
staff. This in conjunction with ineffective project supervision has resulted
in poor overall portfolio quality, high arrears and relatively poor loan
collections. The Bank loan proceeds, on the other hand, were transferreu to
relatively sound industrial projects, whose financial and economic impact were
generally satisfactory. PDFCI's equity financing program did not bear out
expectations and was curtailed. PDFCI was also not able to introduce innova-
tive services such as syndication and underwriting and raise any resources
either in the domestic or international capital markets largely due to circumr
stances beyond its control, however. It remained exclusively dependent on
resources from Bank Indonesia for its term lending operations.



- 15 -
7.03      Largely for reasons beyond its control, PDFCI has also not been able
to raise any resources on its own and has remained dependent on BI for its
term resource needs. Until mid-1983, PDFCI's lending rates were determined by
BI at a level not high enough to cover borrowing costs and allow PDFCI to earn
an adequate spread. As a consequence, it was not feasible for PDFCI to depend
on capital market resources even if it could have raised them. BI provided
PDFCI with the needed funds at subsidized rates. Even after the liberaliza-
tion of interest rates in June 1983, resource costs have been too high and the
capital market too rudimentary for PDFCI to mobilize term resources through
the issue of debt instruments. However, BI has continued to supply PDFCI with
adequate domestic currency funds. In addition to the constraints in the
domestic capital market, PDFCI was not able to develop into an institution
whose magnitude and financial stature would enable it to raise foreign cur-
rency funds in the international capital market. Moreover, since about 1979,
it has also been precluded from IBRD financing due to a change in Government
policy, whereby private institutions such as PDFCI became ineligible for
Government guarantees.
7.04      All-in-all, PDFCI remained a small institution with a limited
capital base, working from its head office in Jakarta without the support of a
branch network and an asset base not significant enough to influence the
financial or industrial sectors. In view of these constraints to its develop-
ment banking operations, PDFCI saw greater potential for its further growth
and development in money market activities. These activities grew rapidly
into PDFCI's mainstay, and by the end of 1983 accounted for 561 of total
assets and 6OZ of gross revenue, but were not profitable particularly in view
of the need for large write-offs and provisions for potential losses.
7.05      Several lessons can be learned from the project:
-    PDFCI's credit/loan objectives were too broad and ambitious in view
of the sectoral constraints such as the prevailing interest rate
regime at that time, the shortage of the calibre of staff needed for
such functions and the long lead time to develop such expertise.
-    PDFCI was organized as a predominantly private institution.
However, it needed strong Government support in order to grow and
prosper and after the Government's decision not to guarantee its
foreign borrowings from multilateral financial institutions, it was
unable to find other sources of external financing. Strong
Government support is a condition sine qua non for the development
of an institution of this type, particularly in the early stage of
development;
-    a private institution like PDFCr is not likely to be able to play a
major role in mobilizing domestic resources, unless the overall
policy environment and state of capital market development are
conducive to this purpose;
-    a major involvement in short-term money market operatiozs for a
relatively inexperienced institution like PDFCI is inherently risky
and great prudence shouLd be exercised and proper guidelines should



- 16 -
be in place before becoming involved in such activity on a major
scale; and
-    while PDFCI has developed some project appraisal capability as
evidenced by relatively effective utilization of Bank funds, some
attention needed to be given to projects' financed from other                  a
sources and to more systematic project supervision.
7.06      The Role of the Bank.  When the project was conceptualized, the Bank
Group pursued a dialogue with the Indonesian Government on the rationale and
need for an additional, predominantly private-owned development finance com-
pany. This dialogue eventually resulted in the creation of PDFCI which was
actively assisted by the Bank during its initial phase of establishment. TA
was provided under the IDA credit in 1973 and the Bank loan in 1977 and
covered the cost of several expatriate advisors for PDFCI. The institution
building efforts were continued during the project supervision phase and
through subproject reviews. However, it now appears that a fledgeling
institution like PDFCI required more intensive Bank supervision, particularly
during the earlier years of the Loan. It was rather difficult for the Bank to
maintain a high level of supervision particularly after 1980, when the Bank
loan funds were fully committed and the Government had decided that it could
not guarantee further World Bank loans Lo PDFCI.
7.07      Future Strategy:  In addition to short-term remedies such as a
moderate growth strategy, consolidation of its financial position and port-
folio, greater resource allocation to supervision, intensification of train-
ing, reduction of staff turnover and restriction of money market operations to
most secured transactions, PDFCI's management is faced with a major deci-
sion. It has to determine whether it wants to focus on development banking or
money market activities. Recent work done by the Bank on the financial sector
in Indonesia indicates that institutions such as PDFCI operate under serious
constraints (e.g. they cannot accept deposits and operate at a suboptimal
scale) and their asset base is not large enough to spread risks and keep
intermediation cost at optimal levels. However, there is a need for
specialised development banks such as PDFCI at least for the rest of this
decade to provide longer term finance. A major issue covers the steps
necessary to enable such institutions tc reach greater commercial scale either
through adjustment of Government policy or through merger with other
institutions facing similar problems.
