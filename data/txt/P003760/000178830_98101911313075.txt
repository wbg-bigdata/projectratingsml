INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF THE
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
SUMMARY
i.        Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI) was estab-
lished in 1973 with the active assistance of the Bank Group, including an
equity participation by IFC, which owns 8% of PDFCI's share capital. IFC was
also instrumental in bringing into PDFCI its present foreign shareholders.
Although Bank Indonesia is a substantial shareholder with 21.8% of the share
capital, PDFCI is predominantly privately-owned. At PDFCI's inception, it
received an IDA Credit of $10 million as part of its initial capitalization,
as well as technical assistance (which still continues) financed by UNDP and
executed by the Bank.
ii.       Indonesia's economic prospects remain bright.  Despite recent
financial difficulties arising from the Pertamina crisis, the Government has
managed to expand its investment program significantly in the last two years,
and remains committed to its objective of creating new employment opportuni-
ties and improving living standards. The Second Five-Year Development Plan
(April 1, 1974-March 31, 1979) aims at achieving a long-term annual growth
rate of 7.5% coupled with an annual rate of employment generation of 2.3%.
To this end, increasing reliance is being placed on the continued expansion of
the industrial sector which is expected to grow, in terms of output, at around
12% per annum over the next several years.
iii.      At this early stage of its existence, PDFCI is still facing the
task of further developing its institutional strength, including its manager-
ial and staff capability. When this has been achieved, it will be PDFCI's
objective to provide to industry a broader range of financial and technical
services than those made available by the two other development finance
institutions operating alongside PDFCI in Indonesia (BAPINDO and IDFC),
including promotional inputs, equity investments, industry studies and
technical assistance to enterprises. In consultation with the Government and
the Bank Group, steps are being taken to further strengthen PDFCI's management,
to improve its organization, to expand its Indonesian staff and to maintain
adequate technical assistance to it. These steps are designed to develop and
improve PDFCI's operational capability - which at present is adequate as far as
the performance of its basic development financing functions is concerned - to a
point where PDFCI could effectively undertake the diversified functions referred
to above, thus broadening its contribution to the Indonesian economy.



- ii -
iv.       Since opening its doors for business in March 1974, PDFCI has
made a sound start, albeit a relatively slow one, in developing its opera-
tions. As of June 30, 1976, PDFCI had approved an aggregate of Rp 5,741
million ($13.8 million) in long-term loans and equity investments in 14 proj-
ects, covering a broad range of activities including agro-industry and ser-
vices. The additional direct employment generated by these projects is esti-
mated to be 3,439, at an average investment cost of $15,900 per employee.
The estimated economic rates of return of these projects are satisfactory,
ranging from 14% to 42%. PDFCI's management attaches due weight to the
economic merits of projects in taking investment decisions. PDFCI has
endeavored actively to seek out worthwhile projects for financing and to
improve their design. PDFCI's appraisal standards are good and are expected
to remain adequate even with the forthcoming gradual reduction in the tech-
nical assistance program. Its project supervision work is satisfactory.
It enjoys a good reputation in business and government circles for the
integrity of its business practices. PDFCI is a suitable allocator of Bank
funds for industrial projects in Indonesia.
v.        PDFCI's profitability is modest, owing partly to high administrative
expenditures, as is to be expected given the short span of its operations.
Its financial position is satisfactory. As of June 30, 1976, its total assets
amounted to Rp 6.5 billion, with net worth of Rp 2.95 billion. The current
ratio was 7.5:1. On account of the newness of PDFCI's operations, a major
proportion (59%) of its assets were temporarily employed in short-term invest-
ments (mostly commercial paper and deposits) with the portfolio of long-term
loans accounting for 35% of total assets. The portfolio appears to be of
good quality. With the gradual expansion of its operations, PDFCI expects to
improve its net earnings, in relation to average equity, from 9.1% in 1975 to
12.2% in 1980, still modest but acceptable.
vi.       A Bank loan of $15 million is recommended.  Apart from replenishing
PDFCI's resources, the proposed loan aims at enabling the Bank Group to
continue to assist PDFCI in the on-going institution-building process. The
Bank Group has a strong interest in furthering PDFCI's success since PDFCI
can play a useful role in the sound development of Indonesian industry. In
addition, the Bank Group played an important role initially in promoting and
establishing PDFCI, and in securing the participation of PDFCI's foreign
shareholders. The proposed loan is justified on the basis of PDFCI's adequate
operational performance to date, including the quality of its appraisal and
supervision work. The proposed Bank loan is expected to finance industrial
projects which are economically as well as financially viable.
vii.      As with previous IDA Credits and Bank Loans to financial intermed-
iaries in Indonesia, the proposed loan would be made to the Government for
relending to PDFCI under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank.
The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk, for which it would
receive a fee. The proceeds of the loan would finance, apart from direct
imports, an agreed percentage representing the foreign exchange component of
domestically procured capital goods (60%) and of locally procured vehicles
and local civil works (40%), and the cost of technical services. As with the
first IDA Credit, the spread allowed to PDFCI on the use of the loan proceeds



- iii -
would be limited to four percentage points. The debt/equity limit would be
maintained at 3:1. The free limit would be increased from $0.2 million to
$0.4 million, with an aggregate free limit of $4 million. The other terms and
conditions of the loan would be similar to those of recent Bank loans to DFCs,
including a flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to the
aggregate of the repayment schedules of subloans.






INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF THE
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Private Development Finance Company of
Indonesia (PDFCI) and recommends a Bank loan of $15 million for it.
1.02      PDFCI was established in 1973 with the active cooperation of Bank
Indonesia and the Bank Group and with the objective of strengthening the
Indonesian financial system with the addition of a predominantly privately-
owned development finance company that would provide private sector enter-
prises with a wider range of financial and technical services than those
previously available to them. At PDFCI's inception, IFC made an equity in-
vestment of $482,000, accounting for 8% of the company's share capital.
Shortly thereafter, IDA made a $10 million Credit for PDFCI, which became
effective in March 1974, at which time PDFCI opened its doors for business.
IFC was also primarily responsible for securing the participation of PDFCI's
present foreign shareholders.
1.03      Notwithstanding a number of existing institutional problems referred
to later in this report, some of which are attributable to PDFCI's infancy,
PDFCI has an important role to play within the Indonesian financial system.
In spite of the relatively slow pace of institutional progress to date, PDFCI
has by and large developed its basic organizational strength, and has built
up a nucleus of well-trained and dedicated Indonesian staff, thanks partly
to a technical assistance program financed by UNDP and executed by the Bank.
PDFCI enjoys a good reputation among the business community for the integrity
of its business practices. The Governmenmt and the Bank agree that PDFCI
is a suitable allocator of funds for industry in Indonesia, on the basis of
its satisfactory appraisal work and the soundness of its investment decisions.
The proposed loan, apart from replenishing PDFCI's resources, would help PDFCI
achieve further institutional improvements. By continuing its assistance to
PDFCI, the Bank Group can play a useful role in the Indonesian economy.
II. PDFCI's ENVIRONMENT
2.01      The economic, industrial and financial environment in which PDFCI
operates is analyzed in Annex 1. Some salient features are summarized in the
following paragraphs.
2.02      The Role of Industry.  Industry (manufacturing, mining and con-
struction) represents the third largest sector in the Indonesian economy
(after agriculture and services), accounting for 27% of the gross domestic
product in 1974 and providing employment for about 8% of the total labor



-2-
force. The industrial sector has assumed increasing importance in recent
years, with value added growing in real terms at an average rate of 17% per
annum between 1971 and 1974. However, during 1974 and 1975 the growth of the
industrial sector was adversely affected by international developments, slow-
ing down to an annual rate of 11% in 1974 and 12.4% in 1975. More recently, the
industrial sector has shown signs of recovery. Demand for oil and wood products
has strengthened in export markets and textile production is on the rise.
Although in recent years a number of new types of industries have been estab-
lished, such as industrial chemicals, steel products and motor vehicle and
radio and television set assembly, their direct contribution to employment
creation has been small. An overwhelming majority (97%) of industrial enter-
prises are small-scale. Geographically, manufacturing is concentrated in
Java, particularly in the Jakarta area.
2.03      Government incentives for industrial development include tax pri-
vileges, import duty exemptions and accelerated depreciation allowances. The
Government also seeks to influence the course of industrial development through
the tariff system, some direct import controls and the interest rate policy.
In view of the failure of the industrial sector over the past decade to sub-
stantially increase employment opportunities, the Government is encouraging
the development of labor-intensive small- and medium-scale industries.
2.04      The Financial Sector.  The Indonesian financial system is still at
an early stage of its development. Over the last few years, the Government
has attempted to strengthen it. With Bank Group assistance, BAPINDO, the
state-owned development bank, was reorganized in 1971 with a view to making
it the predominant source of term finance for industry, and PDFCI was estab-
lished in 1973. Together with the Indonesian Development Finance Company
(IDFC), a quasi-public institution that specializes in small industry financ-
ing, BAPINDO and PDFCI make up the core of the existing Indonesian development
banking system. In addition, a specialized institution, P.T. Bahana, was set
up in 1973 to provide equity financing to financially weak domestic enter-
prises. Short-term loans are extended by the state banks and commercial banks,
generally for up to six months with possibility of roll-over. Financing for
small-scale enterprises is available from two investment credit schemes
administered by Bank Indonesia and handled by the state banks.
2.05      Interest Rates.  Interest rates applied by the state banks are set by
Bank Indonesia.  Private financial institutions such as PDFCI may set their own
rates but in practice they, too, apply the general level of interest rates of
state banks. At present, deposit rates range from 6 to 24% p.a., depending on
the duration. Lending rates applied by state banks range generally from 12%
(for term loans below Rp 100 million) to 24% for working capital loans; the
standard lending rate for term loans (above Rp 100 million) is 15% p.a. The
high deposit rates of up to 24%, in relation to the standard term lending rate
of 15%, precludes financial intermediaries such as PDFCI from mobilizing domestic
long-term funds. The Governemnt is reviewing the present structure of interest
rates and the Bank intends to join the Government in discussion of this matter
in the near future.



- 3 -
The 15% standard lending rate itself, which will also be PDFCI's relending
rate under the proposed Bank loan (para 6.06), is adequate, in relation to
(a) projections of future inflation in Indonesia (15% in 1977, and around 10%
on average over the period 1977-1980); and (b) the cost of borrowings from
the Singapore and Hong Kong capital markets, which at present is below 10-11%
(with the foreign exchange risk borne by the borrower).
III. OBJECTIVES OF PDFCI's ESTABLISHMENT
3.01      The Bank Group began working with the Government in 1967 to help
improve the institutional framework for providing medium- and long-term indus-
trial finance in Indonesia. At that time, the Indonesian development banking
system was limited to: (a) BAPINDO, the largest, a government-owned financial
intermediary; and (b) the relatively small Indonesian Development Finance
Company (IDFC), a quasi-public financial institution owned and controlled
jointly by the Government (through Bank Indonesia) and the Netherlands Over-
seas Finance Corporation in which the Dutch government has a majority interest.
In the course of examining the country's institutional framework the Govern-
ment decided in 1970 that there was need and scope for a third development
bank that, unlike the two above-mentioned institutions, would be predominantly
owned and managed by the private sector. That policy decision, which led to
PDFCI's creation in 1973, was based on the following considerations:
(a) the rapid growth of Indonesian industry warranted the
existence of an additional financial intermediary to
help meet the considerable increase in long-term financ-
ing requirements, especially those of the private sector,
in view particularly of the fact that BAPINDO and IDFC
were expected to be able to finance only a modest
proportion of total industrial investment; and
(b) the new institution, i.e. PDFCI, was expected to help
improve the quality of resource allocation by spread-
ing in Indonesia the practice of sound development
banking methods, including thorough project evaluation
as the basis for investment decisions; and by provid-
ing to industry a broader range of financial and
technical services than those available from BAPINDO
and IDFC, for example equity investments, promotional
inputs and technical assistance to enterprises. The
basic objective was not merely to establish another
financial intermediary, but one that by virtue of
its high operational standards would make a signi-
ficant qualitative contribution to the Indonesian
financial system. Finally, PDFCI was expected in
due course to be able to open up new sources of funds
from the international capital markets, initially
through IFC, thereby gradually reducing its depen-
dence on official funding.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE
Functions
4.01      The main functions of PDFCI, as outlined in its policy statement
(Annex 2), are to assist in the creation, expansion and modernization of
private industrial enterprises; to foster the development of the capital
market; and to help improve the technical, financial, managerial and admin-
istrative practices of private enterprises in Indonesia. The policy state-
ment specifically emphasizes promotional work as one of PDFCI's basic func-
tions. PDFCI seeks to provide a broader range of financial services to
industry than those made available by BAPINDO and IDFC, both of which concen-
trate mainly on straight lending. PDFCI is empowered to make medium- and
long-term loans, to invest in shares, to provide guarantees, to underwrite
debt and security issues, and to supply technical and consultancy services.
It also intends to extend refinancing facilities in selected cases to improve
the capital structure of worthwhile enterprises that are burdened with exces-
sive short-term and medium-term borrowing. At this early stage of its exist-
ence, owing to its limited managerial and staff resources, PDFCI confines
itself largely to basic development financing functions (e.g. selection,
aDpraisal and supervision of projects), but it intends gradually to broaden
the scope of its operations to include the diversified activities referred to
above, as it develops its institutional strength. In 1975, PDFCI's Board
decided that, in addition to development financing, PDFCI should explore
the feasibility of undertaking short-term money market operations, (to be
financed with borrowings) with the objective of augmenting its business
volume and earnings potential. It is PDFCI's intention that these short-term
business operations should not alter PDFCI's basic character as a term-finan-
cing institution. The Bank has expressed to PDFCI the view that these short-
term money market operations should not be undertaken until PDFCI has: (a)
carried out a thorough study which would confirm the financial feasibility
of this activity; and (b) developed the specialized expertise and set up a
properly staffed unit within its organization to handle this type of business.
It has been agreed that PDFCI would consult the Bank prior to undertaking
short-term money market operations involving borrowings.
Ownership and Capitalization
4.02      PDFCI's ownership structure reflects the basic objective underlying
its establishment, namely that of introducing in Indonesia a predominantly
privately-owned development finance company (para 3.01). Its paid-in share
capital, which has remained unchanged since its inception, stands at Rp 2.5
billion (about $6 million equivalent). Of this amount, 60% is owned by
Indonesian shareholders including Bank Indonesia, and the balance of 40% by
IFC and 8 foreign commercial banks. Bank Indonesia, with 21.8% of PDFCI's
share capital, is its largest shareholder. It is Bank Indonesia's intention
in due course to sell Dart of its shares to Indonesian private shareholders
with the object of enlarging private ownership of PDFCI. IFC's share is 8%.
Annex 3 gives the list of principal shareholders.



- 5 -
4.03      As part of PDFCI's initial capitalization, the Government agreed
to provide PDFCI with a subordinated loan of Rp 2,075 million, of which
Rp 1,660 million had been disbursed to PDFCI as of June 30, 1976. This
concessional loan, repayable in 30 years including 15 years of grace, at
an interest rate of 4% per annum, was designed to attract private Indonesian
shareholders into PDFCI by improving PDFCI's earnings prospects, and more
importantly, to give evidence of the Government's commitment to and concrete
support of a private development bank in Indonesia. (The Government's support
was additionally demonstrated in a recent Rp 1.5 billion line of credit
granted to PDFCI by Bank Indonesia (para 4.21)). The previous IDA Credit for
PDFCI, of $10 million, also formed part of PDFCI's initial capitalization.
Board and Management
4.04      PDFCI's Board (Annex 4) comprises 13 members of whom 5 represent
the foreign shareholders and IFC. The 8 Indonesian directors are prominent
members of the business and banking community. The present Board Chairman
is Mr. Soediarso, a former senior executive of Bank Indonesia and presently
a prominent business leader. The Chairman of the Executive Committee is
Mr. Djoanna Koesoemahardja, formerly a Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor. While
the Board lays down policy guidelines and has the ultimate responsibility for
all investment decisions, it has delegated authority to the Executive Commit-
tee (comprising 5 Board members) to approve individual investments and loans
up to Rp 200 million. PDFCI's Board as a body possesses a considerable range
of banking and financial expertise, and takes a keen interest in PDFCI's af-
fairs. Bank Indonesia, on account of its broad influence over the Indonesian
financial system as well as its sizeable shareholding in PDFCI, also plays an
important role in the overall direction of PDFCI's affairs. IFC is repre-
sented on both the Board and the Executive Committee.
4.05      PDFCI's Chief Executive Officer, who is also a member of both
the Board and Executive Committee, has had extensive professional experience,
first in Bank Indonesia and subsequently in the private sector. Reflecting
a conscious decision by the steering committee (including the Bank Group)
involved in setting up PDFCI in 1973, the Chief Executive is invested with
extensive managerial powers, more or less along the lines of a "western" cor-
porate management structure, in contrast to the usual Indonesian management
system based on consensus ("mushawara"). In spite of his limited success
in recruiting qualified staff for PDFCI (para 4.10), the present Chief
Executive has, on balance, performed adequately. His personal integrity as
well as the integrity of PDFCI's business practices are well recognized in
the business community. PDFCI's Board is planning to further strengthen its
management. To this end, the Board Chairman and the Executive Committee
Chairman, both highly capable, intend to become increasingly involved in
PDFCI's management, as the need dictates, thus moving PDFCI's management
structure de facto toward the Indonesian system of "mushawara" referred to
above.  In addition, following consultations with Bank Indonesia and the Bank
Group, PDFCI's Board envisages appointing a Deputy Chief Executive, and is
searching for a suitable candidate.



-6-
Operational Capability
4.06      Technical Assistance Program.  In the course of developing the
proposal to establish PDFCI in the period prior to 1973, it became clear to
the Bank Group and PDFCI's Indonesian sponsors that PDFCI was going to require
considerable expatriate expertise, at least in its initial years, in view of
the severe shortage of experienced Indonesian personnel in the development
banking field. Consequently, the Bank Group, in conjunction with its initial
financing (IFC's investment and the IDA Credit) formulated a program of
technical assistance for PDFCI which, implemented since PDFCI's inception
in 1973, still continues. This program is financed largely by UNDP, with
the Bank acting as the executing agency. It has provided PDFCI with the
services of four expatriate experts to assist PDFCI in managerial duties
and staff training for an initial period of about three years. These four
expatriate experts joined PDFCI between September 1973 and July 1974, respec-
tively as: (a) Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer; (b) Manager of the
Appraisal Department; (c) Manager of the Business Development and Project
Identification Department (BDPI); and (d) Chief Engineer 1/. It was PDFCI's
objective to replace the three foreign experts holding executive positions
(i.e. those mentioned from (b) to (d) above) by suitable Indonesian staff
members as soon as the latter became available. In keeping with that objec-
tive, PDFCI in the first half of 1976 appointed three of its Indonesian
officers to fill the executive positions (b), (c) and (d) above, whereupon
the three foreign experts became advisors to their respective Indonesian
counterparts.
4.07      Because of UNDP's recent financial difficulties, the technical
assistance program is being curtailed In its scope. UNDP's financing con-
tinued to be available for these four foreign experts until August 1976, and
thereafter for only three of them until December 31, 1976. After the latter
date, PDFCI will retain those three foreign advisors through June 30, 1977,
and will finance their services with the proceeds of the IDA Credit, the
legal documents for which have been amended to allow such financing. The
proposed loan also provides for the financing of technical services by a
foreign advisor, as proposed in para 4.08.
4.08      The technical assistance program has largely achieved its initial
objectives, e.g. to help PDFCI start its business in its initial years; to
induct PDFCI's management and staff into the field of development banking,
particularly by the formulation of operating guidelines and procedures; and
to provide on-the-job training to the Indonesian staff by the foreign experts.
In view of the need further to upgrade the quality of PDFCI's operations and
train its Indonesian staff (para 4.10), some foreign technical assistance
to PDFCI, will continue beyond June 30, 1977. PDFCI has agreed to employ one
expatriate advisor acceptable to the Bank through June 30, 1979.
1/   The Appraisal and Promotion Departments, together with the Engineering
Unit, were subsequently merged into a single Projects Department (para
4.12).



- 7 -
4.09      Staff Capability.  Not including its Chief Executive Officer and
the four foreign advisors, PDFCI's staff as of June 30, 1976, totalled 59,
of which 28 were professionals. The latter number included 4 engineers, 16
investment officers (with a general academic and/or professional background
in business, finance and marketing), 2 accountants and 6 administrative and
legal officers. Although PDFCI does not have economists as such, it does
have a number of staff members possessing sufficient economic knowledge to
undertake basic economic analysis of projects, including the calculation of
financial and economic rates of return. PDFCI's present staffing position
is shown in Annex 5. Its plans for staff expansion in the next five years
are discussed in para 5.02 and tabulated in Annex 5-A.
4.10      There is in PDFCI a relative shortage of experienced senior project
staff, and an abundance of inexperienced junior staff who came to PDFCI follow-
ing their graduation from college and whose development and training are still
far from complete. To correct this lack of staff depth, there is a need for
PDFCI to (i) aim its future recruitment efforts at hiring candidates with
some professional experience who have a potential for becoming suitable pro-
ject officers within a relatively short time; and (ii) intensify staff train-
ing. PDFCI's past inability to recruit a sufficient number of experienced
professionals (in spite of a satisfactory salary scale) was attributable in
part to the shortage of suitable candidates in Indonesia, but also to a not
very aggressive recruitment strategy followed by PDFCI's management. (Recently,
however, PDFCI has succeeded in recruiting two promising intermediate-level
officers). The present lack of staff depth notwithstanding, training by the
foreign experts since 1973 has had a beneficial impact, and PDFCI at present
does have a nucleus of adequately trained and dedicated Indonesian staff.
This provides a reasonable assurance that, in spite of the current reduction
in the scope of technical assistance by foreign experts (para 4.07), PDFCI's
operational standards in future would remain adequate, at least in regard to
the performance of PDFCI's basic development financing functions (e.g. ap-
praisal and supervision of projects). However, there is a need for PDFCI to
considerably strengthen its Indonesian staff, both qualitatively and quanti-
tatively, in order for it to undertake effectively the diversified functions
(including promotional work, managerial and technical consultancy services,
capital markets operations, etc.) intended for it (para 3.01(b)). The above
objective can be achieved, not overnight but gradually, through continuing
staff training and upgrading in addition to the recruitment of some additional
intermediate-level staff of good caliber. In other words, PDFCI still has some
way to go in developing its institutional strength to a point where it could
make a significant qualitative contribution to the Indonesian economy.
Organization
4.11      Until 1975, PDFCI's project staff 1/ was grouped in three main
units: (a) the Business Development and Project Identification Department
(Promotion Department for short); (b) the Project Appraisal Department; and
(c) the Engineering Cell. The existence of a separate Promotion Department
1/   exclusive of non-project staff, such as accountants, legal and adminis-
trative officers, et al.



- 8 -
reflected PDFCI's special emphasis on promotiQnal activity (para 4.01). In
view of the short span of PDFCI's operations and the lack of an active port-
folio, project supervision work until 1975 was done by a single staff member
within the Appraisal Department.
4.12      In 1976 PDFCI undertook a reorganization of its project staff by
merging the three above-mentioned departments into a single Projects Depart-
ment. This new Department, presently supervised directly by the Chief Execu-
tive Officer, is divided into 4 project units, each headed by an Acting
Manager assisted by two or three investment officers. (Within the pew Proj-
ects Department, the Engineering Cell remains more or less a separate entity
cooperating with all 4 project units). Each unit now performs the full range
of project work (project development, project appraisal and project supervi-
sion), i.e. it handles projects assigned to it from the time they first come
to PDFCI through appraisal to supervision until the loans are repaid. There
is no specialization among the four units based either on type of work (e.g
promotion, appraisal, supervision) or on industrial activity (e.g. chemicals,
textiles, etc.). PDFCI's rationale for the new organizational set-up was
that: (a) its clients preferred to deal with a single group of staff members
rather than with three successive groups (promotion, appraisal, supervision),
as was previously the case; (b) the previous system occasioned delays at the
transition points, e.g. from promotion to appraisal, and from appraisal to
supervision; and (c) the new system, by doing away with specialization based
on type of work, enables the training of each project officer in the full
spectrum of skills (promotion, appraisal, supervision) required for project
work.
4.13      It is difficult yet to form a judgment on the effectiveness of
PDFCI's recent organization, on account of its newness. Nevertheless the new
system should be considered as no more than an experiment for PDFCI at this
time, to be kept under close study by PDFCI's management. A more definitive
organization of PDFCI's project staff should aim, inter alia, at the following
objectives:
(a) to re-emphasize promotional activity, which de facto
has been downgraded with the recent dissolution of the
Promotion Department. While this downgrading was under-
standable on practical grounds (e.g. the fact that PDFCI
in any case does not have adequate staff to undertake
effective promotional work following the reduction of
the foreign experts' services; and the need to concen-
trate existing scarce staff resources on the more urgent
task of project appraisal), promotional activity should
remain a crucial function for a financial intermediary
operating in the Indonesian context, such as PDFCI
(para 4.01). PDFCI should get involved actively in
promotional activity (with or without a separate
Promotion Department) when it has developed the
necessary staff strength; and



- 9 -
(b) to separate project supervision from appraisal work
(through the establishment of a specific Supervision
Unit), as PDFCI's portfolio expands, in order to
ensure more systematic and objective supervision work.
The Bank has conveyed the views outlined in (a) and (b) above to the Govern-
ment and PDFCI. Furthermore, the Government and PDFCI have informed the
Bank that the prospective Deputy Chief Executive would be put directly in
charge of the project units, in order to tighten up the coordination of
their work.
Operational Performance
4.14      Development Financing.  Since opening its doors for business in
March 1974, PDFCI has made a sound start, albeit a relatively slow one,
in its operations. As of June 30, 1976, net of cancellations, 14 loans and
4 equity investments had been approved for 14 projects. PDFCI's operations
are tabulated in Annex 6 and summarized below.

The sharp reduction in the number of projects in the pipeline, from 64 in 1975
to 24 in mid-1976, reflected the fact that PDFCI, beginning in 1976, made
greater efforts than previously in screening out unsuitable applications. As
a result of this screening process, the 1976 pipeline, though smaller than in
1975, was reasonably firm.
4.15      The 14 projects approved by PDFCI (net of the 4 projects subsequently
cancelled) covered a broad range of industrial activities including agro-indus-
try and services (tea plantation, cassava pelletizing, textiles, wood projects,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metal products, tile manufacturing, hotel), involved
an aggregate fixed investment cost of Rp 22.6 billion, including PDFCI's financ-
ing of Rp 5,741 million, of which Rp 343 million represented equity investments.
The average size of loans was Rp 385 million ($0.9 million). The additional



- 10 -
direct employment generated by these projects is estimated to be 3,439 at an
average investment cost of Rp 6.6 million ($15,900) per employee. The esti-
mated economic rates of return (bo- i on projections made during project
appraisal) are satisfactory, ranging generally from 14% to 42%. PDFCI's ma-
nagement attaches due weight to t  economic benefits of projects in taking
investment decisions, and has rejected some highly profitable projects because
of their dubious economic merits. Annex 6 summarizes PDFCI's loans and equity
operations. Annex 7 gives the characteristics of PDFCI-financed projects.
4.16      As stated in para 4.01, promotional work was intended to be an
important function for PDFCI. To the extent that promotion means narrowly
the creation of new business ventures, there has been no concrete achieve-
ment to date. However, taking "promotion" as "project development" in a
broader sense, PDFCI has played a useful role in influencing/improving the
design of projects submitted to it for financing. Annex 8 describes several
cases in which PDFCI's intervention has resulted in improving projects, by
changes made in the scale of production, marketing arrangements, management
set-up, corporate organization, financial structure, and indigenous owner-
ship, etc. PDFCI has also made commendable efforts actively to seek out
meritorious projects for financing. In addition, the standards of its apprai-
sal work, with the foreign experts' input, are quite good. These efforts
by PDFCI, taken together, represented a useful contribution toward improving
resource allocation in the country, which is one of PDFCI's main objectives
(para 3.01(b)), and should be laying the groundwork for a substantially
greater contribution in the future.
4.17      Considering the impediments PDFCI faced, its operational performance,
as described in the preceding paragraphs, was satisfactory. These impediments
included the delayed arrival of two of the four foreign experts (who joined
PDFCI only in the second half of 1974); PDFCI's initial difficulty in recruit-
ing a nucleus of local staff because of the lack of qualified candidates; and
more basically the fact that most of the financing proposals submitted to
PDFCI were badly conceived and/or prepared, which caused an unusually high
rate of rejection (see Table in para 4.14).
4.18      Short-Term Investments.  As with other DFCs in their initial years,
PDFCI has had at its disposal to date sizeable temporarily surplus funds (its
own equity funds and the Government subordinated loan) awaiting disbursement
to long-term loans and investments. As a means of earning a return, these
funds were employed in short-term investments, initially in the form of time
deposits and certificates of deposit with state commercial banks. When the
Government in December 1974 lowered the rate paid on time deposits (Annex 1,
para 21) and in May 1975 decided that non-bank financial institutions (e.g.
PDFCI) were no longer allowed to invest in government-guaranteed time deposits
with state banks, PDFCI switched increasingly to money market operations, a
more lucrative if somewhat riskier business. Deposits which amounted to
Rp 1,854 million as at year-end 1973 and accounted for the totality of PDFCI's
short-term portfolio, declined to Rp 200 million as of June 30, 1976, repre-
senting only 5% of the same portfolio. Notes receivable, on the other hand,
increased to Rp 3,473 million ($8.4 million equivalent) as of the same date.
They reached a peak of Rp 3,978 million at the end of April 1976, following



- 11 -
the drawdown of Rp 1,250 million of short-term borrowings which PDFCI incurred
in March 1976 specifically for financing short-term operations. At the same
time, the variety of money market operations undertaken by PDFCI also expanded,
from the relatively simple ones (such as discounting of bank acceptances, and
commercial papers endorsed by well-established financial intermediaries) to
more complex operations (for instance, financing of "blocked accounts" , i.e.
contracts between a PDFCI client and the central or local governments for
goods and/or services already supplied or yet to be supplied) (para 4.26).
4.19      As stated in para 4.01, the Bank Group has urged PDFCI, in view of
its present lack of specialized expertise, not to undertake short-term money
market operations involving borrowings before consulting the Bank Group and
before setting up the requisite expertise and organization. On the other
hand, the Bank Group has previously decided not to ob-ject to PDFCI's under-
taking these money market operations as long as they involve only the tem-
porary employment of PDFCI's idle funds (i.e., without borrowings), because
these operations, provided they are carried out with due caution, are neces-
sary to preserve PDFCI's profitability, and because they are expected to taper
off gradually, as PDFCI increases its disbursements to long-term operations.
4.20      It has been agreed that PDFCI would consult the Bank prior to
undertaking short-term money market operations involving borrowings (para
4.01). In addition, an understanding has been reached to the effect that
PDFCI will stop financing short-term operations secured only by "blocked
accounts" such as those referred to in para 4.18.
Resource Position
4.21      Because of the convertibility of the Indonesian currency (para 22;
Annex 1), PDFCI in principle can utilize its domestic currency funds for
financing imports.  Furthermore, the IDA Credit was relent by the Government
to PDFCI in rupiah (para 6.05), and thus can be treated, from PDFCI's stand-
point, as domestic currency resources in the strict sense. In short, legally
there is complete fungibility of domestic and foreign currency resources.
However, it is the Government's policy, based on considerations of balance of
payments, that financial institutions (such as BAPINDO and PDFCI) should, as a
rule, finance imports with foreign borrowings, not with their rupiah funds.
PDFCI follows this policy in managing its overall resources, by utilizing the
IDA Credit for financing imports (plus the foreign exchange component of
domestically procured capital goods), and its rupiah resources for financing
local expenditures. In view of this practice, it is appropriate, when looking
at PDFCI's resource position, to make a distinction between foreign exchange and
rupiah funds, as is done in Annex 10. (Henceforth, E'DFCI's foreign borrowings,
such as the IDA Credit and future Bank loans, will be treated in this report as
foreign exchange resources, despite the fact that they are relent by the Govern-
ment to PDFCI in rupiahs). PDFCI's domestic currency resource position has been
strengthened considerably by the addition of a Rp 1.5 billion (US$3.6 million
equivalent) line of credit from Bank Indonesia in 1976. This together with an
increase in free reserves and retained earnings of Rp 112 million, raised
PDFCI's available domestic resources by Rp 1,612 million over the year ended
June 30, 1976. Since disbursements increased by Rp 629 million and undisbursed
commitments by Rp 371 million over the same period, ]'DFCI's total domestic



- 12 -
resources available for further commitments rose by Rp 612 million. As of the
abovementioned date, PDFCI's available domestic currency resources totalled
Rp 5,129 million, enough to cover its projected commitments of domestic cur-
rency loans and investments until mid-1978 (para 5.03). The foreign currency
resource position, however, is much tighter. Of the $10 million IDA Credit,
which constitutes PDFCI's only existing foreign exchange resources, an amount
of about $9.9 million had been committed for 15 projects as of December 31,
1976.
Financial Position and Performance
4.22      Summarized balance sheets and income statements for the period
1973-June 30, 1976 are presented in Annex 9.  Although PDFCI was formally
established in July 1973, its capitalization was not completed until
March 1974, and its first investment decision not taken until October 1974.
Its first disbursement for a term-loan was made only in April 1975. It is
therefore not surprising that up until June 30, 1975, PDFCI's assets con-
sisted almost exclusively of bank deposits and short-term investments. Over
the twelve month period ending June 30, 1976, however, the composition of
PDFCI's assets has substantially changed as indicated below:

- 13 -
As of June 30, 1976 PDFCI's total assets stood at Rp 6,447 million (US$15.5
million), having increased by over 35% in twelve months, (compared to an 18%
growth in 1975) reflecting mainly the stepped up level of long-term lending
operations, the proportion of outstanding long-term loans in the asset base
rising from 9% of June 30, 1975, to 35% as of June 30, 1976.
4.23      The growth of long-term loan assets was financed almost entirely
by a concomitant growth in long-term debt, particularly foreign debt. Whereas
PDFCI's long-term debt remained stable at Rp 1,660 million until June 30,
1975, it jumped by 79 percent to Rp 2,970 million as of June 30, 1976 as a
result of the rapid drawdown on the IDA Credit. While the outstanding long-
term debt increased by 79 percent between year-end 1974 and June 30, 1976
(from Rp 1,660 million to Rp 2,970 million), PDFCI's equity grew by only
10% (from Rp 2,669 million to Rp 2,950 million), the growth being accounted
for by additions to reserves. As a result, the debt/equity ratio rose from
0.6:1 at end 1974 to 1.0:1 as of June 30, 1976; the ratio as defined under
the IDA Credit Agreement (in which the outstanding portion of the Government
subordinated loan is treated as equity) increased from 0.0:1 to 0.3:1 over
the same period, still well below the 3.0:1 contractual limit. The liquidity
position has remained more than sound, the current ratio being 7.5 as of
June 30, 1976. On the basis of PDFCI's projections, an increase in the exist-
ing debt/equity limit of 3.0:1 as currently defined is not considered necessary
at this time (para 5.05).
4.24      The increase in operations has caused net income to rise from Rp 235
million in 1975 to Rp 146 million during the first six months of 1976, repre-
senting a 24 percent increase on an annual basis over the previous year.
Income growth was attributable entirely to the long-term portfolio with in-
creased interest charges being offset by increased financial expenses result-
ing in a constant gross spread. Administrative and personnel expenses, on the
other hand, have been increasing from 3.4% of average total assets in 1974, to
3.8% and 3.9% for 1975 and the first semester of 1976 (on an annual basis)
respectively. Therefore, although PDFCI's profit levels have increased, as
a percentage of average total assets, net earnings before provisions and
tax have declined from 9.1% in 1975 to 8.2% for the twelve month period ending
June 30, 1976. The same trend has affected net income as a percentage of aver-
age equity which has fallen over the same period from 8.4% to 7.2%, despite
higher leverage. PDFCI's Board decided nevertheless to declare a dividend of
Rp 87.5 million (i.e. 3.5% of par value) out of the 1975 net income.  This
represented a 37.4% cash payout ratio. In anticipation of its need to raise
additional share capital in 1978, PDFCI plans to maintain a 25% cash dividend
pay-out ratio in coming years. Given its projected profitability over the
next two years (Annex 11, Table 5), such a pay-out ratio may prove insuffici-
ent by itself to generate interest on the part of PDFCI's shareholders in the
proposed share capital increase. However, if PDFCI succeeds in curtailing
administrative and personnel expenses as a percentage of average total assets,
as it intends to do, it is likely to improve further its profitability, which
would enable it to attract fresh equity capital.



- 14 -
Portfolio Quality
4.25      It is as yet difficult to judge the soundness of PDFCI's long-term
loan and equity investment portfolios as both are still very new. As of
June 30, 1976, PDFCI's loan portfolio of Rp 2,241 million was on account of
8 client companies of which two with outstanding loans of Rp 569 million (25%
of total portfolio) were servicing regularly. Five clients representing 58%
of the total amount outstanding were still in the grace period of principal
repayment, and with the exception of one, were paying interest charges on
time. The remaining company, with an outstanding loan of Rp 360 million (17%
of total), was slightly in arrears on both principal and interest payments,
for an amount totaling Rp 67 million. Total arrears, as of June 30, 1976,
stood therefore at Rp 80 million, representing 3.6% of the total loan port-
folio. The principal overdue totalled Rp 40 million or only 1.8% of the
total portfolio. The outstanding portfolio affected by arrears amounted to
Rp 508 million or 23% of the total loan portfolio. PDFCI is keeping close
watch on the two projects whose accounts are in arrears and is confident
that their problems can be solved. On the whole, PDFCI's long-term portfolio
appears sound. PDFCI maintains provisions for doubtful accounts at 2% of the
outstanding loan portfolio, which is adequate. PDFCI does a thorough job in
supervising its portfolio, by keeping in close touch with clients and by
endeavoring actively to identify, and deal with, project problems at an
early stage.
4.26      The soundness of PDFCI's short term investment portfolio was some-
what more difficult for the appraisal mission to ascertain (see para 4.28
on audit of the short-term investment portfolio). As of June 30, 1976,
PDFCI held Rp 3,473 million (US$8.4 million) in short-term commercial papers
with maturities of between 15 days and 13 months, that were either issued or
endorsed with full recourse by private banks or non-bank financial institu-
tions. Papers issued by banking institutions totalled Rp 269 million and
represented 8% of the outstanding short-term portfolio; those issued by pri-
vate enterprises and endorsed by banking institutions amounted to Rp 1,339
million and represented 38% of the portfolio. Others totalling Rp 1,311.5
million were secured by certificates of Government-guaranteed time deposits
with state banks and represented 38% of the short-term investment portfolio.
The last category (para 4.18) amounting to Rp 553.5 million consisted of
promissory notes issued by enterprises holding contracts with the central or
local governments under the terms of which partial payments for their services
are to be paid in accounts with state banks that remain "blocked" (or frozen)
until full implementation of the contracts. PDFCI held as security, in this
case, a first claim on the amounts paid in or to be paid in such blocked
accounts.
4.27      Papers backed by certificates of time deposits to date have not
presented any particular difficulty to PDFCI; they represent a very safe form
of short-term investment. Papers endorsed by certain financial institutions
have been rolled-over many times which might indicate some difficulty in
collection; these notes totalled Rp 339 million (US$820,000) and accounted
for 9.7% of the total outstanding portfolio. PDFCI's practice of accepting
"blocked" accounts as security is potentially the riskiest; in certain



- 15 -
instances PDFCI has in effect pre-financed borrowers before they had delivered
the goods or performed the services for which they were to be paid (para 4.18).
Because of the degree of risk involved, and the fact that this type of financ-
ing pertains to commercial banking rather than development financing, the Bank
suggested and PDFCI agreed at loan negotiations that PDFCI will discontinue
the financing of "blocked accounts" (para 4.20).
Audit
4.28      Drs. Utomo, Mulia & Co., associated with the Sycip, Gorres & Velayo
(SGV) Group, have audited PDFCI's accounts since inception. Their reports
have always been without qualification. They however did not cover PDFCI's
short-term portfolio, which continues to make up a sizeable proportion of
its total assets. Both PDFCI's management and its auditors were made aware
of this deficiency, and during loan negotiations, an understanding was reached
to the effect that from 1976 onward, audit reports on PDFCI shall contain a
detailed examination of its short-term investment portfolio. Furthermore, an
ad hoc report on PDFCI's short-term investment portfolio as of August 31,
1976, prepared by PDFCI's auditors at the Bank's request, was reviewed during
loan negotiations. The above-mentioned report included a number of detailed
recommendations by the auditors for tightening up PDFCI's procedures regarding
short-term operations, which.PDFCI will implement.
Terms and Conditions of PDFCI's Financial Assistance
4.29      PDFCI's term loans generally carry a maturity of 5 to 10 years in-
cluding a 1-2 year grace period. It has been PDFCI's practice to charge
interest rates reflecting its estimate of market conditions in Indonesia.
Up until June 1976, PDFCI charged differential rates ranging from 15 to 18%,
depending upon the financial risk involved, the size and duration of the
loan, the geographic location of the project, the type of borrower (indi-
genous or not) and the type of industry. The rate applied is not differen-
tiated by type of currency (rupiah or foreign currency) because the foreign
exchange risk on foreign exchange sub-loans is borne by the Government, not
the sub-borrowers (para 6.05). There were recent indications that differen-
tial rates higher than 15% might have hurt PDFCI's competitive position,
given the flat 15% rate charged by BAPINDO and other term lenders (Annex 1-A).
Consequently, following consultations with Bank staff, PDFCI intends from now
on to charge a uniform rate of 15% on subloans to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan, so long as this remains the standard rate applied by BAPINDO and
other financial institutions. (The adequacy of the 15% interest rate is dis-
cussed in para 2.05 and in Annex 1). Under the proposed Bank loan, as with
the first IDA Credit, PDFCI's spread would be limited to 4 percentage points.
V. PDFCI's PROSPECTS
General Outlook
5.01      Indonesia's overall economic prospects remain bright.  Recent
financial difficulties notwithstanding, the Government remains committed to



- 16 -
its objective of improving living standards and creating new employment
opportunities. As stated in the Second Five-Year Development Plan (April 1,
1974 - March 31, 1979), the aim is to achieve a long-term annual growth rate
of 7.5% coupled with an annual rate of employment creation of 2.3%. To this
end, increasing reliance is being placed on the continued expansion of the
industrial sector which is expected to grow at around 12% per annum over the
next several years. Given their available resources, local term lending
institutions will no doubt find themselves hard pressed to meet the demand
for long-term investment capital that such a development of the industrial
sector will entail. PDFCI is therefore unlikely to face the problem of
lack of business. In the foreseeable future, as in the past, PDFCI's opera-
tions will be limited much more by its staff resources and processing capa-
city than by demand for its financing.
Projected Operations
5.02      For the reasons stated above, PDFCI has projected its future volume
of operations on the basis of its staffing plan (Annex 5-A), which itself was
drawn up with the objective of gradually raising PDFCI's processing capacity
from 12 projects per year in 1976 to 16 in 1977, 20 in 1978, 27 in 1979, and
32 in 1980. This staffing plan, which has a direct bearing on PDFCI's future
operational capacity, was reviewed at loan negotiations and was considered
adequate for the purpose of enabling PDFCI to achieve its target volume of
operations. On the basis of assumptions detailed in Annex 11, Attachment 1,
PDFCI expects to increase the annual volume of its commitments for loans and
equity investments significantly from Rp 5.1 billion (estimated) for 1976 to
Rp 17.9 billion in 1980, i.e. at an average annual rate of 36% over the
projected period. Term loans are expected to account for roughly 90% of
total approvals, with the balance going to equity investments. PDFCI's pro-
jected volume of operations is presented in Annex 11, Table 1; the following
table summarizes projected commitments:

resources, in spite of convertibility, is given in para 4.21.

The attainment of the above business targets will require a continuing and
considerable expansion of PDFCI's operational capability, which in turn will
largely depend on PDFCI's success in implementing its plan for staff build-up
referred to earlier in this paragraph.
Resource Requirements 1/
5.03      Domestic Currency - PDFCI's total rupiah disbursements from January
1, 1976 through December 31, 1980 are estimated at Rp 17.3 billion. At the
beginning of that period, PDFCI had Rp 4.2 billion available for disbursement.
The table below indicates how PDFCI plans to meet its domestic currency
resource requirements.

As can be seen from the above, the  draw-down of the Rp 1.5 billion Bank
Indonesia credit line along with the release of the last tranche (Rp 415 mil-
lion) of the Government subordinated loan will cover PDFCI's local currency
resource requirements, on a disbursement basis, until mid-1978. At that time,
PDFCI plans to raise its paid-in share capital by Rp 1.25 billion and secure
additional domestic currency loans for a total of Rp 8.8 billion mainly from
Bank Indonesia, which would enable it to achieve its projected level of
domestic currency disbursements over the remainder of the projection period.
This projection of borrowings does not appear unreasonable, given Bank Indo-
nesia's willingness to provide PDFCI with domestic currency resources, as was
evidenced by the recent Rp 1.5 billion line of credit.
5.04      Foreign Currency - For its term lending operations, PDFCI plans
to commit approximately US$81.5 million in foreign exchange resources from
January 1, 1976 through 1980. Taking into account the balance of US$6.5 mil-
lion of the IDA credit available for commitment at year-end 1975, PDFCI
1/   The reason for distinguising between domestic and foreign currency
resources, in spite of convertibility, is given in para 4.21.

would need to borrow about US$75 million. In the short run, the proposed
Bank loan would cover PDFCI's foreign exchange resource requirements, on a
commitment basis, until the end of 1978. This would still leave a foreign
currency resource gap of around US$60 million for the remainder of the pro-
jection period. Potential sources o foreign borrowings, apart from the Bank,
include IFC and KfW of Germany. IFC would consider, at an appropriate time,
syndicating a loan for PDFCI with participations by PDFCI's foreign share-
holders. Such a loan by IFC would represent PDFCI's first attempt at mobiliz-
ing foreign commercial resources, in keeping with one of its basic corporate
objectives (para 3.01(b)), but would become feasible only when PDFCI had
succeeded in further developing its track record and managerial and financial
strength.
Projected Financial Position
5.05      Projected balance sheets through 1980 are shown in Annex 11, Table 2,
and selected financial ratios in Table 5 of this Annex. On the basis of its
forecast volume of business, PDFCI's total assets would increase from Rp 6.4
billion at mid-year 1976 to Rp 43.1 billion at end-1980, at an average annual
rate of about 47%. This growth is entirely attributable to the term loan and
equity investment portfolio which is projected to reach Rp 39.5 billion in
1980 after increasing at an average rate of 75% from its mid-1976 level of
Rp 2.3 billion. This along with the gradual disappearance of PDFCI's short-
term investment portfolio will substantially modify the structure of assets;
the term loan portfolio which accounted for only 34.4% of total assets as of
mid-year 1976, would represent about 84.0% of these assets in 1980, while the
share of current assets would correspondingly decline from 60.9% to 7.2%.
A major proportion of the increase in assets is expected to be financed
through long-term debts which will go up from Rp 2.9 billion at mid-year 1976
to Rp 36.1 billion in 1980. PDFCI also expects its shareholders to make an
additional capital contribution of Rp 0.5 billion in 1978 and Rp 0.75 billion
in 1979, thereby raising its paid-in capital to Rp 3.75 billion. The ratio
of total long-term debt (including the Government subordinated loan) to
equity shows an increase from 1.0:1 at mid-year 1976 to 6.8:1 at end-1980;
the ratio as defined under the IDA Credit Agreement (where the outstanding
portion of the Government subordinated loan of Rp 2.1 billion is treated as
equity) is expected to rise from 0.3:1 to 4.6:1 over the same period, exceed-
ing the contractual limit of 3.0:1 by 1979. It is recommended that the
existing limit of 3.0:1 be maintained for the time being, since it is not
expected to become a constraint on PDFCI's operations over the next two
years or so. The current ratio is expected to decrease from 7.5 at mid-
year 1976 to 1.9 by year-end 1978 and stabilize at around that level for the
remainder of the projection period, which would still be adequate.
Projected Financial Results
5.06      Projected income statements for 1976-80 are given in Annex 11,
Table 3.  Net income after tax is projected to increase from Rp 156 million
(estimated) in 1976 to Rp 616 million in 1980. Net profit as a percentage of
average equity, after declining from 7.2% for the first six months of 1976 to
5.4% for the year as a whole (because of higher administrative and personnel
expenses), will increase gradually to 12.2% in 1980, as a result of higher



- 19 -
leverage. Profit before tax and provisions as a percentage of average total
assets, will decrease from 8.2% as of mid-1976 to 3.6% in 1977 and thereafter
remain stable at around that level, thus reflecting the increase in the cost
of term resources employed which is expected to be particularly sharp in the
early years (up to and including 1977). Personnel and administrative expenses
as a percentage of average total assets, which are expected to peak in 1976 at
around 4.1% (on account of staff build-up) should decline gradually and reach
1.5% by 1980, a level comparable to that ultimately achieved by most DFCs
associated with the Bank. In the future, PDFCI's management will have to keep
tight control over the rise in administrative cost if the projected improvement
in PDFCI's profitability is to materialize. Failure to do this might adversely
affect efforts to raise additional share capital. PDFCI's projected cash flow
statements for the years 1976-1980 are given in Annex 11, Table 4. Debt
service cover is expected at or above 1.3 throughout the projection period,
which is adequate.
Development Strategy
5.07      At this early stage of its existence, it is important for PDFCI
to direct its efforts at building up its institutional strength and a financi-
ally sound portfolio as a base for subsequent enhancement of its developmental
impact. Nevertheless, reflecting its growing confidence in its ability to
achieve satisfactory institutional improvements, PDFCI has formulated a state-
ment of Development Strategy (Annex 12) outlining some near-term objectives on
which it intends to place greater emphasis in the 1977-78 period. This program
includes, inter alia, the following elements:
(a)  increased assistance to project sponsors in
improving the design and structure of their
proj ects;
(b)  efforts at identifying and developing selected
project ideas (using outside consultants where
necessary) to a point where they could be
implemented by potential sponsors;
(c)  financing of selected small industry projects,
and agro-industry, to achieve greater socio-
economic impact;
(d)  efforts at raising some resources from foreign
capital markets with the assistance of IFC
and the foreign shareholders; and
(e)  arranging syndication and joint financing with
both foreign and domestic financial institutions,
to help mobilize resources at the project level.

VI.  OBJECTIVES AND FEATURES OF PROPOSED LOAN
Objectives and Justification
6.01      Apart from replenishing PDFCI's foreign exchange resources, the
proposed Bank loan aims at (i) contributing to the sound development of
Indonesian industry by providing finance on suitable terms and (ii)contin-
uing the on-going process of strengthening PDFCI as an institution. It is
clear from some previous paragraphs (4.10 and 4.13) of this report that,
although PDFCI has by and large developed its basic institutional strength,
much remains to be done to transform it into an efficent and innovative
financial intermediary capable of making a significant qualitative contri-
bution to the Indonesian financial system (para 3.01 (b)) and to the devel-
opment of Indonesian industry, which was the basic object're underlying the
initial decision by the Government, with the Bank Group's cooperation, to
create PDFCI back in 1973. Continued Bank Group assistance is important to
enable PDFCI to achieve further improvements toward that objective.
6.02      The proposed loan is also justified on the basis of PDFCI's actual
performance to date, as opposed to the expectations mentioned in the pre-
ceding paragraph. As stated earlier, PDFCI's operational record has been
satisfactory (para 4.17). It has made worthwhile efforts towards selecting
meritorious projects for financing, and useful promotional inputs in shaping
these projects. As stated in para 4.15, the estimated economic rates of
return on PDFCI-financed projects range from 14% to 42%. Subprojects to be
financed under this loan are expected to yield similar economic results.
Finally, PDFCI enjoys a good reputation in the business community for the
integrity of its business methods. PDFCI is a suitable allocator of Bank
funds for industrial projects in Indonesia.
Features of Proposed Loan
6.03      Form of Bank Loan.  The loan would be made to the Government for
relending to PDFCI, under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank.
(The signing of this subsidiary loan agreement has been made a condition of
effectiveness for the proposed loan). The Government has insisted on this
form of lending, instead of a direct Bank loan to PDFCI with the Government's
guarantee, on account of the difficulties which the Government would encounter
if it were to guarantee a foreign loan to a private institution.
6.04      Utilization of Loan Proceeds.  As with the previous Credit, the
proceeds of the proposed loan would finance, apart from direct imports of
machinery and equipment, the foreign exchange component of domestically
procured capital goods estimated at 60% and of locally procured vehicles
and civil construction expenditures estimated at 40%. Additionally, the
loan would finance the cost of the foreign advisor (para 4.07).



- 21 -
6.05      Foreign Exchange Risk.  The Government has indicated that it wished
to on-lend the Bank loan to PDFCI in rupiahs, thereby itself assuming the
foreign exchange risk. This arrangement is similar to that under the first
Credit to PDFCI and previous Bank loans to BAPINDO for financing industrial
as well as shipping projects. The Government's unwillingness to require
Indonesian sub-borrowers (including PDFCI's) to bear the exchange risk has
been based on the consideration that the Indonesian rupiah has been and
remains a relatively stable currency, and that most domestic enterprises
(especially the indigenous ones) were not sophisticated enough to appreciate
the complexities of multiple currency exchange risks, whereas the better
established enterprises, mostly joint ventures and non-indigenous, could
borrow from the Singapore and Hong Kong markets at rates presently below
11% (with however the exchange risk borne by the borrowers).
6.06      Relending Rates.  PDFCI intends to relend the proceeds of the loan
at an interest rate of 15% p.a., as long as the latter remains the standard
rate for medium- and long-term credits charged by state banks and financial
institutions in Indonesia. The Bank would be consulted by PDFCI on any
changes in the proposed relending rate. As stated in para 2.05 of this report
and para 22 of Annex 1, the 15% rate would result in sub-borrowers paying an
adequate real rate in excess of 5% based on projections of future inflation
in Indonesia.
6.07      Spread Limitation.  The Government intends to on-lend to PDFCI the
proceeds of the loan (in rupiahs) at a rate of 11% p.a., thus giving PDFCI a
spread of 4 percentage points, which is adequate. The Government's own spread
of 2.5 percentage points (11% minus the Bank's lending rate) represents a
guarantee fee for its assuming the foreign exchange risk.
6.08      Free Limit.  As stated in para 4.10, in spite of the reduction in
the scope of technical assistance by foreign experts, PDFCI's appraisal
standards are expected to remain adequate. On grounds of appraisal standards,
a substantial increase in the existing free limit of $0.2 million (set under
the previous Credit) would not be warranted. On the other hand, the existing
$0.2 million free limit was unduly low and resulted up to December 31, 1976,
in 14 out of 15 subprojects submitted under the Credit requiring prior Bank
approval. It is therefore recommended that the free limit be increased to
$0.4 million, with an aggregate free limit of $4 million, under the proposed
loan. The increased free limit also takes into account the substantial rise
in equipment cost in the past two years. With this free limit, PDFCI's sub-
loans accounting for at least 70% (by amount) of the loan will still require
prior Bank approval. This should be sufficient for the purpose of effective
subproject monitoring by the Bank.
6.09      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the pro-
posed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially
to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the sub-loans made by PDFCI.
The maximum term for sub-loans would be 15 years including the grace period.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations for the proposed loan, agreement was reached
on the following matters:
(a)  maintenance of the debt/equity limit at 3:1 (para 5.05);
(b)  a free limit of $0.4 million with an aggregate free limit
of $4.0 million (para 6.08); and
(c)  PDFCI to consult the Bank prior to undertaking short-term
money market operations involving borrowings (para 4.01).
7.02      In addition to the above, the following matters were discussed,
and understanding reached:
(a)  employment by PDFCI of an expatriate advisor until June 30,
1979 (para 4.08);
(b)  the organization of PDFCI's project staff (para 4.13);
(c)  discontinuation of financing of "blocked accounts"
(para 4.20);
(d)  coverage of PDFCI's short-term investment portfolio in
future audit reports from 1976 onward (para 4.28);
(e)  PDFCI's plans for staff build-up in 1977-80 (para 5.02); and
(f)  PDFCI's statement of Development Strategy (para 5.07).

INDONESIA
P.T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
Economic, Industrial and Financial Environment
A. The Indonesian Economy -/
1.        Background.  During the First Five-Year Development Plan
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974), the Government's efforts succeeded
in rehabilitating existing plant and infrastructure, thus setting the
economy back on a development course. Real gross domestic product (GDP)
grew at an average annual rate of more than 7 percent, with the highest
growth rates being recorded in the mining (particularly oil), manufactur-
ing and trade sectors. Gross domestic capital formation increased at an
average rate of around 25 percent in real terms, and rose as a proportion
of GDP from 9 percent in 1968 to 19 percent in 1973. Following the boom
in oil and other commodity exports in 1973-74, a mood of optimism prevailed
at policy-making levels. It was thought that earlier resource constraints
had eased sufficiently to allow a substantial increase in consumption and
investment expenditures. The Government intensified its efforts to pro-
mote economic development by stepping up budgetary expenditures in line with
the expected rise in oil revenue, and by raising the level of external
borrowing.  However, the slackening of export demand and the gradual realiza-
tion, in early 1975, of the magnitude of Pertamina's financial difficulties
have since then forced the Government to review and to revise its plans
particularly by the scaling down or deferment of many large-scale capital
intensive projects. Once again, capital resource scarcity has become the
major factor hampering the economic development of Indonesia, a country
whose long-term prospects remain otherwise promising.
2.        Recent Performance.  In 1974, real GDP grew by 7.5 percent compared
to 11.3 percent in 1973. The decline in the rate of GDP growth was pri-
marily due to the decrease in the production of major agricultural and
mineral exports and in their prices except in the case of petroleum,as a
result of the recession affecting Indonesia's principal trading partners.
Another factor was the lower growth rate of rice production. Preliminary
data suggest that these same factors continued to limit the rate of GDP
growth in 1975, but to a lesser extent in 1976. The main rice crop in 1975
was larger but the production of export commodities declined until the middle
of the year. The rate of increase in Government expenditures, though still
very large, moderated and credit for the non-Government sector rose less
rapidly than in the first part of 1974. International reserves which had
started to decline in the latter half of fiscal year 1974/75, further decreased
by US$480 million during the first six months of 1975/76, despite substantial
capital inflows. In that period, exports failed to increase while imports
were climbing at an annual rate of about 30 percent. Debt service
1/ For a detailed discussion please refer to the latest basic economic
report (No. 708-IND) dated April 15, 1975. An analysis of recent
developments is to be found in the Bank's economic memorandum dated
November 12, 1975. A recent study of public sector investment is pre-
sented in the report entitled "Public Sector Investment and Financial
Resources in Indonesia", No. 1187-IND, dated May 24, 1976.



ANNEX 1
Page z
payments on behalf of Pertamina were also very large (about US$1.0
billion). In the second half of 1975/76, there was no appreciable
change in export earnings, but imports and debt service payments
were lower and there was only a small reduction in capital inflows.
The net result, for the year as a whole, was a current account
deficit of US$991 million (compared to US$138 million in 1974/75)
and an overall balance of payments deficit of US$364 million which
left foreign exchange reserves standing at US$557 million as of March
31, 1976. Gross investment continued at high levels in 1975/76,
judging by the 100 percent increase in imports of capital goods,
primarily on account of some large industrial projects which had been
under preparation for some time; investment interest, however, was on
the decline (see paragraph 9). Prices continued to climb though at
a reduced rate, the Jakarta consumer price index rising at an
average annual rate of 19 percent in 1975 (compared to 40 percent in
1974). The main reason for this inflation was the continued rapid
expansion of bank credits to finance public investments. Total liquidity
increased by close to 40 percent in 1975 with about half of all credits
going to the public sector thus forcing some credit squeeze on the
private sector. With the Government's intention to limit credit expansion
in the 1976/77 fiscal year to about 22 percent the rate of inflation is
expected to further decline.
3.       Future Directions and Prospects for Growth.  Despite Indonesia's
recent financial difficulties, the Government remains committed to its
objective of improving living standards and creating new employment
opportunities. As stated in the Second Five-Year Development Plan
(April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979), the aim is to achieve a long-term
annual growth rate of 7.5 percent coupled with an annual rate of employ-
ment creation of 2.3 percent. Priority is being given to achieving self-
sufficiency in food production; increasing industrial production; and
further expanding both physical and social infrastructure. With present
and projected resource constraints, the Government's task is a difficult
one. However, the attainment of a realgrowth rate in excess of 7 percent
remains feasible. Continued expansion of agricultural output with a
concomitant increase in real agricultural incomes, together with further
public and private investment should help sustain industrial output
expansion, particularly in labor-intensive industries serving both the
export and domestic markets. This is needed not so much as a source of
foreign exchange earnings or savings, but as a source of income and
employment for Indonesia's population. To ensure a stable climate for
continued growth, the Government is also determined to reduce the present
rate of inflation. Given its policy of curbing the expansion of total
liquidity to about 20 percent in 1977/78 and maintaining it at that level
thereafter, the rate of inflation is expected to subside to about 15 percent
per annum or less in 1977.
B. The Industrial Sector
4.       The Role of Industry.  Over the long-term, heavy reliance is being
placed on industrial expansion in achieving income and employment growth
targets. In view of the failure of the industrial sector, over the past
decade, to provide employment opportunities commensurate with levels of



ANNEX 1
Page 3
investment, the Government is gradually moving away from its past policy
of promoting large capital intensive projects and is encouraging instead
the development of small- and medium-scale industries using more labor
intensive methods of production, which are also likely to strengthen
intra- and inter-industry linkages and contribute to a wider regional
distribution of investment.
5.        Recent Growth.  Industry (manufacturing, mining and construction)
represents the third largest sector in the Indonesian economy (after
agriculture and services), accounting for 27 percent of gross domestic
product in 1974 and providing employment for around 8 percent of the
total labor force. The industrial sector has assumed increasing impor-
tance in recent years, with value added growing at an average rate of
about 17 percent per annum between 1971 and 1974. Much of this growth,
however, was caused by the rapid expansion of construction (26 percent)
and mining (16 percent). During 1974 and 1975, the growth of the indus-
trial sector was adversely affected by international developments.
Faced with higher production costs and sluggish demand, some sectors
serving the domestic market experienced low levels of capacity utilization.
This was notablv the case of the textile industry which in addition had to
compete with imports. Export-oriented sectors such as mining and forestry
suffered from the recession in the industrialized nations. Overall, the
industrial sector's growth slowed down to an annual rate of 11 percent in
1974; in real terms, mining output expanded by 3 percent, manufacturing
by 16 percent and construction by 22 percent. More recently, the industrial
sector has shown signs of recovery. Demand for oil and timber products has
strengthened in export markets, and textile production is on the rise.
6.        Structure.  Inadequate statistics permit only a broad analysis of
the structure and composition of the manufacturing sector, which in 1974,
accounted for close to 40 percent of all industrial activity and contri-
buted 10.5 percent of GDP. The latest surveys are out of date and can
therefore provide only orders of magnitude and structural relationships.
According to these surveys, four industry groups accounted for about
75 percent of manufacturing value added; these were food processing, to-
bacco manufacture, rubber products (mostly crumb rubber and sheets) and
textiles. These industries were also predominant in terms of employment
(85 percent) and number of establishments (75 percent). In recent years,
a number of new industries have been established in such fields as industrial
chemicals, steel products as well as motor vehicle, radio and television sets
assembly. Their contribution to employment creation, however, has been
small. In terms of size distribution, very small-scale enterprises 1/ re-
present an overwhelming majority (97 percent); in 1972, they accounted for
64 percent of industrial employment and 17 percent of manufacturing value
added, which suggests a very low productivity. Even within the group of
establishments in the medium and large scale category, firms with up
to 100 employees accounted for 90 percent of the number of establish-
ments, employed around 32 percent of the labor force and contributed 18
percent to gross value added.   Geographically, manufacturing
1/ Small scale enterprises are officially defined as those employing 10
workers or less without power equipment, or 5 workers or less with
power equipment.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
activity is concentrated on Java, which has 78 percent of existing medium-
and large-scale firms, and 86 percent of total manufacturing employment.
It is also on Java that the largest scale of production is to be found,
with an average of 53 workers per plant. The Jakarta metropolitan area
accounts for 11 percent of the number of enterprises located, and 7 percent
of manufacturing employment in Java. Other large Javanese cities (notably
Surabaya, Semarang and Bandung) are also important industrial centers.
7.       Industrialization Strategy.  Indonesian manufacturing is geared
mainly to production for the domestic consumer market. This is attributable
to an industrialization strategy which has placed heavy emphasis on import
substitution, resulting in a domestic market highly protected by both
direct import controls and high tariffs. The combination of a completely
convertible domestic currency pegged at a fixed exchange rate to the US
dollar since 1971, and of a high rate of inflation which caused long-term
interest rates to be negative in real terms, might also have induced
manufacturing investment to be more capital intensive than otherwise
necessary. The Government has shown a growing awareness of these problems
and is taking measures to shift the structure of production more toward
labor intensive manufacturing. This is reflected in its present industria-
lization strategy which appears essentially three pronged. First, investments
now well underway in large projects are to be completed. These extend
downstream processing of industrial exports (e.g. mineral ore smelters,
liquified natural gas plants) or encourage domestic production of inter-
mediate goods (steel, cement, fertilizer, pulp and paper). Second, medium-
large projects are to be promoted, especially those aimed at developing the
non-traditional export base and allowing for more integration in existing
industries. Third, increasing emphasis is to be placed on fostering the
growth of small industries which will address the objective of employment
generation, regional dispersal of investment and production closer to raw
material sources and markets. Once the heavy demand which the first group of
projects is placing on available financial resources has been satisfied,
projects in the small- and medium-industrial category will have a better
chance to materialize. At present, their development is seriously impaired
by existing credit restrictions.
8.       Policies and Incentives.  The Indonesian Government's policies on
industrial investment are partly reflected in the incentives it provides
under the Domestic and Foreign Capital Investment Laws which are adminis-
tered by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB). These incentives usually
apply equally to domestic and foreign companies but are not automatically
granted as a package. They vary according to priority ranking of
industry and the economic impact of the project, measured by employment
creation, foreign exchange earnings, training of domestic skilled workers,
degree of pribumi 1/ management, regional location, etc. The main elements
of the incentive system include tax privileges, reduction or exemption from
import levies, depreciation allowances and other important rights and
guarantees relating to management control, transfer of profits and com-
pensation in the event of nationalization. Other means of control at the
1/ Ethnic Indonesian.



Page 5
Government's disposal are the use of protection policies, applied both
through the tariff system and the imposition of direct import controls,
and, to a lesser extent, the interest rate policy. These policies were
originally designed to promote investment which would, over the long-term,
yield the greatest returns to the economy and ensure sound resource alloca-
tion.  Whether they have succeeded in doing so is difficult to determine.
In certain cases (e.g. motor car assembly), these policies have resulted
in the country's incurring higher foreign exchange costs. It is also
alleged that ICB incentives serve to do little apart from partially
countering the distortions introduced by tariffs and import controls; and
that the very nature of the incentive system seems to promote capital in-
tensiveness and, as a corollary, low capacity utilization. While this is
true to a point, any recommendations on the subject must await the findings
of a Bank industrial sector review mission which visited Indonesia in
December 1976.
9.        Manufacturing Investment.  Information on the level and direction
of investment in manufacturing is lacking. Available data pertain only
to investments approved by the ICB, which do not include the large public
sector industrial investments presently underway. On this basis, it appears
that manufacturing investment activity slackened in 1974 and has further
declined since then. In 1975, the ICB approved 43 foreign investment
projects involving a total planned capital outlay of US$1.0 billion. Of
this amount, 85 percent was accounted for by one large project, the Asahan
aluminum plant (with a cost of US$870 million), a joint undertaking between
foreign private investors and the Government. If one excludes this project,
the value of foreign investment approved in 1975 was substantially below
its 1974 level of US$1.1 billion. This represents a continuation of the
declining trend exhibited by foreign investment applications since late
1973, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and is no doubt largely but
not entirely due to the recessionary conditions in capital exporting countries
which adversely affected private industrialists' investment interest. Per-
tamina's financial difficulties might also have influenced prospective in-
vestors. On the domestic side, investors had reacted earlier to changed
economic conditions. The sharp decline took place in 1974 when approvals
of private domestic investment projects fell to Rp 230 billion for 259
projects compared to Rp 569 billion for 550 projects in 1973. In 1975,
domestic investors maintained a cautious wait-and-see attitude. Total
approvals stagnated at Rp 236 billion for 168 projects. While most of the
factors presently discouraging private investment are expected to be of
a short-term nature and do not reflect any changes in the long-term
opportunities offered in Indonesia, others such as the stricter enforce-
ment of the pribuminization regulations 1/, as well as administrative
and bureaucratic obstacles may depress the private investment climate on
a longer term basis.
1/ Pribumi enterprises are defined as those with at least 20% pribumi
(ethnic Indonesian) ownership and with predominantly pribumi management
or 75% ownership if management is non-pribumi.

C. The Financial Sector
10.      Overview,  In terms of structure, diversity of institutions,
financial services offered and the variety of financial instruments
available for mobilizing savings, the financial system in Indoensia
is still in its eariy stages of development. The core of the system
is a large commercial banking sector dominated by five State banks and
regulated by the Central Bank, Bank Indonesia (BI). There are in
addition a variety of specialized financial institutions e.g. term-
financing institutions, merchant banks, and savings institutions, some
of which have only recently been established. Overall, the financial
system remains essentially geared to serving short-term financing needs.
This is the consequence of a regulatory environment governing credit
markets and interest rates which simply does not make it profitable for
private institutions to mobilize long-term funds to finance long-term
investments. Only Government institutions can do so, thanks to the
special facilities provided to them by the Central Bank. As a result
these institutions have grown rapidly (but unprofitably) in a fairly
unorganized fashion.
11.      Over the last few years, the Government has attempted to remedy
some of the shortcomings affecting the financial sector. With Bank Group
assistance, BAPINDO, the State-owned development bank, was reorganized
with a view to making it the predominant source of medium- and long-term
finance for industry. A program to upgrade the five State commercial
banks was initiated and is still underway. In 1972, the Indonesian
Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) was reorganized as a joint venture
between the Government (through Bank Indonesia) and the Netherlands Overseas
Finance Corporation, in which the Dutch Government has a majority interest.
In 1973, again with Bank Group assistance, the Government was instrumental
in establishing a third largely privately-owned development bank, P.T.
Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). A specialized
institution, P.T. Bahana, was also set up the same year to provide equity
financing and managerial assistance to financially weak enterprises. Since
the passage, in 1973, of a law governing the establishment and operations
of non-bank financial intermediaries, 11 merchant banks have been set up
as joint ventures between foreign and local banks. Their operations are
still concentrated in short-term commercial paper, but are expected to
include in the ruture long-term securities and equity investments, thus
paving the way to the establishment of an active capital market. Finally,
to help meet the need for long-term funds, the Government has instituted
two investment credit schemes, the Medium-Term Investment Credit (INVESTASI)
and the Small Investment Credit (KIK and KMKP) programs, which are adminis-
tered by the Central Bank and handled by the State banks.
12.      Indones-a's financial sector consists of Bank Indonesia, five
large Siate cLmercial banks, four national development banks (BAPINDO, PDFCI,
IDFC and P.T. Blhana), 26 regional development banks (RDBs), 11 branches of
foreign banks, 97 small private domestic commercial banks, and about 5,000
savings and small village and rural banks. There are also 11 merchant banks
and a dormant Stock Exchange.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
13.      Short-Term Credit.  Short-term credit is extended by banks for
periods of up to one year; most loans are for three to six months duration
and can be renewed depending upon the bank/borrower relationship. The
commercial paper market started operating only recently following the
establishment of the merchant banks.
14.      Medium- and Long-Term Credit.  Term credit is available from
most banks, though foreign banks must obtain Bank Indonesia's approval
to make loans for more than one year. However, with the exception of
the INVESTASI program and loans from development banks, maturities are
usually limited to three years with possible rollover.  The main source
of term finance remains the INVESTASI program which was introduced by the
Government in 1969.  Under this program, term loans are available for
almost all sectors from State banks and RDBs, with Bank Indonesia re-
financing 65 to 80 percent of the loan amounts. Since the inception of
this program, most loans have gone to the private sector which accounted
for about 70 percent of cumulative loan approvals totalling Rp 224 billion
as of September 30, 1975. Of this amount, Rp 104 billion (or 46 percent)
had been approved for projects in the manufacturing sector, three fourths
of which had been disbursed. The INVESTASI program is limited by annual
budget appropriations. Loans under the program bear an interest rate
ranging from 12 to 15 percent per annum and carry maturities of between
one and five years. Their interest rate is therefore subsidized as the
rate on two-year time deposits is 24 percent per annum.
15.      Four national development banks specialize in extending term
financing to industry. BAPINDO is by far the most important and is the only
State bank allowed to grant term loans with maturities of over five years.
By year-end 1975, BAPINDO's term loans outstanding amounted to about 28
percent of all outstanding term loans under the INVESTASI program, and had
increased almost three-fold since 1972. BAPINDO finances industrial projects
of every size (large, medium and small) in both the public and private sectors.
The Indonesian-Dutch joint venture development bank, IDFC, extends term
loans, participates in equity financing and provides a limited amount of
technical assistance to its clients. So far, it has disbursed about US$12
million for 27 projects in such sectors as food processing, textiles,
printing, tourism, shipping and farming. Because of its limited financial
resources, as well as on grounds of corporate policy, IDFC concentrates on
financing relatively small projects. The average size of its loans to
date is Rp 165 million (US$400,000). In 1973, the Government and the Bank
Group cooperated in setting up PDFCI, in which IFC organized the participation
of eight foreign banks (32 percent), taking up itself 8 percent of the share
capital. PDFCI is empowered to make medium- and long-term loans, invest
in equity, provide guarantees, underwrite corporate equity and debt securities
and provide technical, financial and managerial consultancy services. One
of its most important objectives is the identification of new projects and
the promotion of new enterprises. From 1974, when it started operations,
to June 7, 1976, PDFCI approved a total financing of around US$12 million,
of which US$800,000 represented equity investments, for 12 industrial projects.
The fourth development bank, P.T. Bahana, was established by the Government
in 1973 with the main objective of providing equity financing (up to 12.5
percent of the share capital of its clients) particularly to enterprises
with a weak capital structure. All four development banks can enter into
co-financing agreements but there have been few so far.



ANNEX 1

16.      Financing of Small Scale Industries.  Since December 1973, two credit
schemes are available to small entrepreneurs: the Kredit Investasi Kecil
(KIK) for the financing of fixed investment, and the Kredit Modal Kerja
Penanaman (KMKP) for working capital financing. Both schemes are handled
by State banks and selected RDBs, with the Central Bank refinancing 70
to 80 percent of the loan amounts disbursed. All productive activities
(in industry, agriculture, trade and services) are eligible for KIK and
KMKP financing. A limit, however, has been placed on the maximum loan
amount which may be approved for any single project. This limit is
presently Rp 5 million (US$12,000 equivalent) under both KIK and KMKP.
Maturities range from 1 to 5 years including a grace period of up to two
years, and interest rates applied to sub-borrowers are 12 percent for KIK
and 15 percent for KMKP loans. Unlike the INVESTASI program, loans under KIK
and KMKP do not carry any minimum self-financing requirement. Similarly,the
program regulations specify that the main collateral under KIK is the project
to be financed and, should this value be considered insufficient, additional
collateral should not exceed 100 percent of the credit being sought. As
of February 29, 1976, over 60,000 loans had been approved under both schemes
for an amount exceeding Rp 65 billion (US$150 million), of which Rp 46
billion had been disbursed.  Overall, both schemes have worked reasonably
well, and have provided a large number of small entrepreneurs with much
needed long-term funds. Difficulties experienced so far include the un-
familiarity of State commercial banks with term-financing operations (e.g.
collateral requirements exceed too often the program's guidelines), lengthy
loan processing periods, and the low level of the loan ceilings which dis-
qualifies a number of otherwise suitable projects.
17.      In 1972, the Government established P.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia
(ASKRINDO) to insure bank loans made to small businesses for up to 75
percent of the total risk. This automatic insurance was to induce State
banks to pursue more vigorously their term lending to small scale enter-
prises. Automatic insurance, of course, has its inherent drawbacks but
so far there are no signs that State banks have taken undue advantage of
this facility. To date, P.T. ASKRINDO's experience has been satisfactory
and few defaults have occurred. However, the KIK and KMKP programs are
still fairly new and it is too early to assess their record.
18.      As mentioned earlier, P.T. Bahana was set up to provide equity and
technical assistance to financially weak enterprises; it also engages in
lending operations to a limited extent. Since most small enterprises fall
into this category, P.T. Bahana's operations have focused on this sector
though there are actually no size limitations which confine its lending to
small scale industry. As is the case for most new institutions in Indonesia,
P.T. Bahana has found it difficult to attract experienced personnel, especially
in the field of management assistance to small scale industry; its lending
activity has therefore been limited.
19.      BAPINDO began a small industry financing program of its own in
1973, in collaboration with selected regional development banks. Under the
initial arrangement, BAPINDO would extend a line of credit to these banks
with the understanding that it would serve to finance 80 percent of the
amount approved for each individual sub-loan, the RDB financing the balance
out of its own resources. This system was modified in 1974, following the
introduction of the KIK and KMKP programs. Under both programs, the RDB's



ANNEX 1
Page 9
financing share is now fixed at 10 percent, with the amount non-refinanceable
with Bank Indonesia coming out of BAPINDO's own resources (i.e. 20 percent
and 10 percent for KMKP and KIK respectively). BAPINDO also provides
technical assistance to the RDBs in the form of organizational upgrading
programs and staff training. As of December 31, 1975, thirteen RDBs (out
of a total number of 26) had been selected by BAPINDO and had entered into
co-financing agreements. Cumulative approvals granted by these participat-
ing RDBs under both the KIK and KMKP programs amounted to Rp 3.4 billion
(US$8.2 million) for 1,947 projects, i.e. an average sub-loan size of
around Rp 1.75 million (US$4,200 equivalent).
20.      Interest Rates.  Interest rates applied by the State banks are
set by Bank Indonesia. Because of the importance of the State banks in
the financial system, they in turn determine the general level of interest
rates in the economy, though private banks are free to set their own rates.
At present, deposit rates range from 6% per annum for one month time deposits
with State banks and for demand deposits with private banks, to 21% for
18-month and 24% for 24-month time deposits. Rates on certificates of
deposit range from 7% (two weeks; private banks) to 13% (12 months; State
banks). Lending rates applied by State banks range from 12% for INVESTASI
loans below Rp 100 million and for special short-term agricultural credits,
to 24% for general loans. Lending rates charged by private banks are
slightly higher and, if the loans are financed from foreign exchange sources,
they usually carry a floating rate plus a fixed margin with the exchange risk
being assumed by the borrower.
21.      Compared with deposit rates, particularly those for 18- and 24-month
time deposits with State banks, term lending rates in Indonesia are low.
This interest rate structure does not unduly affect the State banks financially,
as (i) they receive direct interest rate subsidies from Bank Indonesia for
time deposits, and (ii) a substantial portion of their lending is refinanced
by Bank Indonesia at low rates (4% to 10%). This rate.structure, however,
does affect the profitability of private domestic banks and their ability
to compete with State banks for long-term deposits, since they are not
eligible for interest rate subsidies. The Government is reviewing the present
structure of interest rates and the Bank intends to join with the Government
in discussion of this matter in the near future.
22.      The convertibility of the rupiah also exerts some influence on the
domestic interest rate structure. Bank lending rates (other than those
applied by State banks) have remained relatively low in part because of the
proximity of the Singapore and Hong Kong financial markets which are willing
to lend, at least to the better established companies, at rates about 2 or
3 percentage points above the Asian dollar market rates. This in practice
gave an interest rate which over the past few years has been lower than the
15 percent rate applied by the State banks on their industrial loans (the
exchange risk, however, was borne by the borrower). In general, Indonesian
companies have been willing to accept the foreign exchange risk either because
this was the only way to obtain funds directly, or because the risk was



ANNEX 1
Page 10
perceived as not being too great in light of the stability of the rupiah.
In previous borrowings from the World Bank for BAPINDO and PDFCI, the
Government has insisted on assuming the foreign exchange risk on the grounds
that the Indonesian rupiah was a relatively stable currency and because
most domestic enterprises were not sophisticated enough to appreciate the
complexities of multiple exchange rates. The free convertibility of the
rupiah was also one of the reasons why the Government did not raise term
lending rates during the recent period of very high inflation since it was
feared that this would hurt the smaller and financially weaker enterprises
(mainly indigenous) which are unable to obtain foreign exchange loans on
their own, while larger and stronger companies (usually non-indigenous
joint ventures) would still be able to borrow from financial markets abroad.
As stated in paragraph 2, the rate of inflation, which stood at 40 percent
in 1974, declined to 19 percent in 1975. With the Government's policy of
curbing the expansion of total liquidity to about 20 percent in 1977/78,
the inflation rate is projected to further subside to about 15 percent in
1977, and average around 10 percent over the 1977-1980 period. If this
materializes, the 15 percent standard rate for medium and long-term credits
(Annex 1A) would represent a substantially positive real rate of around
5-7 percent.

INDONESIA
P.T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CONPANY OF INDONESIA
Otatement of Financial and Operational Policies
The objective of this Statey:ent is to set out in broad outline the
financial and operational policies of P.T. Private Development Finance
Company of Indonesia (PDFCI).
PDFCI, whose objective is to promote the expansion of private
enterprise in the Republic of Indonesia, through financial, technical
and managerial assistance, will be guided by the policies set forth below:
I.      The Scope of Activities
1.      PDFCI will finance only productive enterprises.  While
its primary activity will be in the field of manufacturing and
processing industry, it may also finance other types of enterprises,
including those engaged in transport and communications, tourism,
large-scale commercially oriented agriculture (including fisheries
and livestock), mining, and construction. It may also finance real
estate to the extent that it contributes to the development of the
above sectors. Trade and small-scale agriculture will be excluded
from its scope of activities.
2.      PDFCI will not finance enterprises in which the Government
or an agency of the Government owns more than 49% of the share
capital or whose management and control is in the hands of the
Government or an agency of the Government.
3.      PDFCI will finance both new enterprises, and the expansion
or modernisation of existing enterprises.
4.      In its operations, PDFCI will give due regard to the
general economic plans, policies and priorities of the Government
of Indonesia.
5.      Enterprises which can be expected to have access to foreign
or international sources of finance, like branches or wholly owned
subsidiaries of foreign firms, would not normally be financed
by PDFCI.
6.      PDFCI will provide financing to private enterprises in
all appropriate ways, but more especially as follows:
a. medium and long-term loans;
b. equity participation (through underwriting, con-
version rights, direct participation in share
capital or otherwise);



A,iw"X 2
Page 2
c. guarantees of payment for machinery and equipment
imported or otherwise, in specially justifiable cases;
d. guaranteeing and underwriting of corporate debt
securities;
e. technical and managerial consultancy services,
and financial services including syndication;
f. identification and promotion of new enterprises.
7.      Recognizing that refinancing with long-term resources of
existing loans to enterprises is a need in the Indonesian environ-
ment, PDFCI may extend such facilities in selected cases, provided
that the volume of such operations shall not at any time exceed
20% of its total portfolio.
8.      PDFCI's financial assistance will primarily be for expendi-
tures for fixed assets. PDFCI may finance permanent working
capital requirements in appropriate cases, whether or not in
conjunction with financing of fixed assets.
9.      It will be one of PDFCI's important aims to investigate
and identify investment opportunities, and to promote and assist
the establishment of enterprises of importance to the Indonesian
economy.
II.      Basis for Investment Decisions
10.     PDFCI will make its financing decisions only on the basis
of sound investment criteria and standards based on its own
analysis of the economic and technical feasibility and financial
soundness of projects, and with due regard to the profitability
of the enterprise, and the competence of its management.
III.      Diversification of Portfolio
11.     In order to reduce the concentration of risks, PDFCI will
diversify its portfolio geographically, by sectors of operation,
and by size of investment.
12.    PDFCI will normally be guided by the following limits in
regard to the maximum commitment it will make, in whatever form:
a.  in a single-project                         15%
b. in a single enterprise or a group of
associated enterprises                      25%



9 2
Page 3
of the sum of its net worth and subordinated loans, which loans
in the event of liquidation, shall rank both after all other debt
of PDFCI and pari passu with equity. PDFCI's financing shall not
normally exceed half of the total cost of the enterprise excluding
that part of the cost which can be financed by short term working
capital loans.
13.     PDFCI will not normally commit to any single enterprise
in the form of equity capital more than 10% of its own net worth.
The aggregate equity investments of PDFCI at any time shall not
exceed the total of its net worth.
14.     In financing projects requiring more than its maximum
lending limits under Clauses 12 and 13, PDFCI will seek the
cooperation of other financial institutions, bot'. domestic and
foreign, through such methods as syndication and joint financing.
IV.      Turnover of Portfolio
15.     PDFCI will seek through its operations to broaden the
ownership of private securities in Indonesia, and with this pur-
pose in view it will seek to revolve its portfolio, whenever it
can do so on satisfactory terms. In selling an investment it will
pay due regard not only to its own interests, but also to the
interests of other participants in such investment, and to the
interests of the concern whose securities are involved.
V.      Relationship with Enterprises Financed
16.     Except in enterprises promoted by it, and in such cases
for temporary periods, PDFCI will not take a controlling interest
in any enterprise in which it has an equity investment, or any
other interest which would give it primary responsibility for
management. Nevertheless, in the case of jeopardy it may take
such action as may be necessary to protect its interest.
Accordingly, it will not normally take up more than 25% of the
share capital of an enterprise except as the result of an under-
writing commitment undertaken in the expectation that the invest-
ment would in fact be within the limit cited.
17.     In accordance with normal banking practice, PDFCI will
require its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security,
to keep records and accounts in accordance with sound generally
accepted accounting principles, and to furnish whatever information
on their operations and accounts it deems desirable. PDFCI will
take the right to inspect the enterprises it finances, as well as
their operations, records and books of accounts.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
18.     Business secrets and other similar information furnished
to PDFCI by applicants or clients will be treated as confidential.
VI.      Financial Guidelines
19.     PDCI will take adequate steps to protect itself against
the foreign exchange risks that it will run arising from the use
of foreign resources in its operations.
20.     PDFCI will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect
its business operations in accordance with sound and generally
accepted accounting principles and practices, and to provide
required management information.
21.    PDFCI will appoint qualified and independent public
accountants to audit its books for each fiscal year, and to express
their opinion on its annual financial statements, including
balance-sheets and statements of income and expense.
22.    PDFCI will limit its borrowings to three times the sum
of its net worth and subordinated loans, which loans in the event
of liquidation, shall rank both after all other debt of PDFCI and
pari passu with equity.
VII.      Profits and their Distribution
23.     PDFCI will seek to develop earnings sufficient to cover
expenses and taxes, to make provisions adequate to the size and
risks of its portfolio, to maintain the value of its equity, and
to pay satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on its
equity investments and will impose interest rates, fees and
charges for its loans and services which will permit it to do
the foregoing.
24.    PDFCI will follow a dividend distribution policy, on the
one hand providing for building and maintaining reserves consistent
with sound financial management practice, and on the other hand
facilitating the development of a broad market for its shares.
VIII.      Staff
25.     PDFCI will build up a technically-qualified staff capable
of carrying out efficiently the responsibilities which its
objectives demand. More especially, recognizing the need for
supporting its clients with advice and assistance in formulating

P. T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
PDFCI's Influence in Improving Project Design: a Selection of Cases
To illustrate the role that PDFCI plays in shaping the design of
projects submitted to it for financial assistance, this annex presents
a selection of cases in which PDFCI's suggested modifications were adopted.
1. P. T. Hadikusumo Soap and Detergent Project
A. The Original Project
P. T. Hadikusumo's original proposal called for the establishment
in one stage, of large-scale manufacturing facilities to produce low-cost
soap and detergents. Under this proposal, the company's total assets were
to increase threefold. Such an expansion would have marked a substantial
change in the nature of Hadikusumo's operations which had been limited to
the blending and bottling of cosmetic products.
B. PDFCI's Suggested Modification
PDFCI recommended that the size of the proposed expansion be reduced,
since this could be done without foregoing any benefits attached to economies
of scale. PDFCI also suggested that the company test the market for its new
products in some of the geographic areas in which it expected to distribute
them, as it was particularly important to have an idea, in advance, of the
level of competition to be expected from existing domestic producers such as
Unilever-Indonesia.
C. Reasons for Modification
PDFCI's impression of the company's management, past performance and
growth prospects was very favorable. The company had successfully extended
its market penetration to the smallest villages in Java, and was selling its
products to some 28,000 retailers. However, the capital investment required
to produce soap and detergents was considerably higher than what had been
needed for the existing blending and bottling operation. In addition, the
competition from existing domestic producers was expected to be severe; these
competitors were privately-owned companies with strong financial backing.
The scaling down and phasing of Hadikusumo's expansion project was therefore
aimed both at protecting the existing assets of the family-owned company and
reducing the risk for the financing institutions to an acceptable level.

2. P. T. Melania Tea Estate Project
A. The Original Project
The original project envisaged a slow expansion in planted area of
the company's tea estate in Cibuni, near Bandung, as well as the construction
of a new tea processing factory. The implementation of the project would
have taken five years.
B. PDFCI's Suggested Modification
PDFCI suggested that, for the first three years, the company focus
its activities on the expansion of the planted area, thereby using its avail-
able resources in a manner which would most rapidly lead to additional output
and profitability. PDFCI also recommended that the construction of the
factory be postponed until the yield from the new plantings became available,
and that, in the meantime, only the necessary repairs be made to the existing
factory. With respect to the project's financing plan, PDFCI suggested that
P. T. Melania, which operates several other estates (coffee, cocoa, cloves
and rubber) in other parts of Indonesia, divest itself of one or more of
its less profitable estates so as to concentrate its financial resources on
the expansion of the Cibuni tea estate, the most attractive among the company's
several properties.
C. Reasons for Modification
PDFCI's market analysis showed that the company's tea enjoyed a high
reputation for quality, thus allowing it to be sold at a premium. Since the
new plantings would be located in the same area as the existing ones and would
be based on clones that had been successfully tested elsewhere, the prospects
of the additional output being marketable at good prices seemed excellent. It
also appeared likely that Melania would face no difficulty in exporting this
output as Indonesia had been unable, up to then, to meet its annual export
quota under the international tea agreement, having fallen short by more than a
thousand tons per year in the past. In addition, the fact that local tea
prices, while fluctuating, were usually at about the same level as export
prices, suggested that a profitable outlet was available, should it not prove
possible to sell all the additional tea abroad. This explains PDFCI's suggestion
to accelerate the expansion of the cultivated area.
The recommendation to postpone the construction of the new factory was
based solely on financial considerations. The company had been expropriated
in 1965 and returned to its original owners in a dilapidated state three years
later. The rehabilitation was only financed out of internal cash generation;
no fresh outside capital was brought in by the owners, all of whom reside
abroad. The company's borrowing capacity, and therefore its ability to carry
out major projects on more than one front, thus remained limited, which suggested
that all available resources be concentrated on one activity. Finally, PDFCI's
recommendation that the company divest itself of one or several of its other
estates stemmed from the drain on managerial and financial resources resulting
from what was, under the circumstances, a state of excessive diversification.

3. P. T. Sukuntex i-dxtile Finishing Mill
A. The Original Project
The proposal to establish a finishing mill that would permit a
forward integration of Sukuntex's existing textile weaving operations,
was first presented to PDFCI in the form of a feasibility study prepared
by consultants. This study was not considered by PDFCI as being fully
satisfactory. The original financing plan, for instance, called for 100
percent debt financing of the project.
B. PDFCI's Suggested Modification
PDFCI first offered Sukuntex to make available staff time to be
spent on jointly upgrading and improving the feasibility study. PDFCI
further suggested that the financing plan be revised to include equity
financing by the sponsors.
C. Reasons for Modification
The company is part of a successful group of family owned enterprises
established near Kudus, Central Java. This group of companies is the only
industrial employer in the region, directly employing about 10,000 people
in the manufacture of clove cigarettes and textile products. PDFCI believed
that the project which had been badly conceived and presented, could be
reshaped to a point where it would become technically, financially and
economically viable. Because the project sponsors had already invested
considerable time and money in having consultants prepare several successive
versions of the feasibility study, all of which had been considered un-
acceptable by the company's commercial bankers, PDFCI felt that it would be
more appropriate to make its own project staff available to assist the
sponsors in revising the feasibility study. However, PDFCI made it clear
at the time that such assistance should not be interpreted as a commitment
to finance the project. This project was eventually approved by PDFCI's
Board in November 1975.
4. P. T. Bena Kutai Hotel Project
A. The Original Project
The original proposal called for the construction of a 216 room
hotel for a total cost of US$7.5 million to be financed through consortium
loan financing for US$5.25 million and equity financing for US$2.25 million.
The proposed terms for the loan accommodation were a six-year repayment period
including a two-year grace period at 3 percent over SIBOR interest rate.-/
The debt to equity ratio stood at 70/30.

ANNEX 8
Page 4
B. PDFCI's Suggested Modification
The project cost estimate was revised to US$8.0 million to include
interest expenses during construction amounting to US$0.5 million. The
company's gearing was lowered to 50/50, by raising the sponsors' equity
contribution to US$4.0 million; US$2.5 million were to be provided by the
consortium loan and US$1.5 million by PDFCI. The consortium of creditors
led by the Chartered Bank of Singapore offered a six-year repayment period
at 3 percent over the 6 months SIBOR rate, and PDFCI, an eight-year period
at 18 percent fixed interest rate p.a., payable in cash at 15 percent p.a.
during project construction and the first two years of operations, with the
remaining 3 percent to be added to the principal amount due.
C. Reaons for Modification
The higher equity contribution was needed to establish the project
on a sound financial footing; it would increase internal cash generation
and provide a large enough cushion to absorb any possible losses thereby
safeguarding the interests of the long-term creditors. More conservative
and realistic financial projections had also revealed that the company?s
cash flow was too strained if it were to service all its long-term debt
within the proposed six years. This explains why PDFCI offered the company
a term of eight years and provided flexibility in the payment of interest,
be it at a higher rate.
5. P. T. Pulau Weh Rattan
A. The Original Project
The company's proposal was to manufacture rattan products for export.
The estimated project cost was Rp 240 million. The sponsor was a government-
owned company (P. T. Penbinaan Pulau Weh) which was to own all the equity of
the project.
B. PDFCI's Suggested Modification
PDFCI suggested that private parties be brought in to share the project's
equity in the proportion of 51 to 49 with Pembinaan Pulau Weh; this was accepted
by the sponsors. A more detailed survey of raw material availability and the
employment of suitably qualified personnel with considerable experience of
both the domestic and international markets were also suggested and accepted.
With respect to this last matter, PDFCI assisted the company in obtaining
the required expertise from the International Executive Service Corporation
(IESC).
C. Reasons for Modification
A change in the composition of ownership was required for the project
to meet PDFCI's criteria on financing eligibility, A raw material survey and
the employment of marketing experts were considered necessary to ensure the
success of the project.

ANNEX 11
Attachment 1
INDONESIA
P.T. PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY OF INDONESIA
Major Assumptions Underlying PDFCI's Operational and Financial Projections
A.  Operational Projections
Short-term Investment Operations:
Except for income earned on short-term investments of surplus
funds, the projections do not take into account, proposed
additional short-term lending activities nor funding thereof.
The implicit conservative assumption is that should such
operations be undertaken, they would break even.
Term-loan and Equity Investment Operations:
(i) Approvals. The expected level of project approvals,
net of cancellations, is due to increase as follows:
1976   1977   1978   1979   1980
Number of projects approved   12       16     20      27     32
These approval rates are based on the projected build-up
in professional staff (Annex 5A) and an assumed 25 percent
increase in productivity per staff member (Attachment 2).
The actual number of appraisals completed per year is
expected to be 25 percent higher than the number of projects
approved.
The average amount approved per project, beginning
in mid-1976, is expected to be Rp 415 million, Rp 385 million
of which as loan financing and Rp 30 million as equity, with
all figures increasing at the rate of 10 percent p.a. over the
projection period, to reflect expected inflation in project
costs.
Loan amounts approved are expected to be financed
for two-thirds out of PDFCI's foreign currency resources (to
cover both the direct and indirect foreign exchange cost of
projects) and for one-third out of domestic currency resources.
Equity investments are to be funded out of PDFCI's own resources.
Average loan maturity: 7 years including a 2-year
grace period.



ANNEX 11
Attachment 1, Page 2
(ii) Commitments. Assuming an average four-month lag between
approvals and commitments, it is expected that 66 percent
of approvals will be committed the same year and 34 percent
the following year.
(iii) Disbursements. One-third of approvals in any given year are
expected to be disbursed in that year, and two-thirds in the
following year.
B. Financial Projections - Income Statements
Interest on Loans:
15.5 percent for all outstanding loans".  Income on loans
is computed on the average loan portfolio outstanding during
each period.
Commitment and Supervision Fees:
Income from supervision and commitment charges to average in
total about 1% of each approved amount in year of approval,
and 0.5% in the following year.
Dividend Income:
Income in the form of cash dividends from equity investments
made to date have been projected on the basis of the latest
financial forecasts available for each project. For future
equity investments, the following assumptions have been made:
Year following          Dividend as %
investmeEt            of investment
2
3                      10
4                      20
During the projection period, no equity investments are ex-
pected to be sold (nor capital gains realized), and no options
to purchase shares exercised.
Income from Short-Term Investments:
Surplus cash is expected to be invested in marketable securities
and other short-term investments yielding an average 14% p.a.
1/ This figure is related to the cost of PDFCI's long-term debt resources.
In effect PDFCI has assumed that it will receive the 4% maximum spread
allowed under the IDA Credit Agreement.



ANNEX 11
Attachment 1, Page 3

Statement of Development Strategy for 1977-1978
During 1977-78 PDFCI will complete its organizational phase and
establish itself as a term financing institution operating on scund and
innovative development banking principles. It shall aim not only to
increase its investments quantitatively but would introduce to and
establish in the Indonesian environment thorough financial, technical
and economic analysis as the accepted methodology for evaluation and
selection of projects. PDFCI plans to undertake the following activities:
I. ProJect Selection and Resource Allocation
(1) PDFCI will actively assist project sponsors in the development
of their projects and, in the absence of a sponsor, will identify and
develop project ideas to a point where they could be implemented by
potential sponsors. In performing this function PDFCI will use con-
sultants, where necessary and will budget suitable amaunts for payment
of consultants' fees. In the Indonesian environment which is short of
technical and entrepreneurial skills this would constitute a useful
activity.  In the same context PIFCI will :
a) assist project sponsors to redesign and restructure
their projects to improve their viability and potential
benefits; and
b) help in restructuring enterprises with good prospects
but weak financial base and, where necessary, use outside
consultants for the purpose.
(2)  In selecting projects for financing, PDFCI will, consistent
with the principle of project viability, lay stress on :
a) medium and smal sized industries with a view of broadening
the base of industrial ownership and producing the maximum
socio-economic impact;
b) efficient existing projects, particularly smaller projects
with a small equity base, seeking to expand their business.
(3) FDFCI will place emphasis on the development of new entrepreneur-
ship. To that end, it intends to :
a) contribute directly to the equity of new indigenous enter-
prises where feasible and assist them in finding other
sources of equity capital; and



ANNEX 12
Page 2
b) assist indigenous entrepreneurs in participating in the
share capital of enterprises sponsored by non-indigenous
groups and, where feasible, itself take a direct equity
position in such enterprises with the intention of
subsequently divesting these shares, at a profit, to
indigenous shareholders.
(4) PDFCI will endeavour to spread its activities and financing on a
geographical basis.
(5) While giving a full range of assistance to the manufacturing
industry, PDFCI will place increasing emphasis on assisting agro-industry,
particularly of the plantation-type.
(6) PDFCI will after due research and subject to feasibility under-
take short term money market operations and build up for the purpose a
specialized department possessed of appropriate expertise and staff. The
short term operations will enable PDFCI to diversify its business, increase
its profits and develop potential long-term borrowers amongst its short-
term clients. These operations will, however, not be allowed to alter
PDFCI's basic character as a term-financing institution.
II. Resource Mobilization
As a new institution, which has yet to build up its financial strength
PDFCI has limited capability for mobilizing funds from the market. The
expensive borrowing rates in Indonesia make it unfeasible for PDFCI to rely
on the domestic financial market for resources. While relying, therefore,
on traditional sources of finance such as the World Bank and other inter-
national and multilateral financing agencies, PDFCI will endeavour to :
(1) obtain suppliers' and other credits for its customers by
guaranteeing such credits;
(2) obtain loans from foreign financial markets with the assistance
of its foreign shareholders, particularly IFC;
(3) obtain short term loans, from foreign shareholders and other
foreign financial institutions to finance its money market operations;
(4) raise domestic currencies resources (i) from insurance com-
panies and pension funds; and (ii) under specialized schemes of the
Central Bank; and
(5) help mobilize resources at the project level by arranging syndi-
cation and joint financing both with foreign and domestic financial insti-
tutions, particularly RAPINDO, IDFC and P.T. RAHANA.

III. Organization
PDFCI is still in the process of building up its professional staff
but it is expected that by 1978 the staff will reach its full strength.
The training of staff will remain a continuing activity and training
facilities will be sought, as hitherto from EDI, Asian Development Bank
and other international and foreign agencies. Endeavour will be made to
seek the assistance of local institutions for designing and imparting
special training courses for PDFCI professional staff,
