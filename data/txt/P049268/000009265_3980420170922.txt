Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project would reduce poverty by providing temporary income support to poor, unemployed workers hired in the
TRABAJAR public works program. The project builds on the experience of the first Social Protection Project, which
safeguarded critical social programs during 1995-96 and provided income support to the poor unemployed, including
through the first phase of TRABAJAR. The first Social Protection project also supports improvements in the
management and effectiveness of social programs (including TRABAJAR) through work on poverty analysis and
program evaluation and finances a pilot participatory Social Investment Fund. Project execution has gone well -- slightly
over 80 percent of the funds have been disbursed as of the end of May 1997, in line with appraisal estimates. Most of the
remaining funds are allocated for the social investment fund, whose implementation was expected to take longer. The
first Social Protection Project was successful in maintaining the level of spending on critical social programs during
1995-96 and evaluations of several social programs have been completed.

3. Benefits and target population: The project would provide temporary financial assistance to poor workers, who are
suffering from high levels of unemployment, and would assist in improving social and economic infrastructure in poor
communitie!,xThe number of people that would participate in the program as workers is estimated at 350,000. These
workers would receive a maximum of $200/mo while they are working on a project. About 16,000 projects are

expected to be completed, of which a large share would be located in poor communities.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:(See Annex 2 for a detailed description). The TRABAJAR
program is managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security staff at the national, regional and provincial levels.
The Ministry will provide the sub-project menu, criteria and other instructions for sub-project preparation, evaluation,
approval, and supervision. It will assign the resources for each province using a formula which weighs most heavily the
distribution of the poor unemployed, and will also consider implementation performance. Sub-projects can be proposed
by municipalities, provinces, national agencies or private organizations. Up until now the major source of sub-projects
has been municipalities. Since the Government is significantly expanding the program, the Ministry of Labor intends
to increase promotion and training activities. All sub-projects will be evaluated by professionals according to a
methodology which was developed during project preparation, drawing primarily on the experience of social funds. The
methodology incorporates economic, technical, financial, institutional, environmental, and social aspects. As projects are
evaluated, a data base on prices of materials as well as unit costs will be built up in order to be used as a basis for
comparison for subsequent project proposals. The database would include standard designs as well which could be made
available, as necessary, to assist some agencies in project preparation. For about 30 percent of the sub-projects,
evaluation will include a site visit. The sub-projects which receive a positive evaluation will be considered at monthly
meetings by committees constituted at the regional level, which include Provincial Managers of Employment and
Training (MTSS employees), the Regional Manager of MTSS, a representative from the national office of the MTSS,
and members of civil society as observers (currently mostly business and union representatives). Sub-projects will be
ranked by a point system according to several criteria, the most important of which is the poverty level of the area in
which the sub-project is located. Sub-projects will be approved up to the limit set by the available funds. Payments to
workers will be made by checks through the National Social Security Administration. Sub-projects will be supervised by
trained professionals generally three times during implementation. A methodology for supervision of sub-projects was
developed during project preparation.
Implementation period: 18 months
Executing agencies: Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MTSS), local governments, and private organizations
Project coordination: Ministry of Labor and Social Security
Project oversight: N/A
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The records and accounts of the Ministry of Labor
relating to the national program (essentially labor payments made by the National Social Security Administration) would
be audited each year by independent and qualified auditors, with a separate opinion provided for SOEs, using generally
accepted auditing standards and procedures. These records have been audited under the ongoing Social Protection
Project and have been found to be acceptable.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The program's management information system is being strengthened in
order to be able to provide timely monitoring reports covering all stages of the project cycle. A set of monitoring
indicators has been agreed. An evaluation of the direct benefits provided by the project will be undertaken by applying
to a random sample of workers benefiting from the project a survey instrument whose results can be compared with a
control group selected from the population at large. The indirect benefits of the projects financed by TRABAJAR will
be measured by ex-post evaluations of a random sample of projects. In cases in which the outcome of a project is not
satisfactory, there would be an examination of the processes of both the TRABAJAR program and the executing agency
to determine the main cause and to draw lessons for the future. The evaluation studies will be financed mainly under the
ongoing first Social Protection Project. A mid-term review will be held for the project no later than March 15, 1998.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the   Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: The document Country
project                               Assistance Strategy for the Argentine Republic, Report No. 16505-AR, was
discussed by the Board on May 15, 1997.
The project supports the CAS objective in the area of enhancing social development, including poverty alleviation and
strengthening the social safety net during the continuing restructuring of the economy. The increase in poverty in 1995-
1996 was closely related to the growth of unemployment in Argentina. Recent data show that about 40 percent of those
in the poorest decile were unemployed, compared to an average unemployment rate for the population as a whole of 17
percent.
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ .............. ............ ......
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The main issues can be categorized under four headings: poverty alleviation, labor market, employment program
policies, and social expenditures.
Poverty alleviation. Argentina's urban poverty declined between 1990 and 1994 together with the achievement of
economic stability and growth. This was a dramatic reversal of the poverty trend during the latter part of the 1980s.
However, economic stability and growth are necessary but not sufficient conditions to ensure continued and sustainable
poverty reduction. In particular, so far outcomes in the area of employment creation have been unsatisfactory and, as a
result, some of the previous gains in poverty reduction were reversed in 1995-96, particularly during the economic
recession. Development of a policy environment which would promote higher levels ofjob creation is crucial for
poverty alleviation in Argentina.
Labor market. Argentina's options in dealing with widespread unemployment are to rely on economic growth to create
employment and/or to institute labor reforms that encourage greater and more productive use of labor. A recent Bank
sector report, Estimating the Benefits of Labor Reform in Argentina (Report No. 15643-AR, January 31, 1997), argues
that given the scale of the unemployment problem, the limited macroeconomic instruments at the disposal of the
government, and the adverse short-term fiscal effects of further reductions in payroll tax rates, further labor market
reforms were needed. While the resumption of sustained growth will improve the employment outlook, it will do so
only over the longer term. Empirical analysis indicated that in fact the output elasticity of employment for Argentina
was lower than the wage elasticity of labor demand. The report suggested the following major reforms: (1) removing the
legally granted monopoly power over negotiations in the hands of sector unions and decentralizing collective bargaining
to the firm level; (2) further reductions in payroll taxes (difficult in the short-run because of fiscal austerity); and (3)
replacement of mandated severance payments by a fully funded severance payment system. With the aim of increasing
the capacity for job creation in the economy, the Argentine authorities have taken some steps to lower labor costs, which
are high by international standards. They have reduced payroll taxes, increased the flexibility of contracts, and
modernized employment regulations. However, so far the Government has not been able to make progress in the critical
(but politically very difficult) area of decentralization of collective bargaining and reform of the severance payment
regime. In late 1996, the President signed three emergency decrees which decentralized collective bargaining for small
and medium-sized companies. The Government also presented legislation to the Congress which would make it easier
for firms to lay off workers, including the establishment of a fully funded severance payment system. However, key
aspects of the decrees have been declared unconstitutional by intermediate-level courts, and the severance payments
legislation has not received sufficient support in the Congress. In February the Government decided to carry out a
tripartite negotiation on labor reform with union and business representatives. So far these negotiations have not been
successful in reaching an agreement among the three parties.
Employment program policies. In the past, many employment programs in Argentina have been characterized by high
administrative costs, poor targeting and a high level of fraud. Recently, the government has introduced changes in
various employment programs to make their management and administration more efficient and transparent. The
government also identified the need to reduce the administrative cost of programs, target them to the poor, and improve
the mechanisms for evaluation and supervision. Another goal is to give priority to those programs with the greatest
social impact, and improve their implementation. The design and operation of the TRABAJAR program reflect these

reforms.
Social expenditures. After increasing steadily during the first half of the decade, consolidated public social expenditures
are expected to fall slightly in 1997 to about $52 billion or 16.5 percent of GDP. The projected reduction in spending is
explained largely by lower outlays on social security and health/medical attention and obras sociales (health insurance
for formal sector workers). The national government finances about 60 percent of consolidated social spending. Social
insurance outlays account for two-thirds ($19 billion), and spending on health and education for an additional $6 billion.
Health spending is mostly accounted for by medical insurance for the elderly and the obras sociales, and, in the case of
education, by transfers to tertiary education. Of the remaining $4 billion, the largest components are nearly $1 billion for
FONAVI, resources passed to the provinces for housing which is part of the tax co-participation agreement between the
federal and provincial governments, and a similar amount in the Fondo del Conurbano (financing for the province of
Buenos Aires). About $2 billion is accounted for by about 40 programs covering the major areas of labor, compensatory
education programs, services for the elderly, community services and nutrition. About $400 million of that goes for
unemployment insurance.
A high share of national social spending cannot be reallocated easily in the short run. The same is true for FONAVI,
which is in effect a series of provincial housing programs for which the national government is only a financial agent.
The main area for efficiency gains appears to lie in a relatively small amount of spending - $2 billion of "targeted"
programs. The Government recognizes that there is a problem of fragmentation and overlapping of programs and that
administrative costs in some cases are probably excessive. Some actions to address these issues have been taken. A
Social Cabinet has been organized under the Chief of the Cabinet with the aim of improving coordination among social
programs. Evaluations of several programs are in process and others are planned in the short term (several supported
by the World Bank).

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Poverty Alleviation. The project will help to alleviate poverty by providing short-term employment to poor workers.
The targeting mechanism is the low wage rate, which is expected to be attractive only to those with few prospects for
employment. The strategy is justified by the strong relationship in Argentina between unemployment and poverty status.
The project will promote poverty alleviation also through an allocation of resources which will favor areas with a higher
proportion of poor unemployed individuals. The project ranking criteria also favor projects located in poor areas and
those paying lower salaries to workers.
Labor Market. The project is designed to be a social safety net for the poor and is not linked to additional labor market
reform. The project does not provide a long-term solution to the currently low employment generation capacity of the
Argentine economy, which will probably require a resumption both of growth and of labor market reform.
Employment Program Policies. The sector issue to be addressed by the project relates to improvements in the design of
the program to increase its cost-effectiveness in poverty alleviation. This includes several aspects. First, the wage rate
has to be set so as to promote self-targeting by the poor and to minimize displaced income. The economic analysis of the
project indicates that the wage rate proposed is appropriate. Related to this objective, other criteria for participation in
the program have been eliminated (head of household, for example). Second, both the evaluation and the supervision of
projects would be strengthened, drawing on lessons from social funds, with a view to ensuring that the projects financed
by the program are of reasonable quality. Third, allocation of resources geographically will improve the targeting to
poorer areas. Fourth, project ranking criteria will improve poverty targeting as well as cost-effectiveness of the program
by giving more weight to the location of projects in poor areas and by "rewarding" projects with higher labor intensity,
among others. Fifth, the project menu has been modified to exclude productive activities which generate mostly private
benefits. Low-cost housing is still on the menu, but receives the lowest ranking among project categories.
Social Expenditures. This project does not address issues related to social expenditures and their efficiency because
work in this area is covered by other projects. The Bank is supporting evaluation and analysis of social expenditures in
Argentina in several other projects, including the first Social Protection Project, and is supporting via other projects

major reforms in programs which account for a large share of public social spending (for example, reforms in pensions,
health insurance, and higher education). The Bank would continue to support the Government's efforts to improve the
efficiency of national social spending by supporting program evaluations and other analysis of social spending in the
context of the first Social Protection Loan.
8. Pojet ateraties onsderd ad reasons for rejection:
One alternative project design option would have been a social fund managed outside of traditional government channels
and using private contractors. Our review indicated that the MTSS-managed TRABAJAR program included sufficient
transparency, objective project selection and targeting criteria, and controls. The fact that the government manages the
program makes it easier to ensure that the wage rate offered will encourage self-targeting by the poor. Why isn't the
Bank supporting another type of safety net - for example, nutritional assistance to children? One reason is that the Bank
is supporting priority social programs in other loans - Maternal and Child Health I and II and the first Social Protection
Project. The focus on employment creation is justified because most of the increase in unemployment has been felt by
the lower income groups in Argentina. The link between poverty and unemployment is strong.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The lessons learned and reflected in the project design relate to public works schemes and the operational procedures of
social funds. The most important general conclusions which can be drawn from the experience with public works
schemes are as follows. One, the level of the wage rate is critical in determining the distribution of benefits from the
program, as well as how much of the program is targeted toward the poor. Maintaining the program wage at the level of
the ruling market wage for unskilled labor is the best way to improve the transfer of the program's benefits to the poor.
Two, public works schemes are most appropriate in situations in which poverty is expected to be transient. They are not
long-term solutions. Three, the program can be designed to encourage greater participation of women, lower
transactions costs for the poor as well as the potential cost of foregone income, and greater involvement of non-
governmental organizations and grass roots participation to prevent abuse. Four, an important determinant of the cost-
effectiveness of the program is the share of wages in the cost of subprojects. Five, it is important that the program be
designed to strengthen the secondary benefits from the assets created. Effective monitoring and supervision of projects is
important to ensure the quality of works.
Relevant lessons learned from Bank experience with social investment funds are now relatively abundant. Major lessons,

which are reflected in the design of the project, include: (a) complementarity of social fund subprojects with other
investments in the social sectors; (b) the desirability of financing small, technologically simple projects with substantial
community involvement; (c) the need for transparency; (d) the importance of using some monitorable form of poverty
targeting; (e) the involvement of both decentralized agencies and NGOs/grassroots organizations in subproject
implementation; and (f) the inclusion of strong supervision mechanisms.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The borrower's commitment to the TRABAJAR program has been demonstrated by its funding of TRABAJAR during
1996, including a budget increase, and by the stress given in the design and operation of the program to the use of
objective allocation and approval criteria and to monitoring and supervision of the projects financed.

12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank support adds value in several areas. Our review of TRABAJAR identified modifications in the design of the
scheme which would increase the efficiency of the program in making transfers to the poor. The experience of the Bank
in the targeting of social programs has been applied. The knowledge gained by the Bank in social fund projects was used
to improve the operating procedures of the program. Finally, Bank experience will help in the evaluation of the
program.

Assessment:                                                                      Effective

Analysis:
The TRABAJAR program can be thought of as generating direct benefits (net income gain to poor workers) and indirect
benefits (mainly the value of assets to communities). The proportion of total public expenditure on TRABAJAR (by
both the MTSS and cofinancing by local government) which is accountable to the net income gain to poor workers is
determined by the following four variables: (a) the budget leverage, or the amount of private financing mobilized by the
project; (b) the labor intensity (or the share of the cost of unskilled labor in the total project cost); (c) the targeting
performance; and (d) the proportionate net wage gain to poor participants. From the information available, it is
estimated that the cost of transferring $1 to poor workers through the TRABAJAR scheme in 1996 was in the range of
$3-5, though probably closer to $5. By a combination of changes in program design and in the ranking criteria for
projects, which among other objectives, would promote a somewhat higher labor share and minimize the foregone
incomes of participants, it should be possible to bring the cost of transferring $1 to the poor under TRABAJAR down to
$3-4 during the proposed project. Nevertheless, these calculations suggest that the case for TRABAJAR as an anti-
poverty scheme rests heavily as well on establishing that the indirect benefits are of sufficient value to poor people to
outweigh the extra costs that are incurred with this type of program. Several features of the existing scheme suggest that
the indirect benefits, particularly from the assets created, help tilt the balance in favor of TRABAJAR over alternative
transfer-based schemes. These features include: well-defined project selection criteria and approval procedures; co-
financing of non-labor project costs by local governments; and the existence of considerable administrative controls and
monitoring. This was confirmed in site visits during project preparation. An ex-post evaluation of a sample of projects
financed by TRABAJAR during 1996 was undertaken during project preparation. The study identified some
weaknesses, but in general found that project quality was acceptable. Planned improvements in the evaluation and
supervision of sub-projects are aimed at ensuring reasonable value to communities. Some of the changes in procedures
address the weaknesses identified in the evaluation study.

14. Financial Assessment: (N/A)   NPV=US$           million; FRR=   %
The evaluation methodology for sub-projects includes, as appropriate, a financial analysis for some types of subprojects.
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment: All projects will be evaluated before being submitted for approval. The evaluation
methodology (See Annex 2) includes technical aspects, focusing in particular on appropriate dimensioning of the
project, comparison with a data base on unit costs, and a check for compliance with existing national and local standards
whenever available. An ex-post evaluation of a sample of projects financed under the TRABAJAR program during
1996 was carried out. The findings were that in general project quality was reasonable. The major weakness identified
was the fact that a few projects financed under the program were unable to complete construction with the funding
provided. Safeguards against this problem are included in the evaluation methodology.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The program is directed by a team within the Directorate of Employment and Training
Policies in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. Day-to- day management is handled by the provincial Offices of
Employment and Training. It is expected that the staff at both levels will be supplemented by consultants to strengthen
the procedures relating to the evaluation and supervision of sub-projects. Payments to workers are made through the
National Social Security Agency. The objective of quadrupling the size of the program is very ambitious, and is driven
by the desire of the government to have a substantial impact on the difficult condition of those lacking work among
lower-income groups. Several factors would facilitate the expansion, including the experience gained in the first year of
operation, improvements being made in evaluation and supervision procedures, a reduction in the time to process
payment documentation, and a strengthening of the information system. The demand for financing for sub-projects
particularly from municipalities has been high. More focus will be given to promotion activities (including training in
the presentation of projects) in order to expand the number and type of executing agencies. Resources will be allocated
to each province based primarily on the relative distribution of the target population (poor unemployed workers).
However, this allocation would be provisional in order to be able also to take into account performance in implementing

the program, and to reallocate resources among provinces as necessary. In any event, a somewhat slower rate of
disbursement on the project would not significantly reduce the expected benefits of the project.
b. Project management: The project will be managed by a small unit within the Directorate of Employment and
Training Policies in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. The record of project management during the first year of
implementation was good. One positive feature was their ability to use their monitoring data to identify problems and
their record in resolving problems and improving implementation. Performance during the accelerated project
preparation process has been excellent. An operational manual has been prepared by the MTSS and approved by the
Bank.

17. Social Assessment:
Community Participation. A social assessment was carried out for this project. The local consultant who completed
the social assessment worked with the project team in the Ministry of Labor. The social assessment evaluated the role
of NGOs and the community in the existing program and identified areas in which their role should be strengthened and
the appropriate mechanisms to be integrated in the various stages of the project cycle - promotion, selection of sub-
projects, execution, supervision, and operation. During 1996, non-profit groups (mostly community groups) were the
main sponsoring agency for about 15 percent of projects. This ratio compares favorably with the experience of other
social funds in Latin America. For other projects non-profit groups participated, but had secondary responsibility. The
main recommendations of the social assessment which were incorporated into the design of the expanded project are:
more project promotion, more technical assistance in project preparation, removal of bias for high shares of project co-
financing and access to outside institutions for evaluation of projects. In addition, a social evaluation is part of the
evaluation methodology for projects. In the project application, sponsoring agencies are asked to describe how
communities have been involved in project selection and their role in project implementation and supervision.
Gender. Labor force participation by females has risen in recent years, and stands now at around 30 percent. The
participation rate for males is 53 percent. Women account for slightly less than half of the total unemployed. About a
fifth of poor households are headed by a woman. Unemployed men are more likely to belong to poor households than
are unemployed women. About 55 percent of unemployed men are in households in the bottom 20 percent of the income
distribution (as measured by household income per capita) while the share for unemployed women is 40 percent. During
1996 about 15 percent of the workers on the TRABAJAR program were women. We expect that this percentage will
increase in the expanded program. In the previous program workers who were heads of household were given
preference. In the new program no such preference will be given. The gender characteristics of workers on the program
will continue to be monitored. In addition, the Ministry of Labor will continue to fund from its own resources a
complementary program of Community Services which specifically targets poor women. This program funds service
activities and pays the same amount to workers as the TRABAJAR program. During last year, considering both
TRABAJAR and the Community Services program, the participation of women in the public employment programs of
the Ministry of Labor was about 25 percent of total beneficiaries.

18. Environmental Assessment:
The project has been assigned a B category. The subprojects to be financed under the Loan are expected to be small
(average size during 1996 was US$70,000) and most of the environmental impacts should be able to be predicted and
subsequently avoided or mitigated with common practices. Consideration of environmental aspects has been
incorporated into the evaluation methodology. The description of the methodology together with forms, etc. is included
in both the Operational Manual and in the Guide for Presentation of Projects. Environmental considerations are also
incorporated into promotion and supervision activities. The counterpart team with Bank assistance developed the
environmental checklists, etc., using as models best practices from other social funds as well as the Municipal
Development and FOPAR projects in Argentina. The evaluation methodology, including the environmental aspects, was
reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank. Environmental aspects will also be included in an ex-post evaluation of a
sample of projects.

The TRABAJAR program has been a demand-driven fund since its establishment in 1996, and thus has incorporated a
participatory approach since its inception. During preparation of this project, a social assessment was carried out with a
view to strengthening and refining the participatory approach in several areas. During preparation of the project, visits
were made to local governments to discuss their views of the program and suggestions for improvements. During the
social assessment, views and suggestions were solicited from community groups and NGOs regarding the project.
Projects can be proposed by local governments, community groups or NGOs. The experience so far is that for the
majority of projects the municipality is the main sponsor, although communities or NGOs are often secondary sponsors.
For about 15 percent of the projects, community groups or NGOs are the main sponsor. Under the expanded project,
some promotion activities will be tailored to community groups and NGOs. Each project will be evaluated, and as part
of that methodology the participation of communities in project selection and their support for the project will be
assessed. Supervision of the project will also include beneficiary assessments and contact with the community in which
the project is located. The Bank has worked closely with IDB on the component of their National Employment Project
which relates to financing for the TRABAJAR program.
20. Sustainability: The expansion of TRABAJAR is intended to be a transitional program that would be phased out
gradually as the increased flexibility of the labor market together with economic growth raise the rate of job creation in
the Argentine economy and thereby reduce unemployment. Thus sustainability of the TRABAJAR public employment
program is not a goal of the project. In fact, we would expect the program eventually to become unnecessary. On the
other hand, we expect the sustainability of the sub-projects financed under the program to be high given the high share of
financing being provided by local governments and the fact that many sub-projects involve remodeling or refurbishment
of existing facilities, not new construction. In addition, the strengthening of the evaluation process (including attention
to design standards and operations and maintenance), promotion of more community participation, and closer
supervision should contribute to sustainability of the sub-projects. In the area of cost recovery, the evaluation
methodology includes a stipulation that the local practices for particular types of sub-projects (for example, basic
sanitation, street paving, etc.) would be applied for any project financed by the TRABAJAR program.

23. Effectiveness Conditions
No special effectiveness conditions.
24. Other
Utilization of project funds
- The Borrower would ensure that the wage rates applicable to the services of temporary and fixed term workers for sub-
projects shall not exceed ARG.$200/mo. (Section 3.05 )
- The Borrower would forward to the Bank for its approval the relevant documentation for all Sub-projects estimated to
cost more than $350,000 equivalent after the sub-projects have been approved by the Project Management Unit. (Section
3.06 (a)(ii).
Management of Project
-The Project will be carried out in accordance with an Operational Manual approved by the Bank (Section 3.01 of the
Loan Agreement), and will be managed by a Project Management Unit with functions and key staff with qualifications
and experience acceptable to the Bank (Section 3.04 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
Block 5: Compliance with Bank Policies
II1 This project complies with all applicable Bank policies.
x The exceptions to Bank policies are as follows:
Retroactive Financing. The project provides for retroactive financing of up to 20 percent of the project costs in order
to permit financing of the program during the months of April-July 1997, up to 12 months prior to loan signing.
Local Cost Financing. The high share of local cost financing under the project is a consequence of the main
objective of the project, which is to provide temporary employment through the financing of labor-intensive
investments in social and economic infrastructure. It is justified by the need to provide a safety net for poor
households who have been most adversely affected by unemployment in Argentina. The fact that the resources for
the program will be targeted to Argentina's poorest areas also justifies the high local cost financing. Given the
objective of the Government to expand the public employment program substantially in order to have a significant
impact on the poor, and the stringent fiscal policy being implemented by the Government, it is our judgment that the
financial requirements of the program would exceed the limits of available local savings and expected foreign
exchange resources. The project complies with all other applicable Bank policies.

Annex 2
Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$ 1,178 million1 (total cost of component)
Sub-projects will be presented by municipal and provincial governments, private groups, and national
organizations. The menu of projects which are eligible for financing by the TRABAJAR program includes
minor construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling of schools, health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small
roads and bridges, small dams and canals, community kitchens and centers, and tourist centers. More detail
(including restrictions and special requirements in some cases) for each category of project are contained in the
Operational Manual.
Project Component 2 - US$ 22 million (total cost of component)
Project management, monitoring, and supervision costs.
Project Cycle
1. Project Promotion. Most promotion activities would take place at the provincial level, with the assistance of the
central project coordinating unit. These would include activities for NGO's and community groups designed to provide
technical assistance in the presentation of sub-projects for financing under the program.
2. Project Presentation. The MTSS has established guidelines for presentation of sub-projects. The menu of activities
eligible for financing includes the following: construction, extension, remodeling, rehabilitation of tourist centers,
schools, basic sanitation systems, transportation networks, bridges, dams and canals, health facilities, community
kitchens and other centers, and low-cost housing. More details regarding eligibility for each category are spelled out in
the operational manual and the guide for presentation of sub-projects. Sub-projects must be completed within 4-6
months and can employ no more than 1 00 persons. The application form includes information on executing agencies,
total cost, benefits expected (included a description of the community, role of the community in project selection, and
implementation and supervision), and location of the sub-project. Completed applications are presented to the provincial
Managers of Employment and Training Programs where they are screened for completeness of information and
compliance with the eligibility criteria.
2. Project Evaluation. Each sub-project will be evaluated by trained professionals, who will generally be contracted at
the provincial level. For about 30 percent of the sub-projects this will include a site visit. The methodology to be used
for evaluation covers economic, technical, financial, institutional, environmental, and social aspects of the sub-project,
and incorporates checks on costs using a data base of unit cost comparisons for similar types of sub-projects. It was
developed during project preparation, drawing from the experience with social funds. Details of the methodology are
contained in the operational manual.
IIncludes US$100 million of co-financing from IDB which remains to be confirmed.

3. Project Approval. Once a sub-project is judged to be viable on economic, technical and other grounds, it is ranked
according to specific criteria. These criteria are explained in both the operational manual and the guide for presentation
of projects. Sub-projects are given points depending on the extent of poverty in the area where the sub-project is located
(highest weight), as well as the coverage of previous sub-projects, the share of labor cost, the project category, the
priority assigned by the province, labor conditions, and salary level proposed. Sub-projects are assigned points according
to these criteria and then ranked. Sub-projects are submitted every month to one of five regional committees. The
members of the committees are the Provincial Managers of Employment and Training, the Regional Director of the
MTSS, a representative of the national office of the MTSS, as well as in some cases non-voting representatives of civil
society. The committees will review and approve sub-projects based on their rankings up to the limit of the resources
assigned to each province. Once a sub-project is approved by the committee, a resolution is issued by the MTSS listing
the names of the sub-projects and the amounts of financing from the TRABAJAR program for each.
4. Project Implementation and Payment of Workers. Once a sub-project is approved, the executing agency has to
present to the Provincial Manager of Employment and Training Programs, the list of workers on the project. Executing
agencies can choose such workers if they wish from lists of unemployed workers wherever they are available from
MTSS offices. Inclusion on such a list is not a prerequisite for working on a sub-project. The list of workers is verified
and the information passed on to the provincial units of the National Social Security Administration, which then forwards
them to the national office. Checks are issued to each worker once a month for the previous month's work. Depending
on the location of the sub-project, workers receive their checks at a bank or at the post office. Workers sign for their
checks, and this information is returned to the national office within 30 days of the initial receipt of the checks for the
workers.
5. Project Supervision. Each sub-project would be supervised by trained professionals, generally contracted at the
provincial level. On the whole, each project would be supervised three times during implementation, once at the
beginning of implementation before the first payment to workers is authorized, once mid-way through execution, and at
the time the project is near completion, before the final payment to workers is authorized.

lThe project costs include US$100 million in cofinancing from the Inter-American Development Bank which has not been confirmed.
2 Since most of the project cost is accounted for by financing for sub-projects, and physical targets are not the principal objective, no contingencies have been
provided for sub-projects. Any increase in the average subproject cost would be reflected in a smaller number of subprojects being implemented. Given the
projected 1 8-month execution period for the project, no contingencies have been calculated for project administration either.

Argentina Second Social Protection Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
A large proportion of the loan would not involve procurement as the Bank would reimburse the Government for
remuneration paid to qualified beneficiaries of the TRABAJAR employment program upon submission of
acceptable payment certificates. This procedure is currently being used for financing provided to the
Government under the on-going Social Protection Loan (Ln. 3957-AR).
Procurement for equipment and office supplies would be handled either using ICB, NCB, or shopping
depending on the value of the contract. Goods would be procured in accordance with the provisions of the
Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, as revised in January and August
1996).
Consulting services related to project management would be contracted following the Guidelines for Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (February 1997). For contracts $100,000 or over, the Quality and Cost-
Based (QCBS) procedures would be used to select consultants. For contracts below $100,000, expected to be
mostly individuals, it is expected that consultants would be selected according to their qualifications. Single-
source selection would be used only in exceptional cases, and for contracts below $100,000. The project is
expected to use the services of the UNDP to provide administrative support on tasks related to project
management.
The first year plan for procurement of equipment and office supplies, as well as consulting services, has been
prepared and is in the project files.
Procurement methods (Table A)
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
DisburseMnent
The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed over a period of 18 months. The project
completion date would be December 31, 1998 and the Loan closing date is June 30, 1999. Retroactive financing
of up to 20 percent of the loan or US$40 million would be available to cover eligible expenditures incurred after
March 31, 1997, but no more than 12 months prior to loan signing.
Required Documentation. Withdrawal applications for consultant services with a contract value of $100,000
or more, and $50,000 or more for the employment of firms and individual consultants, respectively, would be
supported by full documentation. Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs) against eligible expenditures not undertaken by contract which would cover payments of remuneration
for temporary workers. Supporting documentation for these expenditures would be maintained by the Ministry
of Labor and Social Security, and would be available for periodic review by the Bank. The preparation of the
withdrawal applications and SOEs and the organization of the supporting documentation will be the
responsibility of a team in the MTSS led by an administrative officer.
The allocation of loan proceeds is shown in Table C.

Special Account. A special account of US$25 million would be opened for this project in the Banco de la
Nacion. The MTSS would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or
whenever 20 percent of the authorized allocation has been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment
applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account and a
reconciliation bank statement of the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of the Special
Account would follow Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review and approval within
six months of the end of the fiscal year.
