BANGLADESH
SMALL SCALE DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
(CREDIT 955-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Small Scale Drainage
and Flood Control Project in Bangladesh for which Credit 955-BD in the amount
of US$25 million was approved on October 16, 1979. The credit was closed on
December 31, 1987, three years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the
last disbursement was on August 24, 1988.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was prepared by an
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme mission 1 which visited Bangladesh iD. Hay
1990. 2 The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, evaluation study reports prepared
by local consultants, a PCR prepared by the Borrower and discussions with staff
of the Bank and the Borrower concerned with the project.
On February 2, 1991, the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with
the request to prepare Part II by April 1, 1991, but none was received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
SMALL SCALE DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
(CREDIT 955-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objiectives
1.    The objective of the project was to increase crop production from improved
flood control in already partially protected areas. The project, which was to
be completed in about five years. was to comprise the construction of permanent
structures for water control in schemes for which tlhe earthworks for flood
protection embankmnents, drains and irrigation canals had already been compieted
by manual labor under the Food-for-Work Progranmme (FFW) -It was anticipated that
the project would involve the completion of about 100 sub-projects and the
betterment of about 140,000 ha of agricultural land.
Implementation Experience
2.    The project had a slow start due mainly to delays in surveys, design and
land acquisition. Actual costs of the completed sub-projects were appreciably
lower than estimated at appraisal because of depreciation of the Bangladesh Taka
against the US dollar. As a result, a larger number of sub-projects could be
implemented with the available funds, but more time was needed to complete the
expanded programme. The number of sub-projects completed doubled to 204 and the
benefitted area increased almost threefold to about 400,000 ha throughout
Bangladesh (see Map 1). Actual disbursements amounted to US$24.996 million out
of a total credit amount of US$25 million. The credit closed three years later
than planned on December 31, 1987 and the final disbursement was on August 24.
1988. In addition to the IDA credit, the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) made an initial grant equivalent to about US$3 million, which was
increased in 1986 to the equivalent of about US$5.3 million.
Results and Sustainability
3.    Project results are difficult to evaluate because the planned programme
of benefit monitoring required by the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was not
carried out. This is a recurrent problem in projects executed by the Bangladesh
Water  Development  Board  (BWDB).   Evaluation  Studies were  made  by  local
consultants for five sub-projects which had been described in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) and, on the basis of these studies, the PCR re-evaluated the results
in these sub-projects.   on the basis of this sample, the project has been
suLcessful with an average economic rate of return (ERR) of 25? for the five
combined sub-projects with ERRs varying from 14? to 92? for individual
sub-projects. However, if the costs of previously constructed earthworks, which
were treated in the SAR as sunk costs, are included, the range of ERRs for the



- iv -
sub-projects would be between 3? and 54? with an average of 10?. This stresses
the need for careful examinatior, of the feasibility of individual future
sub-projects before they are implemented. 1 By extrapolating the results of the
five subprojects, which cost about US$2.1 million and benefitted a nominal area
of 24,600 ha, to the whole project (US$40.8 million and 392,000 ha), the order
of magnitude of the project results can be estimated. On this basis, the
incremental production of grain due to the project is estimated at 220,000 tons
per year and the number of benefiting farm families at 560,000, or a total
population of about 3.5 million. The incremental farm labor requirements are
estimated to be about 10 million man-days per year. In addition, about 30 million
man-days of employment was used for construction of project works.
4.    The sustainability of benefits generated by the project depends on proper
operation and maintenance of the investment. BWDB has no adequate maintenance
budget. The budget prkvided is for staff and office and vehicle operating costs;
maintenance work is generally only financed under FFW, Flood Damage
Rehabilitation (FDR) or other projects. There is no regular programme for
carrying out minor repairs, which, if enacted early, could save rapid
deterioration and much larger future costs. It is difficult t- be confident that
the flood control works will be in adequate condition to withstand future floods
and storms. However, the Bank is addressing this problem U1..der the BWDB Systems
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2099-BD). Furthermore, there are indications that
extensive construction of flood control embankments, by restricting the spread
of flood water, may result in higher flood levels thereby increasing the
likelihood of embankments being overtopped.  Embankement construction in the
tidal area might also lead to reduced velocities in tidal khals thereby causing
siltation and impeded drainage.
Findinas and Lessons
5.    The project was more successful than estimated at appraisal as more
sub-projects were completed due to overestimation of unit costs at appraisal and
devaluation of the taka. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) did not comply with
covenants of the DCA which require it to monitor project benefits. The mission
found that BWDB staff were mainly concerned with construction and had little
interest in estimating the extent of the benefits generated by the projects.
Staff from the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) were often unaware of
the project's objectives and did not monitor benefits. The project was prepared
without any overall regional plans and the effects of the sub-projects on
upstream water levels, siltation and other aspects were given scant attention.
It is now appreciated that the combined effects of many such projects can be
appreciable and that regional studies are needed before planning such
sub-projects.
6.    The project was based on existing sub-projects selected by FFW and only
cursory screening was carried out before the sub-projects were implemented. Now
that most of the apparently viable sub-projects have been built, it is necessary
1     Because of the very small database available  for computing project
benefits, the results for the entire project are subject to gross errors.



- V -
that more detailed feasibility studies are carried out before additional
sub-projects are selected. This is being done under the Second Samall Scale Flood
Control and Drainage, and Irrigation Project.
7.    As a result of experience with this and other related projects it has been
realized that there are advantages to involving the potential beneficiaries in
the preparation of sub-projects. This should ensure that beneficiaries want the
project and increases the likelihood of their participation in its proper
maintenance. It is also likely to result in a larger number of drainage and
irrigation  inlet  structures.    The experience  of the project  proved that
insufficient numbers of structures were provided initially and it was necessary
to supplement these with additional structures. The project demonstrated the
advantage of the Revolving Fund for subsequent projects.
8.    The recurrent shortfalls in BWDB's obligation to monitor project benefits
make it advisable for future credits to finance a separate project benefit
monitoring component.

B. Ba'kground
1.     The main objective of the agricultural development efforts of GO  since
the early 1970s has been to achieve food self-sufficiency.  However, it was
recognized towards the mid-1970s that crop production in many areas was being
affected by one or a combination of the following problems: early floods,
intrusion of saline water, poor drainage in the monsoon season and lack of
irrigation in the dry season.   To alleviate these problems, the Government
decided to increase significantly the share of its investments in low cost
small-scale irrigation, drainage and flood control projects that would produce
quick returns on investments.
2.       In congruence with the above strategy, GOB asked IDA in 1978 for
assistance in financing the permanent structures required to make schemes
constructed under the Bangladesh Food-For-Work Programme (FFW) fully effective.
Supported by the World Food Programme (WFP), FFW had constructed earthworks for
flood protection embankments and excavated drains and irrigation canals but did
not have the resources to provide the drainage sluices, regulators, culverts and
other control structures needed for the sub-projects to yield their potential
benefits. The complementary permanent structures to be constructed under the
project would have a low investment cost. By permitting much improved water
control at farm level, they would be quick yielding and generate high rates of
return.
3.    Since 1977, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) had been
financing a project called "Canadian Assistance to WFP-assisted Food For-Work
Schemes in Bangladesh". This project had provided C$4H for the construction of
permanent structures in FFW schemes located in the Northwest Region and south



2
of the Karnafuli River in Chittagong District.   These schemes had set a
successful precedent for the proposed IDA project.
C. Frolect Obiectives and Description
4.      In line with GOB's objective to obtain self-sufficiency in foodgrain
production in the shortest possible time, the project was to increase crop
production by a series of quick-yielding, labour-intensive, low-cost
sub-projects, designed to permit much improved water control at farm level.
5.     The project would involve the completion, by the provision of permanent
structures and improvement of earthworks as necessary, of selected sub-projects
constructed under PFW. Sub-projects would be selected upon the basis of criteria
agreed between the Government and IDA.1 The project would be concerned only with
a relatively small proportion of FFW schemes.   It was antizipated that the
project would involve the completion of about l0C high priority schemes involving
the improvement of about 140,000 ha of agricultural land. It was assumed that
project implementation would take four and a half years2 although the
implementing agency, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), would be
encouraged, consistent with its absorptive capacity, to complete the works faster
in the interest of an early repeater operation.
6.     The project would be managed by BWDB and would include the engagement of
consultants to assist BWDB in the selection of sub-projects, supervision of the
design and construction of project-financed works and training of BWDB staff.
Equipment and vehicles would be provided to BWDB from IDA funding.   The
consultants and their vehicles would be financed by CIDA.
D. Project Design and Organisation
7{    The project, which was similar to the CIDA project (para.3), was prepared
by BWDB assisted by foreign consultants.  The project was to be carried out
throughout Bangladesh with the exception of the Northwest Region, which was
already covered by the CIDA project.   Project preparation was based on six
sub-projects for which feasibility studies had been prepared by the consultants.
However, these sub-projects were not typical of those envisaged in that the
average area was over 6,500 ha compared to the estimated average of about
1,400 ha and the actual average of about 1,850 ha.   Moreover, one of the
appraised sub-projects, Dhurung Khal, did not meet the criteria for selection
because the cost per ha was too high and the estimated ERR was less than 252.
1      Including expected ERR to be greater than 25Z; to ben0it at least
400 ha ar 500 farm families. Cost should not be greater than US$370
per ha.
2      Para. 4.05 of SAR refers to five years for completion.  Para. 4.13
and the implementation schedule indicate 4.5 years.

8.     Although the project required the Borrower to monitor project benefits,
no allowance was made to finance such monitoring. It became necessary to amend
the DCA to allow reimbursement of the costs ot consultants to carry out benchmark
and evaluation studies.   Phe Borrower was required to ensure that adequate
extension and credit facilities were available to the beneficiaries, but no
provisiorn waa made  for financing this.   In view of the large number of
sub-projects and their wide geographical distribution, it was not feasible to
set up special extension and credit arrangements for this project.
9.      In an attempt to overcome the GOB's financial constraints, a Project
Revolving Fund was established in a commercial bank as a condition of credit
effectiver.ess with an initial amount of Tk8.55 million (TKO.8 million by GOB
and US$0.5 million by IDA). This was the first revolving fund jointly funded
by GOB and IDA and it set a useful precedent followed in subsequent projActs.
10.    BWDB was responsible for project implementation and the operation of the
Revolving Fund. The Canadian consultants were required to appraise and select
the list of structures in cooperation with BWDB.  They were also required to
verify, prior to submission to IDA, replenishment applications for the Revolving
Fund.
E. Project Implementation
11.    Early project implemexutation lagged behind schedule.  Because the works
were dispersed throughout the country and a large number of relatively small
structures were involved, considerable time was needed for survey and design
work and this became a serious bottleneck during the early years. Actual costs
of completed sub-projects in US dollar terms were substantially lower than
estimated at appraisal because the Bangladesh currency depreciated. As a result,
a larger number of sub-projects could be implemented with the available funds
and more time was needed to complete the expanded programme.   The number of
sub-projects completed doubled to 204 and the benefitted area increased almost
threefold to about 400,000 ha.  Following the completion of the CIDA project
(para.3), Credit 955-BD was extended to include the Northwest Rebion. The other
main changes to the project involved increasing the amount of the Revolving Fund,
the financing of local consultants for benchmark and evaluation studies and
reallocation of the credit between categories. The closing date of thle Credit
was extended three times until December 31, 1987. CIDA agreed in 1986 to provide
a supplemental grant of C$3.9 million to finance further technical assistance
and an expanded staff training programme during the extended project
implementation period.
12.   Although delayed, due to time consuming survey work and design, slow la.-d
acquisition, tendering and insufficient counterpart funds, the project was
satisfactorily completed. The supervision missions reported a good quality of
workmanship.
13.    Of the six sub-projects presented in the SAR as justification for the
project concept, one, Bhola Island (West) was transferred from the IDA project
to be included in the Asian Development Bank financed Bhola Project.  Of the
remaining five baseline sub-projects, the main structures for the Bhola Island



South Sub-project were changed from three regulators to three earth dams and
repairs of a sluice between Bhola (West) and Bhola (South) sub-projects. At the
Nurania Xihal Sub-project a regulator was constructed but two bridges were omitted
and excavation of the silted khal was added. The Harihar River Subproject was
to consist of construction of  ' bridges and 5 regulators as well as drainage
works, but the bridges were onm_6ted and 7 regulators, acting as bridges, were
constructed on tributaries of the Harihar river. The regulator for the Sanir
Haor Submersible Embankment Sub-project was constructed generally in accordance
with SAR proposals. The Dhurung Khal Irrigation Subproject was to include the
replaceirent of the weir, 7 check structures on the main khal and canal
improvements. The weir was reconstructed, 5 check structures built, two surface
sluices added and 20 field outlets built.
F. Prolect Results
14.    The project was more successful than estimated at appraisal in that more
sub-projects were completed and the benefitted area was greater. This was due
to overestimation of unit costs at appraisal and devaluation of the Taka. Since
the monitoring programme required by the DCA was not carried out, the project
impact cannot be accurately evaluated for lack of sufficient data.  Although
Evaluation Studies were carried out by local consultants in 1986/87 to provide
a basis for the PCR, they lack records of annual crop production.  The brief
field visits made by the PCR mission did not allow to collect primary information
which would have improved the data in the Evaluation Studies. In the absence
of other data, the prorated cropped areas, yields and production from the
Evaluation Studies have formed the basis of the PCR re-evaluation of the project.
However, the PCR has examined only the five baseline sub-projects on which the
appraisal report was based, against over 200 sub-projects constructed. A further
difficulty consists of distinguishing the extent to which reported changes in
production are due to the project works. The selected five sub-projects account
for 72 of total project costs. SAR and PCR estimates of costs, areas, production
and ERR are compared in Table 20 of Annex A.
15.    The Bhola Island (South) Sub-project completed three closures of large
khals which prevented salt water intrusion from the south and east during high
tides and cyclonic surges.  BWDB claims that fresh water from the river to the
west of the island can now be used for irrigating dry season crops and for
supplemental irrigation during the wet season, thereby increasing yields and
areas of boro, aus and aman rice and other crops.  The mission, however, did
not observe significant areas of boro cultivation during its field visit. The
sub-project cost US$836,000 for a nominal area of 11,300 ha (US$74 per ha) and
produced an estimated incremental annual production of 5,000 tons of paddy (this
corresponds to a capital cost of US$167 per ton of incremental annual paddy
production).
16.    The Nurania-Khal Sub-project's regulator reportedly achieved its
objective of protecting aus and aman crops from monsoon floods and retained
water for irrigation of boro and other dry season crops, according to BWDB and
local farmers.   In 1988 one flap gate failed, permitting silt-laden salty
floodwater to enter the khal. Impeded drainage in the Bhadra river downstream
of Nurania caused this water to drain slowly and the khal became seriously



D
silted.   Desilting of the khal and the river downstream is expected to be
complete before the 1990 monsoon season. This sub-project provides an example
of one of the effects of poldering on the tidal khals. Since there is less area
to cover with water, less water flows in and out with each tide. The width of
the khal does not change, therefore the velocity of the water decreases and there
is more time to deposit heavy silt loads. Unless poldering is accompanied by
decreasing the tidal khal sections to maintain constant water velocity, rapid
siltation is likely. The sub-project cost about US$132,000 for a nominal area
of 1,300 ha (US$102 per ha) and an estimated incremental annual production of
1,135 tons of grain (US$116 per ton per year).
17.   The Harihar River Reexcavation Sub-project is located upstream of Nurania
and has been affected in a similar way by silting of the Bhadra River. This has
impeded drainage flows in the river, particularly near the regulators on the
downstream tributaries.   The benefits of the project vary from upstream to
downstream. At the upstream end, tidal flooding in the monsoon season was not
a serious problem and the main benefit comes from retaining water for dry season
irrigation. At the downstream end the benefits are similar to those at Nurania,
but impeded drainage due to siltation of the Bhadra and Harihar rivers has
reduced the benefits in recent years. The sub-project cost about US$507,000 for
a nominal area of 4,860 ha (US$104 per ha) and an estimated incremental annual
production of 2,424 tons of grain (US$209 per ton per year).
18.    The Sanir Haor submersible embankment was to protect against floods in
April and the first half of May to permit the boro crop to mature before harvest.
The sub-project, which comprised the construction of a regulator on the major
khal, achieved its purpose for four years. However, in 1990 exceptionally high
floods overtopped the embankment in the first half of April when only about 502
of the crop had been harvested. Farmers in the sub-project area reported that
the drowned crops were harvested under water and about 752 of the affected crop
was lost. At other smaller khals, the embankment is cut by farmers each year
after the wet season to permit drainage of the haor and then repaired again under
FFW to keep out the April/Hay floods.   The regulator constructed under the
sub-project avoids the need for annual cuts and repair of earthworks at the major
khal and it makes protection more reliable. Repeated annual earthwork repair at
this scale (the regulator is more than 10 m wide and 5 m deep) progressively
weaken the flood defence and suitable fill material becomes harder to find each
year.   The PCR mission considers the benefits of the regulator to be:  the
relative reliability of the protection it offers; the ease of opening the gates
to allow flooding of the haor after harvest thereby equalising the water levels
on both sides of the submersible embankment, thus avoiding damage due to
overtopping; and the saving in annual earthwork estimated to cost about 40 tons
of wheat per year under FFW.    The sub-project cost about US$395,000 for a
nominal area of 5,470 ha (US$72 per ha) and an estimated incremental annual
production of 3,216 tons of paddy (US$123 per ton per year).
19.     The reconstruction of Dhurung weir hab increased storage and improved
the reliability of supply of irrigation water. The downstream regulator at the
outfall to the Halda River protects a substantial area from floods from the Halda
mainly during the monsoon season. The areas irrigated from the check structures
are less than estimated because water is now being abstracted further upstream
in the project area by low-lift pumps. Actual project area claimed by BWDB is



0
less than half the SAR estimate (Annex A, Table 9). The sub-project cost about
US$259,000 for a nominal area of 1,680 ha (US$154 per ha) and an estimated
incremental annual production of 2,131 tons of paddy (US$122 per ton per year).
20.    The reestimated ERRs (Part III, 6B and Annex A, Table 20) are higher than
estimated at appraisal for Nurania and Dhurung, slightly lower for Harihar River
and substantially lower for Bhola South and Sanir Haor. The differences between
PCR and appraisal estimates are mainly due to changes in project costs and
incremental production, but are also influenced by unforeseen events such as the
1990 flood at Sanir Haor and siltation at Nurania and Harihar River. On the basis
of the five sub-projects examined in detail, the project appears to have been
reasonably successful with a re-estimated ERR of 25? against an appraisal
estimate  of  35Z.    However,  the variation  in ERRs  between  sub-projects,
particularly if the sunk cost3 of the earthworks are included, stresses the need
for careful examination of the feasibility of each proposed sub-project before
it is implemented.
G. Prolect Sustainability
21.    The sustainability of benefits generated by the project depend on proper
maintenance of the investment. At appraisal it was envisaged that eventually
responsibility for O&M would be handed over to upazilas. It was realised that
this might be a slow transition and the responsibility for ensuring adequate O&M
remained with BWDB. In general there is inadequate budget provision to BWDB for
maintenance works.  The budget is provided to meet establishment costs.  The
small amount of maintenance work carried out is generally financed under FFW,
FDR or other projects, i.e. from other sources than the recurrent budget. BWDB
has no regular programme or budget to carry out minor repairs, which, if enacted
early, could prevent rapid deterioration and much larger future expenditures.
The BWDB Systems Rehabilitation Project (Cr.2099-BD) aims to improve the services
provided by existing flood control, drainage and irrigation infrastructure, by
strengthening BWDB's organization for O&M and training BWDB staff and project
beneficiaries for O&M tasks. Under that project part of the financial burden
for O&H of the infrastructure will be transferred to the beneficiaries. However,
it is only proposed that this should be done for irrigation and not for flood
control and drainage infrastructure. Although local union or upazila authorities
have assumed responsibility for the operation of some structures, the PCR mission
did not find any evidence of maintenance being done by authorities other than
BWDB. The BWDB Systems Rehabilitation Project aims to optimuise the operation
of sluice gates in some flood control and drainage schemes by forming sub-project
committees, including representatives of farmers of high, medium and low land,
fishermen and others. It is difficult to be confident that this will ensure that
the flood control works will remain in adequate condition to withstand future
floods  and  storms.    Furthermore,  there  are  indications  that  extensive
construction of flood control embankments, by restricting the spread of flood
water, can result in higher flood levels.  This increases the likelihood of
embankments being overtopped. Reduced flows in tidal khals can cause siltation
which can impede drainage.

H. Bank Performance
22.    Appraisal was based on the analysis of six sub-projects which were not
all adequately prepared. At appraisal, it was considered that two sub-projects
appraised would not qualify under the criteria for sub-project selection, but
they were nevertheless included in the appraised project.   This was on the
grounds that their economic viability would be re-examined by BWDB and their
consultants.   One was subsequently transferred to an ADB project and several
sub-projects were substantially changed. Although the DCA required the Borrower
to monitor project benefits, no financing for this was provided under the project
and benefits were not monitored. Provision of a special category in the DCA's
Schedule 1 might have enabled the Bank to insist more forcefully on adequate
monitoring.   Insufficient attention was given at appraisal to provisions for
future maintenance of earthwork constructed under FFW and structures completed
under the project. Maintenance is now seen as a major issue (see para 21) and
some efforts are being made under the BWDB Systems Rehabilitation Project and
other projects to address this issue.   However, it is still not considered
feasible by GOB (and the Bank concurs) to recover the O&M costs of flood control
and drainage works from the beneficiaries.
23.    Eleven supervision missions from Washington and the Resident Mission in
Bangladesh supervised the project between 1981 and 1987. They adopted a
flexible approach to the project and cooperated well with BWDB.
24.   Lessons learnt from this project include four that have been incorporated
into the Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project
(Credit 1870-BD) (SSSFCDI Project):
(a)   during the early years of implementation, permanent structures were
planned and designed after the earthworks had already been completed
under FFW. However, the lack of adequate siting of the earthworks
often made it difficult to achieve optimal operational conditions
in the sub-projects after the structures were completed. In later
years earthworks and structures were planned and designed at the same
time.   Under the SSSFCDI Project, earthworks and structures are
designed and constructed simultaneously;
(b)   in accordance with recommendations of the National Water Plan, the
prospects for new or supplemental irrigation development are
investigated for all proposed new flood control sub-projects;
(c)   to encourage the beneficiaries to participate in all stages of
project planning and implementation, the SSSFCDI Project makes
provision for Project Committees, composed of local government
officials and beneficiaries, to be established at the planning stage
of each sub-project, and includes a training programme for local
government  officials  and  farmers.    This  should  ensure  that
beneficiaries want the project and it increases the likelihood of
their participation in later maintenance.   It is also likely to
result in a larger number of drainage and irrigation inlet
structures. The experience of the project was that an insufficient
number of structures was originally provided and it was necessary



8
to increase these with additional structures financed under other
projects to avoid farmers cutting embankments to evacuate drainage
water more rapidly;
(d)   in accordance with IDA's strategy to improve BWDB's capacity to
construct, operate and maintain its projects, the SSSFCDI Pro4ect
includes separate components for modernizing BWDB's Finance and
Account Departments and for enhancing its capacity to estimate
operation and maintenance costs for all its projects; and
(e)   in the future, adequate financial provisions should be made for a
benefit monitoring component, which will enable the Bank to insist
on adequate monitoring.
25.    The project demonstrated usefulness of the Revolving Fund including
the need for its adequate and timely funding to ensure the uninterrupted
construction of civil works.
I. Borrower Performance
26.    Although many delays occurred in project implementation (see paras. 11
and 12), the project was eventually satisfactorily completed. Early in 1982,
it became necessary to increase the amounts deposited in the Revolving Fund.
Despite frequent efforts by Bank staff, the Borrower was very slow in approving
the increase. It was not achieved until 1984, when procedures for withdrawal
of funds had been established to GOB's satisfaction.
27.     The Borrower consistently failed to furnish timely audited financial
statements and audit reports.   In June 1986, audit reports on statements of
expenditures (SOE) for the previous four years had not yet been received. The
Bank then introduced the practice of not accepting disbursement applications
against SOE when audit statements for SOE were more than 90 days overdue. After
this practice was introduced, the situation improved.   The Borrower did not
undertake the monitoring programme designed to assess the impact of the project
on agricultural development as required by the DCA.  Once the Bank agreed to
finance the Evaluation Studies, the Borrower arranged for these but the
consultants were not required to collect and present annual project-specific data
on agricultural production.
J. Project Relationships
28.    Good relations were maintained between the Borrower and the Bank through
frequent communication between BWDB and the staff of the Bank Resident Mission
in  Bangladesh.    The  CIDA-financed  foreign  consultants  developed  a  good
relationship with BWDB which contributed positively to the successful
implementation of the project.  There was a lack of communication between BWDB
and the agencies responsible for providing the agricultural support services and
no specific effort was made to improve coverage of the project area with these
services.



K. Consulting Services
29.      Foreign consultants, financed under Credit 622-BD, assisted BWDB in
project preparation and this was not entirely satisfactory (para 7). The foreign
consultants financed by CIDA for project implementation were generally considered
by bWDB and Bank staff to have performed well. Their role in approving work for
payment  was  helpful  in  maintaining  standards  of  workmanship.           Many
inconsistencies in contractors' bills were corrected, which enabled the Revolving
Fund to operate smoothly. Local consultants carried out benchmark studies of
six sub-projects1 and evaluation studies. The evaluation studies were used as
the basis for this report but lack adequate explanation of their results.
L. Project Documentation and Data
30.    The Staff Appraisal Report generally provided a useful framework for the
Bank and Borrower during project implementation.   The DCA, however, made no
mention of the CIDA-financed consultants and differed from the SAR on the
procedures required for withdrawals from the Revolving Fund and on the
sub-project selection criteria. There was no provision in the legal agreement
and SAR to finance agricultural extension and monitoring of agricultural
production. Although covenants were included in the DCA requiring the Borrower
to take action on both, almost nothing was done. One consequence is that the
data on crop areas and yields are inadequate to accurately estimate the benefits
of the project. BWDB prepared a PCR which covered construction of the project
but did not estimate benefits nor draw any lessons from implementation
experience.
1.     Results of benchmark studies were not available to the PCR
mission.   The PCR mission was unable to discuss the results with
the local consulting firm which conducted the evaluation studies,
since the firm no longer exists.

PROJECT COMPLETIMN REPORT
BANGLADESH
SMALL SCALE DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
(CREDIT 955-BD)
FINANCIAL REASSESSMENT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
General
1.    In the absence of pre-project benchmark surveys and post-project monitoring
on reduction of flooding hazards and subsequent changes in cropping pattern and
crop yields, it is difficult to make reliable projections of benefits due to the
project works. The unreliability of the benefit forecasts is further compromised
by the lack of data on flooding analysis for each sub-project area. Both SAR and
the Evaluation Studies failed to quantify the probable extent of reducing
flooding hazards under the project. Given these limitations, the PCR mission has
reservations about the results of its benefit analysis.
2.    For the purpose of the re-evaluation of the appraised subprojects, the PCR
used the crop data based on a sample survey conducted by the Evaluation Study
Team in 1986/87. The brief visits made by the PCR mission to each sub-project
area did not give sufficient information to improve the data in the studies. The
re-evaluation of the overall project has not been carried out on account of
inadequate data available to provide a reliable estimate for future overall
project benefits. Data from the five appraised sub-projects were prorated for
the entire project.  It ~hould be noted that no proper economic analysis was
conducted for the sub-projects selected during the course of project
implementation.
3.    Neither the SAR nor the PCR evaluated the effect of the project works on
areas outside the polders.

1/ Including physical and price contingencies in 1978 terms.
2/ In current terms. Costs in US$ are less than SAR due in part to
devaluation of Taka.
5.    The PCR costs were obtained from the Evaluation Reports and include an
allowance for engineering, administration and consultants. They are therefore
more than the costs against which IDA disbursed.
6.    Because exchange rates varied during the project, annual investment costs
were converted to US dollars using average annual exchange rates shown in
Table 13.
7.    The per ha financial benefit at farm level, in accordance with the SAR,
is based on the average per ha gross value of output less per ha production
costs, both valued at financial prices. The results are summarised in the
following table.

Economic Re-evaluation
8.    Economic re-evaluation is at spring 1990 constant prices. Import prices
for rice, wheat and some inputs have been derived from World Bank price
projections, dated January 1990, using the average of the forecasts for 1990 and
1995. Export prices for jute and urea are based on information from the
Bangladesh Jute Corporation and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, world

price trends and estimated average costs to destination. Derivations to farmgate
level are shown in Table 11.
9.    The prices of non-traded commodities have been adjusted by the Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.8. The costs of farm labour and irrigation have been
adjusted by the respective Conversion Factors (CF) of 0.75 and 0.85. A list of
financial and economic prices used in the analysis is given in Table 12.
10.   The economic costs of investment include the value of wheat distributed
under the Food for Work (FFW) programme for work carried out on the project after
1981 at an economic price of Tk8,060/ton (See Tables 14 to 18).
11.   To obtain economic costs, the financial costs of investment have been
adjusted as follows:
(a)   taxes and duties have been deducted from the costs in the same
proportions as assumed in the SAR.
(b)   the cost to BWDB of land acquisition has been omitted.
(c)   the local costs have been adjusted by the SCF 0.80. In the absence
of any information on this from the BWDB accounts, the proportion
of local costs in the actual costs has been assumed to be the same
as in the SAR.
12.   This results in the following factors by which financial costs must be
multiplied to convert to economic costs.

0.81    0.81     0.78   0.79      0.80
13.   The series obtained from the above adjustments have been brought to 1990
prices level by adjusting the annual figures in Taka by the respective GDP
deflators for Bangladesh, as shown in Table 13.
14.   Net project incremental agricultural benefits have been obtained using the
cropping patterns, yield, input and price assumptions shown in Tables 1 to 10,
valued at economic prices. The assumed phasing of incremental agricultural
benefits is as followst

17.   The re-estimated ERRs for Bhola South and Sanir Haor are lower than the
SAR estimates because the costs are higher and the incremental production is
lower. Furthermore, at Sanir Haor, the effect of the 1990 flood lowers the ERRs.
On the other hand at Nurania and Dhurung, costs are substantially lower and
although the incremental production at Nurania is slightly lower, ERRs are about
the same or higher than estimated in the SAR.

V/  Assumed that no fertilizers were used in both with and without project situations since tho crops *re local varieties and
the level of crop yields estimated is attainable without fertilizers. Evaluation Report indieates that about 1,500 tons of
fcrtiliz rs have been used in the sub-project arms since the pre-project time (before 1981). This amount corresponds to
about 120-150 kg/ha on an average crop. From the low levol of crop yiolds reported in Evaluation Study (se Tablo 1) It is
difficult to understand such rates of fortilizers as actually applied in the are.

net sub-project area is about 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) and annual cropping intensities in the last four years were in the
range of 180X to 200%. These discrepancies in net cultivated area and cropping Intensities are inexplicable. In the
absence of complete annual cropping records inctuding before and after remodelling weir (1981), PCR used the data given
in the Evaluation Study Report.
