SECOND IIIGIIWAY PROJECT
SU_MARY ANI) CONCLUSIONS
i.         The economic growth of the Ivory Coast over the past ten years has
been impressive, largely as the resuilt of the Government's efforts to promote
agricultural development and exploitation of its abundant timber resources.
Agriculture and forestry are the main economic activities, together account-
ing for about 80% of the total exports and 30%, of the gross domestic product.
Timber production tlhrouglhout the country is expected to level off, however,
and tlhe Covernment's future development plans call for diversification of the
economy and stimulation of economic activity in the less developed areas.
Substantial investments are required in thie transport sector to support and
maintain economic growth. The project, which will allow improved access to
tinmber resources in tlhe west and to agricultural areas in the north, will
assist the Government in its development efforts.
ii.       The project roads were reconnended under Phase I of the Transport
Survey whichi was financed by thle United Nations Development Programnme with
tlhe hank as executing agency.  Detailed engineering was carried out under
l'hase Il of tlue Transport Survey and under the first highway project (Loan
542-IVC).
iii.      T1he project consists of (a) construction of the Yabayo-Duekoue-Man
road inclucliiîg a brancb) from Pinhou to Guiglo (238 km); (b) construction of
tlue Bouake-Katiola road (49 km); (c) supervision of construction by consul-
tants; anid (d) detailed ens-ineering by consultants of about 300 km of roads.
T!he total cost of tlhe projject is estiniated at IJSS35.5 million equivalent.
The forei>n uxcliange coniponenit, corresponding to about 58% of the total
project cost, is estimnated at US$20.5 million and will be financed under
the loan.  Tre Covernment will uuicet tAie local cost of tlhe project, esti-
matcd at US$15v.O millioni equivalent.
iv.       11\(` DirectoraLt  Cetieral of Ptiblic Works, under the Ministry of
1'ubliçe ;orks and Transport, will be responsible for tlhe execution of the
project. It will be assIsted bv consultants eunployed on terms and conditions
acceptable to tle i3ank.  All construction under the project will be by con-
tractors selected tlîrough international competitive bidding among prequali-
fied finns, in accordance witlh Bank/IDA guidelines.
v.         Construction of t1ue Yabavo-Man road is expected to yield an internal
ecoiuomic return of about 16%, and tule Bouake-Katiola road, a return of about
26%., witli tUie retnirn for both roads being about 18%l.
vi.        The project provides a suitable basis for a 13ank loan of US$20.5
tnillion equivalent to tlhe Republic of tlUe Ivory Coast for a term of 24 years,
includinc a four-year grace period.






IVORY COAST
SECON) IIIGIIWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The present project is the second Bank lending for highways in
the Ivory Coast. It is an outgrowth of feasibility studies and detailed
engineering carried out under the first highway project (Loan 542-IVC) and
under a Transport Survey which is being financed by the United Nations De-
velopment Programme (UND)P) with the Bank as executing agency. The project
consists of the construction of the Yabayo-Man road including a branch to
Guiglo (238 km), construction of the Bouake-Katiola road (49 km) and detailed
engineering of another 300 kin of higlh-priority roads recommended under the
Transport Survey. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$35.5
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$20.5 million or
58%.
1.02      The first highway project, financed by a loan (542-IVC) of US$5.8
million equivalent in 1968, consists of (a) construction of a paved road
from Abengourou to Agnibilekrou (60 km) and (b) feasibility studies for 700
km of primary roads to be followed by detailed engineering of 500 km if
justified. Tlhe start of the project was delayed almost a year due to slow
administrative procedures of the Covernment, but progress is now satisfactory.
Feasibility studies are complete and construction is expected to be completed
by Fall 1971. Of the 700 km of roads studied, about 350 km were selected
for detailed engineering. Engineering of the Yabayo-Man road has been com-
pleted by the consultants, Louis Berger International (U.S.), and that of
about 100 lan of road sections north of Abidjan, by the French consultants,
Omnium Technique d'Amenagement, is in progress. Because surplus funds are
available, tle loan agreement was amended (approved by the Executive Directors
on March 8, 1971) to permit financing of detailed engineering of an additional
500 km of road sections.
1.03      The UNDP-financed Transport Survey is being undertaken by the
French consultants, Societe d'Etudes Techniques et Economiques (SETEC), in
two plhases. Phase I, an overall survey of transport requirements, was com-
pleted in September 1969 and makes general recommendations for investments
in the varlous transport modes (para. 2.08). Concerning highways, Phase I
concluded that an extensive program of primary road improvement should be
undertaken. Phase Il consists of (a) feasibility studies for about 1,100
km of roads selected on tlhe basis of recomniendations made in Phase I; (b)
detailcd engineering of the Bouake-Katiola road which was given first
prioritv; and (c) a study of highway maintenance and administration. The
consultants' draft final report on Phase Il is expected to be completed by
the end of June 1971.
1.04      Other Bank Croup lending in the transport sector of the Ivory
Coast has becn confined to a 1954 railway loan (100-FR) of US$7.5 million
equivalent to the Office Central des Chemins de Fer de la France d'Outre-Mer



-_ 2
for the acquisition of diesel locomotives for the Dakar (Senegal)-Bamako
(Mali) and Abidjan-Ouagadougou (Upper Volta) railways. The loan has been
fully repaid.
1.05      This appraisal report is based on the economic and engineering
studies carried out by Louis Berger International and SETEC, on work carried
out by the Bank's Permanent Mission in Western Africa, and on the findings
of a mission consisting of Messrs. G. Chaix (Engineer) and R.F. Einthoven
(Economist) which visited the country in November 1970. The report was
edited by Miss J. Murphy.
2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting (see Map)
2.01      The Ivory Coast is roughly square in shape, with a total lanci
area of 322,000 kmZ which is about the size of the British Isles. The
country is bounded by the Gulf of Guinea on the south, Liberia and Guinea
on the west, Mali and Upper Volta on the northi, and Chana on the east. The
flat to gently rolling terrain of the country presents no major obstacles
for transport development, though north-south construction paralleling the
flow of the rivers is easier and less costly than east-west development.
Climate and vegetation vary markedly according to latitude, with dense
tropical forest in the southern region, open fores:s and grassland in the
central region and savannas in the north. Economic activity and population
are largely concentrated in the southeastern and central regions where
abundant rainfall facilitates agricultural activities.
2.02      The population is estimated at 5.1 million, of which about one
million are immigrants, mainly from Mali and Upper Volta. The population
is growing at about 3.5% p.a., with one-fifth of this growth attributable to
net immigration. About 70% of the population is employed in agriculture.
2.03      The gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of about
7.5% p.a. (at constant prices) from 1960 to 1970, reaching an estimated
US$1.46 billion in 1970 or US$286 per capita.  This impressive growtli, which          
has led to considerable increase in transport demand, is largely attribut-
able to political stability, abundant agricultural and forest resources and
a vigorous program of export promotion.  Agriculture and forestry are the
main economic activities, together accounting for about 80% of total exports
and 30% of the GDP. The main exports are timber, coffee and cocoa, followed
by bananas, pineapples, cotton, palm oil and rubber. Timber prodluctiotn, whiclh
has increased over the past 10 years at 15% p.a., is expected to level off,
and the GDP is projected to grow at 5.5% p.a. (at constanit prices) usltil 1975.
B. The Transport System
2.04      The country is served by a well-developed transport system.  The
predominant feature of the system is the extensive highway network (see Chap-
ter 3) which serves all populated areas of the country and which accounts for



- 3 -
about 75% of all passenger movement and 70% of all freight traffic. The
single track, meter-gauge railway, which extends 625 km from Abidjan, north
to the Upper Volta border and on to Ouagadougou, serves mainly to transport
import-export traffic for Upper Volta and Mali, with transit traffic account-
ing for about 70% of total freight carried. At present, there is only one
deep-water port at Abidjan, but this facility will soon be supplemented by
a new port at San Pedro (para. 2.07). In addition, the country has 400 km
of navigable waterways and nine airports with regularly scheduled services,
including an international airport at Abidjan.
2.05      The railway, the Regie du Chemin de Fer Abidjan-Niger (RAN), is
owned jointly by the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. Freight traffic from the
Ivory Coast and Upper Volta has been growing at about 3% p.a. over the past
decade. But because some Mali traffic, which had been diverted to the RAN,
lias gradually returned to the railway through Senegal, total freight traffic
remained almost constant at about 340 million ton-km between 1961 and 1968.
In the future, however, freight traffic is expected to grow at about 3% p.a.
Passenger traffic has increased steadily at about 12% p.a. since 1958, total-
ling 540 million pass-km in 1968.
2.06      The RAN is run on a sound basis, and despite competition from paral-
lel road transport, remains economically viable. Dieselization is complete,
the track is being graduaLly rehabilitated, and locomotives and rolling stock
are replaced or renewed o01 a regular basis. After allowing in its accounts
for depreciation, the rai'Lway has a small operating deficit that is met by a
Government subsidy, which is about equal to what the railway pays in taxes.
The railway is expected to be able to eliminate its deficit gradually.
2.07      At present almost all foreign trade moves through the one deep-
water port at Abidjan. Total tonnage of imports and exports has increased at
almost 11% p.a. over the past five years, amounting to about 5.2 million tons
in 1969. To relieve the growing pressure on the facilities at Abidjan and to
stimulate the development of the soutlhwestern region, the Government is build-
ing a new port at San Pedro, which is expected to be in operation by mid-1971.
The development of this port, and of complementary facilities such as housing
and roads, is being fiinanced through loans and contractor's financing from
France, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany. Within a few years, all
log and most timber export traffic from the western part of the country will
utilize the new port. The provision of this new port is expected to allow
more intensive exploitation of timber resources in the western region be-
cause of the resulting decrease in inland transport costs.
2.08      Phase I of the Transport Survey concluded that there were no serious
capacity shortages in the transport system. While the consultants' major
recommendations concerned improvement of the highway sector, they did find
that tie railway's track rehabilitation program was justified and that, in
view of the Government's decision to build a second port at San Pedro, some
of the improvements planued for the port of Abidjan would not be required
immediately.  The main problem within the transport sector is the lack of
Ivorian professional staff, a problemn largely alleviated by French technical



-4-
assistance.  Despite the Government's training efforts (para. 3.10), the
highway organization will have to rely o01 tecliniical assistance [rom foreign
experts for somne time.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.09      The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Chart 1) is responsi-
ble for the coordination of policies and investments affecting tlhe various
transport modes.  Investment planniing is not actually done by the Ministry,
however, since it lacks an adequate mechanism for formulating a coniprehen-
sive investment program from proposals made by its various Directorates. The
agency which actually plans public investment in the transport sector is thie
Ministry of Planning which considers the proposals when preparing the five-
year development plans. The Ministry of Planning functions adequately, though
prior to the Transport Survey, transport investments were sometimes undertaken
without sufficient economic analysis.
2.10      Because road transport ls the predominant mode, and because compe-
tition between modes is limited to road-rail competition along the central
north-south transport axis, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's
regulatory responsibilities mainly concern road transport. Within the Min-
istry, the Directorate of Road Transport oversees regulation of this industry.
The effectiveness of the Directorate has been handicapped by a lack of staff,
and by the general scarcity of statistics on velicle utilization, transport
costs, transport demand, etc. on which it must base its policy recommenda-
tions. National and regional transport committees, made up of representatives
from the Government, the railway, the road transport industry, and road users,
advise the Directorate on transport policies, sucli as the allocation of il-
censes and road tariffs.
2.11      Excess capacity within the trucking industry led to a Government
ruling in 1966 which limits the road transport capacity both nationally and
regionally by controlling the number of licenses issued to public carriers.
At present, no new permits are issued except for trucking under contract
for a few specific commodities.
2.12      Under Phase I of the Transport Survey, SETEC recommended that
minimum road transport rates be established and that freight offices be set
up throughout the country to apply them. Although the Bank had expressed
doubts as to the efficiency of this recommendation, the Government established
minimum and maximum rates in 1970 and has just begun establishing the freight
offices throughout the country to apply the rates and to coordinate vehicle
utilization. It is too early to judge the effect of the above regulations
on efficiency of resource allocation. The matter will be reviewed as informa-
tion becomes available on the experience of the freight offices (see para. 2.14).
2.13      In addition to the above regulations, freight transport by road
between points along the railway is legally limited to vehicles with less
than 10-ton loading capacity, which restricts truck-trailer traffic.  Tliis
rule, however, does not apply to veihicles wlîiclh have either origin or destina-
tion at some distance froin the rail line, and since niO controls lhave been



established to distinguish vehicles which are subject to the restriction, it
is not strictly enforced. Thus, the determining factor for allocation of
traffic between rail and road where competition exists is the transport cost.
User taxes on heavy vehicLes are very low at present. While this may encourage
the production of agricultural and forest products, it means that these vehi-
cles do not pay their share of road costs and has an adverse effect on the
railway's competitive position. Data on this subject are still incomplete,
but more information will become available under Phase Il of the Transport
Survey in connection with the feasibility studies for paving the roads paral-
lel to the railway.
2.14      It may prove desirable to undertake a more specific study of the
organization of road transport, road user taxation, and coordination between
road and rail transport with the funds remaining under the UNDP grant. During
negotiations, the Government agreed that such a study would be undertaken if
the Government and the Bank deem it necessary, based on the findings of the
Transport Survey and the experience of the departments and agencies (includ-
ing the freight offices) responsible for coordinating and regulating road
transport.
2.15      Truck axle loads are limited to 10 tons.  Until recently, this
regulation was not strictly enforced, though weighing stations exist on all
paved roads carrying timber traffic. The trucking industry had requested
that the limit be raised to 13 tons and the consultants were asked to study
this question under the Transport Survey. SETEC concluded that the 10-ton
axle limit is more economic than a 13-ton limit, and the Governnent has
tightened enforcement of the regulation. During negotiations, the Govern-
ment confirmed that the 10-ton axle limit will be strictly enforced, and
that weighing stations will be installed along the new roads to be con-
structed in thie western part of the country which will carry timber traffic.
3. THE IiIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
3.01      The extensive highway network consists of about 14,300 km of all-
weather roads, of which about 1,300 km are paved, and about 20,000 km of un-
improved earth tracks. In addition, loggers have opened an unidentified
number of tracks in forestry areas. Two-thirds of the highway network was
built after World War Il (see Table 1), primarily to facilitate timber
exploitation and the collection of agricultural produce. More recently,
investments have been devoted to improvement of the existing network. The
highway density is about 1 km per 10 km2 which is high for West Africa.
3.02      The network coverage is adequate except in the as yet undeveloped
southwestern corner of the country. However, road improvements and main-
tenance throughout the country have not kept pace with the rapid traffic
growth over the past five years, and Phase I of the Transport Survey iden-
tified many roads requiring strengthening or upgrading.



3.03      Two Government projects presently underway will moodify the network.
An area of about 174,000 ha in the central region will be flooded after com-
pletion of the Kossou Dam in 1971, thereby necessitating the construction
of new roads to replace those inundated.  Development of the southwestern
region requires new roads linking the port of San Pedro with its hlnterland.
The San Pedro-Issia road is being constructed as part of the port develop-
ment scheme and will be completed to two--lane gravel standard by the end of
1971. Detailed engineering for paving of this road is underway with finan-
cial assistance from the European Development Fund (FED).  FED is also ex-
pected to finance the paving work which is scheduled for completion by 1975.
B.   Characteristics and _rowth of Road Traffic
3.04      The vehicle fleet (Table 2) is estimated at about 57,000 vehicles,
of which 63% are passenger cars, 22% are buses and light vans and 15% are
trucks and truck-trailer combinations. Since 1965 the fleet has grown at
about 9% p.a., with passenger cars and truck--trailer combinations accounting
for the greatest increase (11% p.a.).
3.05      Traffic volumes (Table 3) have followed the same rapid growth
pattern. Total freight traffic volume has increased by more than 8% p.a.
since 1965, totalling, in 1970, about 1.1 billion ton-km. Since timber
traffic, which accounts for about 40% of this total, is expected to decline,
freight traffic is projected to grow by only 2% p.a. over the next five
years. Inter-urban passenger traffic has increased at about 4% p.a. since
1965, totalling about 1.75 billion pass-km in 1970. The use of private pas-
senger cars, which accounts for 12% of total passenger traffic, has increased
at the rapid rate of 12% p.a. and is expected to continue to increase by 7%
p.a. over the next five years.
3.06      Traffic volumes are concentrated in the southern half of the
country, particularly around Abidjan where most economic activity takes
place. SETEC took extensive traffic counts under Phase I of the Transport
Survey and found that while roads radiating from Abidjan carry more than
1,000 vpd, over the network as a whole traffic volumes are low, averaging
less than 100 vpd on most roads. The road leading north from Abidjan to
Bouake and the Upper Volta border is the one road in the north with substan-
tial traffic volumes.
3.07      Traffic counts, carried out semi-annually by the Directorate
General of Public Works (DPW), are not very reliable. In order to assure
that adequate statisties are collected for planning purposes, the Govern-
ment agreed during negotiations that, by June 1972, an adequately-staffed
unit will be established in the DPW which will carry out traffic counts
regularly.



-7-
C.   Ulighway Administration
3.08      The DPW (see Chart 2) in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the highway network,
with the exception of those roads in the immediate vicinity of the Kossou
Dam and the San Pedro port which are being constructed by semi-autonomous
authorities under the control of the President's office. The DPW head-
quarters at Abidjan includes central services in charge of administration,
accounting, planning and equipment. Actual works are carried out by six
regional divisions which report directly to the Director General of Public
Works. This organization is adequate to handle regular maintenance works
in the field, but the central services, particularly that in charge of
planning (Subdirectorate of Roads), lack sufficient authority to establish
sound priorities and to program the work of the regional divisions.  As
part of their study of highway maintenance, SETEC will make recommendations
on the highway organization.
3.09      While the Director General and most divisional directors are
Ivorian, the Covernment has been unable to fill all staff requirements at
the upper and middle echelons with qualified national staff. Consequently,
the Directorate relies heavily on technical assistance from France, which
presently accounts for 40% of its senior staff. The DPW has given priority
to staff requirements in the regional divisions, but the central services,
particularly the Subdire,-torate of Roads, are understaffed. The situation
is in danger of deterior;ating further in view of the increasing demands of
and better job opportunities offered to Ivorians by the private sector.
3.10      The Government recognizes that its long-term staff needs can only
be met tlhrough an extensive educational and training effort.  Programs for
the training of maintenance foremen have been carried out on a regular
basis for many years. Since 1961, a civil engineering school in Abidjan
lias been training civil enîgineers and techliicians, but an average of only
six engineers has graduated in each of tlhe past four years.  A few students
have also been sent abroad for Ihigher education, mainly to France. Despite
these training programs. the DPII will have to rely on assistance from
forelgn experts for somne timte. While some training will be provided to
Ivorian engineers by the supervising consultants under the project, a more
extensive training effort should be undertaken.  SETEC is reviewing the
staff requirements of the DPW iinder its study of highway administration
ane, maintenance and, in this connection, will make recommendations on train-
ing of Ivorian personnel.  It is hoped that an extensive training program
can be incorporated  into a future Bank lending operation in the highway
sector.
D.  lUiijway Maintenance
3.t1 ioutine higbiw.ay maintenance is carri ed out by the regional
divisions of ttle DPW wl:icli rent their equipment on an annual basis from
thie lirectorate of Equipmeîit; periodic resealing of paved roads is awarded
to contractors.  titile tle network is maintained at a generally higher
level titani in otlher,West African countries, maintenance has not kept pace



-8-
with the rapid traffic increase over the past five years, and will have to
be increased if deterioration of the network is to be prevented. The over-
all maintenance situation is being reviewed under Phase II of the Transport
S urvey.
3.12       Total maintenance expenditures have increased from US$6.2 million
equivalent or US$190/km in 1965 to US$8.8 million equivalent or US$258/km
in 1969. While the annual increase in maintenance expenditures is signif-
icant, it has not been sufficient to cover inflation and increased main-
tenance needs. Government plans call for an allocation for maintenance of
US$11 million annually over the 1971-1975 period, but this is unlikely to
be sufficient to cover future maintenance requirements.  SETEC's recom-
mendations on highway maintenance will include an estimate of the main-
tenance allocations which are required to keep the network in adequate
condition. During negotiations, the Government agreed that, upon comple-
tion of SETEC's study, it will review, in consultation with the Bank, the
consultants' recommendations, will implement a mutually acceptable highway
maintenance program according to an agreed timetable, and will allocate
sufficient funds and other resources to carry out such a program.
E.   Engineering and Construction
3.13       Engineering of major highway construction is carried,out by con-
sultants. The Government utilizes a number of foreign consulting firms which
are active in the country, as well as a semi-public firm, BNETD (Bureau
National d'Etudes Techniques de Developpement), which was created in 1964
to carry out engineering work. BNETD is staffed largely by French experts,
most of them provided under French aid. In addition to highway engineering,
for which it has only limited capacity, BNETD's activities cover building
design, urban planning and regional development studies.
3.14       Major construction works are carried out by contractors.  Several
large foreign contractors are presently working in the Ivory Coast and most
of them have set up local branches. There is only one contractor with
Ivorian majority ownership, SONITRA, which is owned by the Government and
the Israeli contractor, Solel/Boneh. SONITRA and Solel/Boneh are carrying
out, in joint venture, construction of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road.
F.   Highway Expenditures and Financing
3.15       Funds allocated for highways in 1969 totalled about US$20.1 mil-
lion equivalent, of which about US$11.0 million were for new construction,
US$8.8 million were for maintenance, and IUS$0.3 million were for admin-
istration (Table 4). Ilighway administration and maintenance are financed
by allocations from the general budget and from the Road Fund, which is
partly funded by specific taxes on fuel and lubricants (see para 3.16).
New construction has been financed by the Government, by development loans
from the Bank (542-IVC), France, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany,
and by contractor financing.



-9 -
3.16      Road users contribute to the Government's revenues through import
duties and added value taxes on vehicles, spare parts, fuels and lubricants;
through annual vehicle registration fees, and through a "taxe specifique"
on fuel and lubricants, a portion of which is channeled to the Road Fund for
highway maintenance. Only the "taxe specifique" is identified in the Govern-
ment's budget. This tax lias been increased considerably over the past five
years (Table 5) and presently amounts to USe6.1/liter on gasoline and
US01.4/liter on diesel fuel.  In 1970, revenues from this tax alone amounted
to about US$14.9 million equivalent which covered all administrative and
maintenance expenditures as well as a portion of investment expenditures.
G.   Ilighway Planning
3.17      Many past investments in the highway sector have been undertaken
on an ad hoc basis and without economic analysis, largely because the DPW
did not recognize the need for planning a long-tern investment and main-
tenance program. The Transport Survey was the first attempt to give a
rational base to the highway investment program. Largely on the basis of
the recommendations contained in Phase I of the Transport Survey, the Gov-
ernment has proposed an investment program for the period 1971-1975 which
allocates a total of US$76 million equivalent for highway improvement. Of
this amount, US$55 million is for construction and improvement of about
1,000 km of primary roads, and US$21 million is for improvement of the sec-
ondary and feeder road network.
3.18      The Transport Survey identified about 1,600 km of primary road
construction and improvement whicil the consultants have estimated would
cost about US$80 million equivalent.  Since, at the present time, the Gov-
ernment has included only about 70% of this aniount in its primary road in-
vestment program, it will have to select its projects carefully in order
to assure that those with the highest priority are carried out. Feasibil-
ity studies presently underway will provide the necessary information.
During negotiations, the Government agreed that the priorities in the
highway improvement program will be established after consultation with
tlhe Bank.  The roads in the present project were both identified in the
Transport Survey as having very high priority.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project consists of the following:
(a) conistruction of the Yabayo-Duekoue-Man road, in-
cluding a branclh fromi Pinhou to Guiglo (238 km);
(b)  construction of the Ilouake-Katiola road (49 km);



- 10 -
(c) supervision by consultants of works under (a) and
(b) above; and
(d) detailed engineering of about 300 km of roads.
B.   Construction of the Yabayo-Man Road (238 km)
4.02      The Yabayo-Man road, including the branch from Pinhou to Guiglo,
will provide a more direct link between the San Pedro-Issia road being con-
structed as part of the San Pedro development project and the main popula-
tion centers in the western part of the country - Man, Duekoue, and Guiglo.
The project road crosses flat and gently rolling terrain. At present, the
section between Yabayo and Pinhou is a 141 km earth road which is unsuitable
for heavy truck traffic and is often completely impassable during the rainy
season. The Pinhou-Guiglo (19 km) and Pinhou-Man (105 km) sections are all-
weather gravel roads except for the first 6 km outside of Man which are
pavcd.
4.03      Under the project, a two-lane paved road will be constructed; the
pavement on the first 6 km outside of Man will be strengthened. While the
new road will generally follow the existing alignment, some alignment im-
provements will provide a 19 km distance reduction between Yabayo and Pinhou
and an 8 km reduction between Pinhou and Man.
4.04      Because traffic between Duekoue and Man is largely light vehicles,
that section will be given only a light pavement at this time which will
have to be strengthened later. Staged construction of this section is
clearly the most economic solution. The appropriate time for strenthening,
estimated at 10 years after completion of construction, vill have to be
determined on the basis of actual traffic volumes and observed behavior of
the pavement. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it will keep
the condition of the Duekoue-Man section under close observation and will
strengthen its pavement if and when required.
C.   Construction of the Bouake-Katiola Road (49 km)
4.05      The Bouake-Katiola road is a section of the important south-
north road which links Abidjan with the northern part of the country and
with neighboring Mali and Upper Volta. The road is paved from Abidjan to
Bouake, and the Government considers the paving of the remaining portion,
an all-weather gravel road, to be of primary importance. Paving of the
road as far as the Mali border is included in the Government's 1971-1975
investment program.
4.06      The Bouake-Katiola road crosses slightly rolling terrain.  Sur-
face conditions are generally adequate, but washboard surfaces develop during
the dry season and become quite slippery after the rainy season starts. The
new paved road will generally follow the existing alignment: one section
just south of Katiola will be straightened, shortening the distance between
the two cities by 2 km.



- 1i1 -
D.   Detailed Engineering
4.07      The project provides for the detailed engineering by consultants
of about 300 km of roads.  The roads to be engineered will be selected from
among those being studied under Phase Il of the Transport Survey, provided
that the feasibility studies, which will be completed in mid-1971, confirm
that thiey are economically justified. The most likely road to be included
is the Katiola-Badikaha road (160 km) which is the northern extension of
the Bouake-Katiola road being constructed under the present project. Other
roads presently being considered are primary roads between Badikaha and the
Mali border.
E.   Design Standards
4.08      The Governmenit recently adopted uniform design standards for all
primary roads in the country, regardless of actual traffic volumes. These
standards, which call for a 7 m wide carriageway and 2 m wide shoulders,
are suitable for roads which carry either heavy timber trucks, such as the
Yabayo-Duekoue and Pinlhou-Guiglo road sections, or substantial traffic
volumes. The Bank suggested that, for the Duekoue-Man road and the Bouake-
Katiola road, a 6 m wide carriageway would be sufficient for expected traf-
fic volumes for at least ten years. The Government believes, however, that
on the basis of savings due to different estiniates of reduced maintenance
costs and accidents, the proposed standards are optimal. After careful
review and discussions with the Government, the Bank has agreed to retain
the proposed clesign standards (Table 6) for all road sections to be con-
structed under the project, since the higlier standard roads are still eco-
nomically well justified and the difference between the economic returns
considering the two standards is very small. These standards, however,
may prove to be excessive for the traffic on some of the roads selected
for detailed engineering. During negotiations, tlhe Covernment confirmed
that it will review its policy and that design standards utilized in de-
tailed engineering or construction of roads financed with Bank assistance
will be determined on the basis of economic criteria acceptable to the Bank.

F.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.09      The estimated cost of the project, shown in detail in Table 7, is
summarized as follows:
---- CFAF million      -US$'000 equivalent-    Foreign
Local  Foreign  Total   Local  Foreign  Total  Component
Construction:

TOTAL PROJECT
COSTS               4,168   5,695   9,863  15,000  20,500  35,500         58%
4.10      The cost estimates for construction of the Yabayo-Man and Bouake-
Katiola roads are based on detailed engineering and are adequate. Taxes
and duties represent about 25% of the estimated construction costs and
account for about 55% of the local component. The total project cost es-
timate includes contingency allowances on the construction items of about
10% for possible increases in physical quantities and of about 10% for
price escalation.  The price escalation allowance is expected to cover
price increases in unit prices during construction of about 6% p.a. which
reflects the inflationary situation prevailing on the world market and the
increase in local costs expected over the three year construction period.
The annual increase of prices in the Ivory Coast was rather low before
devaluation of the CFA franc in 1969, but this situation is changing.
Minimum wage rates were raised substantially in January 1970 and the
Governanent may have to grant additional increases in the near future. It
has therefore been assumed that local prices will increase at about the
same rate as world prices.
4.11      The cost estimates for consultant services for construction
supervision and detailed engineering are based on previous Bank experience
in the Ivory Coast. A contingency allowance of about 10% has been provided



- 13 -
for time extensions; about 10% has been provided for price escalation on
consultants' services which represents an increase of 6% p.a. in costs.
4.12      The Bank will finance the foreign exchange costs estimated at
US$20.5 million; that is, 58% of total project costs or 70% of project
costs net of taxes. The foreign exchange component of construction costs
has been estimated at 55%. This estimate is based on the consultants' de-
tailed cost analyses, reviewed by the Bank. Although a foreign component
of 70% was assumed for construction under the first highway project, since
that time, better data have become available and more goods are available
locally, wages have grown substantially even at constant prices, and taxes
have increased. The foreign component of consultants' services is estimated
at 80%. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it will meet all
local costs, estimated at US$15.0 million. No difficulty is envisaged con-
cerning local cost financing, since the Government has met its financial
obligations under the first highway project promptly, and since provision
has already been made for the present project in the 1971-1973 investment
program.
4.13      Funds from the loan account will be disbursed on the following
basis:
(a)  55% of expenditures for construction which represents the
estimated foreign component; and
(b)  the foreign cost of consultants' services.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 8. Any surplus
funds remaining in the loan account upon completion of the project will be
cancelled.
G.   Execution
4.14      The DPW will be responsible for the execution of the project.  In
order to assure proper project execution, the Government agreed during nego-
tiations that it will appoint a suitably qualified engineer within the DPW
to administer the project. The Government also agreed that consultants ac-
ceptable to the Bank will be employed for construction supervision and for
detailed engineering. For supervision, the Government proposes to retain
the consultants who carried out the detailed engineering of the project
roads, Louis Berger International and SETEC. This would be satisfactory
since they are well-qualified firms anid their appointment will allow a
desirable continuity. The supervising consultants will also provide on-the-
job training for Ivorian engineers in the DPW. Signature of the consultants'
contracts for construction supervision and designation of the engineer who
will administer the project are conditions for effectiveness of the loan.
4.15      Construction will be carried out by prequalified contractors under
unit price contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding. This was confirmed during negotlations and prequalification is under-
way. Since most road construction presently underway in the Ivory Coast is



- 14 -
scheduled to be completed by tlue end of 1971, competition is expected to
be keen among contractors already in the country for the construction work.
Construction is expected to begin early in 1972. The Yabayo-Man road will
be completed in three years under two contracts awarded simultaneously.
The Bouake-Katiola road will be completed under one, two-year contract.
During negotiations, the Government confirmed tlhat adequate rfght-of-way
wîll be available to permit construction to start on schedule.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The Ivory Coast's impressive development in agriculture and
industry over the past decade has been concentrated largely tii the south-
eastern region. A major objective of present Government policy is to
broaden the economic base and stiimulate economic activity in the lesser
developed areas of the country.  Accordingly, the Governmetit's development
plans place a considerable emphasis on tlhe construction of new roads in
the southwestern region and tlhe iniprovement of road links to the north
to assure that economic developmeent in these areas is not hindered by higl
transport costs. The project, wliich is expected to yield an overall eco-
nomic return of 18%, supports the Government's strategy in this effort.
A.   The Yabayo-Man Road (238 km)
5.02      The Yabayo-Man road and its brancli to Guiglo will serve the more
populated and economically active areas of the western region. The towni of
Man (50,000 inhabitants) is the commercial center for an important agricul-
tural region (population, about 500,000) tliat produces a variety of subsis-
tence crops and about 20,000 tons of coffee, 11,000 tons of rice and somne
cocoa for outside consumption.  Guiglo, a small market town with about 6,000
inhabitants, serves an additional 100,000 people engaged in agriculture
in the surrounding area.  A number of agricultural development programs are
planned or underway in the Man and Guiglo areas, including a cocoa project
being financed by the Bank (Loan 686-IVC) wlhich lias just started. These
are expected to increase agricultural production substantially over the next
ten years.  Duekoue is a small agricultural town (8,000 inhabitants) in the
center of a forested reqion which produces about 200,000 m3 of logs annually.
An additional 250,000 mj of logs are produced each year in the area to the
west and southwest of Guiglo.
5.03      Goods for export from this region - primarily timber, coffee and
cocoa - are now transported about 500 km to Abidjan. With the opening of
the new port at San Pedro in mid-1971, timber and some general traffic will
shift to a 320 km gravel road from Duekoue, through Issia, to this port.
Timber production in the Guiglo and Duekoue regions is then expected to
increase by about one-third because the reduction in inland transport costs
will make the lower value species marketable. The project road will provide
an additional distance saving over the road to San Pedro via Issia of about
30 km, and a small volume of traffic is expected to be generated.  After 1975,
however, forest production  in this area will begin to decrease at a rate of
about 5% annually due to exhaustion of resources.



- 15 -
5.04      For purposes of analysis, the road has been divided into three
sections according to differing traffic characteristics: Yabayo-Pinhou-
Duekoue (134 km), Pinhou-Guiglo (19 km), and Duekoue-Man (85 km). In 1975,
when construction is completed, traffic on the three sections is projected
at 120 vpd, 230 vpd, and 400 vpd respectively. There is little local traffic
between Yabayo and Duekoue, and during the first two years only San Pedro
traffic will use that section. About 75% of the traffic on the Yabayo-
Duekoue section and about 25% of the traffic on the Pinhou-Guiglo section
will be heavy timber trucks. In about 1977, a road from Yabayo to Gagnoa
is expected to be completed and traffic to and from Abidjan will then also
use the project road, increasing traffic volumes on the Yabayo-Duekoue
section by about 200 vpd. Timber traffic is expected to decrease at 5%
annually after 1975, while light vehicle traffic is expected to increase at
about 10% p.a. until 1980 and at 7% p.a. thereafter.
5.05      On the basis of savings in velhicle operating costs for projected
traffic, due to improved operating conditions and distance reductions, as
well as savings in road maintenance costs, tlhe construction of the three
sections is expected to yield internal economic rates of return of 17%,
16% and 16% respectively, or 16% overall. Since the traffic projections are
based oni estimates of future agricultural and timber production, they are
probably the least certain of thie major paramneters considered in the analyses,
tliouglh they are considereci to be reasonably conservative. If, however, total
benefits were assumed to be 25% lower because of lower traffie growth rates,
sensitivity analysis shows the return on the road construction at about 13%.
If construction costs were 25% higher titan present cost estimates, the return
would be about 14%. In elther event, tlue project would bc justified. If
benefits were lower by 25%' and costs greater by 25%, the economic return
would bc about 11%.
5.06      An additional urncertainty was considered in the evaluation of the
Yabayo-Duekoue section.  lhe possibility exists of a railway being constructed
from iron ore deposits found 30 km northi of Duekoue near 13angolo, to the
coast. If sucIh a railway were built, tituiber traffic might be diverted from
tiie road to tlue railway.  Although iutensive investigations for development
of a mine are underway, when operations would begin, if at all, is very
uncertain.  The mode by wlîich the ore would be transported to San Pedro is
also in doubt. Thle conmpaniy doing the exploration work (Pickands Mather-U.S.)
has proposed a pipelinie, but thie Goverutwteitt favors a railway.  Determination
of tlhe more economic mode would require much furtlier study.  Since both fea-
sibility studies and detailed engineering for construction of the railway
still remain to be carried out, au(i any financing for both the mine and
transport mode would have to be arraiiged, it is extremely unlikely that a
railway could be in operation prior to 1977, i.e. two years after completion
of the proposed road.  If, however, iin iron mline were to be opened by 1977,
a railwav selected to transport the ore (for both of which there is no evi-
dence currentlv), and assuming all loi, traffic were diverted from the road
to the railway, tlhe proposed road constrtuctiotn would remain economically
justified withi a return estiînated .tt 11'.  Tle first year benefits expected
from construction of the Yabayo-I)t îelte section - 16% of construction costs -
also inidicate the soundness of the livestment.



- lbi 
3.   The Bouake-Katiola Road (49 km)
5.07      The project road joins Gouake, the second largest city in tie
Ivory Coast (100,000 inhabitants) and tite administrative center for the
area, witli Katiola, a small marketing towin.  It is part of the main higliway
linking Abidjan with the northern part of the country and with Upper Volta
and Mali. Though the road parallels the railway, it carries a considerable
volume of traffic, including agricultural goods such as cotton, tobacco aind
food crops from the agricultural area in the north destined for Abidjan,
and imports for the main population centers, particularly Korhogo (30,000
inlhabitants).  The Governmeat is making a special effort to encourage
economic development of the northern region. Cotton and rice production is
expected to increase considerably in tie Korhogo/Ferkessedougou region, and
crop diversification schemes include developinent of kenaf and sugar cane
production.  FED is considering the financing of a sugar refinery in
Ferkessedougou wliicli would produce about 25,000 tons of sugar annually by
1975.
5.08      Total traffic on the road in 1975 is projected at 790 vpd, of wlhich
about 55% will be passenger vehicles; 15%, sniall trucks; and 3L, trucks of
5 tons and over. The road carries no timber traffic. On thvc basis of eco-
nomic forecasts, passenger traffic is expectcd to increase by about 5% p.a.,
and gencral merchandise traffie at about 6' p.a.  Some traffic is expected
to be diverted from the railroad to road transport.
5.09      On the basis of savings in vehiclc operating costs and road main-
tenance costs, construction of the Uouake-Katiola road to paved standard
is expected to yield an internal economic return of about 26'.  As in the
case of the Yabayo-Man road, the traffic forecasts are depenldent on agri-
cultural production figures which can only be approximated. If, for sensi-
tivity purposes, benefits are assumed to be 25% lower, the rate of return
on this road remains about 21% indicating that the project is economically
sound. If construction costs were 25% higher, the rate of return would be
about 22%.
C.   Detailed Engineering
5.10      Feasibility studies for the roads which have been proposed for
detailed engineering are still in progress. All the roads being cotisldered
were identified in Phase I of the Transport Survey as having high priority.
Ile Katiola-Badikaha road is an extension of the highway from Abidjan to
the northern part of the country and is expected to have a rate of return
of over 20%. The feasibility studies for the other roads being considered
are not sufficiently advanced to give an estimate of the economic returas
at this stage.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The following are the major project matters which were discussed
and agreed between the Government and the Bank during negotiations:
(a) a study of the organization of road transport, road user
taxation, and coordination between road and rail transport
will be undertaken if the Government and the Bank deem it
necessary, based on the findings of the Transport Survey
and the experience of the departments and agencies (includ-
ing the freight offices) responsible for coordinating and
regulating road transport (para 2.14);
(b) the 10-ton axle ]Limit will be strictly enforced and
weighing stations will be installed along the new roads
to be constructed in the western part of the country which
carry timber traf.fic (para 2.15);
(c) by June 1972, an adequately-staffed unit will be established
in the DPW and will carry out traffic counts regularly (para
3.07);
(d) upon completion of SETEC's study, it will review, in con-
sultation with the Bank, the consultants' recommendations,
will implement a mutually acceptable highway maintenance
program according; to an agreed timetable, and will allocate
sufficient funds and other resources to carry out such a
program (para 3.12);
(e) priorities in the highway improvement program will be estab-
lished after consultation with the Bank (para 3.18);
(f) it will keep the condition of the Duekoue-Man road section
under close observation and will strengthen its pavement if
and when required (para 4.04);
(g) it will review its policy regarding design standards on
primary roads, and design standards utilized in detailed en-
gineering or construction of roads financed with Bank as-
sistance will be determined on the basis of economic criteria
acceptable to the Bank (para 4.08); and
(h)  it will appoint a suitably qualified engineer to administer
the project (para 4.14).
6.02      Signature of the supervising consultants' contracts and designa-
tion of the engineer who will administer the project are conditions for
effectiveness of the loan (para 4.14).
