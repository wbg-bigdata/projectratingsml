Burkina Faso and Republic of C8te d'lvoire
West Africa Pilot Community-Based Natural Resource
and Wildlife Management Project
Country/Sector Background
1.    A protectionist approach based on the establishment of national parks has domirnated
biodiversity conservation efforts in Africa during the last fifty years. So far, this strategy has
largely failed in West Africa. A lack of political commitment, inadequate financial resources,
limited potential for tourism, and conflictual situations with peripheral human populations have
meant that most of the region's protected areas are only "paper parks", with little effective
management on the ground. Denied their traditional prerogative to utilize wildlife and other wild
resources, local populations have had no incentive to manage the protected areas in a sustainable
way, or to protect them from poachers and settlers.
2.    In the C8te d'Ivoire economic growth has slowed down since the 1980s.Per capita GNP
dropped to US$715 in 1992 (and to US$510 after the 1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc). In the
same year, the current account deficit reached 12 percent of GDP and outstanding public debt
increased to 151 percent of GDP. There has been insufficient investment in local capacity
building and there is a relatively weak private sector resulting from excessive government control.
With a current annual growth rate of 3.7 percent the country's population has risen to over 12.5
million. It is estimated that half of the national population lives in urban areas.
3.    Burkina Faso is a land-locked country and, with a 1994 per capita GNP of US$300, is
one of the poorest in the world. The population is currently 9.6 million and growing at 3 percent
per annum. Agriculture is the basis of the country's economy, but past growth has been more
through the expansion of cropped areas than increased productivity. Government intervention in
the industrial and commercial sectors is being reduced and there is increasing support for the
private sector, especially in agriculture, animal production and mining. The Government aims to
reduce the public finance deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1995.
4.    The main strategic foundation for the Project in both Burkina Faso and Cate d'Ivoire is the
community-based land management (gestion des terroirs) approach that is increasingly being
adopted in the region for sustainable economic development and natural resource management.
In support of the community-based land management operations both governments are
developing new policies and legislation on decentralization, land tenure reform and the increased
participation of local communities in the management of natural resources.
5.    Land tenure in Burkina Faso is officially controlled by the Zatu An VIII 0039 of June 4,
1991. All land legally belongs to the State, but the establishment of local Community Land
Management Committees can provide the population, represented by traditional land chiefs, with
the acknowledged authority to manage their land and natural resources outside gazetted areas.



-2 -
6.    In Cote d'Ivoire land tenure effectively remains based on colonial legislation dating from
1928, 1932 and 1935. More recent legislation in 1971 had virtually no impact on the land tenure
situation. In the Project area the land legally belongs to the State. However, outside the gazetted
protected areas the powers of traditional authorities to control land use are accepted by the
population, and unofficially recognized by the local authorities.
7.    In CMte d'lvoire, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources is responsible for
agriculture, animal production, water resources and forestry, which includes wildlife management
and conservation. Work on a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) started in 1992 and the
NEAP is expected to be adopted by the Government in October 1995. The NEAP includes a
Biodiversity Conservation Strategy which promotes the involvement of local communities in all
conservation activities and the sustainable use of wildlife in non-protected areas. In 1992,
Government environmental priorities were established which include: (i) improved natural
resource management; (ii) improved public awareness and mass education; (iii) the preparation of
an Environmental Code; (iv) the promotion of ecotourism; and (v) the development of an
agricultural and land use policy based on the regeneration of basic natural resources. In May
1994, the Government decided to lift the ban on hunting, which had been in place since 1974,
once effective monitoring and control mechanisms were put into place. This change in legislation,
together with the Government's adoption of a community-based natural resource management
strategy, provides a positive policy environment for the Project. C6te d'Ivoire has ratified the
Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).
8.    In Burkina Faso the Project fits well into national strategies for community-based land
management and for the conservation of biodiversity, both described in the NEAP which was
completed in 1991. The aim in these areas is to guide migration and encourage people to settle
and develop land within a framework of sustainable natural resource management. In 1993, the
Government organized a national seminar on Wildlife Conservation Strategy which advocated a
conservation approach based on sustainable wildlife utilization. The proposed project will help to
implement the seminar's recommendations which include: (i) improving the participation of local
populations in wildlife conservation; (ii) ensuring that benefits from wildlife are available to them;
(iii) delegating responsibility for wildlife management areas outside national parks to independent
management units which would be legally recognized by the Government; and (iv) improving
cooperation with national and international non-government organizations. Burkina Faso has
ratified the CITES convention.
9.    The Project also represents an important practical test of recently adopted strategies for
natural resource management and economic development in the areas liberated from
Onchocerciasis.  Both countries recognize the weakness in the government's capacity to
implement natural resource management projects.  The Project therefore will provide an
important step in developing new strategies to increase the involvement of NGOs and the private
sector in the implementation of national projects.



-3-
Project Objectives
10.   The Project will facilitate the conservation of three areas in Burkina Faso and one in CMte
d'Ivoire within one of West Africa's most diverse and threatened ecosystems: the Comoe. It will
do this by introducing a new approach to biodiversity conservation in West Africa which aims to
find a common solution to both development and conservation concerns by involving local
communities in the sustainable, profitable exploitation of wild resources and assisting them to
manage their wild land areas for their own economic benefit and for the benefit of biodiversity.
11.   The Project's four specific objectives are:  (i)  to strengthen the capacity of local
communities, NGOs and Government to manage wild plant and animal resources in a sustainable
manner; (ii) to improve the management and use of habitat and wildlife populations at each site;
(iii) to improve local land management practices and infrastructure; and (iv) to establish a
durable system for monitoring and evaluating project implementation and impact.
Project Description
12.   GEPRENAF would be a five-year project. There are four components: (i) support for
local-level capacity building; (ii) implementation of habitat and wildlife management measures;
(iii) land management and infrastructure development; and (iv) project management, as outlined
below:
a) The Project would finance awareness building and training for local communities on village
organization, project management and planning, habitat and wildlife management, the use of
secondary forest products, anti-poaching, and monitoring and evaluation. Training will also
be provided to local government officials and project staff. Technical assistance would be
provided to village groups and associations.  Also under this component the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) would be contracted by each government to provide regular
advice, project supervision and support. This component amounts to 15 percent of total base
costs in Burkina Faso and 16 percent of total costs in CMte d'Ivoire.
b) Habitat and wildlife management operations would include the identification, zoning and
delimitation of village land and wildlife management zones, road construction, bush fire
management, anti-poaching operations, and water development. The Project would assist
communities to make better use of wildlife and secondary forest products through improved
collection, processing and marketing.  It would promote, though not directly finance,
ecotourism and safari hunting as a means of increasing local revenue from wildlife and thereby
providing incentives for conservation. This component amounts to 33 percent of total costs in
Burkina Faso and 38 percent of total base costs in CMte d'Ivoire.
c) The details of land management and infrastructure investments would be decided by the
communities with the help of specially trained project staff using the participatory planning
methodology developed by community-based land management projects (gestion des
terroirs). Possible investments would include soil and water conservation, small-scale
irrigation, animal health, improved agro-pastoral production, bee-keeping, agroforestry, roads,



- 4 -
water supplies, and the construction of dispensaries and primary schools. Labor-intensive
techniques would be used wherever possible. This component amounts to 13 percent of total
base costs in both Burkina Faso and C6te d'Ivoire.
d) The Project would finance management facilities, construction and maintenance consisting of
small office buildings at each site, the purchase and maintenance of vehicles and motor bikes,
office equipment including a computer, a small generator, audio-visual material, radios and
other necessities. This component amounts to 39 percent of total base costs in Burkina Faso
and 33 percent in Cote d'Ivoire.
13.   Within each component, the Project will finance monitoring and evaluation activities to
track project implementation and the impact of project operations. The Project will train and
employ teams of villagers to undertake regular field-level monitoring and evaluation surveys and,
where necessary, external specialists to provide technical support for the ecological monitoring
program.
Project Implementation
14.   Project organization and management systems will evolve in three phases. Progress would
depend on the rate of the development of local skills and management capacity. During Phase I,
the villages will not have the capacity to manage and implement the Project. Local Village
Organizations (VO) will therefore be supported and trained by a Technical Support Unit (TSU).
The TSU would answer to the Project Coordinator (PC) in the lead technical Ministry.
Candidates would be recruited through a process of pre-selection and competitive bidding, with
contracts being awarded to a local NGO or consultant firm, or a joint local/international
consortium of NGOs and/or consulting firms.
15.   As village-level management skills improve, Phase II would begin, with the VOs at each
site grouping themselves into informal inter-village associations, the AGEREF'. The committee
would gradually take the lead in planning and decision-making in inter-village activities. Phase In
would start once the communities at each site are ready to formalize the AGEREF. During
Phases I and II the TSU would manage project funds and be responsible for project planning and
implementation. This responsibility would be transferred to each AGEREF as soon as realistically
possible. The timing of the transition from one phase to the next would be determined by the
progress in building local capacity and institutional strength.
16.   To insure local coordination, the existing Provincial Technical Consultation Group
(PTCG) would coordinate project activities and approve village-level investments in Burkina
Faso. In CMte d'Ivoire, the PC will organize an Annual Departmental Seminar (ADS) at each site
to present the Project's activities and gather input on proposed village-level investments. At the
national level, each govemrnment would nominate a PC. Coordination will be achieved through a
National Steering Committee (NSC) comprising representative ministries in CMte d'lvoire and by a
IThe association will be known by its French acronym, AGEREF: Association pour la gestion des ressources naturelles et de
lafaune.



Consultative Group (CG) comprising interested ministries, NGOs, donors and private sector
operators in Burkina Faso. At the international level, coordination would be guided by a formal
agreement between the two countries defining cooperation on anti-poaching activities, bushfire
management and ecological monitoring. In addition, representatives of the three TSU/AGEREFs
would meet twice a year to discuss a range of common technical and operational interests.
17.   Annual work programs and budgets would form the basis for implementation and financial
management. They would be prepared by the PC in collaboration with the TSU/AGEREF and
submitted to the CG in Burkina Faso and ADSs in C6te d'Ivoire for comments and to the PTCG
in Burkina Faso and NSC in C6te d'Ivoire for approval. The proposals and budgets for
investments in village-level land improvements and socio-economic infrastructure would be based
on community land management plans. At each site IUCN would review the development of
capacity building and human resources, the management of the wildlife zones and biodiversity
conservation, animal and habitat survey and monitoring techniques, species and habitat
management, and resource utilization. IUCN would also provide advice to the government on
policy and legal aspects of the Project, and would assist in the identification of technical assistance
needs.
18.   The Project is a flexible pilot operation in which many of the investment details will be
decided by local participants during implementation.  An effective monitoring system will
consequently be very important for project management and evaluation. Monitoring indicators
would cover four major groups of factors: institutional, ecological, socio-economic and project
implementation. The organization of monitoring would initially be the responsibility of the TSU
and data collection would be done at two levels. First, simple field and village data collection
techniques would be used to collect the bulk of monitoring information.  Second, more
complicated techniques, such as aerial surveys and analyses of satellite images would be
undertaken by technical specialists contracted by the TSU.
19.   The Project will require careful and regular supervision of both its technical and
management aspects. There would be three levels of supervision. First, the PTCG and CG in
Burkina Faso and the ADS and NSC in CMte d'Ivoire would review project plans and progress.
Second, IUCN would assist and advise the TSU/AGEREFs and PCs during regular field visits.
Third, the World Bank and cofinanciers would undertake two supervision missions every year at
each site. A detailed mid-term review would be undertaken at each site during 1998. This review
would focus on: (i) habitat management and biodiversity conservation; (ii) natural resource
utilization; (iii) socio-economic development; (iv) project management and capacity building; (v)
monitoring and evaluation; and (vi) an analysis of the viability of the underlined project strategy.
Project Sustainability
20.   The Project is designed to be ecologically, economically and institutionally sustainable. A
major investment in capacity building and the direct participation of the local communities in
project management creates institutional sustainability. The implementation of a series of habitat
improvement and resource management techniques assures ecological stability. The establishment



-6 -
of profitable wild resource utilization operations which channel the benefits directly to the
population would provide economic sustainability.
Lessons From Past Experiences
21.   The Project draws heavily on lessons learnt from previous experiences in West Africa with
participative natural resource management. This has concentrated mostly on soil, pasture and
forest resources with little attention paid to biodiversity. Although some examples of community-
based wildlife management are available in Africa, they are mostly from southern Africa. There is,
however, one important West African example, the Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso. The
main lessons from these experiences are that: (i) habitat and wildlife population rehabilitation is
technically possible in areas as small as 100,000 ha.; (ii) community-based wildlife management is
an effective form of habitat improvement and biodiversity conservation; (iii) sustainability depends
on building-up local ownership of the Project through the generation of tangible benefits for the
community; and (iv) revenue-sharing mechanisms must be clearly defined and operated in a
transparent and accountable manner. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the
proposed project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement and GEF Funding
22.   The northern Comoe is one of the largest and most biologically diverse ecosystems in
West Africa. Biodiversity in the areas that remain pristine is threatened due to growing human
pressure, associated with high imrmigration, land-extensive agriculture and uncontrolled hunting.
The Project will address this key issue for biodiversity conservation in an innovative way by
testing a participatory method for sustainable wildlife utilization, community-based natural
resource management and biodiversity conservation. It will have an important local impact, but
also could serve as a model for similar conservation activities elsewhere in the region. Although
there is considerable national interest in the Project and its strategy, a basic lack of resources
means that this type of pilot project would not be financed from existing government budgets in
the near future. The proposed Project has already started to play an important role in promoting
practical regional cooperation for biodiversity conservation, and would significantly contribute to
local and regional human resource development in the fields of rural development and biodiversity
conservation. In both countries the Project provides investment opportunities directly
related to the concerns of sustainable development and improved environmental
management, which are important features of each Country Assistance Strategy for
Burkina Faso (May 1994) and Cote d'Ivoire (June 1994).
Agreed Actions
23.   During appraisal, agreements were reached with the governments of Burkina Faso and
Cote d'Ivoire on the institutional arrangements and the definition of the responsibilities of the
communities, the government, NGOs and the private sector in the Project.  In addition,
agreements were obtained on the TORs and recruitment schedule of each TSU, procedures for
managing the benefit stream, the methodology for determining natural resource off-take rates and
fees, monitoring indicators, the TORs for IUCN, and procurement procedures.



-7 -
24.   For Burkina Faso, the following agreements were reached prior to or at negotiations: the
draft contracts and the short-list for the recruitment of key Technical Support Unit staff,
satisfactory to the Trustee, were finalized; a Government statement satisfactory to the Trustee for
the establishment of Village Organizations was issued; a standard schedule of procurement and
the nomination of a National Project Coordinators satisfactory to the Trustee were agreed upon;
finally, the procedures for financial management and account, the TORs and the short list of
external auditors satisfactory to the Trustee, were agreed upon. Grant effectiveness would be
conditional on the opening of a Project account with an initial deposit of CFA 25,000,000; the
completion of the selection of the TSU staff whose qualifications will be agreeable to the Trustee;
the establishment of satisfactory draft standard bidding documents; adoption of a satisfactory
Project Implementation Manual satisfactory to the Trustee, and the establishment of procedures
for financial management and an accounting system consistent with the Implementation Manual,
the appointment of external auditors agreeable to the Trustee; and the signature of a technical
assistance contract with IUCN to provide support to project implementation Furthermore, Grant
effectiveness will be conditional on the fulfillment of all conditions required for the effectiveness
of the Belgian Grant Agreement
25.   For C8te d'Ivoire, the following agreements were reached prior to or at negotiations: the
draft contracts and the short-list for the recruitment of key Technical Support Unit staff
satisfactory to the Trustee were finalized; a Govemment statement satisfactory to the Trustee for
the establishment of Village Organizations was issued; a standard schedule of procurement, and
the nomination of a National Project Coordinators satisfactory to the Trustee were agreed upon.
Additionally, the Government of C8te d'Ivoire ratified the Rio Convention on Biodiversity and
signed an agreement on the control of the institution in charge of the Project over the Kinkene
and Warigue Gazetted Forests, and agreed that forest guards from the Comoe National Park
would participate in GEPRENAF implementation. Grant effectiveness would be conditional on
the opening of a Project account with an initial deposit of USS100,000 equivalent; completion of
the recruitment of the TSUs' community-based land management specialist and the conservation
and wildlife specialist whose qualifications will be satisfactory to the Trustee; the establishment of
draft standard bidding documents agreeable to the Trustee and the adoption of a satisfactory
Project Implementation Manual satisfactory to the Trustee; and the signature of a contract with
IUCN for technical support to the Recipient, the TSUs and the AGEREFs. Furthermore, Grant
effectiveness will be conditional on the fulfillment of all conditions required for the effectiveness
of the Belgian Grant Agreement
26.   At negotiations the government indicated its intention to proceed with the establishment
and signature of a trans-frontier coordination agreement on anti-poaching and bushfire control.
Environmental and Social Aspects
27.   The Project will have a positive environmental impact through biodiversity conservation,
improved habitat quality and productivity, and increased animal numbers. There will be no
resettlement of the population under the Project, as the alignment of the wildlife management
zones will avoid conflict between existing cultivation and biodiversity protection. The Project is
not expected to have any negative environmental impact. However, each TSU/AGEREF must be



- 8 -
vigilant to ensure that resource exploitation is sustainable, that the improvement of local access
does not lead to increased settlement, that the interests of pastoral communities with rights to use
the area are not jeopardized, and that land management and infrastructure investments have no
negative environmental impact. The Project is placed in Category "B" for environmental impact.
28.   The Project is not expected to have any serious long-term  negative social impacts,
although some short-term losses will be experienced by families currently involved in commercial
hunting, and there are potential medium-term losses for those involved in extensive yam
cultivation. The Project will provide a framework to assist in local conflict resolution. The
participative diagnostic methodology used by the Project will ensure that minority and politically
marginalised groups, such as women, newly arrived migrants and landless people, are able to
express their needs and concerns, and be involved in the overall planning process and sharing of
benefits.
Project Benefits
29.   The main environmental benefit is the initiation of a process for community-based natural
resource management and biodiversity conservation in 480,000 ha of the Comoe ecosystem. In
addition, future efforts in biodiversity conservation in the two nations will benefit from a field-
tested model for a conservation and development strategy that could be replicated elsewhere.
Social benefits include: (i) improved physical security through the control of poaching and illegal
grazing; (ii) improved security of land and natural resource tenure; (iii) increased decentralized
management powers and capacity; (iv) better quality of life through improved social infrastructure
and revenues; and (v) improved planning, technical and management skills. The economic and
financial benefits of the Project will be: (i) increased sustainable income from wildlife and wild
lands resource utilization; (ii) improved community land management; and (iii) improved
agricultural production.
Risks
30.   The Project has four important risks. The first is uncontrolled migration. It is a risk for all
natural resource management projects in the region, but the gestion des terroirs strategy is
designed to limit this risk. Second, are risks associated with the lack of capacity to manage the
wildlife zones. These include: (i) the continued expansion of agriculture; (ii) poor control of
poaching; (iii) poor control of grazing; (iv) monopolization of project benefits by groups or
individuals; and (v) lack of inter-community cooperation. The major emphasis by the Project on
local capacity building, strengthening of anti-poaching activities and the initial technical assistance
input are specifically designed to minimize this risk. The third risk relates to the difficulty of
ensuring that safari hunting standards will be enforced by the governments. Careful project
supervision and review of contracts will minimize this risk. Finally, there is the risk of waning
local interest if the communities do not get immediate benefits from project operations. This risk
is minimized by ensuring early and effective benefits from resource exploitation activities, and
through the implementation of a range of infrastructure development and agro-sylvo-pastoral
support activities.

After Project
31.   As a pilot project, one of GEPRENAF's objective is to set up a conservation model
designed to be sustainable within five years. As such, a second phase should not be necessary.
After the end of the Project, other projects may continue to support activities at the GEPRENAF
sites. In particular, the National Protected Area Management Project that is being identified in
RCI is expected to finance activities in the periphery of the Comoe National Park where the
GEPRENAF sites are located.
32.   Should GEPRENAF's model be successful and viable, it could oe replicated in other
locations in the region. The Second Forestry Sector Project, for which preparation is about to
begin in RCI, could apply a similar model for Savanna Gazetted Forests. The GEF needs to
closely monitor the progress of GEPRENAF and remain open to financing similar projects
elsewhere in the region. Suitable sites exist near Odienne in RCI; around the Pendjari Benin and
Burkina Faso; in the Bafing area of Mali; in the Faleme area of Senegal; in the Fouta Djallon
mountains of Guinea; and near the W park in Niger. Already, GEPRENAF has had a significant
impact in the region. The Nazinga Game Ranch, on which GEPRENAF was initially modeled, is
being rehabilitated by the Burkina Government with funds from UNDP/GEF and the Government
is using the GEPRENAF as a model for its new Nazinga design.

THE PROJECT
A. Project Description
1.          The Project will support three pilot land management and biodiversity
conservation operations using a community-based land and natural resource management strategy
which has been successfully tested in the region. It will contribute to the conservation of a rich
West African ecosystem (see Appendix I for a description of the sites' biodiversity) by developing
a profitable and sustainable model for community-based natural resources utilization (see
Appendix 2 for a description of the people living on the sites). The Project has four components:
(i) support for local-level capacity building; (ii) implementation of habitat and wildlife
management measures; (iii) land management and infrastructure development; and (iv) project
management.
2.          Local Capacity Building:  The Project would finance local institutions and
capacity building, through training, technical assistance and supervision. The training component
will finance over 250 training sessions at each site. This would involve 119 weeks of training for
2,200 villagers, 36 weeks of training for the members of the Village and Inter-village
Associations, and technical and managerial training for 77 government staff. The training would
include awareness building, planning, habitat and wildlife management, the use of secondary forest
products, safari support techniques and monitoring and evaluation.
3.           At each site the Project would finance supervision support through the services of
the World Conservation Union (IUCN) contracted to the governments. This would entail four
man-months of supervision each year. An additional 15 man-months of short-term international
technical assistance and 4 man-months of local technical assistance would be financed at each site.
4.    Habitat and Wildlife Management activities will start with the identification and
delimitation of village terroirs and the wildlife management and village agro-sylvo-pastoral
management zones. It is provisionally estimated that in the adjacent sites of Diefoula in Burkina
Faso and Warigue in Cote d'Ivoire, the total wildlife management zone will cover approximately
195,000 ha and in C6te d'Ivoire Monts Tingui site, about 116,000 ha (approximately 65 percent
of the total project area in the three sites; see maps). Once final zoning and delimitation is
completed, the Project will finance habitat management activities designed to improve the quality
and quantity of vegetative cover, improve the availability of water and mineral salts in the area,
undertake anti-poaching activities and control the use of the areas' natural resources. One hundred
and fifty kms of all-weather earth roads in C6te d'Ivoire and 100 kms in Burkina Faso would be
rehabilitated and up to 500 kms of temporary tracks in Cote d'lvoire and 200 in Burkina Faso
would be constructed. Bush fires would be managed through the establishment of a network of
fire breaks and an early burning program. Anti-poaching patrols would be undertaken by groups
of village auxiliaries supported by four armed Forest Service personnel at each site. The anti-
poaching work would be facilitated by a network of guard posts. Seven small dams (five in Cote
d'Ivoire and two in Burkina Faso) will be developed from seasonal water holes. Salt licks will be
established and improved at all sites.

5.          The Technical Support Unit (TSU) financed by the Project will help the population
better exploit, more profitably and in a more sustainable way, a range of natural resources, and
forest product processing and marketing. The Project would finance professional analysis of the
potential for developing a range of commercial activities, such as the collection and sale of honey
and medicinal plants, the collection and processing of natural dies and tannins, and the
exploitation of indigenous plants as a source of natural food colorant. Where potential is
indicated, the Project would provide initial financial support to communities to establish trial
commercial operations.
6.           The Project Management Team will encourage the development of safari hunting
and ecotourism, but the Project will not directly finance these activities. This will be undertaken
by private sector operators who would benefit from project-financed infrastructure, but would not
be directly supported by the Project. The Project will finance a series of monitoring and control
activities that are essential to ensure that the resource off-take quotas are effectively established
and respected, that local and national hunting regulations are adhered to, and that all important
game species populations are carefully monitored.
7.           Land Management and Infrastructure Development:   Community-based
village land management plans would be prepared and the Project would finance part of the
implementation costs of improved land management and infrastructure development. The
population will a:so be required to contribute (see para. 36). The details of the investments at
each site will be determined by the communities themselves. Possible activities include, but would
not be limited to, soil conservation, small-scale irrigation, animal health, improved agro-pastoral
techniques, rangeland management, bee-keeping, agroforestry, vegetable production, roads and
water supplies. A summary of possible investments in this component is provided in Appendix 3.
Investment in land management and social infrastructure would average US$40,000 per village
over the five year peniod2.
8.           Project Management: At each site the Project will finance the construction and
maintenance of a small office buildings and accommodation, vehicles and motor bikes, office
equipment including a computer, a small generator, audio-visual equipment, radios and other
essential equipment.  To ensure fully participatory management and commitment by all
stakeholders, an annual project planning workshop would be held using a suitable participatory
planning technique.
9.           Monitoring and Evaluation: Within each component, the Project will finance
monitoring and evaluation activities that will track project implementation and the institutional,
ecological, socio-economic impact of project operations. The Project will train and employ teams
of villagers to undertake regular systematic field-level monitoring and evaluation surveys and,
where necessary, external specialists to provide technical support for the ecological monitoring
program. Details on the monitoring and evaluation program and indicators are provided in
Appendix 6.
2 Ihe GEPRENAF will only finance part of these investments.

10.         Links With Other World Bank-Supported Operations:  Project staff will
maintain close links with the national community-based land management project in Burkina Faso
(PNGT) and in C6te d'Ivoire (PNGTER). These projects will be an important source of
technical, managerial and strategic advice to GEPRENAF. The Project also has strong links with
the Bank-supported National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) that already exists in Burkina
Faso and which is under preparation in C6te d'Ivoire. The Project's ecological monitoring system
will be linked with the existing national environmental monitoring programs in each country. It
also has links with the World Bank-supported program to eradicate River Blindness in the region,
particularly recent efforts to develop policies to ensure the sustainable economic development and
environmental management in the Oncho-freed areas. At a meeting held in Paris in May, 1994
eleven governments of the Oncho-freed region accepted community-based land management
approach as the basis for sustainable development and natural resource management in the
Oncho-freed zones. The proposed project will adopt this approach, but will also extend it to
include a range of wild resources.
11.         Also, in Cote d'Ivoire, the Project will be closely coordinated, under a common
program, with: (i) the protected area component of the Bank Forestry Sector Project (PSF),
which is about to be implemented at Comoe, Azagny and Mont Peko National Parks; and (ii) the
National Protected Area Management Project (PCGAP), which is currently being identified.
PCGAP's objectives would be: (i) to provide the Government of C8te d'Ivoire with the capacity
to efficiently manage the national protected areas system; and (ii) to implement development
action plans in selected national parks and adjacent areas. It is expected that GEPRENAF will
contribute to the development of a suitable model for buffer zone management of the Comoe
National Park that can be replicated by PCGAP.
B. Proiect ImiDlementation
Project Organization and Management
12.         Phasing:  Project organization and management systems will evolve in three
phases, and will need to maintain a very high degree of flexibility during implementation. During
Phase I, the focus will be on Village Organizations (VO, para. 15) which would be assisted at
each site by the Technical Support Unit (TSU, para. 18). As village-level management skills
improve, project organization would enter the transitional Phase II, during which VOs at each site
would organize themselves into an informal group which would be the precursor of a formal inter-
village association (informal AGEREF3, para. 16). This is expected to start at the end of the
second year of project implementation, but the actual date would depend on progress in the field.
Phase III would start approximately one year later with the formalization of the AGEREF . The
structure and organization of both the VOs and AGEREFs may need to be modified to
incorporate practical lessons learnt during project implementation. During Phases I and II, the
TSU will manage project funds and be responsible for project planning and implementation. This
3 The association will be known by its French acron,vm, AGEREF: Association pour la gestion des ressources naturelles et de
lafaune.



- 20 -
responsibility would be handed over to each AGEREF as soon as that is realistically possible. The
evolution of the organization of the Project is presented in a diagram in Appendix 8.
13.         The transition from one phase to the next would depend on the development of
local skills and management capacity; advance from one stage to the next would therefore be
determined by achievement rather than a fixed time-table. The criteria for deciding when advance
is possible would include: (i) planning and technical capacity; (ii) proven financial management
and accounting skills; (iii) effective local leadership; and (iv) a high degree consensus within the
group.
14.         Annual Planning and Programs: The proposals and budgets for investments in
village-level land improvements and socio-economic infrastructure would be based on the gestion
des lerroirs plan proposed by the VO assisted by the TSU. Annual work programs and budgets
would form the basis for technical implementation and financial management. They would be
prepared by the Project Coordinator (PC, para. 22) in collaboration with the TSU/AGEREF and
submitted to the Consultative Group (CG, para. 23) in Burkina Faso and to the Annual
Departmental Seminar (ADS, para. 24) in C6te d'Ivoire for comments. Approval would be issued
by the Provincial Technical Consultation Group (PTCG, para. 23) in Burkina Faso and National
Steering Committee (NSC, para. 25) in C6te d'Ivoire.
15.         Institutional Arrangements:  The Village Organizations (VOs) would be
established after an initial period of awareness building and training. To as great an extent as
possible they would be based on existing traditional institutions, and should be designed according
to the situation in each village, to limit any potential conflict with other traditional structures. The
management team of each VO would include a President, Treasurer and Secretary, each with an
assistant, and three villagers nominated as local counterparts to the TSU. The three counterpart
villagers would focus on: (i) rural development; (ii) wildlife and habitat management; and (iii)
coordination with other villages. Each VO management team would include representatives of all
resource user groups, including migrants as well as long-term residents, hunters and pastoralists,
as well as farmers. Women would be specifically represented. The VO management teams would
be open, by invitation of the villages, to groups outside the Project area with a vested interest in
the Project.
16.         The Associations for Management of Natural Resources and Wildlife (AGEREF)
at each site are needed, as the wildlife management zones span the terroirs of a number of
different villages, and are best managed as a single cohesive unit. The informal AGEREF would
provide an in.tial framework for cooperation between the villages at each site. This would be
transformed into a formal AGEREF once the villagers have improved their management skills and
appreciate the need for inter-village cooperation. Two representatives from each village would
form the General Assembly of the AGEREF and would elect a President, Treasurer, Executive
Secretary, Wildlife Zone Manager, Inter-Village Coordinator and a Wildlife Utilization Manager.
Until local capacity is effectively developed and the post can be filled by a member of the
community, the team leader of the TSU would act as Executive Secretary to the AGEREF.



- 21 -
17.         The VOs and AGEREFs would act as independent private, non-profit bodies .o:
(i) promote local management capacity; (ii) coordinate the implementation of project
interventions; (iii) ensure coordination between the different actors at the local level; and (iv)
administer and distribute project benefits to local communities according io an agreed formula.
Each village would conclude a management agreement, initially with the TSU and subsequently
with the AGEREF, to describe the rights and responsibilities of each party, including: (i) the use
of the classified forests; (ii) the adoption of improved land use and production practices; (iii)
control and supervision of the management of village hunting zones; (iv) support for agro-sylvo-
pastoral development; and (v) the system for distributing project income to the population.
18.         The Technical Support Unit (TSU) would assist the VOs and the AGEREF at
each site. This is necessary because of the limited initial management capacity of the VOs and
AGEREFs. The TSU would be recruited under contract to the Government and would report to
the PC. It would initially be staffed by technical specialists from outside the communities. The
role and responsibilities of each TSU would be defined in the terms of a contract agreed with the
Government. As the Project progresses and local capacity increases, community members within
the AGEREF would replace TSU members as available skills permit. The role of the TSUs would
be to: (i) organize community training and capacity building; (ii) develop an information and
public awareness program; (iii) organize the implementation of habitat and wildlife management
operations; (iv) establish community-based habitat and wildlife survey systems; define criteria and
controls for an effective off-take quota system, (v) organize field level monitoring and evaluation;
(vi) train local counterparts; (vii) assist in the creation and operation of the AGEREF; (viii) ensure
effective coordination with local administration and government services; and (ix) negotiate - on
behalf of the VOs and AGEREF - contracts with private operators.
19.         The TSU would comprise: (i) a community-based land management specialist; (ii)
a conservation and wildlife specialist; (iii) an accountant/administrator; (iv) a mobile extension
team (three people for the first two years, reduced thereafter to one person); (v) an anti-poaching
assistant; (vi) a monitoring assistant; and (vii) a secretary and two drivers. The Team Leader
would be chosen from one of the two technical specialists. The TSU staff would be recruited
after a process of careful pre-selection and adherence to World Bank guidelines for hiring
consultants. The contracts would be awarded to a local NGO or consulting firm, or a joint
local/international consortia of NGOs and/or consulting firms. It is expected that the majority of
the TSU personnel would be national specialists. It is, however, possible that suitably qualified
and experienced national candidates for the post of conservation and wildlife specialist may not be
easily identified. This program of support is in line with the World Bank's Africa Region
Guidelines on the use of technical assistance.
20.         The World Conservation Union (IUCN , under contractual arrangement with each
government, would provide regular, periodic technical supervision and advice to the two
governments and the three TSU/AGEREFs. This is necessary because GEPRENAF is a complex
and innovative project and because experience in this type of operation is, inevitably, limited.
IUCN is well placed to assume this role as it is the leading technical international NGO in
biodiversity conservation. It will draw on the staff of its established base of international



-22 -
programs4 to provide technical supervision and advice. IUCNs contact with other similar
operations in Africa and throughout the world would contribute to the effective use of available
knowledge and information, and enhance the rapid transfer of lessons from one region to another.
IUCN would operate at two levels. Firstly, as advisors to the TSU, and subsequently to the
AGEREF, IUCN representatives would review progress and advise on: (i) capacity building and
human resource development; (ii) management of the biodiversity zones and wildlife areas; (iii)
anima! and habitat survey, and monitoring and evaluation techniques; (iv) species and habitat
management; and (v) sustainable resource utilization and exploitation techniques. Secondly,
IUCN would provide advice to the two governments, through their national project coordinators,
on project supervision, policy, legislation, institutional and human resource development issues
related to the Project.
21.         The governments in both countries would have overall responsibility for project
implementation through the appropriate technical ministry: The Ministry of Environment and
Water (MEE) in Burkina Faso and the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources
(MINAGRA) in C6te d'Ivoire. Each Government would be responsible for: (i) overall financial
administration, project monitoring, evaluation and supervision; (ii) the review of national policy
and legislation relating to the implementation of the Project; (iii) arranging concession of the
classified areas to the AGEREFs and negotiation of management contracts; (iv) support to village
auxiliary patrols in the arrest and prosecution of poachers; (v) trans-frontier coordination; and (vi)
control of professional hunting standards.  In addition, the two national natural resource
management projects (PNGTER and PNGT) would provide technical support to the AGEREFs
and the TSU when needed..
22.         A Project Coordinator (PC) would be nominated by the ministry responsible for
wildlife in the respective countries.  Each PC would coordinate:  (i) overall financial
administration, project monitoring, evaluation and supervision; (ii) the review of national policy
and legislation relating to the implementation of the Project; (iii) arranging concession of the
classified areas to the AGEREFs and negotiation of management contracts; (iv) support to village
auxiliary patrols in the arrest and prosecution of poachers; (v) trans-frontier coordination; and (vi)
control of professional hunting standards. The PC would elaborate the annual work plans and
budgets in collaboration with the TSUs, VOs and AGEREFs. Also, the PC would facilitate
coordination with other projects with relevance to GEPRENAF (PNGT in Burkina Faso,
PNGTER in CMte d'Ivoire). In Burkina Faso, the PC would be based in the regional Wildlife
Directorate in Banfora. In C6te d'Ivoire, the PC would be based in Abidjan. He/she would
belong to a local team at the Directorate for the Protection of Nature (DPN) in charge of
supervising Bank projects related to conservation.
23.         In Burkina Faso, information sharing would be facilitated through an informal
Consultative Group (CG) including interested ministries, NGOs, donors and private sector
operators. Groups not directly involved in the Project, but active in the field of biodiversity
conservation and natural resource management, would be invited to participate in the meetings.
4(i) Sustainable Use of Wildlife Program; (ii) Social Policy Service Program; (iii) Biodiversity Program; (iv) Environmental
Law Centre; (v) Species Survival Commission; and (vi) National Parks and Protected Areas Program.



- 23 -
The purpose of the CG would be to establish a forum for the exchange of information relating to
the Project. It would have no authority or responsibility for project planning and decision-
making. The ministry responsible for wildlife in each country would be chair the CG and the
secretariat would be assured by the PC. The CG would meet at least once a year. The existing
Provincial Consultation Group (PTCG) would review and approve village-level investments',
approve annual work plans and budgets as well as the progression of the Project from one phase
to another. It would also ensure that project investments complement existing development plans
and that there is no duplication of effort and investments. The committee would be chaired by the
senior local administrator (Haut Commissaire) with a secretariat for matters relating to the Project
provided by the PC. The PTCG would meet every trimester.
24.         In C6te d'Ivoire, Annual Departmental Seminars (ADSs) would be organized in
each Department (Ferkessedougou for Warigue and Dabakala for Monts Tingui) by the PC to
gather input on the Project's annual work program and budget. The seminar would be chaired by
the local senior administrator (Prefet) with a secretariat provided by the PC. The seminar would
be open to the technical services interested in the various GEPRENAF components (Agricultural
and Planning Services, Directorate of Tourism, etc.), NGOs working on related projects in the
area, representatives of the AGEREF and the TSU, and elected political representatives. The
objective is to provide a forum to comment openly on annual work and investment plans, to verify
that project investments complement existing development plans, and to avoid duplication of
effort and investments. A National Steering Committee (NSC) would be the principal authority
for project management. It would review and approve village-level investments, the annual work
plan and budgets as well as the progression of the Project from one phase to another. It would
consist of representative ministries and would be chaired by the ministry responsible for wildlife
with the secretariat assured by the PC. The NSC would meet at least once a year.
Coordination
25.         At each project site, day-to-day coordination would be the responsibility of the
TSU/AGEREF.  Particular site-specific coordination needs include, for Burkina Faso,
operational cooperation with the proposed Koflande Game Ranch to the north of the Project area
and, for the two C6te d'Ivoire sites, cooperation with the authorities of the Comoe National Park
(see map of the general area). Cooperation would include anti-poaching operations, ecological
monitoring, and training and extension work with villages. At the national level, each PC would
facilitate coordination with other projects with relevance to GEPRENAF (PNGT in Burkina Faso,
PNGTER in C6te d'Ivoire).
26.         Coordination at the national level in Burkina Faso would be facilitated through
the informal Consultative Group (CG). The purpose of the CG would be to establish a forum for
the exchange of information relating to the Project. At the local level the existing Provincial
Consultation Group (PTCG) would coordinate GEPRENAF activities with other projects in the
region to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication of efforts.
5By appraisal the PTCG has started working at Banfora in Burkina Faso. Seminars have already been organized with
departmental representatives at Ferkessedougou and Dabakala in Cote d'Ivoire for the other two sites.



- 24 -
27.         In Cote d'Ivoire, at the national level, the National Steering Committee (NSC)
would review and approve the annual work plan and budgets. At the local level the Annual
Departmental Seminar (ADS) would be organized to provide a forum to comment openly on
annual work and investment plans, to coordinate with existing development plans and to avoid
duplication of effort and investments.
28.         At the international level coordination would be guided by a formal agreement
between the two countries paying particular attention to cooperation on anti-poaching, bushfire
management and ecological monitoring. In addition, representatives of the three TSU/AGEREFs
would meet regularly to discuss: (i) developing compatible plans for habitat and wildlife
development, anti-poaching, bush-fire management, use of secondary forest products, commercial
and subsistence hunting, and ecotourism; and (ii) exchanging information on habitat and wildlife
management, training, socio-economic development, popular participation, and land and resource
tenure problems.
Capacity Building
29.         An analysis of training needs has led to the development of a detailed training
program which includes all those involved with the Project (communities, local leaders, local
administrators, and technical staff).  The details of this program  are presented in the
Implementation Manual. The TSU would have overall responsibility for organizing the training
program, and would recruit suitably qualified groups and individuals to present the various
modules. The mobile extension teams would include one trainer who would undertake village-
level training aimed at local capacity-building, planning and project management. Selection of the
individuals to receive training would be undertaken by the TSUs for village-level training, and by
the PTCG in Burkina Faso and PC in Cote d'Ivoire for the other levels.
Habitat and Wildlife Management
30.         The identification of village terroirs, and the determination of wildlife management
zones and agro-sylvo-pastoral zones would be undertaken by the communities, supported by the
TSU, using the participative rural appraisal techniques increasingly employed by gestion des
terroirs projects in the region (see Appendix 3 for details). The preparation of village land
management plans would include details of the development of the wildlife management zone.
Through this process the specific and agreed undertaking of the community to manage wild
resources would be clearly stated.  Through the plan, progress on habitat and wildlife
management would be contractually linked to the provision of social infrastructure and other
socio-economic benefits. The plan would also include the identification of pastoral zones, where
necessary, and the corridors for transhumant livestock.
31.         The wildlife management zone would be selected to ensure the greatest potential
for habitat and wildlife management, and minimal disturbance of, and by, human activity. There
are no villages nor cultivation currently inside the areas initially identified for the potential wildlife
management zones. There will therefore be no resettlement. The majority of habitat management
work would be undertaken by local villagers under contract to the TSU/AGEREF. Labor-



- 25 -
intensive techniques would be used wherever possible. Where necessary, local contractors would
be engaged to design and supervise work on the more complicated structures, such as drifts at
river crossings. In most of the wildlife management zones the natural vegetation is still in good
condition and only limited direct rehabilitation work is necessary. Effective protection from
uncontrolled fires, uncontrolled grazing and uncontrolled hunting would do a great deal to
improve the current situation. It will be particularly important to ensure effective protection for
the areas of gallery forest and forest islands that are highly valuable as biodiversity "hot spots".
The bush fire control program would encourage the ecologically positive aspects of controlled,
low-heat early season fires and avoid the destructive aspects of uncontrolled, high intensity late
season fires. Day-to-day organization of anti-poaching patrols would be the responsibility of the
TSU/AGEREF but under the authority and overall supervision of the local Forest Service officer
currently responsible for anti-poaching activities in the area. It will be very important to link the
anti-poaching operations at the three sites with an effective regional program.
32.          The exploitation of indigenous plants has a potential that requires specialized
research and development. The Project would obtain technical guidance on the exploitation of the
medicinal plants of the area from the Traditional Pharmacopoeia Center at Banfora Hospital and
on developing the potential for exploiting traditional plant sources of dyes and tannins from a
specialized research unit at the University of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Potential commercial
outlets in Europe and North America will be explored. Improvements in traditional hunting would
be achieved by training hunters to better organize, select age and sex of prey, and replace the non-
selective snares and gin-traps. Annual off-take rates for the most numerous species would be 20
percent of the estimated annual increment of the species. It is, however, unlikely that this quota
could be effectively imposed during the early years of the Project.
33.          Although not directly financed under the Project, the development of safari hunting
would be a long-term operation that would provide important revenue to local communities, and
thus a strong incentive to manage the habitat and wildlife populations in a sustainable way. This
activity would be implemented by professional, commercial guides contracted to the
TSU/AGEREF. A substantial part of the profits from this operation would go to the villages.
The trophy and area fees would be payable to the local communities. Safari hunting is already a
well-established commercial activity in Burkina Faso. In CMte d'Ivoire it has not been a legal
activity for twenty years, though the decision has now been taken to lift the ban once certain
conditions are fulfilled. Despite relatively low animal numbers, selective off-take of certain
species would be possible in the second year of project operations. After initial pre-selection, the
contract for hunting concessions and for possible ecotourism activities would be let through
competitive bidding. It will be of the utmost importance that the highest possible professional
standards are maintained. The TSU/AGEREFs and IUCN would have important roles in
respectively organizing and supervising the process of letting these contracts and monitoring
progress. However, the responsibility for overall control of professional standards lies with the
government of each country.

Social Infrastructure
34.          Infrastructure development outside the wildlife management zones is a high
priority for the population in the Project area, and will provide essential support to the habitat and
wildlife management operations. Using the gestion des terroirs strategy, village land management
plans would be prepared which indicate local priorities for agro-sylvo-pastoral and socio-
economic development. Investment in land management and infrastructure development would
be linked to progress with habitat management and biodiversity conservation through the village
land management plans. The plans would include details of monitoring criteria and procedures,
and the identification of mechanisms to adjust the management plan as a result of feed-back from
the monitoring system.
35.          The details of land management and infrastructure development activities would be
determnined by the communities themselves. Once specific activities have been identified and
agreed upon by the VOs, within the framework of a village land management plan, the TSU
would contact the PTCG in Burkina Faso and the NSC in Cote d'Ivoire to obtain approval of the
plan. The TSU would then identify and contact appropriate local contractors. Depending on the
type of investment this could be either a government service (e.g., agricultural extension,
veterinary service, education), a non-government organization or a private contractor. The final
details of implementation would be determined during discussions between the community, the
TSU and the executing agency. The contractor would prepare detailed cost proposals for
approval by the TSU and the VO. The TSU would also review the proposals for possible
negative environmental impact, and propose any necessary mitigating actions.
36.          All communities would contribute towards the costs of land management and
infrastructure investment by providing unqualified labor and eventually contributing to the
financing the operation. The level of contribution of each village would be determined by its
revenue level from  the Project's natural resource exploitation activities.  Three levels of
contribution are proposed:
Level             Average annual per capita                   Contributions
revenue from Project
I                 Less than 2,000 CFAF        20 percent of labor requirements
No cash contribution
2             From 2,000 CFAF to 6,000 CFAF   20 percent of labor requirements
_Up to 5 percent of investment cost
3                 More than 6,000 CFAF        20 percent of labor requirements
Up to 10 percent of investment cost
Monitoring and Evaluation
37.          GEPRENAF is a flexible pilot operation in which many of the details of
implementation will be decided by the local participants during implementation. This means that
effective monitoring is particularly important, and mechanisms will need to be established to
ensure that lessons learnt are effectively applied in the field. The factors to be monitored include:



- 27 -
(a)   Institutional - (i) village groups' management capacity; (ii) AGEREF's
management capacity; (iii) rates of replacement of the initial TSU staff by local
personnel; (iv) effectiveness of anti-poaching operations, control of grazing and
logging; (v) level of participation by village groups in project activities; (vi)
efficiency and local perceptions of the benefits distribution system;
(b)   Ecological - (i) changes in numbers and distribution of animals and herd
composition; (ii) records of animals and plants exploited; (iii) changes in
vegetation; (iv) changes in numbers of indicator species; (v) changes in land use
and production systems;
(c)   Socio-economic - (i) crop and livestock yields and prices; (ii) changes in family
income and employment; (iii) changes in attitudes to the management of natural
resources; (iv) immigration patterns in each village terroir; and (v) gender-related
impact on access to benefits and influence on management decisions.
(d)   Project implementation - (i) details of use of funds, audit of accounts,
procurement and disbursement; (ii) implementation of habitat improvement, land
management and infrastructure development programs; and (iii) execution of
contracts with private sector operators.
38.          The organization of the monitoring program would initially be the responsibility of
each TSU, which would be required to produce regular quarterly monitoring reports. Data
collection would be undertaken at two levels. First, simple field and village data collection
techniques would be used to collect the bulk of monitoring information. Second, certain technical
tasks, such as aerial surveys and monitoring ecological changes, would be implemented by
technical specialists under contract to the TSU/AGEREF. It will be important to coordinate the
Project's ecological monitoring with the program for the Comoe National Park in C6te d'Ivoire.
The two national universities would be contracted to undertake specific studies related to
monitoring as required. While the IUCN would supervise the monitoring programs, each
government would retain overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation.
39.          Each TSU/AGEREF would use a simple geographic information system (GIS) as
an aid for planning and monitoring and evaluation. It would operate at a 1:50,000 scale and be
based on visual mapping and thematic interpretation of satellite photographs. It would be run on
the Project PC at each site. Information on the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) operations and
quantifiable indicators are presented in Appendix 6.
Revenue Management and Benefit Stream
40.          The establishment of a flow of tangible project benefits to the local populations is
crucial. All steps of the distribution system of project benefits must be clear and transparent and
must be related to each village's contribution to the generation of the benefits. Village-level
revenue would come from: (i) safari hunting; (ii) ecotourism; (iii) the sale of game meat; and (iv)
the sale of secondary forest products. Each TSU/AGEREF would have overall responsibility for



-28 -
distributing profits from these centrally organized activities to the communities. They would need
to make sure that the control of the management of benefits does not fall into the hands of one
small influential group of villagers. Initially, during phase 1, each village would receive the
benefits from resources within its own wildlife management zone.  The benefits from the
community-based resource management operations (as opposed to individually earned wages)
would be allocated according to a formula designed to establish the base for sustainable project
management and financial systems. The allocations would be the same for all phases of project
development: 40 percent would be allocated directly to the villagers through the VO commercial
bank account; 15 percent would be paid into village's Village Development Fund, which would
initially be managed by the TSU/AGEREF; 30 percent would be allocated to operational project
costs (roads, habitat improvement etc.) and would be managed by the TSU/AGEREF; and 15
percent would be allocated to costs of local government services (support for anti-poaching, land
management advice, coordination, monitoring etc.).
41.         Revenue from project activities would be managed using village-level financial
procedures based on systems currently being used by community-based natural resource
management projects in the region. It is designed to take into account the initially limited
management capacity of the local population. As with the development of project organization
(para. 12-24), the revenue management of the Project would evolve in three phases.
42.         Phase I would last for approximately two years and would be based around a small
Village Imprest Fund, managed by the Treasurer of each VO. Such Imprest funds already exist in
a number of villages in the Project area. The Village Imprest Fund would hold receipts from
wildlife and wild resource utilization activities, up to a maximum of 100,000 CFAF. Any amounts
larger than this would be deposited in a commercial bank account in the name of the VO.
Payments to and withdrawals from the account would require the co-signatures of the VO
President and Treasurer and the Head of the TSU. The TSU accountant would train and assist
each VO Treasurer in maintaining simple accounts that would require monthly balances and
quarterly summaries of payments and receipts. These would be reviewed by the TSU and
discussed at quarterly VO meetings.
43.         Phase II would be a transition period which would last approximately one year, but
the moment of change would be determined by local level capacity rather than a fixed calendar.
The focus of financial management would move from the individual Village Associations to an
inter-village committee (informal AGEREF) at each site. While the VOs would continue to
operate Imprest funds and a bank account, the informal AGEREF would begin to promote inter-
village operations, some of which would generate revenue for the community. The informal
AGEREF would create a small Financial Management Group with representatives of the informal
AGEREF and the TSU. An account for receiving payments and distributing revenue would be
established for the informal AGEREF. The account would be managed by the TSU Accountant,
assisted by the trainee accountant for the AGEREF.
44.         As the extent of each village's wild land management zone is different, it might be
expected that the allocation of benefits derived from the use of resources in this zone would
reflect this difference. However, there are other ways of distributing benefits. The main options



- 29 -
would be: (i) to continue direct payment of benefits to the particular village at the site of
utilization; (ii) a pro rata system reflecting the percentage area of each village in the total
AGEREF wildlife management zone; or (iii) a pro rata system reflecting the percentage
population of each village in the AGEREF total area. One important task for the informal
AGEREF at each site would be to consider the options and decide on the locally preferred
system. As the amounts of undisturbed wild lands within each village terroir varies considerably
the extent of the area managed by each village may also vary6. Depending on the revenue
distribution system finally negotiated, this variation could influence the levels of income and
benefits each village can expect to receive from the natural resource utilization component of the
Project. A fair solution will be sought for villages without land in the Wildlife Management Zone
but included in the Project because of their long-standing interests, even if not direct rights, in the
use of the natural resource within the area. For example, many of the villagers from these
adjacent communities hunt in the Wildlife Management Areas and might jeopardize the future of
the Project if they were not directly involved.  governments would eventually concede to
AGEREFs, representative of the Project area community, the authority and responsibility to
manage the Wildlife Management Areas, including their portion of classified forests, on the basis
of a negotiated management contract.  The agro-sylvo-pastoral zones, outside the areas
designated for wildlife management, would remain directly under each traditional village
authority, but investments would be coordinated and sponsored by the AGEREF where necessary.
45.          Phase III would start at each site with the creation of the formal AGEREF.
Although the VOs would continue to operate their Imprest funds and bank accounts, the
AGEREF would play a very active role in organizing revenue earning activities and distributing
the benefits to the villages and other participants. The former, transitory informal AGEREF
Financial Management Group would be replaced by the AGEREF Accountant working under the
control of the AGEREF's Executive Secretary. The transition to Phase III would take place after
the TSU has carefully evaluated the management and technical skills of the key members of the
AGEREF. The transition would need to be reviewed and approved by the PTCG in Burkina
Faso, the NSC in Cote d'Ivoire and the World Bank.
C. Project Renortin- and Supervision
46.          As an innovative, pilot operation GEPRENAF will require regular reporting and
careful supervision. Each TSU would provide regular quarterly reports on progress and a detailed
annual report. This would compare achievements against expectations, identify lessons learnt
during the year and propose adjustments and improvements to planning and implementation
methodologies. The Project will require more intense supervision than normal.  It will be
necessary for both the technical and management aspects of the Project. Supervision would take
place at three levels. First, the local coordinating committees would review project plans and
progress. Second, with the assistance of IUCN, the national coordinators would supervise the
progress of the Project through site visits, meetings with the communities and discussions with the
6 The undisturbed areas varyfrom virtually no land at all, for villages in the eastern part of the Burkina Faso site and the
south-western part of both Cote d 'Ivoire sites, to over 40, 000 hafor the village of Folonzo at the Burkina Faso site.



- 30 -
Project team. These routine field visits should take place ever four months. Third, the World
Bank, co-financiers and governments would undertake two supervision missions each year to each
site. The skill mix of each supervision mission would depend on the needs and state of the
progress, and a considerable amount of flexibility would therefore be required. A mid-term
review of the Project would focus on these essential aspects: (i) habitat management and the
state of biodiversity conservation; (ii) the effectiveness and profitability of natural resource
utilization; (iii) the impact of the Project on the socio-economic development of the population in
the Project area; (iv) project management, institutional development and local capacity building;
and (v) monitoring and evaluation, and its feedback to project management. Each aspect would
be the subject of a specific study to assess progress, identify constraints and propose necessary
corrective measures.

by the Bank of all contracts for civil works, goods and consultant firm services exceeding
US$100,000 equivalent and individual consultant services exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would
be required.   Table 3 summarizes the expected  procurement for the Project.   A  standard

50.         Civil works: Civil works financed under this Project include: (i) Project offices
and stores, physical infrastructure in the wildlife management zones (dams, roads, firebreaks); (ii)
land management works in the village zones (soil and water conservation structures, small-scale
irrigation facilities, tree planting); and (iii)social infrastructure in the villages (wells, roads, earth
dams etc.). All civil works undertaken under the Project will be implemented either directly by
local communities under the supervision of the Technical Support Unit, or under contract with
local agencies. Labor-intensive methods will be employed wherever possible.
51.         No contract is expected to be over US$250,000. However, in case during project
implementation an individual contract is estimated to exceed the threshold of $250,000, it would
be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Because of the small value of the
individual contracts National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB) will be used for individual
contracts below US$250,000 and over US$10,000 and aggregating to no more than US$756,000
to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$520,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for CMte
d'Ivoire and US$655,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$345,000 to be financed by the
Belgian Grant for Burkina Faso.
52.         Contracts for works, such as the construction of temporary tracks, fire breaks and
small dams and other biodiversity zone rehabilitation works below US$10,000, and aggregating to
no more than US$114,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$79,000 to be financed by the
Belgian Grant for Cote d'Ivoire and US$80,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$42,000
to be financed by the Belgian Grant for Burkina Faso, will be awarded to the VOs or AGEREF on
whose terroir the work is to be carried out by community participation.
53.         Goods: Goods financed under the Project include vehicles, office equipment,
spare parts, survey equipment, camping and anti-poaching equipment which, to the extent
possible, should be grouped into lots.  No contract is expected to be over US$250,000.
However, in case during project implementation an individual contract is estimated to exceed the
threshold of $250,000, it would be procured by International Competitive Bidding procedure.
All individual contracts for goods, vehicles, materials and equipment totaling less than
US$250,000 and more than US$30,000, and aggregating to no more than US$398,000 to be
financed by the GEF Grant and US$274,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for CMte d'Ivoire
and US$328,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$173,000 to be financed by the Belgian
Grant for Burkina Faso respectively, will be procured through National Competitive Bidding.
54.         The remaining goods which cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least
US$30,000 equivalent, aggregating to US$113,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and
US$82,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for Cote d'Ivoire and US$98,000 to be financed
by the GEF Grant and US$51,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for Burkina Faso, would
be procured on the basis of shopping by obtaining price quotations of at least three suppliers,
where that is reasonably possible. Some technical goods, not likely to be available from more
than one supplier, e.g., SPOT satellite images, aggregating to no more than US$20,000 to be
financed by the GEF Grant and US$10,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for CMte d'Ivoire
and US$12,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$7,000 to be financed by the Belgian
Grant for Burkina Faso, will be obtained under sole source procurement given the small total



- 34 -
amount and unique technical requirement. All procurement procedures will be in accordance with
the Bank Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA Credits of January, 1995. The
total value of goods to be purchased by the GEF Grant is US$530,000 for C6te d'Ivoire and
US$438,000 for Burkina Faso. The total value of goods to be purchased by the Belgian Grant is
US$366,000 for CMte d'Ivoire and US$231,000 for Burkina Faso.
55.         Services: All technical assistance, training and studies totaling US$1,180,000 to
be financed by the GEF Grant and US$813,000 to be financed by the Belgian Grant for Cote
d'Ivoire and totaling US$681,000 to be financed by the GEF Grant and US$359,000 to be
financed by the Belgian Grant for Burkina Faso, would be contracted in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank
as Executing Agency (August 1981). Apart from the contracts for each TSU, all consultant
services would be procured through short-term contracts. A prior review threshold for firm and
individual consultant contracts are respectively set to US$100,000 and US$50,000. All contracts
for consultants, technical assistance (para. 3), training (para. 2) and studies (para. 5) above these
amounts will be subject to prior review by the World Bank. Terms of reference of each contract,
sole source and complex assignments will be also subject to prior review even if their amounts are
lower than the thresholds established above.
D. Disbursement
56.         The GEF Grant, equivalent to US$4.38 million for CMte d'Ivoire and 2.64 million
for Burkina Faso, will be administered by the Bank and as such, will follow the disbursement
procedure outlined below.
57.         The Belgian Grant, equivalent to US$3.02 million for CMte d'Ivoire and US$1.39
million for Burkina Faso, will be administered by the Bank through the GEF under joint
cofinancing and, as such, will follow the disbursement procedures outlined below.
58.         Of the total grant amount jointly cofinanced, the GEF Grant will finance 60
percent and the Belgian Grant will finance 40 percent.
59.         The anticipated disbursements are summarized in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. The GEF
Grant and the Belgian Grant will be disbursed over a period of five years, following the standard
disbursement profile for West Africa (see Tables 5.1 and 5.2).
60.         All disbursements will be fully documented, however, the Statement of
Expenditure (SOE) would be used for training, operating costs, and contracts for goods, works
and services with consulting firms costing less than US$100,000 equivalent. An SOE would also
be used for individual consultants' contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent. The PC
would retain all documents for review by the Bank and by the auditors. Given the availability of
the Special Account (SA), the minimum application for direct payment would normally be for the
equivalent of 20 percent of the initial deposit to the SA.



- 35 -
61.         To expedite disbursements, and to ensure that funds are available when needed,
each government will open a Special Account (SA) in CFAF. In Cote d'Ivoire this account would
be managed by the CAA7, in Burkina Faso it would reside in a commercial bank acceptable to the
World Bank. In both countries, the governments will also open a Project Account into which the
Government's portion of the Project costs will be deposited. To facilitate disbursement and
implementation at the site level, Regional Advance Accounts will be established at a suitable
commercial bank nearest to each project site. At each site, Regional Advance Accounts would be
replenished by the Special Account and by the Project Account. All accounts will be established
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the World Bank. They will be used to finance the local
and foreign costs of eligible expenditures financed by GEF and Belgian Grants.
62.         In C8te d'Ivoire, as a condition of Grant Effectiveness, the Government will
deposit an amount of US$100,000 equivalent into the Project Account. Then, an initial amount of
US$500,000 equivalent will be deposited by the Bank in the Special Account according to the
respective percentages of financing of the GEF and Belgian Grants. The PC will subsequently
deposit into each Regional Advance Account, an amount not greater than US$100,000 equivalent,
corresponding to the first quarter's work plan budget of the Project sites as established by the
TSU and PC and approved by the Bank.
63.         In Burkina Faso, as a condition of Grant Effectiveness, the Government will
deposit in the Project Account an amount of CFA 25,000,000. Then, an initial amount of
US$250,000 equivalent will be deposited by the Bank in the Special Account according to the
respective percentages of financing of the GEF and Belgian Grants. The PC will then transfer to
the Regional Advance Accounts, an amount not to be greater than US$100,000 equivalent,
corresponding to the first quarters work plan budget of the Project site as established by the TSU
and PC and approved by the Bank.
64.         In C8te d'Ivoire, each TSU, and subsequently each AGEREF, which will take
over the Regional Advance Accounts from the TSU when they are established, will prepare
quarterly replenishment requests for the Regional Advance Accounts and submit them to the PC.
The Government will prepare disbursement requests which will be submitted to the Bank who will
replenish the Special Account upon receipt of: (i) proof that the Government has replenished the
Project Account; (ii) satisfactory proof of incurred expenditure and evidence that such
expenditures were eligible for financing; and (iii) a satisfactory three-month work plan. Up-to-
date bank statements and reconciliation of the accounts will accompany replenishment requests.
65.         In Burkina Faso, each TSU, and subsequently each AGEREF, which will take
over the Regional Advance Accounts from the TSU when they are established, will prepare a
quarterly replenishment request for the site accounts and submit it to the PC. The Government
will prepare disbursement requests to the Bank who will replenish the Special Account upon
receipt of: (i) proof that the Government has replenished the Project Account; (ii) satisfactory
proof of incurred expenditure and evidence that such expenditures were eligible for financing; and
7C,A standsfor Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement which is a parastatal organization which manages external loans and
grants in the Ivory Coast.



- 36 -
(iii) a satisfactory three-month work plan. Up-to-date bank statements and reconciliation of the
accounts will accompany replenishment requests.
66.             The Project Implementation Schedule: A disbursement schedule is outlined in
Table 5 and a detailed implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 9. An early start to
project implementation will be facilitated by a Pre-Implementation Phase, funded out of the
Project Preparation Advance, that will include: (i) training and awareness-building for villagers
and local government officials; (ii) preselection and identification of candidates for the recruitment
of the TSU's personnel; (iii) preparation of bidding documents for the construction of project
buildings; (iv) establishment of Project accounting systems at both the national and site levels; and
(v) preparation for the procurement of vehicles and essential equipment. This would be organized
by the PCs who would contract the bulk of the work to suitably qualified NGOs or local
consulting firms.

maintained by the TSU until the AGEREF is effectively established and staffed with a suitably
trained and experienced accountant. Both accounts will be maintained in a manner consistent
with sound accounting practices which will reflect fairly, in accordance with intemational
accounting standards, the situation of the Project.
68.           Audited accounts and reports (short-form report, special report on the utilization
of the GEF and Belgian grants and the management letter) for each year would be audited by
qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit will include specific verification
of the legitimacy of all expenditures and an opinion on the reliability of the SOE procedures and
the utilization of goods and services financed under the Project. The auditors will also provide a
long-form report including detailed comments on the accounting and financial system and an
assessment of the operational efficiency of the Project and its components. The final audit would
be submitted to the Bank no less than six months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition,
quarterly audits in CMte d'Ivoire and half-yearly audits in Burkina Faso would also be undertaken
until such time as the auditors propose and the Bank accepts that they are no longer necessary.

GEPRENAF
SITE BIODIVERSITY
I. INTRODUCTION.
1.    The project area is distibuted over three independant sites: Ouarigue and Monts Tingui in C6te
d'Ivoire and Diefoula in Burkina Faso. The Diefoula and Ouarigue sites are contiguous and lie across the
intemational border delineated by the Leraba while the Monts Tingui site is located 70 km to the south. All
sites are connected to the westem side of the Comoe National Park through a 7-km wide corridor for
Ouarigue/Diefoula et a 20 km border for Monts Tingui (see map 1).  About 1950 km2 within
Diefoula/Ouarigue and 1160 km2 within Monts Tingui, are free of any cultivation and are potentially
available for biodiversity conservation (see maps 2 and 3).
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE BIOLOGY OF THE PROJECT AREA
2.    Vegetation - The vegetation is typical of the Sudanian domain at Diefoula/Ouarigue and Sudano-
Guinean domain at Monts Tingui. Overall, the three sites are quite homogeneous with woodland savanna,
characterized by Terminalia macroptera and Vittalerta paradoxa, occupying about 70% of the surface.
The monotonous woodland savanna is broken by occasional stands of open understory woodland with
Isoberlinia doka and Monotones kerstingii. A grassland savanna prevails on the numerous bowalsI with
Loudetia simplex and on the sedimentary plains of the Comoe, Leraba and Kinkene Rivers with Vettiveria
fulvibarbis.
3.    Gallery forests grow along the Comoe, Leraba and Kinkene Rivers foming a species-rich dense
continuum, sometimes wider than 100 meters, characterized by Khaya senegalensis and Diospyros
mespiliformis. The continuum is broken along the secondary rivers and temporary creeks where the gallery
forests become less dense and only occur intermittently. All sites are dotted with archipelagos of dry semi-
deciduous forests, characterized by Celtis spp. and Triplochiton scieroxylon. A significant increase in
number, size and species richness of these forest islands is apparent from Diefoula to Monts Tingui. These
primary forests, islands or galleries, constitute the northern spur of the Guinean tropical forest block. This
block is now 80% degraded in C6te d'Ivoire. At all three sites, it is estimated that the survival of more
than half of all species depend on the presence of healthy gallery forests and forest islands.
4.     Fauna - Associated with the vegetation, the site's fauna is characteristic of the Sudanian to
Sudano-Guinean domain. Most West African Sudanian savanna and woodland species are represented.
From Diefoula to Monts Tingui, a gradual but significant increase in forest species, and thereby species
richness, occurs. This is well illustrated, at the entomological level, by a shift from widely distributed
butterflies at Diefoula/Ouarigue to species specific to the savanna-forest ecotone and even to dense forest at
Monts Tingui, e.g. with Papilio menesthus.
5.    The avifauna of this vanred ecosystem is extremely species rich. In particular the presence of
spectacular species such as the secretary bird (Serpentarius sagittarius), the ground hombill (Bucorvus
abyssinicus), the Jabiru stork (Ephippiolyncheis senegalensis) and the giant plantain eater (Corythaeola
I Bowal is a Foulani word that describes a flat, hard lateritic pan, on which little vegetation grows

cristata) is recorded . Several species or sub-species are endemic to the Guinean forest block, e.g. gray-
wood pigeon (Columba unicincta). The area also shelters numerous Ethiopian (local) and European
(palearctic) migrants such as the spurred-winged goose (Plectropterus gambesis) and the woodchat shrike
(Lanius senator).
6.     Mammals are well represented by nine species of primates indicator of habitat diversity, e.g. the
exclusively dryland patas (Erythrocebus patass) and the forest dwelling greater white-nosed monkey
(Cercopithecus nictitans), and by most of the large ungulates and carnivores representative of the Sudanian
savanna ecosystem, e.g. western hartebeest (Alcelaphus busephalus major), lion (Panthera leo) and
spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). The region is also biologically important because of the richness of its
small predator species, e.g. civette (Viverra civetta), ratel (Mellivora capensis) and several mongoose
species. Many species, mostly represented at Monts Tingui, are also characteristic of dense forest
ecosystems.  This is the case of the western race of black and white colobus3 (Colobus polycomos
verrosus), the rare bongo (Boocerus euryceros) and giant forest hog4 (Hylochoerus meinertzehageni).
III. FEATURE SPECIAL TO THIS REGION OR THREATENED GLOBALLY
7.     Habitat diversity - One important characteristic of all three sites is that, in spite of being 70%
covered by savanna woodland, they still regroup a variety of different vegetation types, e.g. wooded
savanna, grassland, bowal, gallery forest, semi-deciduous forest island, etc. Habitat diversity, at the local
level, is the closest measure of ecosystem diversity. At the selected project sites, diversity stems from the
interface and overlap between two biogeographic zones: the arid Sudanian savanna and the moist Guinean
forest. The interaction of these two biomes creates special conditions in which very different vegetation
types, i.e. habitats, are brought together with hard edges. This in turn induces a close cohabitation between
species having widely different ecological niches. Most of these species are at the extreme limit of their
natural ranges. For examnple, Monts Tingui has six duiker species, one of which is savanna dwelling, the
Grimm  duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and another exclusive to the densest forest, the black duiker
(Cephalophus niger).
8.     Species diversity - The three sites, and in particular Monts Tingui, have a high species diversity.
At all sites, species richness is mostly associated with the presence of dense forest patches. Birds, which
are considered good indicators of overall biodiversity, underline well the importance of this region for
species richness. Long term studies in the adjacent Comoe National Park demonstrate that because of the
habitat diversity, 490 bird species (80% of all birds species listed for all C6te d'Ivoire and more species
than ever recorded in all of Europe) transit through or live in the Comoe ecosystem.
9.     Endemism  - One of the global measures for the biodiversity value of an area is its level of
endemism. Sudanian biomes are constituted of widely distributed species and usually exhibit endemism
only at the sub-species level, i.e. at the genetic level. The Western hartebeest (A. b. major), waterbuck
(Kobus defassa), and Buffon kob (Kobus kob) are represented as western races. They differ from eastern
races not only by morphological characters, but also by their social behavior due to the dense vegetation of
the wet savanna of West Africa. At these sites, endemism at the species and subspecies level, is related to
the presence of specialized forest species with extremely narrow niches and limited distributions. These
2 The presence of all of these species has been verified by the pre-appraisal mission.
3The black and white colobus presence was confirmed along the northern portion of the Diefoula site along the Comoe River
during the pre-appraisal mission.
4The bongo and giant forest hog were confirmed at Monts Tingui during the pre-appraisal mission.



APPENDIX I

species have evolved from the small forest refugia that remained in West Africa in the ice age. Several
forest species, endemic to the Guinean forest block and therefore globallv rare, are present at Monts
Tingui; for example, butterflies, such as Euphaedra spp., endemic to west/center C6te d'lvoire were
recorded during project preparation.
10.    Endangered species - The conservation of these sites is also important because they shelter
several species endangered internationally or locally vulnerable. The Diefoula sites comprises several pure
stands of Guinean coppalier (Guibourtia coppalifera) that are not reported elsewhere in Burkina Faso. In
addition, relic populations of a regionally important and threatened tree species remain: the Parinaria
sp. Some animal species are listed as endangered in the IUCN red data book, including the western
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), the hunting dog (Lycaon pictus) and the most threatened elephant
subspecies, the forest elephant (Loxodonta africana oxyotis)5.
11.    Economic value - Finally, the economic wealth that is associated with biological resources, even
though currently undervalued and difficult to quantify, is nevertheless extremely important for the local
population. The high value of large savanna ungulates provides these animals with an important role in the
conservation of a broader diversity. At all three sites, several species extremely valuable on the safari
market, e.g. roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), could potentially generate more revenues than
agriculture and thereby induce an alternative land use not consumptive of habitat. A satisfied demand, by
these ungulates, for large areas of high habitat quality trickles dowvn to the conservation of non-game
species that constitute the bulk of animal diversity. Furthermore, numerous secondary forest products,
likely to be present at the project sites, are currently undervalued. This is the case, for example, of the
Datura spp. plant, which extract is used as a natural food colorant and is currently priced at CFA 300,000
($600) per kg on the international market. There are over 50 species of medicinal plants recorded in the
area.
IV. NATURE OF THE THREATS
12.    The threat to the local ecosystem is mostly anthropogenic and originates from non sustainable
human uses of a slowly renewable resource. Biodiversity is affected in two ways: (1) the consumption of
the biological resource itself, and (2) the consumption of the land sustaining the biological resource.
13.    The first way does not always significantly affect biodiversity as it usually consists of direct use of
a small proportion of the fauna and flora. Traditional hunting, fuel wood or secondary forest product
gathering are example of direct use. However, when the human pressure is locally high, as in part of
Diefoula/Ouarigue and Monts Tingui, the direct use can become unsustainable and lead to the degradation
of significant parts of the ecosystem. For example, in the Banfora area, near Diefoula, limited logging by
outsiders may lead to the local disappearance of timber species such as Khaya senegalensis and Afzelia
africa that are both rare in Burkina Faso. Species exclusively used in traditional medicine, e.g. Coclos
spermum, Sclerocania spp., are also becoming locally endangered. The "Centre de Pharmacopee de
Banfora" near Diefoula must now obtain several plants up to 120 km away, when only recently they were
available near the city. Similarly, the large fauna at all sites is threatened in the short term by excessive
direct use, i.e. hunting and trapping. Given the current hunting pressure, it is considered that at no time
would habitat quantity become a limiting factor for the large ungulates; they would be hunted out much
before. Still, since hunting, secondary forest product gathering and logging, only targets specific species,
5The presence of chimpanzees and elephants at the Monts Tingui site was confirmed by the pre-appraisal mission. Although
the hunting dog presence was not verified, many villagers described it as present.



APPENDIX I
Page 4 of 5
most of the other plants and animals that constitute the bulk of biodiversity may not be significantly
affected.
14.    Of the non sustainable activities described above, hunting is the most important and impacts
significantly the project areas potentially available for biodiversity conservation. The populations of most
game species is very low; some such as the waterbuck and the Buffon kob are close to the minimum
viability threshold. Even small game species, such as guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), are surprisingly
uncommon. Therefore, it is expected that without a modification of the hunting habits within a short period
estimated at 10 to 15 years, the large game species will all have disappeared from the project areas.
15.    Unlike hunting, agricultural encroachment, i.e. shifting cultivation or pastoralism, consumes or
modifies the habitat and thereby destabilizes the natural ecosystems, influences the species composition and
diminishes the original diversity of life. This is the second type of degradation of natural biodiversity. In
all of the three project sites, agricultural pressure, and therefore land consumption, is driven by population
growth rate and immigration supplemented by the use of a land-voracious variety of yam. Much of the
project's conservation areas were not historically inhabited because of the presence of the blackfly that
transmitted onchocerciasis. These areas are now freed of the disease and available for human use. In the
medium term, modeled to be 25 years, it is estimated that the cultivation front would have advanced
throughout the areas that currently remain in near-pristine condition. Also, but to a lesser extent, it may be
expected that transhumant pastoralism from the northern part of Burkina Faso and from Mali could
increasingly use the project sites for dry season grazing. Indeed, these areas are now being freed of the
tsetse fly that limited prolonged use of riparian Sudanian habitat by zebu cattle which are not naturally
resistant to trypanosomiasis. The main consequence of livestock grazing and browsing of natural range,
even when not accompanied by destructive habits such as tree looping, is a modification of habitat quality
which leads to a shift in species composition and eventually diminishes natural biodiversity.
V. GENERAL CONDITION OF THE CONSERVATION AREAS
16.    Within the areas potentially available for conservation, a total of 3000 km2, or approximately
60% of the project area, the habitat and biodiversity are in general in almost pristine condition.
Human use has not affected the vegetation which appears as healthy as the habitat at the heart of the
nearby Comoe National Park. The savanna is usually burned every year, sometimes irrationally late6, but
this has not significantly affected the quality of this fire adapted vegetation. The gallery forests and forest
islands are largely intact and function suitably as wildlife corridors and shelters. Currently, the only
significant human impact on biodiversity is the diminished populations of game species and in particular
large ungulates.
17.    Nonetheless, only a few large game species appear to be close to a viability threshold (i.e. the level
below which the species cannot recover) and most of them have a potential for rapid recovery given a
significant removal of the hunting pressure. Table I provides estimates of the population sizes of the main
game species, at project start and after 10 year, for each site and under a with and a without project
situation.
6Late season fires (February to April) are more damaging to the vegetation than early fire (November to January) for several
reasons: (i) the low moisture content of vegetative material does not offer an effective heat barrier, (ii) the dry
vegetative material fuels more intense fires, with higher and sometimes lethal temperature and (iii) the high air
temperature and low relative humidity enhances the fires' lethal effect.



APPENDIX 1
Page 5 of 5
VI. ZONING AND MANAGEMENT
18.     The larger the area assigned to remain as wildland the greater the potential for (1) biodiversity
conservation, (2) large game species recovery and (3) economic return to wildlife utilization. However,
there must be a balance between land use types. Given the location of the current agricultural front, it is
possible to zone for conservation a total of 3110 km2: 900 km2 in Diefoula, 600 km2 in Ouarigue, with an
additional 450 km2 to connect the Ouarigue/Diefoula complex with the Comoe National Park, and 1160
km2 in Monts Tingui. The exact zoning plan will be determined through negotiations with the communities
whose terroirs could be partly included in the Conservation Areas. These areas are not meant to be safe
refuges for all species, thus several game species will be utilized according to sound wildlife management
practices and national and international regulations. Traditional and safari hunting quotas will be set
annually, in function of the previous year populations, while allowing for a proportion of loss to poaching,
in such a way as to provide a continuous and sustainable return to the community.
VII. CONCLUSION
19.     These sites offer one additional particularity that goes beyond the importance of its habitat
diversity, species diversity and the verified presence of endemic and endangered species: it is not only
nearly pristine but also certain to be turned over to unsustainable agriculture if an alternative, sustainable
and more profitable land use is not established.

GEPRENAF
PEOPLE OF THE PROJECT AREAS
Socio-demographic Information
1.    The original populations of the Diefoula area belong to the Gur Voltaique group (Gouin, Dogse and
Komono) to the Dioula and Mande groups (Djongo and Ngiwi). Immigrants belonging mostly to the Mossi,
Lobbi and Foula groups have settled over the past ten years; they now represent about 36% of the
population. Ten villages are included in the project which represent an overall population of 6000 people
with a density of 3.8 inhabitant per km2. With immigration, it is believed that population is increasing at a
rate greater than 4% per annum; without immigration, the natural rate of population increase is near 2.5%
per annum.
2.    The Diefoula site can be divided into two specific zones: Diefoula to the East of the Comoe River
and Logoniegue West of the river (see map 2). The Diefoula area is much less densely populated than
Logoniegue. It is estimated that 2800 people are distributed over 4 villages at a density of 2.4 inhabitant
per km2. Ten percent of the population is constituted of migrants. Because of high immigration, the
Logoniegue area is 60% populated by migrants. Six villages include 3200 peoples with a density of eight
inhabitant per km2.
3.    In Cote d'Ivoire, the Ouarigue site includes 17 villages with a total population of 5000 people. The
average density is 3.6 inhabitant per km2. The Eastem areas of Ouarigue were originally occupied by
Ngiwi people of the Manding group. Now they represent only 13% of the population. Most migrants
belong to the Lobi group which represent about 29% of the population of East Ouarigue. Other groups
include Palakas and Kongs. Western Ouarigue is more densely populated (7 inhabitant per km2). There,
Palakas represent 40% of the population, Lobi 29% and Nyaforolos 15%. A minority of Foula is also
represented. Demographic increase rates are similar in the Cote d'Ivoire sites as in the Burkina Faso site,
i.e. 4% per annum.
4.    About 26 villages, with a population of 8700 people, belong to the Monts Tingui site. The average
density is 4.8 inhabitant per km2. The resident populations are Djimini from the Bambara/Senoufo group
and Kong from the Dioula group. Most migrants are Lobi and now represent about 40% of the population.
They remain mostly in northern Monts Tingui. Again, a similar population increase is estimated in Monts
Tingui.
Hierarchic Structure
5.    The traditional organization is based on the terroir unit (dughu1). A terroir is defined as a portion
of space utilized and exploited by a social group which has de facto traditional control on tenure issues.
Normally, a terroir "belongs" to the first occupant of the land, i.e. the family whose ancestors had build the
first houses and cleared the first field. Today, the descendents are represented by the village chief (dughu
tigi), master of the village itself and of its people, and the land chief (dughu kolo tigi). The land chief
inherits the agrarian "forces" and is expected to manage the land, i.e. to distribute it to the resident of the
l Dughu in Dioula, Manding, S6noufo and Bambara designates the terroir.



APPENDIX 2
Page 2 of 5
villages and to the new migrants. Once received from the land chief, a piece of land can remain in the
lineage of a family as long at it remains cultivated. Planting trees or digging wells requires authorization
from the land chief.
6.     Traditional village institutions are generally well organized, though there is considerable variation
between sites and villages. In Cote d'Ivoire, almost all villages have Village Councils. This is a recognized
authority which, reinforced by the project, will constitute the basic project unit at the village level. In
Burkina Faso, the importance of village council is yet to be legally established, however, in almost all
villages numerous other associations (ton) exist. They range from women's associations to youth's
associations, and include thematic associations with various objectives (charity, collective fields,
construction and management of infrastructure and hunting). In Burkina Faso, village hunters associations
are found in virtually every village where there is a land chief, and have been encouraged by the
govemment. In the Cote d'Ivoire only some villages have hunter's associations. Traditional village
structures will generally provide a viable base for project activities, although a considerable amount of
capacity building and institutional support will be needed. In the Cote d'lvoire sites, some villages have
organized a network of "vigilante" groups to undertake night patrols against local bandits: clearly an
interesting base for community anti-poaching activities.
7.     In some of the newly settled villages, the political power and recognition lies outside of the village.
For example, the Lobis installed in Gorowi and Amaradougou at the Monts Tingui site have allegiance to a
"king" located in the city of Kong. The villages in the southem portion of Monts Tingui (Djimini villages in
map 3), recognize the "canton chief' of Dabakhala as supreme authority. Several emigrated villagers from
the project areas have reached a national political stance. In turn, they became influencial in their village of
origin. For example, in the village of Yrenderikoro a villager who emigrated to Abidjan was for a short
period deputy in the national assembly. This has given him a special authority in the village which now will
not accept any project or venture without consulting him.
8.     Little inter-village structure exist yet. The Pays Rural and the Communaute Rurale (both are sets
of villages) are the basic administrative units respectively in Cote d'lvoire and Burkina Faso. However,
they often do not represent homogeneous social units and do not function well. Therefore, the project will
have to induce the notion of inter-village association in order to manage wild areas overlapping several
terroirs. The creation, training and formalization of these inter-village associations into an efficient entity
is expected to be carried out over the project life.
Production System
9.     Agriculture is the principal activity for all sites' populations. It is a slash and bum type of rainfed
agriculture where fields are farmed for three to six years and then remain in fallow for five to 12 years.
Agricultural production currently occupies less than 16% of the total area, but is rapidly expanding into the
classified forests. This system is traditionally oriented toward auto-consumption but is increasingly shifting
toward commercialization.  Three production systems can be identified:   subsistence agriculture,
commercial agriculture and agro-pastoral production.
10.    Subsistence agriculture is a traditional system based on the cultivation of millet, sorghum, maize
and rice. It is supplemented by a limited production of ground nuts and yam. A large proportion of the
production is consumed locally. However, a significant proportion is sold or shared in a local charity
network. Hunting, secondary forest product gathering and fishing also contribute to food diversification
and food security. Family manual labor is the basic production unit. At the Burkina Faso site, this system



APPENDIX 2
Page 3 of 5
is adopted by 30% of units in the Diefoula area and 40% in the Logoniegue area. At the Cote d'lvoire sites,
it concems 30% of the Ouarigue units and 55% of the Monts Tingui units.
l.    Commercial agriculture is not mutually exclusive with the subsistence system. It is mostly carried
out by young farmers. While the family remains the basic production unit, it is supplemented by additional
manual laborers, mostly migrants. Two commercial sub-systems can be identified: one is dominated by
yam and the other by cotton.
12.   Yam cultivation leads to relatively high eamings. However, this labor demanding system requires
the use of paid labor, and rapidly exhausts the soil. The recently introduced high yield "American Florida"
variety, depletes soil nutrients in one to two seasons. Consequently, this subsystem is highly demanding in
new land and contributes to the accelerated movement of the agriculture front into wildlands. If the current
rate of clearing continues, all the remaining land in the three classified forests will be cultivated or under
fallow by the year 2020. At the Burkina Faso site, this system is adopted by 20% of family units in the
Diefoula area and 60% in the Logoniegue area. At the Cote d'lvoire sites, it involves 40% of the Ouarigue
and Monts Tingui units.
13.    The cotton production  subsystem  is demonstrative of a new  agro-econonuc behavior:
intensification, organization into cooperatives and use of paid labor and of mechanized equipment. This
system is still developping and involves only 50% of the cultivators in the Eastem part of the Diefoula area
of the Burkina Faso site, and 40% of the farmers in the Eastem part of Ouarigue.
14.   Agro-pastoral systems is the domain of the Foula herders. Migrant herds, mostly Zebu cattle,
originate from northem Burkina Faso and move through the Diefoula/Ouarigue area during the dry season.
These animals are owned by Foula families living in North Burkina Faso, and increasingly, by Foula who
have settled in the area. In addition, sedentary livestock, mostly trypano-tolerant Ndama cattle, owned by
the resident population are herded around fallow areas by paid Foula herders. The impact of livestock on
the wild habitat and on wildlife would be substential if livestock continues to increase. The herders combine
the use of bush fires with systematic lopping of trees to provide forage to their animals. In addition,
livestock can compete with wildlife for food and for water thereby lowering the carrying capacity for some
wild ungulate populations.
15.   In all areas, the population depends to a significant extent on natural resources such as wild meat
and gathering. Food preparation almost always includes vegetal fat and spices from wild plants. Wild meat
often constitute the sole protein intake of the villagers.
16.    Three types of hunting are practiced in the area:  traditional subsistence hunting, organized
commercial hunting and recreational hunting. Hunting takes place in the classified forests as well as in the
village agro-pastoral zones. Traditional subsistence hunting has considerable socio-cultural significance,
but contributes only about 3% of total monetary revenue to villages. It has minimal impact on animal
populations. The most serious threat to wildlife is from organized poaching, by both residents and large
groups of Lobi hunters from Burkina Faso, who hunt and dry bush meat for commercial sale. If this type of
hunting continues unchecked virtually all the large and medium sized mammals will have disappeared from
the area within twelve years. Some recreational hunting takes place in Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire by
expatriates and civil servants. Its impact on wildlife populations is negligible, but it generates considerable
local income for guides, trackers and porters. Some villages even encourage game animals specifically for
these outsiders. Although usually illegal, this provides an important demonstration of potential interest in
the strategy of the proposed project.



APPENDIX 2

17.    Beside hunting, natural resources are used in traditional food preparation, construction,
pharmacopoeia. Timber species such as Khaya senegalensis, Pterocarpus errinaceus and Afzelia africana
are marginally exploited in the Logoniegue Classified Forest. More than 50 plant species are used in
traditional pharmacopoeia. Honey production is relatively developed in the area, though it remains an
opportunity activity destructive of the trees in which wild hives are found. Table 2.1 presents the revenues
from the different production systems.

Infrastructure
18.   Physical and social infrastructure and Government services in the area are limited and investment in
basic infrastructure, especially water supplies and roads, is the highest development priority for most
villages
19.    For the 10 villages of the Diefoula sites, there are three schools with a total of eight classrooms, 18
water points and five primary health centers. The Logoniegue area, even though more populated, does not
have any school and has less developed infrastructure. The access roads are all in extremely poor shape
and are perceived as an impediment to agriculture export.
20.   In the 17 Ouarigue villages there are two schools with a total of nine classrooms, one primary
health center, 10 equipped wells and two hand-dug wells. In Monts Tingui, there are six schools and one
primary health center. About half of the villages are equipped with a drilled well and a manual pump.
Access roads to these sites are not as degraded as in the Diefoula site. However, roads within the sites are
in great need of rehabilitation.
Factors of Pressure on Resources
21.    At all three project sites, the current production system will fail in the long-term. It is estimated
that without a change in current trend, the entire project area will be cultivated within 20 years. The current
trend is characterized by a high population growth exacerbated by high immigration and supplemented by a
land-extensive agriculture and by an uncontrolled demand on bush meat. Details on the threat that humans
pose to renewable resources of the area are presented in Appendix 1.

Conclusion
22.   Investigation of the current production system as well as social studies conducted during project
preparation have shown how unsustainable the current production system is and how it will lead to
economic difficulties and to biodiversity depletion. These studies have also shown that numerous villagers,
particularly the young cultivators, are aware of this problem. They understand that if the elders continue to
distribute land to all newcomers, soon there will be no meat on the table and no land to cultivate. Many of
them are receptive to the ideas that GEPRENAF proposes. Admitedly, understanding of GEPRENAF is
not yet widespread, nonetheless a project that aims at solving the problems of this community will, without
doubt, be well received. A financial analysis has shown that, if immigration can be controlled, then wildlife
management and utilization by the villagers will rapidly become more profitable that agriculture. There is
an opportunity to enable the people, perceived today as the "problem", to become the real solution.

COMMUNITY-BASED LAND MANAGEMENT: THE "GESTION DES TERROIRS"
APPROACH
INTRODUCTION
I.    This Annex provides an overview of the community-based land management (CBLM, or gestion
des terroirs) approach that forms the basic strategy for the planning and implementation of GEPRENAF.
2.    The CBLM strategy has evolved during the past ten years from a generation of mainly productionist
or integrated rural development projects. An evaluation of the results of these traditional projects showed that
despite high investment costs the projects generally had limited impact and were unsustainable as the
strategies were not adopted by the population. This led West African countries, donors and non-government
organisations towards the definition and progressive implementation of a new multi-sectoral and
decentralised strategy which incorporates the concems of natural resource management, spatial planning,
improved production and household incomes and the development of socio economic infrastructure. Unlike
the previous generation of projects, this new community-based land management (CBLM) strategy directly
provided organised rural communities with the responsibility, skills and tools to manage sustainably the land
and natural resources they use on a daily basis.
3.    To date, CBLM has been used to increase the productivity and sustainability of crop and livestock
production and to improve land management techniques. The aim of the GEPRENAF, however, is to
promote wildlife management (both plant and animal) as an alternative land use which is both economically
and ecologically viable. This will be a new concept for the majority of the communities in the project area,
and will therefore be an idea that is initially "external" to the main CBLM process. In effect, through
increasing awareness and subsequently through demonstrating tangible benefits, the project will add a new
land use option.The approach taken by GEPRENAF can consequently be considered as one of "guided"
CBLM.
OBJECTIVES
4.    The objectives of the CBLM are:
*     to provide communities with the operational capacity to initiate and implement activities designed to
improve production, their quality of life and the natural environment through better information,
training and coordinated technical and financial support,
*     to provide communities with the authority and administrative and legal power , through
decentralisation, to manage the resources of their land.
5.    The Approach - The CBLM approach is participatorv, open, flexible and iterative. It is based on
the community's knowledge of their land and its resources, their needs and priorities and the possible
solutions to their problems. There are several key elements of the approach that depend to a large extent on a
supporting national policy, institutional and legal framework.
(i) Participation, which includes having the legal right to assume authority and responsibility for land and
resource management, is crucial to the CBLM  approach.  Without the participation  of the local



APPENDIX 3
Page 2 of 6
communities, and the range of local resource users, the approach will not be intemalised and therefore have
little chance of long-term success. Participation should start as early as possible in the project cycle and
begin if possible with a process of participatory diagnostic evaluation by the population of their resources
and future needs. Acceptance of this strategy requires a change in the way that outside agents and agencies
work with local communities: the capacity to listen to the people becomes a prerequisite to effective
operations.
(ii) Coordination between the different groups (government services, NGOs, private sector operators)
working in development in an area is important as CBLM requires a wide range of skills and supporting
activities. Local coordinating committees have an important role in ensuring that inter-agency and inter-
sector coordination is achieved. The process needs to be clear and transparent, with the roles and
responsibilities of all involved precisely defined. The diagnostic process enables the various sectoral
programs working in an area to target their assistance to where the real needs and priorities are expressed.
However, like participation, this requires the adoption of a new way of working with the communities.
(iii) Security of tenure, both land and natural resources, is a precondition to the long-term success of natural
resource management operations. Throughout much of rural West Africa there is currently considerable
overlap between local, traditional land tenure arrangements and elements of modern, national legislation.
This problem can often be resolved on a case-by-case basis without resorting to extensive litigation. The
CBLM approach, by bringing together different resource users to discuss specific natural resource use
conflicts, can help clarify the interests of the range of different resource users and provide a coherent
framework for discussion and dispute resolution.
(iv) Decentralisation entails the transfer of central government authority to local community groups so that
they have the legal status to control the management and exploitation of their own property and their own
internal decision making processes. At the same time a process of deconcentration of necessary government
power is necessary, whereby essential government responsibilities, such as the provision of agricultural and
social services, are transferred from central state structures to those closer to the population.
(v) Local capacity building is essential if rural communities are effectively to assume control and authority
over their resources. The speed of the progressive, iterative CBLM approach is controlled primarily by the
capacity of the communities to learn and expand their management and implementation skills. Consequently
the development of human resources and a program of special training and field visits is an essential part of
any CBLM operation. Experience shows that successfully implementing specific actions which are of
priority concerns to the population is the most effective way of reinforcing participation and encouraging
local capacity. The program of work subsequently expands to include other activities as interest, skill and
capacity grow.
(vi) Special group interests are targeted in CBLM through the initial participative diagnostic process of
rapid rural appraisal. The particular concerns of women, youth, transhumants, migrants and other
significant recourse users are included in the over-all analysis of resource users interests and needs. This is
essential if a true and balanced view of the "terroir" and its related population is to be achieved. It is only
through this process that the full range of concerns, and potential and existing conflicts, can be discussed and
solutions eventually be negotiated.
(vii) Supporting Investments in social infrastructure are an essential element of CBLM activities, even
though the main focus of the programs will be on improving natural resource management.  Social
infrastructure (wells, clinics, schools etc.) is inevitably a primary concern of the population and will thus

COMMUNITY-BASED LAND MANAGEMENT: THE "GESTION DES TERROIRS"
APPROACH

infrastructure (wells, clinics, schools etc.) is inevitably a primary concern of the population and will thus



APPENDIX 3
Page 3 of 6
regularly emerge as a high priority in the participative diagnostic process. The CBLM strategy must
therefore take these demands into account, even if direct funding might not automatically be included in the
CBLM project package. This will be of particular importance in the GEPRENAF sites, where the
standards of services and social infrastructure are particularly poor and a subject of great concern to the
population.
(viii) Flexibility is an essential characteristic of the CBLM approach. It is important that communities and
project staff can learn and react to changes in capacity, local conditions and opportunity. It is therefore
important to monitor progress very carefully and reevaluate plans according to evolving conditions.
6.     Key Steps in Implementation - There are eight steps which normally would be followed in the
implementation of a CBLM strategy. The importance of, and time required for, each step will be determined
by site-specific characteristics.
(i) Preparing a supportive framework. This includes an initial phase of raising communities awareness
about the approach of the CBLM strategy, ensuring that there is strong, visible national and provincial
support for the project strategy and establishing an effective national policy and legal framnework. This also
requires that the project's key institution have the mandate and manpower needed to execute their tasks.
(ii) Participative diagnostic survey. This is carried out by specially trained professionals using a rapid
rural appraisal methodology. It is a powerful participative planning tool that is based on traditional local
concepts. The communities (including all resource users within the terroir, which is a socially recognised
area of land and resources) describe and map the resources of the terroir and identify their primary
problems. The interests of each specific sub-groups within the conmnuity (women, migrants, youth etc.) are
identified during the diagnostic process.
(iii) Identification of goals, skills and available resources. During this step the community analyses
priority goals associated with the quality of life (income security, health, education, water supplies, rural
access etc..) and production and economic goals (agriculture, hunting, animal husbandry, use of primary and
secondary forest products, employment etc.). At the sane time the available skills and resources to achieve
these goals are identified and compared with an analysis of the skills and resources that would be required to
achieve them. In this manner the actual resource gap (human, technical, financial and physical) can be
described.
(iv) The preparation of a community "terroir" development plan. Initially this will be a very simple
document - not even written to start with; a locally made terroir map and a verbal agreement is generally
sufficient - that identifies a limited number of priority actions that can be implemented within a specific time
frame (usually 6 or 12 months). Training needs as well as direct investment in physical infrastructure should
be included, as well as the human, physical and financial requirements that are needed to implement the plan.
As local skills and capacity increase so will the plan's complexity and detail. In the specific case of
GEPRENAF it is extremely unlikely that some of the essential initial habitat improvement and wildlife
management activities would be included as immediate priorities in the communities' plans. It will therefore
be necessary for the GEPRENAF team to propose these activities - which would be paid for by the project -
as an additional set of activities for the area, and to negotiate the details of implementation with the
communities. This should include resource utilisation as wvell as habitat improvement operations. As the
local population gains experience - and begins to receive tangible benefits from project activities - it is
expected that habitat and wildlife management operations would be included in the terroir development
plans.



APPENDIX 3
Page 4 of 6
(v) Review of the plan. Before starting implementation the community should review the proposed plan,
with the project team against a set of evaluation criteria. These should include: an evaluation of the
environmental impact of the activities; a clear identification of "who will do what, and with what"; an
analysis of the weak links in the plan and the actions needed to reinforce those links; an estimate of the
marginal benefits to the population; a review of the role and interests of special groups (women, youth,
migrants, transhumants etc.); and a review of the plans social and cultural impact.
(vi) The negotiation of a development agreement between the community and the project. Initially this
will be done on a village-by-village basis, but as the project develops the agreements would be with the inter-
village associations. The agreement will be based on the plan developed by the community and the proposals
for the biodiversity and wildlife management zone. It would define the roles and responsibilities for all parties
concerned, with a timetable for action and a financing plan. The communities' contribution would mainly be
in the form of labor and allocating land to biodiversity conservation, while the project's contribution would
be training, technical advice and finance, though as the communities start to earn cash income from wildlife
exploitation they would be expected to contribute to the costs of the project.
(vii) Implementation. The majority of the work, both for the biodiversity component and the  terroirs
development plans would be undertaken by the communities themselves. Where necessary, however, large
civil works (permanent roads, project buildings), safari operations and coomplex technical work (aspects of
ecological monitoring) would be contracted out to private sector operators.
(viii) Monitoring, Evaluation and Adjustment. The iterative character of the CBLM approach requires
regular analysis of what has been achieved and an assessment and updating of current plans where
necessary. This is particularly important in view of the limited number of predetermined project goals. Once
a year the process of participative planning will be repeated and the terroir development plans and associated
agreements updated.
7.     Conclusion - The CBLM  approach is participative and flexible. It moves a great deal of the
authority and responsibility for detailed project planning and execution to the local communities and the
support units financed by the project. There is no blue-print for success in this type of activity and results
will depend on the skill, determination and energy of the project staff and the capacity of the local
communities to respond to their efforts. Experience has shown that suitably motivated and capable personnel
are available in the region who, with appropriate training and technical support can effectively undertake the
task.

A NOTE ON INDICATIVE COSTS FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE
INVESTMENTS.
Introduction - The participative, decentralised planning process of Community-based Land
Management (CBLM, or gestion des terroirs) means that it is not possible to pre-plan the detailed
investments to be undertaken in each village. The decisions on what activities relating to land improvement
and infrastructural investments would be made by each village association, following a procedure of
participative diagnosis of problems, potentials, resources and needs. The types of investments will depend on
the characteristics and particular circumstances of each village. The costs and implementation details of
each activity will also depend on the site. However, some approximate costs of possible activities in land
management and infrastructure investment are presented below.

SOCIAL ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
I.    This Annex outlines the key social factors that have been considered in the design of the project, and
which need to be considered during the implementation. The approach used in the Annex follows the Social
Guidelines for Biodiversity Projects' proposed by ENVSP in 1994.
CURRENT SOCIAL CONTEXT
2.     The local stakeholders or affected population at all three sites are the traditional residents and migrants,
both being resident in the project area. The traditional residents are the accepted "owners" of the rights to the land,
though in recent years they have lost their influence for political reasons. The majority of the migrants are Lobi,
originating in southwest Burkina Faso. They started to migrate about ten years ago, mainly attracted by the
opportunities for employment as laborers for commercial yam cultivation. There are also some Mossi and Fulbe
immigrants, and a few pastoralists, also Fulbe, cross the region with their cattle. The transhumants remain only
between January and April in the project areas.
3.     Potential conflicts will arise as the traditional residents increasingly try to contain migration. Although
not yet widespread, there is conflict between long-term residents and Lobi migrants, the latter being accused of
causing environmental problems ranging from soil degradation to poaching. The project's gestion des terroirs
strategy will provide a frame work for tackling this problem and for resolving disputes. In the medium term it will
also provide a methodology for analyzing the present and future capacity of each area to receive new migrants.
4.     There are three main factors in the current social context which affect biodiversity:
(i) Migration: even if the current population density is low (about 5 people/kin2), the number of new
migrant families is increasing every year in all three project areas,
(ii) Agricultural Cropping Patterns: commercial production of high yielding yamn varieties requires new
land every one to two years followed by 10 to 15 years fallow. This leads to a very rapid expansion of the
agricultural front and to extensive soil depletion.
(iii) Illegal Hunting: all ethnic groups in the area hunt. This is the greatest threat to the remaining large
animal populations in the area. There is considerable demand for bushmeat, particularly in the C6te d'Ivoire,
where local hunters supply not only the neighboring towns of Ferkesedougou and Dabakala, but also markets as
far away as Abidjan.
5.     Other human activities that may in the future threat to biodiversity include logging, fuel wood gathering,
fishing, livestock production and uncontrolled burning. While these activities have not impacted the project areas'
I " Incorporating Social Assesment and Participation into Biodiversity Conservation Projects" ENVSP, March 30th,
1994.



APPENDIX 4
Page 2 of 7
biodiversity, it is still important that project implementation ensures that they are controlled and subject to rational
management plans.
6.     Traditional Wildlife Management Systems are disappearing because it is in the short term interest of
both residents and migrants to bypass the traditional rules and exploit wildlife for quick commercial profit. This
practice is only worsened by the competition that now exists between resident and migrants for the few remaining
animals. Nevertheless, the Village Hunters Associations in Cote d'lvoire are well organized and represent the
interests of the traditional resident hunters. In Burkina Faso the traditional associations had mostly disappeared.
The current association of hunters, whose creation has been encouraged by the forestry department, may not be
representative of the traditional hunter associations. In both countries the Associations exclude the Lobi migrants,
who are often active hunters. Consequently they have little capacity to control wildlife utilization by the migrants
through social pressures.
7.     The lack of effective implementation of national policies on decentralization is an important socio-
political factor in both countries. In the Cte d'Ivoire, the government is preparing a legal framework for
decentralization. In Burkina Faso the law already exists (Loi de Reorganisahon de l'Administration Territoriale
du 6juin 1993) and the next steps are being reviewed by a National Decentralization Commission. However, it is
implemented at the local level only through gestion des terroirs projects. The absence of formal decentralization
structures has in the past prevented local populations from securing legal tenure rights over natural resources and
land. The project, because it takes a gestion de terroir approach, will help clarify the situation in all three
project sites.
SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
8.     The project can be expected to have several positive results:
(i) Decision making. The establishment of the Village Associations, and subsequently the AGEREFs, will
enable, for the first time, all the traditional and migrant residents, to participate in the formulation of development
strategies toward which the project will contribute funding;
(ii) Capacity building. The project's support for political decentralization is new for each project site. A
considerable amount of training in technical and management skills and institutional development will be given to
the members of the project teams, and to both individual Village Associations and the inter-village Associations
(AGEREF). This will enable local communities to assume effective long-term responsibility for the management
of their resources.
(iii) Collective development perspectives. At the village level, the financial benefits generated by the
project, within two years of project start, will provide an important incentive for the development of a community-
based natural resource development system.
(iv) Changing livelihood strategies. The current agricultural production systems in the three project sites
are not sustainable; Without the project's intervention, revenues from both farming (particularly yam production)
and commercial hunting will decline over the long term. The project changes this perspective and will establish
sustainable resource management systems. There will be some initial short term declines in revenue due to the
adoption of a new land-use and production strategy, but this should be compensated for by investments in socio-
economic infrastructure and, subsequently, revenues from wildlife utilization.

(v) Gender. At the moment little is known about the bushmeat marketing systems, though it is clear that
women, usually the hunters' wives, smoke bushmeat and sell it to the local markets. It is also wornen who manage
the local restaurants that serve the meat ("les maquis'). These women currently benefit considerably from
commercial, often illegal, hunting, and some provide hunters with ammunition. Clearly these women will lose
income during the first years of the project.
(vi) Employment. It is estimated that the project will generate local employment in multiple aspects.
First, the wildlife and habitat management and monitoring activities will employ villagers in fire management, anti
poaching, wildlife inventory, and general day-to-day management of the area. Second, numerous infrastructures
will be built or rehabilitated and then maintained annually using High Intensity of Labor technique; such
infrastructure range from wildlife area boundary, local tracks, road improvement, small dam construction, and
building of project housing and offices. Finally, safari hunting will require the employment of a small number of
guides, cooks, porter, etc.
MITIGATION ACTIONS
9.     The project has been designed and planned in a number of ways to minimize or avoid potentially negative
impacts for the areas' population. Table I describes in detail the potential negative social impacts of the project,
the project-specific context of these impacts, the intrinsic project design factors that mitigate the potential negative
impacts. Necessary mitigation actions are also described. In general. the project was designed in such a way as
to maximize benefit to the population and minimize negative social impacts:
(i) Resettlement. No resettlement or voluntary relocation of houses will be required by the project. The
wildlife management zones will be so sited as to avoid the need for resettlement and will assure minimum
disturbance to and by human activity.
(ii) Social Integration. The project will provide special training to assist the integration of all resident
groups, traditional residents and migrants into project planning and execution. The gestion de terroir Strategy
will also help in this respect. Once individual Village Associations are able to work effectively and effectively
present and defend their interests, they will be helped to form larger inter-village groups, the AGEREFs, that will
provide the base for an associative management of the natural resources of the area.
(iii) Minority and Less Powerful Groups' Interests are provided with special attention through the
gestion des terroirs strategy and the process of community-based needs analysis (see Appendix 2). These
concerns will be included in the planning of project activities and will be also be factored into the monitoring
process.
(iv) Bushmeat marketing studies - that will accompany the opening of hunting in the Cote d'Ivoire will
greatly increase understanding of the complex marketing system of hunting and bushmeat. They would also
indicate the social and political influences that are important to the market at the local, regional and national level.

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
1.    The project objective is environmental in essence: it is to contribute to the conservation of
areas in one of West Africa's most diverse and threatened ecosystem: the Comoe (see maps at the
end of the document).  It builds upon a new approach to conservation that promotes the
rehabilitation and sustainable utilization of wild plants and animals simultaneously for the benefit
of local communities and for the conservation of biodiversity. The land allocated for wildlife
management is free of human settlement and cultivation, and no resettlement of either human or
production system will be undertaken. In the long term, the project should result in the effective
and durable protection of 3000 km2 of pristine species-rich wildand in a regionally important
ecosystem. Without the project, it is estimated that within 12 years all large mammals will have
gone extinct and within 25 years the entire are will have been turned over to unsustainable
agriculture. The project will have a number of additional positive environmental impacts: (i) it
will contribute to the conservation of existing biodiversity in an area currently threatened by
rapidly expanding human activity, (ii) it will restore the large animal communities,(iii) it will
develop and demonstrate an alternative land use that is sustainable, profitable and environmentally
benign that could consequently become a model for other national park buffer zones and areas
recently liberated from onchocercaisis, (iv) it will test a computer model prepared during
preparation that simulates the project activities and compares them to a without project situation
over a 25 year period, and finally, (v) it might also have a marginal positive impact on global
warming and watershed protection.
2.     Alternative strategies that in theory also aim at sustainable and profitable conservation,
have been tested using a model prepared during Project preparation. These alternatives include: (i)
private game ranching, (ii) protected area development, (iii) Government managed hunting zones.
Game ranching, because of high recurrent costs was modeled not to be profitable for its operators
and would provide no or very little revenue to the community. Park development would have to
rely on non-consumptive use of the areas, such as ecotourism, for cash earnings. It was estimated
that the tourism potential of these areas was not sufficient by itself to compensate the community
for not converting the land to agricultural use. Finally, not only would a Government managed
hunting zone possess all the disadvantages of a centrally managed project, but also would prevent
the diversification of activities necessary to achieve a profitable equilibrium.
POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT
3.     Conservation of biodiversity - The project will protect about 3000 km2 of a near pristine
mosaic of Sudanian savanna and Guinean forest habitat . If measures are not taken, cultivation
will have consumed all the site's land within 25 years. This would have a disastrous effect on the
local biodiversity. Furthermore, since these areas are adjacent to the Comoe National Park, they
See Annex 1 on biodiversity for a presentation of the sites, their current condition and their global importance for
biodiversity conservation



APPENDIX 5
Page 2 of 10
will act as buffer and contribute to biodiversity conservation in the park by diminishing people's
pressure on the park boundaries.
4.     Rehabilitation of the large fauna population - Approximately 60% of the project area is
still pristine and most non-game species remain in a healthy state. On the other hand, due to
uncontrolled hunting most of the large mammal species are in a potentially precarious state; all
large mammal species would become locally extinct within 12 years. The project will enable these
populations to become reestablished. For example, the expected impact of the project on two
important species (Alcelaphus buselaphus major and Hippotragus equinus) is illustrated in Figure
I which shows their probable fate without project and a conservative path for their recovery with
project.
5.     Research and Development - The pilot nature of this project and the lessons that can be
drawn from its implementation will be extremely important. If successful, GEPRENAF would
have several far reaching consequences and influence the design of many conservation and land use
projects in the future. Firstly, the pioneering of community-based wildlife utilization in West
Africa would provide a useful strategy to conserve other areas and would prove that wildlife
conservation can be a profitable alternative land use in certain parts of West Africa. Second, the
2
project would provide a suitable model for buffer zone management . Third, the project through
its monitoring and evaluation system will provide lessons on wildlife management and in particular
on the impact of biological buffers and corridors on national park wildlife populations. Fourth, the
results will be particularly important as operational strategies for sustainable economic
development and natural resource management are being actively sought for the areas recently
freed from river blindness.
6.     Protection of the Comoe upper watershed - Soil losses from extensive agricultural
activities can be significant in this area particularly. Continued cultivation of the banks of the
Comoe, Leraba and Kinkene Rivers could lead to significant soil erosion and siltation of the river
and increased turbidity. This in turn could impact negatively many downstream activities
associated with the Comoe system. The project, which will prevent further human settlement on
the river banks in the project area, will therefore contribute to the Comoe River protection.
7.     Contribution to reducing global warming - By preserving significant stands of healthy
forest and woodland, the project contributes a global benefit in the form of carbon storage.
Without the project, the depletion of substantial forest cover would decrease the carbon storage
ability of the area thereby diminishing its contribution to global warming mitigation, even though
very limited on the global scale.
POTENTIAL NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
8.     Even though the project should improve the global environmental quality, it is possible that
without proper attention some project activities might have negative impact on the environment.
These actions, their possible impact, project design factors incorporated to limit the damage, and
proposed mitigation actions are listed in the attached table.
2Wells and Brandon, in Peoples and Parks (World Bank/WWF/USAID, 1992), analysed existing buffer areas
worldwide and concluded that none could be considered as functionning adequatly.



APPENDIX 5
Page 3 of 10
MITIGATION ACTIONS
9.     The description and implementation details of the different mitigation actions, listed in the
righthand column of the table, are integrated within each of the project components. Therefore,
this mitigation "plan" does not require a specific budget to be implemented. A budget line, which
includes the financial means to mobilize the necessary material and man power, already exists
within each project component. The implementation of each mitigation action will be the
responsibility of the Technical Support Unit.
10.   Neither all possible environmental impacts nor the magnitude of the considered impacts
can be fully estimated. Consequently, the TSU will carry out a basic Environmental Assessment of
all new investments before their implementation. Furthermore, a monitoring system will be put in
place which, as well as monitoring project performance, will enable the project participants to
detect any unforeseen negative environmental impact. Measures would be taken to appropriate
funds to prevent or mitigate these effects.  The supervision of this component will be a
responsibility of IUCN and the National Coordinator.
11.   It is estimated that 2% of the Technical Support Unit (through design and monitoring) and
10% of the IUCN input (through review of project design) would be spent on Environmental
Assessment of project activities.

BURKINA FASO and COTE D'IVOIRE
GEPRENAF
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
INTRODUCTION
1.    GEPRENAF is an innovative pilot project. The project will test and develop a strategy of
community-based biodiversity conservation and the explore the possibility of using sustainable
wild resources utilization as an incentive for improved habitat management. Many important
implementation details will be determined by the participants during implementation, rather than at
the pre-implementation planning stage. Detailed and suitably adapted monitoring program will
therefore be essential if the progress of the project is to be effectively followed. Monitoring will
also be an important tool for adaptive management, ensuring that both problems and potentials are
identified as early as possible and appropriate action can be taken.
2.     Section 1 of this Appendix describes the main components of the monitoring program,
identifies the main indicators for each component and outlines the evaluation process. Further
operational detail is provided on the important Ecological Monitoring (Section 2) and Socio-
economic Monitoring components (Section 3).
3.     Reliable quantitative and qualitative indicators will be necessary to monitor the evolution
and impact of the project. This will concentrate on four main aspects; (i) institutions and local
capacity, (ii) socio-economics, (iii) ecology, and (iv) project management and implementation.
Wherever possible local, village-level techniques will be used to ensure the maximum participation
of the local communities and sustainability of the system. However, more sophisticated techniques
will be required in certain areas to supplement these data.
4.     The aim of the monitoring program is to established a field-based system to track the
physical, conceptual and technical progress of the project, and to evaluate its impact on both the
environment and the lives of the communities in the project area. Particular emphasis will be
placed on establishing quantifiable parameters that can be easily collected on a regular schedule.
The monitoring process will be structured to ensure direct feed back to the project staff and "target
population" for each of the four main implementation components of the project (Local Capacity
Building, Habitat and Wildlife Management; Natural Resource Utilization and Processing; Land
Management and Infrastructure Development.)
5.     The monitoring program identifies who needs which type of information for what sort of
decisions. In doing so, it enables the program to focus on the collection of data required for
operational use and to reduce the collection of non-essential information. The main questions to be
asked for each of the four monitoring topics are: Why is the information being collected ? Who
needs it ? How will it be collected? Who will collect it ?, and What will be done with the results ?
INSTITUTIONS AND LOCAL CAPACITY MONITORING
6.     WHY '? To follow progress in local capacity building and local participation in project
planning and implementation. To determine when key steps in institutional development can be
made and to identify unplanned needs for additional institutional support.



APPENDIX 6 Section 1
Page 2 of 10
WHO needs it ? Primary Users - TSU, IUCN, AGEREF and Villagers; Secondary Users- National
Coordinators and Donors.
HOW will it be collected ? Detailed records on training and local participation in project activities.
Regular evaluation of capacity of villages to undertake key planning, implementation and
monitoring tasks.
WHO will collect it ? Mainly the TSU, with support from Village Associations and villagers
WHAT to do with the results ? The results will provide feedback on the impact and efficiency of
the project's training programs and provide project staff with indicators of when key steps in
institutional progress of the project - creation of the formal AGEREF, replacement of TSU
members by local personnel - can be taken.
ECOLOGICAL MONITORING
7.     WHY ? To assess whether the project is achieving its goals in increasing wildlife
populations, protecting biodiversity, stabilizing land use and improving agricultural production
systems. To evaluate the ecological impact of habitat management techniques, wild resource
utilization activities, land management operations and socio-economic investments..
WHO needs it? Primary Users - TSU, AGEREF and villagers: Secondary Users - National
Coordinators and Donors
HOW will it be collected ? Village-level ground surveys, and professional ecological monitoring
techniques using low-level aerial surveys, systematic ground transects and satellite image analysis.
WHO will collect it ? The TSU, IUCN, AGEREF, Villagers, the two national Universities and
specialized contractors.
WHAT will be done with the results ? The results will provide essential feed-back on the
effectiveness of management techniques to achieve project goals at each site. They will also
provide early warning of any possiblc negative environmental impacts. The need to improve or
modify both management strategy and technical methods would be identified as part of the
management Strategy.
SOCIO-ECONOMIC MONITORING
8.     WHY ? To determine impact of project activities on the lives of the population of the
project area, to determine whether expected benefits are being realized and to obtain information on
local perceptions of project progress and applicability to local concerns. Specifically, to follow the
flow of project benefits to all sections of the community and determine whether project benefits are
offsetting short-term losses due to project. To ensure that all groups are adequately represented in
project decision making. To identify any unexpected negative impact.
WHO needs it ? Primary Users-TSU, IUCN, AGEREFs and Villagers; Secondary Users- National
Coordinators and Donors.
HOW will it be collected ? Mainly village-level surveys undertaken by the TSUs and villagers.
WHO will collect it ? The mobile teams of the TSU and Villagers.
WHAT to do with the results ? The results will show whether expected benefits - both in cash and
in improvements in quality of life - are reaching the target population and indicate whether these
benefits are sufficient to offset foregone revenue.  This will enable project management to
determine changes in strategy necessary to ensure future participation of the population.



APPENDIX 6 Section 1
Page 3 of 10
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
9.    WHY ? To follow use of financial and human resources in project implementation and to
provide essential background information on the viability of planning targets, implementation
costs, and use of man-power.
WHO needs it ? Primary Users - TSU, IUCN and AGEREF; Secondary Users - National
Coordinators and local coordinating committees, and Donors.
HOW will it be collected ? Detailed annual planning, financial accounting, physical inventories,
systematic record keeping of implementation (staff and labor requirements, quantities etc.)
WHO will collect it ? The TSU, AGEREF,audititors.
WHAT to do with the results ? A regular comparison of project targets and achievements will
provide a practical yardstick for improving the precision and viability of project planning process
and identifying implementation constraints and bottlenecks.
MONITORING ACTIVITIES AND TECHNIQUES
10.   The Institution and Capacity Building component is best described by input and output
indicators that are measurable using the project day-to-day Management System, e.g. number of
training days, creation of Village Association, etc.. The same observation can be made of Project
Management and Implementation. However, ecological and socio-economic project objectives
have specific, tangible output. This requires a proactive data collection and analysis system that,
even though coordinated by the regular Management System, is not intrinsically part of it. It is
necessary to enhance the list of indicators provided by a description of the proactive monitoring
systems. Therefore, APPENDIX 6 is supplemented by two Sections to present the framework of
ecological and socio-economical monitoring (see SECTIONS 2 and 3).
MONITORING INDICATORS:
11.   The following tables summarizes the indicators that could be used in the monitoring
process. Selected bench mark indicators, against which project evaluation is to be carried out, are
identified ahead of the other indicators for each component. A final decision on indicators would
be made by the project team and advisors during the Project Launch Workshop.

EVALUATION
12.     It is estimated that four independent evaluations of the project impact will be necessary
over the 5 year project life. These evaluations will take part during standard supervision and will
rely on data collected through the permanent monitoring program and supplemented, if necessary,
and at the request of the TSU and IUCN, by specific surveys.
13.     The first evaluation will be organized at the end of year 1.  The objective will be to
determine (i) the impact of the GT approach on villagers activities and {ii) the success of the GT
approach at convincing villagers to allocate the required land to wildlife management. The
benchmark indicators describing Institution and Capacity Building as well as Project
Managementand and Implementation will be evaluated. In addition other indicators related to (i)
zoning of village terroir, (ii) participation of villagers in project induced activities (including all
representative groups), and (iii) capacity/readiness of villagers to formalize the inter-village
communication and relationship necessary for the creation of the informal AGEREF.
14.     The second evaluation will be organized at the Mid-Term  Review. The objectives will be
to analyze the impact of the project using all benchmark indicators. This evaluation will attempt
'Detailed physical targets can not be preparedfor this component as specific investments will be decided by the local
communities during project implementation. Indicators will therefore need to be established during the
detailed, village-levelplanningphase.

to link each project output, through its benchmark indicators, to the project. input that triggered it.
The goal is to enable the selection of an appropriate course of action for the second half of the
project.
15.    A third evaluation will be organized one year before the end of the project.  This
evaluation will be similar to the mid-term evaluation, but it will specifically assess the likelihood
of project sustainabili.y and either, maintain the project on its current track, recommend minor
changes, or recommend a follow up phase of the project to the Govermment and other interested
parties.
16.    The final evaluation at project completion will again review all benchmark indicators, but
it will focus on analyzing the lesson leamed, i.e. reasons of failures and successes and
recommendation for future operations, and identifying suitable follow-up actions.

ECOLOGICAL MONITORING
INTRODUCTION
1.     The monitoring of biodiversity will take place at two levels: at the local-level carried
out by the community, at the project-level carried out by scientific specialists. There are two
main reasons for this.  First, because of the pilot character of the project and its unique
approach to conservation, biodiversity must be monitored very closely with appropriate and
modern techniques.  Such close monitoring will be executed throughout the project life.
Second, a cheap and simple, but efficient, community-based monitoring system is crucial to
assure continuation after the end of the project. A summary of the methods is presented in
Table A6-1.
2.     Monitoring of several different types of ecological indicators will be carried out. First,
game-species need special attention because, they are the most immediately threatened and
because it is through them that the economical sustainability of the project is reached.
Therefore, the population sizes, group/herd composition, age and gender structures,
distribution and offtake will be monitored very carefully. Second, several species are good
indicators of habitat quality. By their very presence or absence, they indicate whether a certain
set of conditions, required for their survival, and thus for the survival of species living in
similar habitat, are met. For example, chimpanzees are considered good indicators of low
human disturbance, spiders indicate an array of micro-climatic conditions and birds of prey
indicate the presence of abundant prey species. Species that also require special monitoring are
keystone species; which enable the existence of other species. For example, aardvark dens are
necessary to shelter numerous ground-dwelling animals such as porcupines.  Finally, the
dynamics and resilience of the habitat itself needs to be monitored quantitatively and
qualitatively. Quantity, refers to the surface area of habitat available for conservation, e.g.
free of agriculture encroachment, and quality refers to the availability of resource required by
certain species for survival within the habitat, e.g. nutritious grass for grazing species.
SCIENTIFIC MONITORING
3.            Scientific monitoring will be directed and organized by professional ecologists
contracted by the TSU. They will use the methodology already established for the monitoring
system set up for the adjacent Comoe National Park (CNP)l.  Homogeneity in method is
extremely important to compare the evolution of animal populations and habitat in a baseline
environment (the CNP) and in a dynamic, managed environment (the GEPRENAF sites).
4.      Monitoring of animals - In the past, animal populations have been monitored in the
CNP with aerial surveys accompanied by road strip censuses. The same methods will be used
in the GEPRENAF sites. Both methods provide estimates of animal densities, group sizes and
distribution. Road strip censuses are necessary to corroborate aerial surveys and to provide
densities of small species, such as duikers, not visible from the air. Furthermore, road strip
censuses are extremely important to collect detailled data on gender ratio and age classes.
They also provide useful information on nocturnal species.  Both methods need to be

APPENDIX 6 SECTION 2
I'age 2 of 4
supplemented by foot surveys and random point sampling to corroborate results and to observe
indicator or keystone species2 not visible by either of the two other methods.
5.      Vegetation monitoring - Changes in vegetation cover will be monitored yearly using
satellite images SPOT3 supplemented by ground truthing activities.   This will provide
information on the temporal and spatial changes in land use, i.e. the position of the agricultural
front and of new villages, and on the evolution of the vegetation cover within the conservation
area, i.e. stages of succession, sizes of forest islands, effectiveness of the bushfire management
program, etc. The ground truthing of satellite images will be accompanied by site specific
sampling activities.  Composite 360 photographs would be taken from  fixed locations at
different seasons during the project life. This would monitor the succession of individual
plants and sensitive sites, and assess their sensitivity to known events, e.g. repeated fire,
storm, elephants etc. Grazing pressure, at different points of each area, would be monitored
by point sampling of grass cover and species composition.
COMMUNITY-BASED MONITORING
6.             The monitoring program executed by the villagers will focus on the revenue-
earning resources, particularly game-species and easily identifiable indicator species. Data on
these species will be gathered using foot transects, informal collection and offtake check
points.
7.      Foot transect - Community teams, supervised and trained by consultants in charge of
scientific monitoring, will carry out 80 annual foot transects4 and associated analysis at each
site.  Analysis of the data collected will generate information on population size, group
composition, gender and age ratio and distribution for each game species and for selected
indicator species. The results of the foot survey will be compared to the results of the aerial
surveys over five years to establish whether a compensation factor is needed and, if necessary,
its value.  The hunting quotas will be established from  the villages-based results (verified
initialy by the TSU member in charge of the ecological monitoring).
8.     Informal data collection - Informal continuous monitoring will be performed by the
anti-poaching patrols.  The guards and the village auxiliaries will be trained to collect
information on several easily identifiable species. This information will be collated by the
TSU for analysis by the scientific monitoring consultants.
9.     Animal utilization - In addition to the live animal monitoring program, exploitation of
game species will be monitored. This would be through a village-based checking system in
which hunters provide voluntarily the head and hooves of the animal taken, for gender and age
identification, as well as information on the location of the kill for species distribution analysis.
The animal parts, e.g. trophy, will be returned to hunters if they request it. This information
will also be collated for analysis by the TSU member in charge of ecological monitoring.
2 A list of indicator and keystone species to monitor will be established in the first project year

area to collect observation data to determine species' population densities

GEPRENAF
SOCIO-ECONOMIC MONITORING
INTRODUCTION
1.     Even though GEPRENAF is a biodiversity conservation project, its success will partly
be measured through the improvement of specific and local socio-economic indicators. Viewed
from a social angle, GEPRENAF aims to develop a new integrated land-use system that is
more sustainable and more profitable for the local communities than the current slash and burn
agriculture. The Project also aims to improve the quality of life for all groups through
investment in socio-economic infrastructure.   The improvements are necessary  if the
communities are to participate effectively in achieving the projected biodiversity conservation
goals. In order to verify that the well-being of the whole community increases in a fair and
equitable manner, the set of indicators presented in Section 1 of Appendix 6, will be
monitored.
OBJECTIVES AND INDICATORS
2.     It is expected that the well-being of the community will improve because of enhanced
family income. This would come firstly from the local intensification of agriculture, decrease
in immigration and pastoralism, and improvement of market access. Secondly, a great number
of villagers will receive the benefit of project related employment such as wildlife
management, anti-poaching and infrastructure construction.  Finally, it is expected that
revenues from hunting and natural resources utilization will increase over those from
agriculture.
3.     Continuous monitoring of these indicators is necessary. First, it will ensure that the
project is maintained on track and allow corrective actions to modify the project strategy.
Second, because of the pilot nature of GEPRENAF, it is crucial to ensure that any
improvement or degradation can be linked to its cause. This will enable better replication of
the community utilization concept in other locations.
METHOD
4.     The practical objective of this component is to compare data on the evolution of project
indicators with the initial project target indicators  This is necessary to determine whether the
project benefits compensate lost agricultural revenues and provide an adequate incentive for
sustainable conservation.  To be representative of real community conditions, the socio-
economic monitoring will be carried out at the family and village level. The trends will be
compared with a baseline condition and with similar villages not affected by the project.
5.     Socio-economic data will be collected in several ways: (i) by the mobile team of the
TSU using a permanent village survey, (ii) by villagers for specific data and (iii) using data
The baseline data will be entered in the socio-economic model prepared during project preparation to measure progress and
calculate the expected evolution of indicators.



APPENDIX 6 Section 3

collected by remote sensing methods2. Most of the survey work will be carried-out by the
TSU. The team members will be required to collect data in the villages in which they are
developing the activities linked to the gestion de terroir approach. A survey and data analysis
method will be prepared during the first months of Project implementation. The members of
the mobile team will be trained in data collection. The mobile team will also spend one month
per year surveying villages not included in the project. These villages will represent a control
sample, against which the project impact can be measured.
DATA SET
6.     Section 1 of Appendix 6 presented a list of indicators.  These indicators will be
analysed using representative data samples collected at the village level. For example, to
construct the indicator "change in villagers' income due to project" a set of data on
agricultural income, employment income, forest product gathering income, dividend from
safari hunting, etc. need to be collected in subsequent years. A list of data required to build
the indicators is provided in Table A6-2.
