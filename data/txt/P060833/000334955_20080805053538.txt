1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (16554-TA) had the primary
development objective of broad-based economic growth with poverty reduced by about 5
percent by 2000. To realize this development objective, it planned to (i) improve and
stabilize fiscal performance; (ii) strengthen the base for economic growth by giving a high
priority to the rural sector and facilitating private sector investments; (iii) improve
environment management; (iv) liberalize prices and marketing; (v) improve market
integration and access to productive assets and services; (vi) improve the efficiency of social
services and target vulnerable groups; (vii) improve expenditure efficiency; (viii) eliminate
redundancies and build capacity; (ix) enhance performance of regulatory functions; and (x)
eliminate opportunities for rent-seeking and enforce accountability. The Public Service
Reform Program (PSRP) was expected to directly support a number of these objectives by
systematically introducing a strategic process that would focus public service managers on:
(i) more efficient use of limited public resources through selected decentralization options
and enhanced private sector participation in service delivery; and ii) sustainable
improvements in capacity and overall performance.

The Government of Tanzania (GOT)'s objective was to "restart progress in poverty reduction
by raising growth performance and extending access to basic social and economic services".
The World Bank and other donors supported this objective mainly through sector
development programs (SDPs) and other programs aimed at improving the performance of
the MDAs. From a systems perspective, the PSRP's interventions were critical to effective
implementation of the development processes initiated under various SDPs. While the SDPs
mainly provided physical material and sector-specific inputs for the development processes
that were expected to improve the supply, quality and access to basic social services, the
PSRP, together with the other main institutional reform programs (Public Financial
Management Reform Program and Local Government Reform Program), were expected to
provide the "systemic" inputs (systems, policies, rules and regulations, and others) to the
development processes.

The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was selected as the most appropriate for the sequenced,
programmatic and long-term implementation strategy that the Government had adopted.

To assess the performance of such a large and cross-cutting reform program, there is a need
to be aware of the particular contextual conditions of Tanzania and their implications for the
design and implementation of the PSRP Phase 1 (PSRP1).

    · Tanzania's unique social and ethnic structure will be familiar to most readers. The
        country has many small tribes and groups, none of which have the power to exercise
        political or economic domination. Intermarriage and other inducers of social capital
        have been rapidly eroding whatever tribal differences still exist. Efforts at public
        sector reform such as the PSRP1 thus had a better chance of being depoliticized. Elite
        attitudes to reform, especially those at the political and bureaucratic levels, appear to
        have been more supportive compared to those in many other low-income countries.




                                                1

   · The Tanzanian political system has been organized on the basis of what has been
        called `uncompetitive pluralism'.    This system provided the country with stable
        governance over the life of the PSRP1 and the opportunity to apply a consistent
        approach to public sector reform.

   · Tanzania has had a tradition of reform and national collective action going back to the
        Arusha Declaration in the mid-1960s. The current efforts at public sector reform thus
        derived some legitimacy from their connection to this historical undercurrent of
        change and the promotion of public goods though state action.

   · Since the early 1990s, Tanzanian decision makers tried to make more of a separation
        between the political and the bureaucratic spheres of public action. In the case of the
        PSRP1, Tanzanian public servants were given the space to design and manage the
        program with only modest amounts of political intrusion compared to many other
        countries. No interest groups outside the public sector ­ commercial, ethnic, regional
        or foreign ­ were able to capture the processes of state decision-making or resource
        allocation. Tanzania also appears to have had lower levels of informality in its public
        sector compared to many other low-income states.

   · The GOT and its development partners (DPs) had evolved a set of shared institutions
        over the last decade that had improved collaboration on development co-operation
        and given the Government the space to develop its operational ownership. This
        learned capability of both the GOT and its DPs to collaborate was in evidence on the
        PSRP1.

   · The Tanzanian public service had its own culture and patterns of behavior that
        showed influences of past and current eras in governance including colonialism,
        African socialism and the market-focused approach.         The Government was also
        engaged in a series of reforms across most aspects of its operations including finance,
        legal and local government. In practice, there could have been few countries in the
        world with so many reform initiatives in the public sector going on at any one time.

   · The Government did not have deep pools of capabilities upon which to draw to
        manage public sector reform.          The impact of Human immunodeficiency
        virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) had inflicted staff losses on
        many MDAs, a trend that aggravated the skills gap especially in technical and
        managerial activities. The public service also showed generational differences with
        many older members who joined in the 1970s and early 1980s more skeptical of the
        value of yet more reform initiatives.

   · Demand-side pressure or claims from the `public' were growing in Tanzania but did
        not yet add up to a driving force for public sector reform. Non-state actors such as
        private sector firms, international corporations, civil society organizations, trade
        unions and the media were also growing in influence but were not yet in a position to
        reshape a reform strategy. Part of the challenge to any effort at public sector reform
        (PSR) was the need to engage and form productive relationships with non-state actors.

The PSRP1 was thus operating in a country characterized by relatively low politicization and
relatively high levels of commitment and motivation. In such a context, conventional reform



                                              2

strategies focusing on the procedural, the technical and the logistical had a better chance of
being effective.

It is, however, important not to overdraw this point about lower levels of politicization. As is
the case in any country, decisions about the way public sector reform programs allocate
power, resources and opportunities and to whom had political aspects. The design of the
second phase of the reform program ­ the PRAP - includes provision for the ruling party
manifesto to shape the direction of reform.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Underpinning the PSRP1 was the core idea of transforming the public service into "an
institution of excellence playing a pivotal role in achieving sustained national economic
growth and prosperity and eradication of poverty in the 21st century".1

To support this idea, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of the PSRP1 in 1999 set out the
following hierarchy of goals, purpose and objectives.

    · The overall goal was to improve public expenditure efficiency and to build capacity to
        manage for economic growth and poverty reduction.

    · The program purpose was to ensure that service delivery within priority sectors of the
        public service conforms to public expectations for value, satisfaction and relevance by
        end-2011.

    · The program development objective was to improve accountability, transparency and
        resource management for service delivery in the public service.

The 1999 PAD saw these objectives being achieved in the following stages:

    · The installation of performance management systems (2000-2005).
    · The reinforcement of a performance management culture (2005-2008).
    · The implementation of quality improvement cycles (2008-2011).

1.3 Revised GOT program objectives and indicators

The adaptation of the GOT program objectives in 2003 retained the goal and purpose of the
PAD. The revised GOT objectives focused on a series of intermediate outcomes related more
to capacity investments in the public service and less on direct improvements to service
delivery.2 In effect, the sequencing and timing of the PRSP1 activities were altered to pay
more attention to strengthening the foundations of public service reform. The governing

50% of central government service users were dissatisfied. 50-75% of local government users were dissatisfied.




                                                      3

assumption was that improved service delivery would emerge in the medium and longer-term
from capacity improvements to MDAs in the short and medium term.3

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The revisions to the program document in 2003 restructured the pattern of the potential
beneficiaries.    Less direct attention to service delivery meant less immediate gains for
individual citizens although some would benefit through the improved operations of some
MDAs and also the new executive agencies in areas such as the Land Registry or the Passport
Office. The main beneficiaries in the short and medium-term became the central agencies
and MDAs of the GOT located mostly in Dar es Salaam.

1.5 Original Components

Part A: Phase 1 Program Components. The PSRP was designed to support the
consolidation of the on-going cost-containment and institutional reforms initiated under Civil
Service Reform Program (CSRP). The CSRP had a fairly comprehensive program covering
the following components:
    · Performance Improvement.
    · Restructuring and Private Sector Participation.
    · Executive Agencies Program.
    · Management Information System.
    · Leadership Management and Governance
    · Program Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation

PSRP1 (2000-2005) added two components to the ones initiated under CSRP, namely: (i)
Performance Improvement; and (ii) Program Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. This
reflected a shift in focus to: (i) institutionalizing a strategic process to sustain these structural
reforms; and (ii) achieving capacity improvement in the quality of public services. The other
components were retained in the new program.

Performance Improvement. This component was designed to initiate a long-term process of
sustainable capacity building and the transformation of the public service to result-oriented
management. The component aimed at introducing a simple and feasible management
process-the PIM. This would focus public service managers on utilizing strategically the
limited public resources towards service improvements in line with the Government's overall
policy and public expenditure priorities. These strategic plans were expected to be consistent
with sector development strategies, Government policy objectives and strategies in the
ongoing local government reform and the public financial management reform. The strategic
plans were also expected to reflect broad consultations with clients and stakeholders.
Demonstrated commitment and achievement to improve services would facilitate MDA's
access to other budgetary incentives. Within this framework, the PSRP was expected to
support processes to (i) clarify the role of the MDA; (ii) strengthen capacity in key areas
identified during the strategic process; and (iii) define appropriate institutional incentives for
performance.



3From the Tanzanian perspective, the PSRP1 rested on an assumption that "the better an organization is
managed, the better it will perform". PRSP End of Program Report, p. 4.




                                                     4

Program Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. CSRP management monitored inputs
and outputs well. A comprehensive quarterly progress report was prepared and distributed to
all key stakeholders on a timely basis since 1995.                    Under PSRP, it was planned that
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will cover outcomes and impact assessment in terms of
changes in quality of and access to public services, responding to public expectations for
value, satisfaction and relevance of services. In this framework, it was anticipated that the
implementation of the MDAs' strategic and annual plans would be independently monitored
and evaluated using participatory approaches. It was also envisaged that information,
education and communication activities would involve the public more directly in decisions
related to service delivery and give them a voice to report and rate the public service's
performance in delivering services. The changes in the GOT program document in 2003
shifted the focus of M&E on capacity improvements in MDAs. Since the outcomes and
impact of this program were to be closely linked to the effective implementation of the
complementary reform programs, i.e., PSRP, local government, public financial management
and sector development, it was foreseen that the PSRP's M&E activities would signal the
need and opportunities for strong program coordination.                     This component would also
facilitate the coordination of strategies, policies and implementation among the programs.
The GOT recognized the need to build skills in addition to putting in place a robust M&E
system. This component was key to the success of the PSRP and was expected to be given
high priority at the outset of Phase 1.

The subsequent two phases of the program were viewed as a logical development, following
a successful completion of Phase 1. After installing the strategic process for sustainable
performance improvement, and the new institutional framework for service delivery, the
focus of Phase 2 (2008-2012) would be on instituting a performance management culture in
the public service4. Once this has been achieved, then total client orientation through
continuous quality cycles (benchmarking, total quality management) will be introduced in
Phase 3 (2013-2015).

Part B: Establishment of a Distance Learning Center (DLC). An additional component
to the PSRP was the establishment of a DLC. The DLC was to be established as an
autonomous nonprofit agency, housed in the Institute of Finance Management (IFM), to
deliver training mainly to the public sector through videoconferencing facilities.

1.6 Revised Components

The 2003 revision retained the original 6 components, but regrouped them differently, with
minor changes in the content. The Executive Agencies component was merged with the
Restructuring and Private Sector Participation component. Human Capital Management and
Pay Reform component was set apart to emphasize the need to control establishment and
motivate staff. Integrity and Diversity was established as an additional component to give it
the desired prominence. Part B of the project relating to the TGDLC was merged under the
Leadership, Management and Governance component.




4Due to the delay in the completion of phase 1, the timelines of the subsequent phases of the program, i.e.
PSRP2 and 3 have been changed to 2008-12 and 2013-15, respectively.

This ICRR rearranges and expands these categories for ease of grouping and understanding.
This list also follows the analysis in the PRSP1 End of Programme Report that remains the
most comprehensive document on outcomes and results achieved.

    · Performance Improvement
    · Restructuring and Private Sector Participation (includes Executive Agencies)
    · Human Capital Management and Pay Reform
    · Leadership, Management and Governance
    · Integrity and Diversity
    · Management Information Systems
    · Program Co-ordination, Monitoring and Evaluation

1.7 Other significant changes

At the request of the Government, the DPs stopped making individual transfers of funds in
2005 and began using a common basket arrangement in an effort to reduce the transaction
costs of the GOT and improve inter-DP coordination. For this reason, the Bank changed the
Financing Agreement to adapt to basket financing arrangements.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Most of the basic assumptions of the core design of the PSRP1, e.g., its overall approach to
public sector reform, its overall objectives and its positioning within the structure of the
Government ­ remained appropriate and relevant over the life of the program especially after
the revisions in 2003.

Two design weaknesses became apparent during the implementation of the PSRP1. Both
have been addressed in the second phase of the reform program, the Program Results and
Accountability Project (PRAP).

    · First, the design relied too much on standardized approaches to the reform of the
        MDAs. As will be discussed later, the general structure of the relationships between
        the PO-PSM and the MDAs proved to be too supply-driven in terms of encouraging
        change and reform.5

    · Second, the estimates of the time required to implement and institutionalize the
        complex reforms inherent in the design of the PSRP1 proved to be unrealistic. This
        issue of time is also discussed later in this ICRR.

Continuation of past phases of public sector reform

The Government and the DPs crafted the design of the PSRP1 based some on the lessons and
achievements of both the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-sponsored

reforms in the late 1980s and the Civil Service Reform Program (1992-1999), the previous
phases of PSR in Tanzania. Both these program focused more on staff retrenchment, the start
of the Executive Agency (EA) program, reduction in staff costs, restructuring and salary
reform.    The PSRP1 thus represented both continuation (e.g. the expansion of the EA
program) and change (e.g. the shift towards the application of more systematic PSM). In
practice, the PSRP1 was a seven-year phase of a thirty-year program of PSR extending to
2015. This combination of continuation and change on the PSRP1 appears to have made it
easier for a range of Government participants to understand and absorb the reforms.

The emergence of Tanzanian ownership and control

The design process in 1999 can be seen, in retrospect, as a critical transitional point. In the
two earlier phases of reform beginning in 1985, external consultants in collaboration with
country participants largely dominated the crafting of strategies and the control of
implementation. These consultants were supplied using conventional packages of technical
assistance (TA). In the 1999 appraisal process, the Tanzanian participants exercised more
influence over the design of the PSRP1. In effect, Tanzanian ownership and control emerged
during the design phase and remained in place over the life of the program.

The integration of the PSRP1 into the Government structures

The previous reform program ­ the Civil Service Reform Program ­ had operated on the
basis of a project implementation unit (PIU). The PSRP1, at the request of the Government,
restructured this approach in three key ways.

    · The design of the PSRP1 did away with the project implementation unit (PIU)
        approach of the previous phase and integrated the PSRP1 into existing Government
        structures.

    · More specifically, the Office of the President rather than Ministry of Finance assumed
        the accountability for the management of the PSRP1. The rationale behind this
        decision was the greater capacity of the PO-PSM to deal with the strategic
        management issues particularly those to do with human resources that were likely to
        emerge during the PSRP1.

    · The design of the PRSP1 opted for a more cautious approach to system-wide reform.
        It did not pursue dramatic restructuring or major changes to the existing MDA
        systems. It focused more on encouraging incremental reforms that had a greater
        chance of being absorbed and institutionalized.

2.2 Implementation

Implementation of the PSRP has generally been satisfactory. The capacity of the President's
Office ­ Public Service Management to manage the program has significantly improved
during implementation of the PSRP. This has led to a stronger ownership of the program by
the government and a more constructive engagement between the government and
development partners.

Changes in Government's program document. In 2003, Government decided to change its
program objectives and implementation modality following an output-to-purpose review


                                              7

(OPR) , the Bank's mid-term review and a stakeholder's review of the pace of
        6

implementation, direction and impact of the PSRP. Government recognized (i) the weak
collaboration among PSRP component managers; (ii) poor coordination with other
institutional reform programs; (iii) the need for stronger coordination between development
partners in support of the program; and (iv) the indirect link between improvements in public
service reforms and service delivery. It is to address these weaknesses, that government, in
agreement with development partners, modified its program objective to focus on creating an
efficient and motivated public service and to streamline the implementation of the program
by adopting a Sector-Wide Approach program with pooled funding arrangement. Therefore
government ensured that its program was more in line with client expectations and findings
of the various reviews. In addition, it was also more in line with existing capacity and less
ambitious.

Implementation through pooled funding arrangements. In 2003, government reviewed
the PSRP program document, which led to changes in the program objectives to ensure they
are closely in line with the expected achievements of phase 1. To improve coordination and
harmonization, the government proposed to development partners the establishment of a
pooled funding arrangement under a Sector Wide Approach program (SWAp). The Bank in
collaboration with other development partners ­ DFID, Denmark and Ireland agreed to a
pooled funding arrangement which was established in January 2005.

Mid-Term Review April 2003. A mid-term review of the PSRP was carried out in April
2003. The review concluded that the project was progressing well, although at a slower pace
than anticipated. This led to extension of the closing date of the project from December 2004
to June 2006. The project was again extended for 12 months to June 2007 and later by six
months to December 2007. The other two extensions were necessitated in part by the need to
ensure phase 1 achieves its desired outcomes and also to ensure adequate preparation and
smooth transition to the second phase.

External Review April 2005. An external review of the project was undertaken in April
2005 to inform the government and development partners on implementation progress. This
review concluded that the program needs to devote more time and resources to ensuring that
the basics of Public Service Reform are in place to ensure success. These basics included (i)
enhanced establishment control, rigorous recruitment and career management, discipline and
the regulatory role of the Public Service Commission (PSC) to ensure compliance; (ii)
strengthened relationships between ministries, executive agencies, and private sector
provision and better incentives to foster accountability, and (iii) continued pay reform,
enhanced career management (e.g., new recruitment criteria and procedures under the PSC)
and other rewards, combined with the implementation of the Performance Management
System itself, to stimulate better performance.

Public Service Reform Program Working Group. The Bank has provided leadership to
the DPs in engaging with the government since 2004 through the Public Service Reform
Program Working Group (PSRP-WG). Regular meetings between the Bank and DPs on the
one hand and between the Bank and government on the other have served to provide a
sounding board for critical decisions that government has taken to implement the program.

The contribution of other DPs either through own staff time or consultants was instrumental
to ensuring effective supervision of the project.      In general, a trustworthy relationship
between the development partners and the government has been built over the course of
implementing the PSRP, thus contributing to effective implementation of the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The PSRP1 made good progress in establishing an internal monitoring and evaluation system.
From the outset, the Bank and other DPs created the space, time and resources for the PO-
PSM to develop its own approach to M&E. The PO-PSM established an internal unit that to
date has produce a series of quarterly monitoring reports detailing both the progress on the
PSRP1 and across the public service as a whole.7 These PSRP1 reports can be found at the
PSRP1 website www.estabs.go.tz.

Three other aspects of the M&E activity were important:

    · First, it took the PO-PSM 3-4 years to develop an effective M&E system. The task of
        crafting indicators to assess capacity and program effectiveness proved to be
        especially challenging not only in terms of their design but also their acceptance as a
        tool for PO-PSM management. The current approach to M&E is included in the PAD
        for the PRAP.

    · Second, the development of an effective M&E system depended on more than the
        mastery of technique. Underpinning the system was a willingness of the PO-PSM in
        general and senior managers in particular to highlight and learn from both progress
        and failures. In practice, the PO-PSM and its DPs put in place a constructive pattern
        of learning and exchange in which the DPs provided space to the PO-PSM in
        exchange for the provision of realistic tracking and information.

    · The PO-PSM worked to help other MDAs to develop and use their own M&E
        systems. Progress on this activity has been mixed and depended on MDA willingness
        to invest in M&E, general PO-PSM relationships with a particular MDA and the
        nature of the technical work of the MDA.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no fiduciary, environmental, social or safeguard problems. The overall financial
management of PSRP1 was satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Bank approved the PRAP in September 2007.              Co-financing with Department for
International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) is now in place and will be managed through the common basket arrangement similar
to that in PSRP1.




7See the State of the Public Service Report 2004.




                                                   9

Four aspects of the PRAP will be key:

    · Part of the PRAP will be devoted to completing the specific reform agenda initiated
        under the PSRP1. This will include further attention to pay reform, the continued
        installation and institutionalization of the PSM techniques and the completion and
        functioning of the Human Capital Management Information System (HCMIS). The
        PO-PSM will also continue to give more attention to building the capabilities of the
        MDAs across a range of activities such as public outreach, human resource planning,
        executive agencies and diversity, records management and HIV/AIDS.

    · Under the PRAP, the relationship of the PO-PSM to the MDAs will change from a
        supply-driven to a much more demand-driven approach.                  The Performance
        Improvement Fund of the PSRP1 has been eliminated. All program funds dedicated
        to the performance improvement of the MDAs will be allocated through regular
        budget allocations and in line with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
        (MTEF). The PO-PSM will shift to a more facilitative support role.

    · The PRAP will promote a much greater outreach to non-state actors including the
        private sector, civil society organizations, training institutes and professional
        associations. In practice, this emphasis reflects a realization that the ultimate fate of
        public sector reform in Tanzania will depend upon its ability to gain acceptance and
        legitimacy of the wider Tanzanian society through improved service delivery.

    · The PSRP1 approach to DP co-ordination and the common basket fund mechanism
        will remain the same in the PRAP given its general effectiveness and acceptance
        amongst both the Government and the DPs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the PRSP1 were relevant both in terms of the priorities and plans of the
Government and the overall country assistance strategy of the World Bank and the other DPs.
In 2005, the Government launched a National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty
based on three key aspects (i) growth and reduction of income poverty (ii) improved quality
of life and social well-being (iii) good governance and accountability. The Government
regarded this third aspect as the foundation of the first two. The National Strategy thus
reflected the key assumption that a capable and effective public service was critical to
achieve rapid economic growth and poverty reduction. The PSRP1 was thus positioned at the
heart of the overall Tanzanian development strategy.

But in assessing the outcomes of the PSRP1, it is important to keep in mind some sense of
proportion and scale. The PSRP1 was only one of at least five major public sector reform
programs. In addition, most MDAs were also implementing their own sector strategies,
which involved some aspect of institutional reform.          In practice, the PSRP1 was a
strategically important but still modest part of the overall Government program of state
reform and an even smaller part of the overall Government development budget. It did not,
by itself, make up the total approach to public sector reform in Tanzania.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Government has estimated the rate of achievement of the project objectives up to mid-
summer 2007.8 56% of the PSRP1 targets were produced to the levels expected. The
remaining 44% ranged from modest to significant progress.

Table 1 from the PRSP End of Programme Report sets out the breakdown of this aggregate
by components.9 Table 2 also tracks a series of milestones beginning in 2003 that give
another indication of progress to date.10 More documentation can be found at Annex 2 of this

The expenditure analysis of the PSRP1 can be found in Annex 2 p. 5. Actual expenditures
reached between 50 and 75% of budget target each financial year.

Component 1: The installation of performance management systems (PMS)

The intent of the PSRP1 was to install PMS in all MDAs in an effort to reprofessionalize the
public service, improve its results orientation and make MDAs more accountable. Tools
included strategic and operational planning, client services charters, self-assessments,
performance budgets, improved M&E, the introduction of the Open Performance Review and
Appraisal system (OPRAs) and the establishment of a Performance Improvement Fund (PIF).
Table 3 below sets out the overall progress of the Performance Improvement component.11

PLANNED TARGET                    ACHIEVEMENT
PMS installed in 34 MDs              Achieved. PMS installed in 25 Ministries, 9 Independent Departments
                                     and 21 Regional Secretariats

budget of about $12.5 Million        implemented.12
100 Quick wins implemented           Not Achieved in full: no Quick wins implemented and no Business
                                     Process Improvements (BPIs) completed


Individual elements include the following:

    · The progress on the installation of strategic and operational planning can be rated as
         mixed.     All 34 MDAs received training and support to develop results-oriented
         strategic plans to implement a comprehensive PMS. PO-PSM in collaboration with
         MOF and Ministry of Planning, Economy and Empowerment prepared a manual to
         assist MDAs to harmonize strategic planning and budgeting. Different MDAs moved
         to adopt these techniques at varying speeds and levels of enthusiasm. Some larger
         MDAs such as Agriculture or Health, for example, already had developed their own
         approaches to performance improvements, which they favored over the PO-PSM
         interventions.13 In general, the supply-driven nature of the PMS initiative did not fit
         well with MDA expectations.

    · The PIF was an attempt at inducing change and reform in the MDAs that did not
         prove effective. The original intent in the 1999 design was to combine MDA access
         to additional funding and technical support from the PO-PSM to encourage capacity
         improvement and performance. A variety of constraints, however, emerged during




11See Figure 16, PRSP End of Programme Report, p. 16

12  As will be discussed below, the administration of PIF funds needed to be strengthened. According to the
EDI report of February 2007 143 approvals were made but only 43% of these reached the no objection
(procurement) stage.

13The Department of Fisheries, example, was implementing a $61.0 million program of improvements. It did
not see the added value of the PSRP1 interventions.




                                                      12

         implementation that limited progress.14 The transaction costs involved in the PO-
         PSM processing of MDA applications turned out to be too onerous and too slow. PO-
         PSM control of the PIF diminished the sense of MDA ownership. Some MDAs tried
         to access the PIF for basic supplies and equipment. The PIF was weakly linked to
         MDAs Strategic Plans and had none with the MTEF.

    · The use of OPRAs by all MDAS was made mandatory under the new act establishing
         the public service commission. About 2,500 Government staff were trained on their
         use. Adoption, however, has remained patchy. The compliance rate is estimated to
         be about 51% for a variety of reasons.               The initial OPRA forms were overly
         complicated to complete. Some public servants remained skeptical of their intended
         use especially for promotion purposes. Little dissemination took place at the middle
         and lower levels of the MDAs or in field offices. The prognosis, however, is for their
         increasing use as staff become more familiar with the techniques.

    · The installation of client service charters were designed for all MDAs and Regional
         Secretariats.   But most are not yet operational.              Citizens did not use them for
         demanding services. Public campaigns to publicize their use were limited. MDAs
         have not monitored the impacts of the charters and have not amended them to
         generate greater legitimacy.

Progress in this component is rated as satisfactory.

Component 2: Restructuring and private sector participation (PSP)

This component was designed to restructure and reconfigure selected aspects of the national
public service including executive agencies, private sector participation and MDA
restructuring. Table 4 below sets out the restructuring targets and achievements for this
component.15

    · Between 2000 and December 2007, the Government established twenty (20) new
         executive agencies raising the total to 28, the most of any Government in Africa. By
         the end of the PRSP1, these EAs covered functions as varied as land registration to
         airport management. Two independent evaluations conducted for the PSRP1 judged
         the use of EAs as being appropriate to Tanzanian conditions. Their performance to
         date has generally been judged to be encouraging.




14By late 2006, 29% of the PIF approvals had gone to support retooling, 59% for training, 9% for technical

    · The shift to EAs was not another universal solution to all Government performance
         issues. By 2007, the staff of the 28 EAs comprised only about 5% of all public
         servants.    Those with less ability to charge for services have remained largely
         dependent on state funding. There are, in fact, indications that central government
         subsidies to EAs are increasing rather than decreasing, the reverse of the conventional
         predictions. In a number of cases, the performance measures and the information and
         monitoring systems to assess EA performance have not been put in place. Hence the
         principal-agent relationship with supervising ministries and departments has not
         always functioned effectively.

    · Efforts to involve the Tanzanian private sector suppliers in outsourcing and non-core
         service delivery accelerated after July 2003. By the end of the program, 68 contracts
         had been signed and were being implemented. Another 128 were being negotiated.
         Contracted out services included activities such as tailoring, transportation and
         aircraft cleaning. Assessments of the outcomes of the PSP component has shown
         improvements to the quality, level and costs of services such as transportation of staff,
         housing maintenance and messenger service.16


16The Economic Research Bureau of the University of Dar Es Salaam completed an independent assessment of
the PSP component in late 2007.




                                                    14

   · The PO-PSM assisted in the establishment or design of 15 new ministries and
        departments. In addition 19 ministries and departments were restructured and another
        12 were scheduled. Most of these changes involved the delegation of a range of
        centralized functions to MDAs. An independent Public Service Commission was
        established in 2004 based on a new act approved by the National Assembly. The
        centralized procurement function shifted to ministerial procurement boards.
        Responsibility for personnel management was delegated to the MDAs with the new
        PSC providing support and inspection. All MDAs established units to carry out
        information, education and communication functions (IEC). The National Records
        Management Act was passed in 2002 and new systems were rolled out to 34 MDAs
        and 39 local government authorities. MDA capabilities to address the challenges of
        diversity and disabilities were substantially improved. Most MDAs can now better
        respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis by using the strategy outlined in the National
        Guidelines for Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS in the Public Service drafted by the PO-
        PSM. By the end of 2007, seven MDAs had developed the units to deal with citizen
        complaints and questions.

Progress in this component is rated as highly satisfactory.


Component 3: Human Capital Management and Pay Reform

The goals of the PRSP1 under this component were basically twofold: to improve pay and
allowances for public sector staff and second, to reform the way human resources were
managed. Eight of the 15 objectives were implemented as planned. The balance showed
varying degrees of success. A detailed account of the planned and achieved progress in this
component can be found in the PRSP1 End of Programme Report.17

   · Tanzania has a long history of addressing pay reform since the virtual collapse of
        salaries and benefits in the mid-1980s.18 The Government pay scale, in common with
        many countries, had traditionally been compressed at certain levels with low salary
        differences in the lower and middle grades. Staff were forced either to take on second
        and even third jobs to survive or to leave the public service for better paying positions
        in the private sector.

   · Over the lifetime of the PSRP1, the Government made incremental efforts to improve
        pay and benefits. The initial attempt at improvement was the implementation of the
        Selective Accelerated Salary Enhancement (SASE) Scheme whose purpose was to
        augment the pay and benefits of about 1500 key staff in 4 MDAs. For a variety of
        both political and technical reasons, the Cabinet canceled the SASE scheme in 2004.
        In the meantime, the wage bill in the Government increased rapidly from both

        increases in staff, pay and allowances. In an effort to develop more sustainable
        approaches to implementing the MTPP, the Government appointed a Presidential
        Commission with the mandate to review the pay issue. Government is now preparing
        an implementation plan.

    · Progress was made on the pay issue during the PSRP1. The average salary of a
        Tanzanian public servant has increased by an annual compounded increase of 17.85%
        or a total of 215.7%. After inflation, this would represent upward adjustments of
        12.1% and 122.1%. By May 2006, salary levels were 82% of the MTPP targets. By
        2007, the Government had fully achieved its pay reform targets. Even with these
        achievements, pay levels in the public service are still low, compared to similar
        positions in public enterprises and the private sector. As a result, public servants
        continue to be perversely motivated by allowances largely in the operations budget.

    · The PSRP1 addressed human capital management issues to do with budgeting,
        recruitment, transfer, promotions and disciplinary action. The new Public Service
        Commission carried out part of this activity. Within the PO-PSM, the Establishment
        Division was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the payroll.

The effort during the PSRP1 to develop and implement the HCMIS bumped up against a
series of implementation constraints, few of which were foreseen at the design stage. These
are listed below to give readers a sense of the implementation difficulties involved. Progress
on the HCMIS was the least satisfactory element of this component.

    · It proved difficult to come to a shared understanding within the PO-PSM and the
        MDAS on the specific software to be used for payroll and HC management. A
        number of MDAS showed a lack of interest in the HCMIS system.

    · The information technology (IT) upgrading program had to keep pace with the speed
        of change in the IT industry. Over time, various versions of software were retired and
        were no longer serviced.

    · The prime contractor for the installation of the HCMIS suddenly opted out of the
        contract soon after the start of implementation.

    · Three key PO-PSM technical staff were suspended after being accused of
        inappropriate conduct.

    · Only contract PO-PSM staff could be employed given the difficulty of attracting
        permanent staff on regular pay and benefits.

    · The small IT industry in Tanzania made it difficult to follow conventional
        procurement procedures.

    · The shift to the common basket funding in 2003 shifted the source and pattern of
        technical support coming from the DPs.

    · The technical staff in the PO-PSM found it difficult to manage the procedural and
        logistical challenges of procurement.




                                               16

    · Unlike the effort to install the PMS in the MDAs, the IT staff in PO-PSM were
         continually confronted with deadlines to do with salary payments and payroll
         adjustments.

The progress of this component is difficult to specify in the aggregate. Progress on pay
increases for targeted groups was moderately satisfactory. Salary targets were exceeded.
Nevertheless, the establishment of a system that would ensure greater transparency and
control of the payroll, the HCMIS, was by and large unsatisfactory.


Component 4: Leadership, management and staff development component

This component focused on the objective of strengthening leadership and management
capabilities at various levels of the public sector.            Two out of six main targets were
implemented as planned. The remaining four generated varying degrees of progress. Table 5
sets out the planned and achieved targets.19

                                        issued to MDAs to instruct them to develop training plans (Circular
                                        20-Nov-06).
Civil Servants Trained in Leadership,   Achieved. Over 4,000 persons trained.

Assessment Centers Established          Not fully achieved, but a leadership competence framework was
                                        completed during December 2007.
Public Service Training Policy          Not fully achieved. A Policy was drafted but is not yet approved. The
approved and implemented                circular on foreign recruitment in the Public service was updated
Capacity of the TNBC Strengthened       Handed over to the BEST Programme under MPEE
Capacity of TPSC and DLC enhanced       Achieved.


    · Training focused mainly on leadership, customer care, OPRAs and Information and
         Communication Technology (ICT). A total of 4009 public sector staff were trained or
         about 4% of all central Government staff. The PRSP also assisted MDAs to install or
         roll out a series of human resources systems such as frameworks for HR planning and
         training needs assessment. A draft training policy was also completed in 2007 but has
         not yet been reviews or approved by Cabinet.

    · The PO-PSM prepared a leadership competency framework in 2007 which sets out a
        range of various leadership competencies and the ways these can be encouraged,
        trained and rewarded.

    · With respect to training institutes, both the Tanzanian Public Service College (TPSC)
        and the Tanzanian Global Development Learning Center (TGDLC) made good
        progress using PSRP1 support. The TPSC trained almost 20,000 people during the
        period 2003-2007. The TGDLC gained in revenue, courses offered and numbers of
        participants. The TGDLC is also now in the process of devolving services to four
        regional hubs.

This component is rated as satisfactory.


Component 5: Integrity and diversity

The purpose of this component was two fold: first, to restore and promote ethical conduct in
the Tanzania public sector and second, to promote diversity in the public sector including
more attention to HIV/AIDS, gender and disabilities. Table 6 sets out the planned and
achieved targets.

Table 6: Ethics and Diversity Targets


PLANNED TARGET                    ACHIEVEMENT
MDAs Capable of internally           Not fully achieved: Though all MDAs have Ethics Committees which
monitoring, inspecting, and          are supposed to undertake these functions and though MDAs have
sanctioning unethical behavior       been trained on inspection and other issues, Ethics Committees are
                                     only partially functioning
Public Awareness of Ethics           Achieved. Codes of Ethics have been disseminated, weekly radio
Enhanced                             shows were produced, and numerous articles were placed in the
                                     newspapers

MDAs                                 not yet implement formal diversity management programmes.
Capacity of Female Civil Servants    Achieved. 140 women completed Masters Degree programmes while
Strengthened                         45% of the 4,099 people trained under PSRP I were female


HIV/AIDS programs                    Achieved. Guidelines have been drafted and distributed. All MDAs
implemented in MDAs                  implement HIV/AIDS interventions through the budget



    · The PO-PSM implemented a wide range of ethics awareness-raising activities
        including radio and television programmes and training. An operational manual was
        also issued for complaints handing units. Seven MDAs now have dedicated units to
        handle public complaints about public sector staff behavior. The PO-PSM has also
        carried out surveys analyzing the prevalence of corruption in the public sector.

    · The PO-PSM focused on four aspects of diversity: gender, disability, HIV/AIDS and
        compensatory skills training. A Unit within the PO-PSM prepared a series of manuals
        on subjects such as managing HIV/AIDS and disability in the public sector.

This component is rated as satisfactory.


Component 6: Management Information Technology and Systems

This component was aimed at improving computerized and manual information systems.
Activities included the training of public servants, the installation of systems, the provision of
equipment and infrastructure and the development of guidelines. Table 7 sets out the planned
and achieved targets.20

                                       environmental impact assessment were completed. PSRP Phase 2
                                       (PSRP II) will facilitate construction and equipping the centre.
National Archive Services              Achieved. German colonial records are being scanned and archived.
Improved                               Historical records of first presidents are being treated specially.


     · MIS capacity did improve in all MDAs under the PSRP1. Most MDAs developed
         websites that were well equipped through the PSRP1 in terms of computers and other
         ICT tools. MIS strategies were developed in 10 MDAs and about 650 staff trained.
         Seven MDAs developed through the PSRP1 stand-alone MIS departments. Initial
         steps were taken to create the basic infrastructure for e-government. But these steps
         remain poorly co-coordinated.

     · The PSRP1 made good progress on manual file management including the installation
         of upgraded systems in 34 MDAs and 64 local governments.

This component is rated as satisfactory.

Component 7: Program Coordination, Monitoring and evaluation

This component was designed to provide support functions to the other programme activities
of the PSRP1 including progamme coordination, IEC, policy guidance and monitoring and
evaluation. Eight out of 11 targets were implemented as planned with the 3 remaining
showing smaller gains. Table 8 sets out the details.22

Table 8: Programme Management and Coordination Targets


PLANNED TARGET                ACHIEVEMENT
An M&E System in place and      Achieved: PO-PSM uses web-enabled M&E software that allows all
operational within PO-PSM       employees to enter data and view performance reports. A wide range of

    · The M&E function within the PO-PSM developed steadily over the period. And most
        MDAs also developed the basic M&E capabilities. The PRAP, however, will need to
        provide more support to this function both within the PO-PSM and most MDAs.

This component is rated as satisfactory.


3.3 Efficiency

No net present value or economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated for the program. The
PRSP1was an exercise in public sector reform by country participants with some TA support
from the Bank and other DPs. Attempts to determine an ERR are in such cases not useful.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

This ICRR has assigned ratings to individual components. Annex 1 sets out the ratings
assigned to each of the individual components of the PSRP1. The overall ICRR rating of
satisfactory is based on an aggregation of the ratings.

The rationale for this rating is as follows:

    · The pace of reform under the PSRP1 did not match pre-implementation predictions.
        Some important objectives remain unmet. But on balance, the PRSP1 did represent
        substantial gains in developing the foundations for further reform and in improving
        the ability of a wide variety of actors within the Tanzania public sector to manage
        complex change.

    · The outcomes of the PSRP1 are rated as satisfactory when matched up against the
        challenges that appeared during implementation. The latter included the unexpected
        time required for consolidation, the incremental pace of acceptance of certain policy
        changes at the political level and the barriers to complex learning amongst and across
        the PO-PSM and the MDAs.

    · The pace and effectiveness of reform under the PSRP1 compares favorably in terms
        of results achieved and pace of reform with other similar public sector reform
        programs in Tanzania such as the PFMRP, similar initiatives in other African states
        such as Ghana or Uganda and even those in many high-income countries.

Rating: Satisfactory


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The shifting pattern of Tanzanian ownership, commitment and adaptability

As mentioned earlier, much of the effectiveness of the PSRP1 stemmed from country
ownership and commitment at both the political and bureaucratic levels. But it is helpful to
disaggregate these general conditions and look at their specific dynamics in the Tanzanian
context.    Such analyses need to be more specific, i.e., which individuals or groups or
organizations are committed to what and why and for how long.



                                               21

    · The high levels pattern of commitment and energy in Phase 1 that sustained the
        program in the early and middle stages was based largely on the combined support
        from the two Presidents, the PS of PO-PSM, the PO-PSM staff and the DPs. But the
        influence of this informal grouping began to diminish by the end of the program as
        more uncommitted Tanzanian actors began to play a larger role in the implementation
        of the program. Part of the challenge facing the PO-PSM towards the end of the
        program was to help put together a wider pattern of ownership and commitment.
        Such an informal coalition included a range of actors such as more PSs, politicians,
        MDAs, non-state actors and informal public groups. In effect, the pattern and effects
        of the commitment underlying a program such as the PSRP1 needed to shift as the
        program itself widened and became more varied and complex.

    · This pattern points to strength of the PSRP1, i.e., the ability to both adapt to changing
        circumstances and also maintain the continuity needed for sustained action over the
        medium and longer term. These two interconnected streams were kept in place
        through an election cycle and changes in the top leadership of the public service.

    · Country ownership and commitment was not just based on a psychological sense or
        the natural outcome of a vested interest. In the PSRP1, these conditions also came
        about ­ or not ­ through the impact of specific organizational and logistical
        approaches. More specifically, the overly centralized and supply-side character of the
        PO-PSM role tended to constrain the growth of MDA ownership and involvement.23

Results, installation and institutionalization

The overall pattern and pace of progress of the PSRP1 showed a complex interrelationship
amongst three aspects of the reform process ­ achieving results, focusing on system
installation and encouraging institutionalization. In many cases, these different processes
moved at different speeds and needed careful sequencing. For example, some of the initial
scheduling of the PSRP1 centered on achieving sectoral results through improved service
delivery. The revisions in 2003 saw a de-emphasis on this objective and an increased focus
on the process of installation or the `roll-out' of new structures and systems such as the PMS,
OPRAs, M&E units, diversity and gender policies. Effective installation was thus seen as a
foundational step to achieving improved results through service delivery.

But in practice, this process of installation itself represented only a part of the larger process
of institutionalization or consolidation, meaning the understanding, legitimization, acceptance,
integration and mastery of these new techniques into existing organizations. In practice,
MDA management support, new patterns of incentives for MDA staff, greater efforts to
increase MDA demand, PO-PSM facilitation and importantly, the space for MDA staff to
assimilate, practice and learn, all of these were required to help induce the necessary changes.
In retrospect, this process of institutionalization represented a crucial step between, or
overlapping with, installation and implementation.

The pace of public sector reform thus required some sort of rough but shifting balance
amongst these three aspects. In some instances, too much pressure for short-term results
could constrain the process of installation. The 2003 revisions were an attempt to rebalance



23For an analysis of the reasons behind the lack of MDA involvement, see Kiragu et al., p. 5.


                                                     22

that relationship. Similarly, too much focus on rapid installation to meet preset schedules
could take the focus away from institutionalization. Some reform processes in some MDAs,
for example, lost momentum and focus once the installation phase was completed. This
process of institutionalization thus required a good deal more awareness, time and persistence
than was understood or acknowledged in the original design of the PRSP1.

This simple framework of results, installation and institutionalization can provide some
insight into the value of formal training on the PSRP1. The program did not depend on
comprehensive training programs to achieve its effectiveness. Indeed, some stakeholders
have pointed to the modest amount of training and direct capacity development at the
individual level as a weakness of the PSRP1.24 Overall, just over 4000 people were trained
mainly in leadership, the use of OPRAs, and ICT.25 Both the Tanzanian Public Service
College and the Tanzania Global Development Learning Center provided training support.
But this training was more effective in promoting installation than institutionalization.

The issue of time and timing

PSRP 1 represented an exercise in complex, ambitious public sector reform.             Such an
approach contained the usual dilemma with respect to the issue of time and timelines. Time
schedules that were too relaxed could well lead to a lack of urgency, application and energy.
But too many unrealistic schedules could produce a loss of external credibility and a
misplaced sense of poor performance amongst the participants.

As is almost always the case in public sector reform programs, especially those supported by
DPs, the initial design of PSRP1 opted for an ambitious set of objectives that, for the most
part, had little chance of being implemented within the projected schedules. This pattern
applied particularly to those activities such as MDA restructuring or pay reform that
depended on complex joint action at the bureaucratic level or on policy changes at the
political. Simply put, the PSRP1 design underestimated the time required for the complex
processes of political and institutional change to unfold. In particular, it did not take into
account the time needed for the process of institutionalization (discussed above) to unfold.
The revisions in 2003 were an effort to reset the time schedules.

Another issue to do with time and timelines had to do with the balance between a long-term
horizon of 20 to 30 years and the need for quick results to maintain momentum and
consolidate support. The long-term view was needed in the PSRP1 to reinforce the need for
strategic sequencing, a more realistic perspective on the achievement of results and DP
perseverance. The short-term could be useful for maintaining momentum, confidence and
commitment and for experimenting and learning about opportunities and constraints during
implementation.

                                                     23

Decisions about sequencing and selectivity

At one level, it is useful to be skeptical about engineering the sequencing of the complex
processes of reform given the uncertainties that arise during implementation. It is unlikely
that such processes will evolve in linear stages through a preset program of steps and phases
especially at the more micro levels. But from another perspective, the strategic choice of
program emphasis and points of entry over the medium and longer term - the macro
sequencing - can be critical to progress.

We can see both these aspects at work in the PSRP1.

   · The earlier phases of public sector reform in Tanzania beginning in the late 1980s
       focused on the conventional `first generation' reforms such as retrenchment, the
       elimination of ghost workers and cost reduction. These interventions were necessary
       at the early stages of reform but obviously not sufficient to ensure improved
       performance in the medium term. The CSRP program in the period 1991 ­ 1999 gave
       more attention to restructuring and pay reform.

   · The PSRP1 needed to maintain this macro sequencing. To do this, it addressed three
       key foundational aspects of reform. First was the design and implementation of a
       series of new institutions in the form of acts and regulations such as the Public
       Service Commission and the Public Procurement Acts. Second was the beginning of
       institutionalizing various systems and procedures within the public service such as the
       Performance Management System. And third was the creation and development of
       the PO-PSM itself whose mandate was to guide the management of reform. The key
       aspect of the PSRP1 approach to strategic sequencing was the emphasis on capacity
       development for complex reform as a critical foundation for later direct efforts at
       performance improvement and eventually service delivery. This overall sequencing
       was, in general, appropriate in the Tanzanian context and still guides the focus of the
       PRAP.

   · But it is not helpful to overdraw the idea of staged sequencing. In practice, the PO-
       PSM was forced to manage overlapping phases of change and reform. Attention to
       `softer' aspects such as cultural change originally projected to follow the `harder' or
       more structural elements, in practice, received attention regardless of the degree of
       progress on changing structures. Continued work on the `basics' such as pay reform,
       personnel information systems, training and operating budgets remained incomplete
       under the PSRP1 and had to continue under the PRAP.

   · A final sequencing issue on the PSRP1 had to do with choices about the allocation of
       resources to individual MDAs. It did not prove politically possible under the PSRP1
       for the PO-PSM to engage in selectivity, i.e., making some MDAs eligible for
       financial and technical support compared to others who would receive little or nothing.
       Experimenting with `pilot' projects that gave the impression of special treatment
       proved unsustainable. Sequencing in the form of simply directing resources to all
       MDAs but in some phased manner was required.

The harmonizing and co-coordinating of public sector reform

The overall process of public sector reform in Tanzania passed through a series of stages.
Individual programs such as the PSRP1 focused first on achieving their own particular
objectives. This pattern applied equally to the other major reform programs in the Tanzanian
public sector including the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP), the
Legal/Justice Reform Program (LSRP) and the Local Government Reform Program (LGRP).

At a certain stage in the implementation of the PRSP1, two major shifts occurred.

   · The need for greater inter-program coordination became apparent. This appeared to
       be a natural stage in the evolution of these programs as they grew in size, reach and
       complexity. In the case of the PRSP1, the existing structures both within the GOT ­
       the Inter-Ministerial Working Group ­ and the DP community ­ the Public Sector
       Working Group ­ did not prove effective to ensure this coordination. The response of
       the Government, now included in the PRAP, was to establish a new Office of Reform
       Co-ordination in the Office of the Chief Secretary of the Government.

   · The Government also needed to integrate better the various reform programs into the
       established system of national planning, budgeting and MDA management. The
       PRAP addresses this issue by funding MDA reform through the MTEF.

The influence of organizational and personal relationships

Current development thinking about public sector reform gives a good deal of attention to the
impact of change strategies, restructuring and incentives on organizational and personal
behavior. But another important influence on program outcomes in the case of the PSRP1
was that of organizational and personal relationships

   · On the positive side, the coordinated relationships amongst the DPs including the role
       of the Bank as the main liaison with the Government, in turn, strengthened the
       relationship with the PO-PSM in particular. The productive relationship between the
       Bank and the PO-PSM created a sense of trust, openness and space that allowed both
       sides to learn, discuss and make shared decisions over the life of the PSRP1. The
       relationship between the PO-PSM and key actors in its own authorizing environment
       particularly two Presidents and other PSs allowed for greater continuity and support
       from with the Government.

   · On the negative side, the organizational relationships between the PO-PSM and some
       other MDAs should have been more productive as has been discussed earlier. Other
       ways to structure these relationships were reviewed in some detail during the
       consultation phase for the PRAP. The relationships amongst the PO-PSM and a range
       of non-state actors also became a focus of attention during the latter stages of the
       PSRP1.

The importance of communication and awareness raising

A factor whose influence grew in importance over the life of the PSRP1 was that of
communication and awareness raising. Earlier efforts at public sector reform such as the
CSRP in the 1990s could be directed and implemented directly using a PIU. But as the


                                              25

sphere of action widened during the PRSP1 to include more actors that the PO-PSM could
only persuade and influence, the importance of communication and awareness raising
increased dramatically as a means of inducing collaborative behavior and support.

In practice, the PSRP1 bumped up against one of the basic dilemmas in public sector reform.
Control from the center and direct action could be useful in the early stages of reform and at
the very least, could give the appearance of progress. But as scope of reform widened out to
encompass more organizational actors, a great range of change strategies were needed
encourage joint action. Communication and awareness were prime examples.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)



3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No formal beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop was conducted for the ICR. Such
processes were widely employed during the design stage of the PRAP and did not need to be
repeated.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Medium to High

Public sector reform is an uncertain process in almost all situations. The sustainability of its
gains is sensitive to contextual conditions, political trends, loss of support, bureaucratic
conflict and sheer loss of interest and momentum. The PSRP1 has been able to achieve a
range of objectives that have been discussed earlier. But it remains vulnerable to weak
institutionalization and loss of political, bureaucratic and public support if it cannot show
gains in service delivery during the PRAP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

In many respects, the Bank's approach to the design and management of PRSP1 followed
most of the currently accepted principles of partnership and aid management championed in
the Paris Declaration.     The assessment of Bank performance is thus rated as highly
satisfactory.

(a) Bank Lending

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank supported a Government-led process that led to the design of the PSRP1 in 1999.
The key element in this process was the consolidation of Government ownership of, and
commitment to, the underlying points of entry, strategy and anticipated outcomes. This


                                               26

`space' for country ownership and the willingness of the Bank to be flexible and learn
collaboratively with the PO-PSM were two of the key elements of the `quality at entry'
effectiveness that underpinned the program during its lifetime.

(b) Bank Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The quality of supervision is rated as highly satisfactory. Three of the four      coordinating
groups charged with supervisory responsibility under PSRP1 functioned effectively. Bank
supervisory missions took place regularly twice a year and enabled the Bank to meet its
program and fiduciary responsibilities.

(c) Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank was instrumental in helping to consolidate external funding into a common basket
in 2004 that, in turn, acted to reduce the transaction costs facing the Government. Bank
leadership of the DPs continued through the balance of the program and appears to have been
welcomed by all the other participants.

The ability of the Bank to craft a constructive partnership with the Government in general
and PO-PSM in particular stemmed from two factors: the decentralized structure of the
country office and the consistency of its full-time staffing over the life of the PRSP1. Both
combined to provide the Government with an informed, steady relationship over the medium
term. The Bank provided the PO-PSM with sound technical advice on a range of subjects
such as IEC, IT, M&E, financial management and procurement.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating:        Satisfactory

Judgments on the performance of the Government must, given its dominant role in the
implementation of the PSRP1, be a good deal more complex to assess compared to those to
do with the performance of the Bank and other DPs. But the Government is at least as
responsible as the DPs for the success and weaknesses of the PRSP1. The rating assigned in
this ICR to the performance of the borrower is therefore satisfactory for the following reasons.

    · The Government through the PO-PSM took full ownership and management of the
       PSRP1 beginning in 2000 and managed it effectively with only intermittent
       consulting and supervisory support from the Bank.

    · The Government managed to sustain its role through the tenures of two Presidents and
       three Permanent Secretaries. This pattern of consistency and longer-term thinking
       was an important contributor to the progress of the PSRP1. These factors also help to
       explain the absence of policy or implementation reversals during the course of the
       program.



                                              27

    · The ambitious set of reforms that Government has undertaken in the past decade led
        to major challenges of coordination and harmonization and had a significant impact
        on the pace and outcomes of the individual reform programs. The progress of PSRP1
        was thus influenced by the difficulties in coordination of reforms and the motivation
        at the center of Government to ensure synergies and impact.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance

Rating:         Highly Satisfactory

The implementing agency, PO-PSM, developed the capability to learn and adapt during the
implementation of the PSRP1. Almost all key performance areas such as executive agencies,
pay reform, communication with the public, policy management, diversity and information
technology were the subject of PO-PSM analysis and review. As a result, PO-PSM has
gained substantial capacity in managing public service reform.

PO-PSM developed the ability to discuss its achievements and failures on the PSRP1 with
relative frankness and openness with both DPs and the public. Part of this had to do with the
overall trend within the Government to be more open and transparent. Hence, the activities
that progressed the least during PSRP1 ­ the HCMIS, the PIF, and the need for improved
inter-program coordination - were highlighted during the participatory design phase for the
PRAP and restructured accordingly.

PO-PSM provided adequate staff for implementing the PSRP.              It was able to utilize
effectively technical assistance to ensure it contributes to the relevant deliverables. With
adequate resources at hand, PO-PSM was able to implement workplans and effectively meet
its fiduciary requirements in relation to financial management, procurement and external
audit.

(c)     Overall Borrower Performance

Rating:         Satisfactory

The performance ratings of the Bank and the Borrower cannot simply be analyzed
independently. The PSRP1 was a case in which both sides contributed to a productive
relationship. Both managed to balance the issue that lies underneath the surface of most post-
Paris aid relationships: too much country control and lack of openness can lead to DP
dissatisfaction.   But too much DP intrusiveness can undermine the sense of country
ownership that is so important for effective implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

The importance of Tanzanian leadership

The process and pattern of change in the PSRP1 indicates the critical importance of
leadership at different levels of the Government. In retrospect, the design of the reform
strategy of the PSRP1 was a key factor in subsequent performance. The contextual factors
were generally enabling. The relationships with the DPs were largely supportive. But what
integrated these elements and focused them on productive outcomes was the nature of
Tanzanian leadership.



                                              28

Three aspects of this leadership stand out.

    · First, political support and direction began in the Mkapa presidency beginning in
        1995 and continued through the life of the PSRP1 including the transition in 2006 to a
        new president.      Leadership from this level provided the protection, buffering,
        legitimacy and stability needed by the PO-PSM to push ahead with the reforms.

    · Second, the bureaucratic leadership of the PO-PSM helped to develop the confidence
        of PSRP1 staff and to promote its influence within the senior levels of the public
        service. Much like the political leadership, this pattern of supportive bureaucratic
        leadership was sustained over the life of the PSRP1 and kept the longer-term
        perspective in place. This leadership could also supply the strategic and technical
        skills needed to manage a complex program of reform.

    · The PSRP1 benefited from a particular style of leadership that was oriented towards
        the needs of public sector reform. Leadership that valued task achievements and
        substantive results over capacity development would not have been as effective. The
        PSRP1 style emphasized confidence building, patience, longevity and a genuine
        interest in reform and change.

The understanding of the importance of leadership shifted over the life of the PSRP1. The
initial design in 1999 included no specific attention to this issue. By the time of the design of
the PRAP in 2006, the participants had realized its importance and had included specific
attention to it in the design of the new program. Leadership was also seen as something that
was required at all levels of Government structures rather than simply at the top.

Building the PO-PSM

A key outcome of the PSRP1 was the capacity development of the PO-PSM, the main
Government agency with a mandate to manage system-wide change and reform.                   One
perspective on this process is to disaggregate this emerging capacity into four capabilities, all
of which were essential for effective PO-PSM performance.

These were the following:

    · The capability to carry out technical, managerial and logistical tasks
    · The capability to adapt and change
    · The capability to engage and form relationships with other actors
    · The capability to achieve greater coherence both internally and externally

A more detailed review of the performance of the PO-PSM could track the development of
these capabilities over the period 2003 to 2007.

The relevance and applicability of the new public management

Much of the initial design of the PSRP1 was based on a connected set of concepts called the
`new' public management. These included ideas to do with accountability for results, the
power of incentives, quasi-contractual relationships, citizen charters, strategic planning and
targeting, attitudinal change, the separation of policy and delivery usually in the form of
executive agencies, decentralized authority and control. The Bank and DFID in particular,

encouraged a wide variety of African countries to adopt the full New Public Management
(NPM) approach to public sector reform

There is a growing body of experience that analyzes the relevance and applicability of the
principles of the NPM to the public sector of low-income countries. The main outlines of this
debate are not repeated in this ICR. But it may be useful to include some of the experience
related to the Tanzania case that may add to this body of experience. More emphasis on
improvements to service delivery in the second phase will reveal more about its operational
relevance.

    · NPM prescriptions usually founder in highly politicized contexts in which decisions
       are made on the basis of informal and self-interested behavior. As explained earlier in
       this report, Tanzania, in comparison with most other African states, had managed to
       avoid the worst aspects of politicization and state capture. These conditions made it a
       good, but not representative, candidate for the applications of the NPM.

    · One clear contribution of the NPM in Tanzania was its compelling image of reform,
       accountability and performance improvement. Simply put, officials, particularly at
       the top levels of the public service, could easily grasp its message and strategic
       direction. Those at the middle and lower levels seemed less persuaded of the value of
       the NPM techniques such as performance management.

    · The NPM prescriptions have usually assumed that incentives, demand and
       accountability would be enough to shift the behavior of big public sector systems.
       But it seems clear from the experience of the PSRP1 to date that more conventional
       capacity development, organizational restructuring and systems improvements ­ the
       `old' public administration - will still be needed in countries such as Tanzania to
       support and supplement the NPM-type reforms. Basic management is needed in
       addition to the more econocratic approaches used in the NPM.

    · A key energizer of NPM prescriptions has been that of transparency and citizen
       demand. Citizen charters and client surveys are usually seen as part of this approach.
       But societies such as Tanzania still functioned mostly on a `high-need, low-demand'
       basis. Only a modest set of `new public expectations' emerged on the PSRP1. A
       good deal more time and effort will likely be needed in governance, political
       development, communications and citizen outreach before the real benefits of this
       aspect of the NPM can be realized.

Public sector reform as a process of change

The implementation of the PSRP1 and the design of the PRAP illustrate the shifting pattern
of the change processes that emerged between 1999 and 2007. In the early stages, the PSRP1
operated mainly on the basis of planned change managed by the PO-PSM. This approach
used a combination of strategic planning and bureaucratic rationality. Reform approaches
such as the NPM were preselected. The strategy was mainly top-down, supply-driven and
standardized. The focus was mainly on shifting big public systems by altering formal
structure, systems, accountabilities and incentives.
The changing demands on the PSRP1 towards the end of its life signaled the need for the use
of a greater variety of approaches to complex systems reform. Some examples of these
emerging approaches, most of which are included in the PRAP, are the following:


                                              30

    · The PO-PSM will need to facilitate change and reform rather than `drive' it. The
       challenge for the PO-PSM will be to master these new more indirect approaches while
       at the same consolidating the gains of the PSRP and meeting the expectations for
       results that will be higher during the next phase of the PRAP.

    · The PO-PSM will need to respond to a much more varied set of demands from actors
       such as the MDAs as opposed to providing a more standardized supply. A wider
       variety of change tactics such as piloting and sequencing, awards and recognition,
       developing a wider range of relationships with non-state groups, rapid results, cultural
       change, the building of a critical mass of support inside and outside the public sector,
       will be needed to implement the PRAP. In particular, outreach to various groups in
       the Tanzanian `public' will be critical.      The value of the techniques of social
       marketing, always difficult for a public bureaucracy to master, will be explored. All
       of these types of initiatives will require more creativity and responsiveness in the PO-
       PSM.

    · The PSRP1 was designed to meet two interrelated objectives: first to design and
       manage complex change in the public sector and second, to develop the Government
       capability to design and manage such change. More than many other efforts at public
       sector reform, the PSRP1 tried to balance the demands of both these objectives. In
       particular, the PSRP1 worked to develop the PO-PSM as an internal source of
       experience, learning and expertise with respect to public sector reform and change.
       That pattern will need to continue under the PRAP.

Readiness, implementation and absorptive capacity

Both the Government and the DP community in Tanzania have supported the idea of
implementing multiple reforms simultaneously. The PSRP1, compared to many other efforts
at public sector reform, paid more attention to the implications of this volume of work. But it
too underestimated the implementation challenges inherent in managing such a complex
program. For example, Box 1 below sets out the constraints to `installing' strategic plans in
the MDAs in support of performance improvements


 Box 1: The constraints to the implementation of strategic planning in the GOT

 The Government saw strategic planning as a key element of its efforts to improve
 performance.    But the introduction of such techniques bumped up against a series of
 implementation challenges.

     · Most plans were conventional descriptions of planned activities. They did not point
         to new directions
     · Many MDAs had several plans to meet the demands of different external and internal
         stakeholders
     · Many managers did not accept the value of detailed predictions in an context or rapid
         change
     · Plans were not regularly monitored and used for management purposes
     · Staff at the middle and lower levels was unclear about plans designed at the top of the
         MDA
     · MDA plans could be disconnected from budgets and from sectoral and national plans




                                               31

What appears to be needed in such cases is some more systematic way of thinking about the
implementation demands facing public sector organizations in low-income countries such as
Tanzania and their absorptive capacity or readiness. .

If we look at the PSRP1 experience, we can see a range of factors combining to shape the
capacity of a government organization such as an MDA to respond to and absorb complex
changes.

   · The influence and focus of leaders at various points in the hierarchy.
   · The time and work pressures on MDA staff
   · The capability to manage the implementation of a reform program
   · The complexity and scale of the reform initiative
   · The time and timing of the initiative
   · The organizational design of the change strategy
   · The level of staff motivation, commitment and motivation
   · The political and bureaucratic space created to support reform

1.0     Introduction
Since the mid-1990s, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) has implemented a comprehensive
program of reforms that has yielded sustained macroeconomic stability, an increasingly
liberalized economy, and scope for the private sector to become the main agent of economic
activity. These reforms have created the foundation for accelerated economic growth and
poverty reduction. In 2005, the GOT launched a National Strategy for Growth and Reduction
of Poverty (MKUKUTA in Swahili) that provides an overarching framework for resource
allocation, development management and fighting poverty. It is based on three clusters: (i)
growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii) improved quality of life and social well-being;
and (iii) good governance and accountability. This last pillar is regarded by the Government
to be the bedrock of the other two clusters. It encompasses cross-cutting public sector
reforms, i.e., public service reform program (PSRP), public financial management reform
program (PFMRP), local government reform program (LGRP), legal/judicial sector reform
program (LSRP), national anti-corruption strategy and action plan (NACSAP) and business
environment strengthening program (BEST).          In this context, MKUKUTA reflects the
strategic perspective that a capable and efficient public service is at the core of an effective
state, and therefore would provide an enabling environment for rapid economic growth and
poverty reduction.

2.0     Background to PSRP Phase I
There have been sustained and serious efforts to reform Tanzania's public service for the last
fifteen years or so.   The early phases of this reform effort (the Civil Service Reform
Programme, 1991 to 1999) focused on cost containment and restructuring. Key achievements
included the contracting-out and streamlining of Government structures, reduction in
employment numbers and wage bill control, installation of an integrated Human Resources
and Payroll Management System, improved pay structures and enhanced salary levels, and
the decentralization of service delivery. Building on these results, a more comprehensive
Public Service Reform Programme (PSRP Phase I) was launched in early 2000.

The Public Service Reform Programme was designed as a long term endeavor and was to be
implemented in three phases: (I) installation of performance improvement systems (2000-
2004); (II) performance management culture (2005-2008); and (III) quality improvement
cycles (2009-2011). The PSRP Phase I was integrated into Government's structures and was
coordinated and managed by the President's Office--Public Service Management. It was
financed using a basket fund arrangement comprising the Government of Tanzania, the
World Bank (IDA Credit), DFID, DANIDA, the Ireland Embassy, and CIDA. Additional,
but relatively minor, project support was also received during the 2000-2007 period from
SIDA, African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF), Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), USAID, and the Commonwealth Secretariat.

Though launched in 2000, PSRP PHASE I was jointly reformulated in 2003 in order to take a
SWAp. The reformulation aimed to streamline operations and remove duplication in donor
procedures and requirements. Though primarily aiming to reduce transaction costs, the
reformulation also resulted in slight changes in terms of the programme's structure and
content. The reformulated PSRP Phase I was to be implemented from July 2003 to June
2006. However, due to delays in implementation and operationalising the basket fund its
deadline was extended to December 2007.

3.0     Programme Objectives
During the original formulation, in 2000, PSRP's results framework contained the following
high-level goals:

        · SECTOR-RELATED CAS GOAL: improve public expenditure efficiency and
            build capacity to manage for economic growth and poverty reduction
        · PROGRAMME PURPOSE: Ensure that service delivery within priority sectors of
            the public service conforms to public expectations for value, satisfaction and
            relevance by end 2011
        · PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE: to improve accountability,
            transparency, and resource management for service delivery in the public service26

The 2003 reformulation featured an adjustment of the programme's structure and results
framework. Between the year 2000 and 2003 PSRP's monitoring efforts were to focus on
some 1,200 indicators, most of which were sector specific and service delivery related. The
revised results framework retained a higher-level goal aiming at improved service delivery
but also included a series of intermediate outcomes (objectives) that were derived from the
problem analysis found in the Public Service Management and Employment Policy of 1999.
These objectives described the improved management of public service institutions and
included the following:

    · PUBLIC SERVANT BEHAVIOUR: Public Servants are honest and ethical,
        approachable, hard working and productive; they follow rules and regulations and
        display discipline in their approach to work
    · SKILL: The best available talent is recruited and retained; public servant skills are
        continuously developed to reflect current and emerging challenges
    · INCENTIVES AND MERIT: Public Servants are appraised, rewarded and sanctioned
        based on merit and performance.           Rules and regulations are applied fairly.          A
        conducive work environment free of discrimination has been created. Pay and other
        incentives are sufficient to motivate employees
    · MANAGEMENT/ACCOUNTABILITY: MDAs make informed and systematic
        decisions. Management is accountable, responsive and results oriented. Information
        is effectively managed within MDAs.
    · CORE FUNCTIONS: Public Service Institutions are focused on core government
        functions. They are run economically and provide value for money
    · CLIENT FOCUS: Clients are treated promptly, courteously, and in accordance with
        their needs. Citizens are informed and consulted

4.0     Programme Components
Following the 2003 reformulation, PSRP Phase I was implemented under seven
components:27




26 Separate CAS goals and development objectives were also designed for the Distance Learning Centre
Component. In 2003, the Distance Learning Centre was incorporated into the Leadership, Management and
Staff Development Component.

5.0      Programme Management
Though PSRP Phase I was managed and coordinated by the President's Office--Public
Service Management, most reforms were implemented by MDAs (Ministries, Departments
and Agencies). To ensure the programme met the needs of MDA-implementors and to
ensure the effective monitoring of programme performance, a number of governance
arrangements were established. These institutional mechanisms included:

    · The INTER-MINISTERIAL TECHNICAL COMMITTEE (IMTC) which was
         chaired by the Chief Secretary with membership comprised of all Permanent
         Secretaries. The IMTC is a standing committee of Government and meets regularly,
         every two weeks. The IMTC was responsible for overall leadership, co-ordination
         and supervision of all public sector reforms. A special IMTC meeting was held each
         quarter to focus exclusively on Public Sector Reform issues. During that meeting the
         IMTC constituted itself as the Steering Committee of PSRP.
    · The INTER-MINISTERIAL WORKING GROUP (IMWG), which was chaired by
         the Permanent Secretary PO-PSM. Its membership included the Deputy Permanent
         Secretaries in central ministries, the Accountant General, Commissioners for Local
         Government, Health, Education and the legal sector, and all PO-PSM Directors. The
         IMWG was responsible for providing technical and policy level guidance to the
         programme and for overseeing Performance Improvement Fund (PIF) proposals and
         disbursements for Selective Accelerated Salary Enhancement (SASE). The IMWG
         approved plans and reviewed progress of cross-cutting reforms programmes. It met at
         least once every quarter and reported to the Steering Committee of PSRP.
    · The JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS REVIEW COMMITTEE (JIPRC)
         was chaired by the Permanent Secretary PO-PSM and included all development
         partners as well as directors and assistant directors of PO-PSM. The JIPRC reviewed
         PSRP's overall progress and performance (including external audits) and reviewed
         and endorsed all levels of plans (strategic and operational).
    · PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT WORKING GROUP (PSMWG) worked on
         policy issues concerning the public sector and included representatives of key central
         Ministries and development partners.            It contributed to the Public Expenditure
         Review.




27Prior to the reformulation the components were: Performance Improvement, Restructuring and Private Sector
Participation, Executive Agencies Program, Management Information Systems, Leadership, Management and
Governance, and Programme Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation.

7.0       Programme Results
Appendix A describes results in terms of 21 high level performance indicators, many of
which are closely related to the programme's objectives as described in Section 3 above.
Though it is difficult to attribute improvements in service delivery or the overall management
of MDAs to PSRP Phase I, the following general trends can be observed:28

· There are improvements in terms of service delivery, whether measured using sector
     specific indicators (like enrolment rates) or user satisfaction surveys.
· There has been significant economic growth, and there are high levels of satisfaction with
     economic policies




28   These are discussed in more detail in the State of the Public Service Report of 2004.




                                                          47

· Corruption indicators, such as the Transparency International Corruption Perception
    Index, as well as governance indicators (for example the WBI's index) show long term
    improvement.


In terms of implementation, most Programme outputs were implemented as planned. Key
achievements during PSRP Phase I included:

· Performance Management Systems were introduced to all MDAs.                                                Tools included
    strategic and operational planning, client service charters, self-assessments, service
    delivery surveys, M&E and Open Performance Review and Appraisal Systems (OPRAS).
    A Performance Improvement Fund (PIF) was implemented to support changes identified
    in Strategic Plans. Strategic Planning and M&E are now integrated into the MTEF and
    have been harmonised with the MKUKUTA. There are now reporting requirements
    which focus on all levels of results and which aim to improve the public's access to
    performance information.
· OPRAS are now used across Government. Prior to PSRP PHASE I appraisals were
    confidential and were not linked to strategic plans.
· EXECUTIVE AGENCIES:                    Between 2000 and December 2007, {X} new executive
    agencies were formed. Two independent evaluations of Agency performance show (1)
    service delivery has improved due to the formation of Agencies, (2) revenue collection
    performance of Agencies has improved and (3) Agencies have increased levels of
    autonomy.
· PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION (PSP): Between 2000 and December 2007, {X}
    contracts with private sector suppliers have been signed (and are being implemented)
    while an additional 128 are in process. An independent assessment of the "impact" of
    PSP shows the quality and level of these non-core services has improved drastically. In
    some cases these improved services are also being supplied at lower costs. PSP has also
    led, on average, to an increase in employment of 21%.
· PAY:        Wages of Public Servants have
    increased significantly (see the adjacent              250,000

    graph).   While the average salary of a                225,000
    public servant during 2000/01 was TSH
                                                           200,000          Average Salary in TSH
    74,183 the average salary by 2007/08 was                                Average Salary Deflated to 2000/01
    TSH 234,224.29 This represents a total                 175,000          TSH levels


    increase of 215.7%, or an average annual               150,000

    compounded increase of 17.85%. Once
                                                           125,000
    inflation is taken into account, increases
    remain significant, and reach a total                  100,000


    increase of 122.1% (or an average annual                 75,000

    compounded increase of 12.1%). In the                    50,000
    future issues of pay will be addressed                         2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08

    using   the     recommendations         of    the
    Presidential Commission on Pay which completed its work during 2006/07.
· TRAINING: a wide variety of training was completed during PSRP PHASE I. Training
    focused on leadership, customer care, OPRAS, and ICT. Overall, 4,099 people were

   trained. Both the Tanzania Public Service College and the Tanzania Distance Global
   Learning Centre have shown increased number of participants and courses as well as
   improved revenue collection. A number of HR management and development tools were
   introduced including Training Needs Assessments, Training Plans and HR Plans. A
   Leadership Competency Framework was developed.
· COMPLAINTS HANDLING:                 A strategy and design for complaints handling
   mechanisms was completed and is now described in an operations manual. By the end of
   2007, seven MDAs had operational complaints handling processes and systems.
· HIV AIDS: National Guidelines for Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS in the Public Service were
   completed in late 2007. These guidelines followed a detailed process of situation analysis
   and consensus within Government on how to combat the problem of HIV AIDS. HIV
   AIDS workplace interventions are being implemented in most MDAs
· ICT CAPACITY has improved in all MDAs. Most MDAs have web-sites and are well
   equipped in terms of ICT tools. MIS strategies were developed in 10 MDAs. Seven
   MDAs have stand-alone MIS departments, 8 have (or are in the process of having)
   WANS and 20 have LANS.
· SUBJECT FILE MANAGEMENT systems were rolled out to 34 MDAs and 39 Local
   Government Authorities. Results of a 2004 assessment show the following. The average
   subject file can be retrieved in roughly 18 minutes and in some 80-90% of the instances
   (depending on the indicator) surveyed records were accurately stored. Physical storage
   spaces and conditions are quite good and there is a high level of compliance with the
   design of the new records management systems. Progress has been made in managing
   non-current records and the process of reforming personnel records management systems
   has begun.
· IEC IN MDAS: All Ministries either have IEC units or are in the process of establishing
   them.    PSRP has facilitated the development of IEC strategies in 5 Ministries or
   Programmes.       Most Ministries have received significant training in strategic
   communication.


In a few instances implementation, even with the extension of PSRP PHASE I, lagged behind.
Though progress was made on all PSRP outputs, the following key outputs were not fully
implemented as planned:

· BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS (BPIs): Though manuals and guidelines were
   derived to guide BPIs and the procedure of designing BPIs was initiated in 5 MDAs, the
   number of business process improvements actually implemented was less than anticipated.
· HCMIS: A decentralised (web-enabled) computerised IHRPMIS (Integrated Human
   Resource and Payroll Management Information System) was supposed to be in use across
   all Central Government Ministries and Departments.             In addition to allowing
   decentralised data entry and ownership as well as decentralised reporting, the system
   planned to expand the current functionality and to include additional processes such as
   training, appraisal, and position management. Ten MDAs are using a decentralised
   HCMIS, which is not, however, web-based and does not include the added functionalities.
   Delays can be traced to issues of procuring new hardware and software.
· PAYROLL INSPECTIONS: Periodically, PO-PSM undertakes three types of regulatory
   work to ensure the integrity of the payroll: (1) staff inspections, which are physical
   checks to ensure employees on the payroll actually exists (i.e. are not ghost workers) (2)
   payroll inspections, which ensure employees are being paid the correct amount and (3)



                                             49

    HR data inspections which aim to ensure HR data (such as gender, birth date, etc) are
    accurate. Each of these inspection routines takes place but on a limited basis. Work is
    still required to improve the coverage of inspections and make them more systematic in
    terms of sampling and design.
· REFORM AND POLICY COORDINATION: Although there has been improvement in
    terms of reform and policy coordination, a review of existing coordination mechanisms
    suggests that there is still need for greater coordination among the cross-cutting reforms
    and between these reforms and the sector reforms.           Reforms contain overlaps or
    duplication and lack synergy. An important consultancy to recommend improvements to
    the policy making, scrutinisation, and coordination process, implemented together with
    the Cabinet Secretariat, began but was not completed on time.

8.0      Major Implementation Issues Encountered
Despite the positive results outlined above, PSRP PHASE I faced three key challenges which
affected programme implementation.

First, though MDAs implemented most PSRP Phase I reforms, implementation was supply
driven and highly centralized. PO-PSM decided which reforms would be implemented, when,
and by whom. PO-PSM managed most financial and procurement aspects. This mode of
implementation weakened the ownership of the reform process in the institutions that were
implementing reforms. Similarly, it contributed towards inadequate coordination. MDAs
could not link their reform efforts to their sector development plans or service delivery
improvements.

Secondly, there were institutional weaknesses and gaps in the coordination of cross-cutting
reforms and sector development programmes. PSRP was, generally considered to be the
"lead" or "parent" cross cutting reform programme yet it lacked the authority to harmonise
interventions across reform programs and to remove unnecessary duplications.

Thirdly, though there were significant changes in the systems MDAs used and improvements
in their management, accountability within the Public Service still requires to be significantly
strengthened. Weak accountability mechanisms lowered the impact of several PSRP Phase
Interventions, including OPRAS, Client Service Charters, M&E and others.

9.0      Sustainability Issues
Government is committed to continuing reforms in the public service, and PSRP Phase I had
significant and high-level political support.     PSRP is consistent with national planning
frameworks and strategies such as the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty

During PSRP Phase I, Government adopted critical measures to sustain public sector reforms.
The approved strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation and reporting
frameworks aim to ensure Performance Management systems are sustained in the long run
and that MDAs focus on results.

At PO-PSM, the implementation of the PSRP Phase I was mainstreamed into the
Government's own structures and processes. An enclave Secretariat, used to implement the
CSRP, was disbanded.       During this phase key staff were trained on a wide range of
managerial and technical aspects. Generally, the capacity to manage reforms is high, and
PO-PSM has shown then ability to learn and adapt the programme to changing circumstances.


                                               50

A good deal of capacity building also took place within MDAs and MDA's have a high level
of understanding of the reforms.

10.0    Key Lessons Learnt
In the course of addressing the implementation constraints outlined in section 8, the following
lessons were learned:

· MDAs need to take a stronger lead in designing and implementing reforms
· Reforms need to be integrated into the strategic plans and budgets of MDAs. MDAs need
    to ensuring their reform interventions are linked to national strategies, sector programmes,
    and any internal service delivery improvements being implemented.
· Improvements need to be made in the institutional arrangements which coordinate
    reforms. Coordination needs to be pushed from a level higher than the management of
    PSRP.
· The issue of accountability needs to be approached from both the supply-side and
    demand-side. Non-state actors need to have a stronger participation and their capacity to
    demand results needs to be strengthened. Generally, PSRP needs to improve the way it
    engages the public in debates concerning public sector performance
· Reform programmes like PSRP need to be integrated into Government processes and
    systems. Procedures of Development Partners need to be harmonised in order to reduce
    transaction and overhead costs.

11.0    Bank/Lender's Performance

Design
The Bank contributed positively to all aspects of programme design. The Bank supported the
Government's lead role in identifying its reform priorities during PSRP PHASE I. This
ensured high levels of Government ownership. In reviewing and approving plans dialogue
was constructive and led to improvements in terms of programme interventions. The Bank
showed flexibility in working together with Government to make adjustments in terms of
programme design as circumstances changed along the way. During the reformulation
exercise of 2003 the Bank (and other Development Partners) were highly supportive and
worked cooperatively with the Government in improving the Programme's results framework
and other elements. In all cases the Bank showed a willingness to listen to Government and
to improve the Bank's own internal planning and monitoring documents.

Implementation
The Bank provided adequate technical support and resources during implementation.
Although there were some delays in initially operationalising basket funding arrangements
the Bank showed flexibility in extending the Programme's time frame. Once the basket fund
became operational, financial resources were disbursed in a timely fashion. The no objection
process was adopted internally by PO-PSM and when approval by the Bank was required this
approval was, generally, provided on a timely basis. These positive results, in the view of the
Government, came about due to the Bank's decision to establish a fully fledged country
office.

Reviews and Supervision
Frequent reviews and supervisions were held throughout in the course of PSRP
implementations. These were both formal and informal. Generally speaking, reviews and



                                              51

supervision missions were done in a participatory fashion and the Bank ensured the
Government took the lead in order to ensure ownership. The Bank provided high quality
technical assistance in areas of financial management, procurement, IEC, M&E, and IT. The
Bank took a flexible "learning approach" to ensure all reviews, supervision missions and
evaluations could be used productively and positively to result in improvement in terms of
programme implementation.

{MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION REQUIRED} In some cases, however, the Government
disagreed with some results of mid-term and other supervision missions, and documented
these disagreements during meetings and in writing.         At times, subsequent supervision
missions returned to the same issues without taking into account the Government's view.

During PSRP PHASE I the Government commissioned a wide range of independent
evaluations and reviews. In some cases, Government did not adequately share the results of
these reviews with Development Partners. In some cases, because the Bank was not involved
in the generation of Terms of References or in the procurement of evaluators, the
independence of results was discounted. More generally, a process which balances the
Government's ownership of the evaluation process and its results, and the Development
Partner's interest in seeing results incorporated into improved implementation is required.

Procurement
The Bank provided adequate support in terms of procurement. The Bank's procurement
reviews were undertaken in a participatory and constructive manner. The Bank provided
technically sound procurement advice and worked towards ensuring procurement procedures
were implemented as efficiently as possible.

At times, however, procurement procedures led to significant delays in terms of
implementation. Sometimes, delays were the result of inadequate forward planning by PSRP
implementers, but in other cases--most importantly the procurement of software and
hardware--it is the Government's belief that the procurement procedures themselves
contributed towards and caused unnecessary delays. In the Government's view, technology
changes very quickly, and in cases where a Government wants to simply upgrade software (to
versions with increased functionality) or to repurchase servers from previous suppliers,
competitive bidding procedures often lead to inefficient results. By the time procedures are
completed, the technical specifications may already be outdated. In Government's view,
procurement of ICT equipment requires its own procurement guidelines.

Finally, the Government anticipates programme implementation will be adversely affected in
the future, when procurement plans, rather than annual action plans are used as the
Programme's key implementation tool.

Financial Management
Through the Bank a number of capacity building initiatives were undertaken in order to
improve PSRP financial resource management. Workshops were organized locally and
regionally focusing on various areas of the financial management including disbursement
procedures as well as financial reporting. In both mid-term and in annual reviews of the
PSRP Phase I issues of financial management were addressed and financial ratings were
provided.    These reviews were undertaken competently and ensured compliance with
financial management procedures.         The programme always received clean certificates
throughout its implementation.



                                                52

12.0    Borrower's Performance

Design
The Government took the lead in all issues of programme design and had a strong ownership
of the planning process. This led to significant improvements in PO-PSM's capacity to plan.
Although, the borrower's performance in terms of programme design was satisfactory, there
were cases where the programme's design was overly ambitious.

Implementation
During Phase I of PSRP, reform activities became fully integrated and mainstreamed into the
machinery of Government and the Programme was managed through the President's Office -
Public Service Management. Although some delays in implementation were encountered,
during Phase I the overall capacity to implement and coordinate reforms improved
significantly. Overall, the borrower's implementation of the PSRP Phase I was satisfactory.

Procurement
Overall the borrower's procurement assessment throughout the Programme's implementation
was satisfactory. Initially, during Programme inception, procurement was done under the
Programme Administration Accountant Unit (PAAU). From 2004 PO-PSM established a
Procurement Management Unit (PMU) and a Ministerial Tender Board (MTB) in line with
The Procurement Act (PPA) No. 21 of 2004 and its regulations. These initiatives minimized
complaints and some delays related to tendering, contract management, and overall
procurement. PO-PSM's procurement capacity improved throughout the PSRP Phase I.

Financial Management
Throughout PSRP Phase I the programme's financial management was satisfactory and PSRP
always received clean audit certificates. PO-PSM's financial management capacity improved
throughout the PSRP Phase I.

13.0    Conclusion
After some initial delays, the Public Service Reform Programme was largely implemented as
planned. Most of the desired results were achieved or in other instances significant progress
was made in ensuring reform moved in the right direction. The programme showed a great
capacity to learn and to adjust its design and implementation based upon results. Tanzania is
typically cited as having one of Africa's best Public Service Reform Programmes. During
this phase implementation was integrated into the Government's administrative structure and
relationships between the lender and borrower were constructive and positive. Capacity
within Government was strengthened considerably, and reforms are likely to be sustained
into the future.

                                                  with any average, some salary bands and employees are above the average while others are below it.
                                                  Since 74% of all employees have salaries above their targeted figure, the median employee has seen
