AGRICUL1TURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Projeet Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Latvia
Executing Aaencv:   Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)
Beneficiary:       Private Farmers, Selected Private Agro- and Forest- Industries and State Land
Service.
Amount:            US $25 million
Terms:             Seventeen years including four year of grace at standard IBRD rates
Onlendin Terms:    From the Govemment (MOF) to the financial intermediaries in dollars with a
margin of at least 10% of the Bank rate; from the financial intermediaries to
individual borrowers at the MOF rate plus a margir sufficient to cover
administrative costs and lending risks, and to be reviewed annually.
Objective:         Project objectives are to support private agricultural development by providing
critically lacking investment credit to nevily-emerging private farmers and
investment funds for expansion and technological upgrading to private agro- and
forest-industries.  The project would also support implementation of the
Government's reform program in the agricultural sector and it would assist the
MOA and otier agencies in the removal of key constraints limiting the
transformation to a market-based agricultural economy. Specific supports include
the implementation of land reforms, gradual privatization of state processing and
distribution monopolies, strengthening of the rural fincial system, and improving
the extension service, training and applied research. Other objectives are
improvements in developing the sector policy framework and in Govemment policy
making capacity through suitable pricing, legal, fiscal and institudonal reforms.
Descrintion:       The main components of the project are: (a) Farm credit for on-farm production
and development. A financing company, the Agrcultural Finance Company (AFC)
is being established to idenmify investment opportunities, appraise viability, assess
credit-worthiness, and channel funds to individual sub-borrowers; (b) Support for
private small and medim scale agro- and forest- industries through long-term
investment funds. Priority would be given to commercial viability, export
potential, and management capacity; and (c) TA support for sector reform program
including development of human and institutional skills necessary for a market
economy through support for agricultural advisory services, training of technicians,
managers, and workers/farmers and strengthening of market information, land-
survey, registration and titling services.



- ii-
8enefits:          The project's potential benefits include an iamediate short-term impact on
production, income and employment generation, and foreign exchange earnings.
The project would serve as a vehicle for further reforms in agnculture and would
accelerate the move to a market oriented system based on private ownership of land
and other productive assets. Direct benefits from the project would include
icreased production of various crops and livestock products, diversified and
improved quality in processed goods, increased export revenues, and economic
stabilization in nrual areas. The project would help improvu institutional structures
conducive to smoothing the transition to a market economy. The project would
also improve agro-chemical management, soil conservation, and agro-industrial
effluent control, and thus contribute to enviromnental protection.
The risks associated with the project are: (a) macroeconomic instability; (b) politicai
instability; (c) possible reintoduction of import tariff and/or export duties; (d)
delays in implementation of land tiling, registration, and fully functioning land
markets; (e) high financial risk inherent in new private farming; (f) slower than
expected start-up of the AFC; and (g) market flucations, particularly for those
sub-projects requinng long gestation periods. Given a sincere commitment by the
Government to continue economic reforms, the first three risks are somewhat
mitigated. For market and financial risks, the project would strengthen institutional
capacities in credit assessment and market analysis, and risk is likely to be
mitigated by careful analysis of each of the sub-projects on future market potential.
nstdtutional risks are minimzed by technical assistance already in place to estab]H
the AFC and in strengthening the financial intermediaries. Substantial TA is
incorporated in the project to strengthen agricultural extension and training and the
fm business management capabilities of the project beneficiaries, blnce mitigating
the risks in lending to new private farmers.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
AGRICULTURAL DPE-VELOPMENT PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.1          The Republic of Latvia lies on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea sharing borders with
Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus and Russia. Its territory, 65,000 km2, is roughly equivalent in size to
Switzefland. One million of Latvia's 2.7 million population live in the capital city of Riga. Only 30% of
the population live in rural areas.
1.2          Latvi began to industrialize toward the end of the nineteenth century. In the rapid post-
World War II industrializtion, Latvia developed some of the most sophisticated industries in the former
Soviet Union (FSU), including, machine building, chemicals, electronics, wood, paper, food processing,
and light industries. The agricultural sector was also under intensive production. Latvia was already
exportng agrnaultual commodities to We tern Europe before the War, and continued to export meat, dairy,
and fish products to the rest of the Soviet Union. The highly skilled labor force and general efficiency of
the Latvian economy, allowed it to enjoy one of the highest living standars li the FSU, with per capita
incomes almost 30% greater than the rest of the Soviet Republics. Latvia regained independent in August
1991.
B. StabizaLtion and Reforms
1.3          SLabilization Program. In July 1992, Latvia launched a formal stabilization program
supported by an IMT standby arrangement. Since then, Latvia has been successful in containing the rate
of inflation, which has declined from double digit monthly figures through October 1992, to an average
monthly rate of 2% for the first half of 1993 and continues to decrease during the latter half of 1993.
Contribufting to this drop has been a tight monetary and fiscal policy as well as suppordng income policy
measures which have resulted in a substantial fall in real wages. The currency system has been successfully
delinked from the Ruble area with the introduction of a new currency, the Lat.
1.4          Price Liberalization.  In December 1991, the Govermment of Latvia liberalized all
agricultural commodity prices. In the immediately following months it then set minimum prices to support
farmers. However, by mid 1992, the farm-gate prices had exceeded the minimum floor prices and are now
fully market determined. Input prices have also been liberalized. Price reform was largely completed in
1992, with price subsidies remaining in only a few areas such as heating and rent.
1.5          Financial Sector Reform. In mid-1992, legislation was passed to separate the commercial
banking functions of the Bank of Latvia (BOL) from its functions as a Central Bank. In December, 1992
the 49 commerial branches of BOL were placed under the control of the Bank Privatization Committee.



-2-
Recently, some of the individual branches have been converted into joint-stock companies and others have
been sold to private commercial banks. It is planned to create a "core bank" comprising the 18 renaining
branches of BOL. No definite plans have been formulated for the restructuring and/or evenual privatization
of the Savings Bank. With IMF assistance, progress has been made in establishing a prudential regulation
and supervision system for banks. However, further changes in regulation in somne key areas are needed,
such as foreign exchange exposure and bankl holdings of enterprise equity and real estate. The Bank
Group's ongoing financial sector restructuring work is designed to address these issues as well as the
coordination of donor assistance in institutional development for the core bank.
1.6          Labor Market and Social Safety Net. The Government has adopted active labor market
policies such as retraining, job search assistance, and public works. The unemployment rate is on the rise,
reaching 6% in August 1993 and may reach 12-15% by the end of 1993. Under-employment remains high
and exceeds official unemployment rmes. The rising cost of unemployment is expected to put strong
pressure on fiscal resources.
1.7          Privatization.  The privatization process is well advanced in the agricultural sector.
Individual laws governing the privatization of milk, meat, grain and other agro processing iniustries have
been passed. Some small plants have already been privatized and the remaining plants are expected to be
privatized by early 1994, with the exception of large scale state enterprises. Spimilarly, a vast majority of
small enterprises under the jurisdiction of local authorities had been privatized. However, the privadzadon
of large-scale state owned entities still faces significant obstacles and has been at a virtual standstill since
1991. This delay was initially caused by the lack of important pieces of legislation such as the voucher and
leasing laws, which have been approved only recently. Now that the basic legislative framework is in place,
the main reason for the delay appears to be institutional procedures requiring the intervention and
involvement of several ministries ir. privatizadon decisions without a uniform approach. The Government
intends to establish a Privatization Agency with centralized authority over the privatization of large
enterprises, including those in the agriculture sector.
1.8          Land Reform. Land reform is fairly well advanced in that land restitution and privatization
has been largely completed. Under the November 1990 law, all holders of agricultural land as of July 21,
1940, or their heirs, were eligible to reclaim land nationalized after that date. The law also included
provisions for those with current use rights to file ownership claims. Since then, more than 210,000 claims
have been made, of which over 100,000 claims were acalaly registered under the land restitution law.
1.9          The process of land restitution and privatization has beer. divided into two phases: the
restoration of land user rights to former owners; and the restoration of ownership rights including the right
to sell and to mrortgage the property. Phase One of the reform has progressed quite rapidly, though it
remains incomplete. Land use rghts have been awarded to private individuals on 46% of all arable land.
This includes over 52,000 private farmers (average holding 16.7 hectares). However, progress has been
slow for Phase Two of the reform which involves transfer of ownership rights (including the right to sell
or mortgage the property). The first properties were registered in the newly registered Land Book Offices
only in June, 1993. As of July 1993, only 10 properties (8 rural, 2 urban) have been titled and registered.
It is estimated that less than a thousand properties would be titled and registered by January 1, 19,94.
1.10         Slow progress in land titling and registration threatens to constrain the development of the
sector. Although many farmers now have the right to use the land, they cannot at present sell or mortgage



- 3 -
their property. A functioning land market does not yet exist and consolidation of ownership cannot take
place. Agricultural credit development is hampered by the inability to use land as collateral. A major
constraint to acceleraing the titling process is a lack of funds to purchase equipment for adequate land
survey and cadastre prior to titling. Until a functioning land market exists, efficient producers are
constrained and face great difficulties to expand their operations.
C. Project Bkround
1.11         The proposed project is the first investment project to be supported by the Bank in Latvia
and the first Bank-supported project in the agriculture sector for the Baltic. The first Bank loan to Latvia,
the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 3525-LV) approved by the Board on October 22, 1992, was to support
importation of critically needed inputs. The total loan amount is US$ 45 million, of which about US$ 14.5
million has been earmarked for imnport of agricultural inputs.
1.12         The Bank's lending strategy in agriculture is to support Government efforts to carry out
reform of the agriculture sector and to assist in its transformation to a market driven system. The proposed
project is the first operation conceived within the above mentioned strategy to support the emerging
agricultural private sector with critically needed investment funds and to support Government policy
formulation. Rapid implementation of the project is important because of the urgent need for both
investment, and access to convertible currency resources, in the emergent private sector. This project has
been prepared following the agricultural sector review mission and is consistent with the mission's findings
and recommendations.
1.13         Bank involvement in this project bridges a critical financing gap. It is anticipated that the
project would elicit a supply response in agricultu :which has been disrupted by a lack of access to i4puts
and financing since the reform period began. The project would strengthen the policy framework and
Government policy-making and implementation capability. Furthermore, the proposed project would also
have inter-sectoral implications by contributing to enterprise and banking sector reforms through training
of staff in credit evaluation through the credit component of the project, and establishment of the
Agricultural Finance Company (AFC). The project draws on the Bank's previous experience in agricultural
development projects in Eastern European countries, e.g. Hungary, Romania, Poland, etc. Bank
involvement on policy framework and its reform would promote the efficient use of limited resources, help
improve technologies for crop and livestock production, and upgrade agro-processing technology and
operations, and enhance environmentally sound agricultural development by improving current practices and
introducing protective measures.

II. TIE AGRICULTURE SECTOR'
A. BAck round
2.1          Historically, the agricultural sector has been one of Latvia's main sources of income,
employment, and foreign exchange earnings. Today, the sector occupies more than 40% of the country's
land area, accounts for nearly a quarter of the GDP, and employs about 17 percent of the Latvian labor
force. The sector traditionally produced an exportable surplus t'hat was delivered to the other republics of
the former Soviet Union (FSU). Over one third of the livestock production of Latvia was destined for
export to the east, supplying about 2 percent of all livestock products in the FSU.
2.2           Based on land and climate potential, and market and trade prospects, agriculture could once
again become a reliable source of income and foreign exchange earnings for the rural population. This
-would require reform-driven structural adjustments in the sector. Latvia can develop competitive agriculture
due to its relatively good overall agro-ecological conditions, and low cost land and labor, compared to
Western standards. However, at present, Latvia's agricultural potential is severely under-exploited. With
improved teahnology and better extension services, provision of inputs and training of farmers, yields of
most crops and livestock could be doubled.
2.3          Like the economy as a whole, the agricultural sector in Latvia is undergoing a difficult
adjustment period. Since indeperndence in 1991, Latvia's agricultural prooaction declined each year by more
than 30% on average. Following the severe drought of 1992 and the drop in inter-republic trade,
production in 1993 declined once again. Particularly hard-hit are the livestock and agro-processing
subsectors where outputs have declined by as much as 50% due to drops in domestic demand and the
disruption of FSU trade. Exports have been slow to develop due to poor product quality and weak
marketing channels. Profitability is down as inputs prices have risen far more than output prices. The
number of workers being discharged from agro-industries is on the rise and many private farmers are under-
employed as their land remains iae due to lack of equipment and other productive assets, and the lack of
seasonal and long-term capital. The present conditions indicate that a robust recovery of the economy
overall, much less within the agricultural sector, is not likely to occur in the near-term.
B. Climate Togog=ahv and Soils
2.4          Average annual rainfall in Latvia is about 680 mm. The wettest months are April through
September, coinciding with the highest crop demand for moisture. There is thus sufficient rainfall for most
crops, particularly summer crops. Severe droughts, like the one in 1992, are rare,
1/    For more detals, see Latvia: In Transition to Private Agriculture, an agricultural sector review report. EC4NR,
World Bank, 1993.



2.5    Mean annual temperatures (54 degrees Celsius) are relatively mild for the country's latitude, due
to the influence of the Baltic Sea. Relatively high minimum temperatures permit successful production of
winter cereals in most years, while relatively low annual maximum temperatures generally guarantee
successful production of spring sown small grains and oilseeds. The relatively short growing season of 120
to 150 days, however, presents considerable problems for reaching high yields of potatoes, sugarbeet,
maize, fruits, vegetables, and alfalfa, as available varieties are not sufficiently bred for cultivation this far
north.
2.6            Soil quality varies considerably. Podzolized soils constitute 54.5%, and deep fertile organic
loam soils account for about 7 % of total agricultural land, with the rest belonging to less fertile categories.
Recent soil maps on a 1:10,000 scale are available for virtually all agricultural land. Average soil quality
is 4 on a scale of 10 points, with 7% falling i i the highest quality. Soil quality is thus relatively low, and
so is soil humus content, averaging no more than about 1.7%. Widespread soil compaction and
deteriorating drainage systems are amplifying the imnact of relatively low soil quality on soil productivity.
2.7           Insufficient and deteriorated drainage systems have led to the abandonment of large areas
of agricultural land. At least 200,000 ha of drainage works need rehabilitation and most of the remaining
1.5 million ha require comprehensive repair and maintenance. However, rehabilitation and/or maintenance
works have been drastically scaled down due to insufficient funding.

agricultural sector is estimated to be 5 to 8 times lower than in most Western countries, mainly due to low
capitalization per worker and low quality of capital inputs. Low labor motivation and the lack of managerial
skills and authority, combined with an aging workforce and a marked outflow of young and technically
skilled laborers over the past decade, has further reduced labor productivity.

2.10         Lad Use  Latvia has 2.6 million ha of agricultural land, of which nearly 1.7 million ha
is arable. Most of Latvia is a flat coastal plain, with substantiai forest coverage. During the past 50 years,
about 1.2 million ha of agricultural land has been abandoned, 80% of which has been converted to forest
Sand. During the past decade, cereals accounted for rougly 43 % of arable land, potatoes and vegetables
7XZ, industrial crops (mainly sugarbeet and flax) and orchards 2% each, and forage crops accounted for
37%. Fallow is negligible, covering only 10,000 to 12,000 ha; but in recent years it has been rising
substantially. Permanent grassland covers about one-third of all agricultural land.
D. Recent Perfonnance and Trnds In Crop and Livestock Production
2.11         Crop production has averaged roughly 30% of total agricultural output for most of the past
decade. The bulk of this production has been in grains. Spring barley presently accounts for over 50%
of all grain production and 21% of all arable land. It is primarily used for animal feed and beer production.
Other grains include winter wheat, winter rye, barley and oats. Crop production peaked in 1984 when total
grain production reached nearly 1.7 million tons. Yields have varied considerably since then but showed
a dramatic decline in 1992 when cereal production dropped by over 30% from 1990 levels and forage crops
dropped by over 50%. These changes not only reflect the severe drought of 1992, but also the macro-
economic difficulties that have led to cutbacks in subsectoral investments, subsidies, and inputs. Yields for
all grains are low compared to those in the West and by using better seed stock, more optimal amounts of
fertilizers and pesticides, and improved cultivation and harvesting techniques, they could easily be doubled.
2.12         Forage crops have received low prinrity compared to directly marketable field crops. The
heavily subsidized manufactured feedstuffs and feed grains made forages, including nahtral grasslands,
relatively expensive feedstuffs. As a result, forage production and practices remain well behind Western
standards. Sugarbeets, potatoes, legumes and veg-+ables comprise the bulk of non-grain crops in Latvia.
These crops would also show substantial rises in 3 .-lds if improved seed stock and modern cultivation
techniques were introduced.
2.13         Livestock Production. Because Latvia was heavily dependent on imports of subsidized grain
and protein concentrates for feed fiom other Republics, pre-independence livestock production masked true
profitability and allowed for large-scale concentrated production. With the removal of subsidized feed grain
and manufactured feeds, Latvian livestock production fell significantly and the trend is expected to continue
beyond 1993. Particularly hard hit have been state owned pig and poultry production.
2.14         Since 1989 the private sector share in livestockproduction has st-adily increased, accounting
in 1992 for over 40% of all production. The most dramatic increase in private sector participation is in pig
raising, which correspondingly shows the largest drop in share of the state sector. This illustrates the
flexibility of private farmers in adopting and substituting feed grains with non-grain feed and forages, while
state farms are unable to change from their grain-intensive feeding practices. As a whole, livestock
production is moving awa) from intensive state-run production toward semi-intensive private production
while adjusting to a more efficient and manageable scale.



2.15         Tqnns of Trade. Agricultural producers suffer from a severe deterioration in terms of trade.
In 1992 alone, agricultural inputs and machinery prices dramatically increased from their formerly
subsidized levels to market prices, up on average by about 30 times and manufactured feed and diesel fuel
prices were up by 20 and 150 times respectively while farnigate prices of livestock products increased on
average by only about 3 times. This trend has begun to reverse, terms of trade for agriculture began to
improve, albeit slowly, in 1993. This trend has already improved the profitability of crop and livestock
production.
E. Aaieultural Inputs
2.16         Seeds. Latvian seed production is performed exclusively by public institutions. Seed quality
is reasonable and is controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture. New seed legislation based on the European
EUPOV-system was introduced in the spring of 1993. All cereal and potato seed is multiplied in Latvia,
but seed for forage maize is imported from Moldova and the Ukraine. Seed for peas, sunflowers and
sugarbeets also come from the Ukraine, alfalfa from Kyrgyzstan, and vegetables from several FSU and
Western countries.
2.17         Many farmers use their own seed and are not prepared to pay a premium for quality seed.
There has been a dramatic drop in the use of quality seed materials since 1990 and the use of imported seed
dropped by roughly half in 1992, compared to the 10-year period 1982-1991. A Seed Fund supported by
Sweden (5,000 tons) and the Government budget (2,000 tons) is making food grain seed available to
farmers. This fund however, was able to provide only about one-fifth of private farmers' 1993 spring
cereal seed requirements.
2.18         Fertilizer. All chemical fertilizers are imported from Russia. Total chemical fertilizer
application in 1992 dropped by 50 % compared to the late 1980's and again by another 35% in 1993. The
major reason behind this drop is the increase in prices by over 75 times during 1991/1992. Russia is now
demanding world market prices and an advance payment in hard currency. In addition, an almost complete
lack of seasonal credit for fertilizer purchases has further depressed fertilizer application. Still, compared
with other FSU countries, Latvian fertilizer application rates have been relatively high and had much better
balanced nutrient supply than Ukraine and Russia.
2.19         Pesticides. Virtually all pesticides used in Latvia come from Russia or Ukraine. Recently,
prices have increased by 7 to 170 times, resulting in a drastic drop in pesticide usage. High-quality
pesticides manufactured in the West have also entered the market, but are too expensive for the majority
of farmers. As a result there is little herbicide use at present. To combat increasingly severe weed
infestation, access to credit to purchase modern herbicides is urgently needed.
2.20         Fertilizer and pesticide storage, distribution, and spraying used to be under the responsibility
of Agrokhimia, a state monopoly. In 1992, their activity has collapsed to about 10% of the normal work
volume, due to equipment and fuel shortages, and lack of demand by farmers, who claim that they can do
this type of work cheaper and better than Agrokhimia. Most of the field application of pesticides is still
done by former State and co!lective farms as most of the private farmers lack the necessary equipment and
knowledge.

2.21          VeXin&ay pplies. AU essential veterinary supplies have to be imported into Latvia. Due
to the high prices of veterinary supplies, the 1992 sales level dropped to only about 10% of the levels in
the past. In early 1993, Latvijas Zoovetpgade, the state agency in charge of procurement and distribution
of veterinary supplies, estimated large shortfalls of required veterinary drugs, medicines, and vaccines.
Latvia has obtained some veterinary supplies from relief agencies, and procurement of agro-chemnicals and
veterinary supplies was financed under the Bank's Import Rehabilitation Loan. The most urgently needed
veterinary supplies include drugs for treatment of internal and external parasites, wide spectrum antibiotics,
and some essential reagents and chemicals for diagnostic work, particularly for leucosis detection.
2.22         Veterinary Services. Until recently, veterinary services were provided exclusively by the
public sector. Latvia plans to privatize all clinical veterinary treatments, vaccination, and drug distribution.
A law on privati2ation of veterinary services had been passed in June 1992, but licensing of private
vetinarians had already started as early as January 1992. By the end of 1992 about 1,000 licenses had
been issued. Very few private veterinarians have opened up full-scale veterinary offices however, due to
lack of funds and the fact that practicing veterinary medicine under the presently distressed conditions of
livestock producers is risky.
2.23         Livestock Feedstuffs. Compared to the 3-year period 1987-89, when livestock production
peaked, overall feed production, e.g. silage, forages, hay, and manufactured feedstuffs fell by about 50%
in 1992 due to the combined impact of economic uncertainties and the 1992 drought. Latvian feedstuff
quality is inferior to that used in the west, resulting in a lower overall livestock production performance.
Manufcred feed had relatively low protein and feed additive content, often combined with an energy
content too low to guarantee satisfactory feed conversion efficiency. The quality of mamnactured feed
deteriorated dramatically in 1992. Pelleting, for example, has been discontinued due to the rise in energy
costs.
2.24         Fam MiKgine. At present, most farm machinery is outdated and too large for the smaller
rms being created by land reform and privatizatiozi.  The number of smaller tractors has increased
somewhat during the past two years as land privatization has progressed. However, a lack of long-term
credit for agriculture has prevented most of the newly emerging private farmers from purchasing new
tractors. Meanwhile, the number of harvesters and most other machinery and equipment declined steadily
since the mid-1980's. Much of the Latvian machinery fleet needs replacement, particularly the forage
harvesters.
2.25         Rual  astructure. About 62% of all agricultural land has open ditch or tile drainage,
but most of the drainage systems are over 15 years old and would require substantial rehabili4ion in
addition to the necessary expansion of the system. Extensive networks of highways and main roads are well
established in Latvia. However, presently existing rural access roads and the electrification network of the
country would have to be expanded to facilitate newly established private farmers. The buildings and
physical assets inherited by private farmers from state or collective farms are in reasonably good shape, but
many new farmers are in need of new buildings and other physical infrastructure.



F. Africulg turlSUp   Soervce
2.26         Agricultural Research. With de-collectivization and the continued implementation of land
reform, Latvia's research infrastructure needs substantial strengthening and reorientation to respond to the
needs of new private famiers. Most pressing needs include imrroved access to research results and transfer
of technology from other parts of the world as well as concentration on adaptive research. This would
require training of Latvian scientists, support for expatriate visiting professors in Latvia, establishment of
an up-to-date agricultural library, including up-to-ate subscriptions to scientific journals and literature, and
continuation of varietal field testing and demonstration work on individual fanns and fainners' fields.
2.27         Agricultural Extension. In 1992, Latvia established an independent agricultural extension
service, the Latvian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS). LAAS has a two-tier organizational structure;
the National Advisory Cenier and 18 local Advisory Centers with a total of 260 advisors. The Advisory
Service plan calls for a total stafi of 670 by 1998, which would permit at least one advisor for each of the
500 districts plus regional advisors and specialists. It is well suited to Latvia's relatively well developed
inrastructure and agricultumal technology levels. LAAS has been receiving substantial TA assistance from
bilateral and multilateral sources. These TA projects still need to be better coordinated and adjusted to meet
the critical needs of the country. Under the proposed project agriculture advisors would work closely with
staff of the Agriculture Finance Company (AFC) to provide combined technical and financial support to
farmers.
2.28         Effective and far-reaching extension services would be critical to the success of the private
agricultural sector in Latvia as many practices that were used in the former collective system would have
to be changed. The new private farmers do not yet comprehend the dynamics of a market economy.
Trining in record keeping, marketing, agricultural finance, and in other areas of farm management would
be essential. New farmers with little previous experience would require more technical advice.
2.29         Livestock Artificial Insemination (AD has also declined. Al coverage, formerly 90% to
95%, has fallen to only 60% to 70%, mainly because many farmers use their own bulls to save money and
to avoid cumbersome Al procedures. While the cost of AI service is quite cheap by intemational
comparison, farmers still consider it excessively high. Realistically however, it remains the only cost
effective way of improving the genetic stock of Latvian farm animals.
G. Forestry and Forest Industiies
2.30         Latvia has rich forest resources which, with proper development and utilization, can play
a key role in the country's economic reform program. However, at present Latvian forests are under-
utilized. Forestry is one of the few subsectors for which there are immediate export possibilities. Although
total wood volume is not large in comparison to many other countries, the tree species are well suited to
industrial uses, the quality of the logs is good, and the logging terrain generally favorable. It has been
estimated that with proper management, the anmual allowable cut could be increased to about 11 million



- 10-
m3/yr, compared with the currerA harvest of about 4 million n9/yr. The shot-term prospects are good,
provided that deforestation is properly managed and monitored.
2.31         Most of the forest is owned by the state, but about 30% is on agricultural land recently
returned to its original private owners through the nation-wide program of restitution. Many private
operators, having obtained the right to harvest through a system of open biddirng on parcels of forest land
put up for auction by the state, are already involved in harvesting the forest.
2.32         The forestry processing subsector is presently operating well below its installed capacity,
primarily because of low consumer demand in the domestic market and in the traditional export markets
of the FSU. Some parts of the subsector have the potential to be competitive in Western markets because
of the high quality of the raw material, but other parts have no apparent export potential and should
concentrate on domestic markets. Production of sawnwood, panel products, and converted products such
as firniture, have good potential if they are properly dried, dimensioned, and designed.
2.33         The pulp and paper industry is operating at a small fraction of its capacity using outdated
equiplnent and processes, and has no basic competitive advantage as an exporter. The largest pulp mill uses
the sulphite pulping process with no chemical recovery system, thus posing a serious enviromnental threat.
EL h
2.34         Agro-processing, like other agricultural subsectors in Latvia, was geared toward serving the
FSU market. Due to high dependence on imported raw materials, the plants using large quantities of sugar,
chemicals and other additives have been most affected by the reduction of FSU raw material supplies. The
meat, dairy, and leather processing industries have been affected by the recen contraction of livestock
populations.
2.35          The above shortages combined with the loss of FSU markets have reduced capacity
utilization by 30-50%. Agro-processing plants employed about 30,000 people in 1992, downby 30% from
42,000 in 1990. The technology is generally 1960's PSU vintage and is characterized by low energy and
material efficiency, high losses, oversized plants with inappropriate design and operational flows which are
mostly too highly specialized to be flexible for developing new products. The average output per employee
in the food industry is only about 10% of the output for equivalent industries in the West. The value added
in the industry is also low when compared to similar plants in the West. The future outlook for the
subsector is gloomy unless a near complete overhaul of the subsector is carried out.
2.36         The dairy, meat and grain subsectors dominate agro-processing in Latvia. Dairy processing
has undergone the most rapid and extensive restructuring to-date. Sixteen state-owned processing plants
distributed across the country have collectively dominated the subsector and individually dominated their
respective regional markets with satellite networks of smaller intermediate processing plants and milk
collection stations. Privatization of larger plants expected to be completed this year. Meat processing has
undergone restructuring at a slower rate. There are fourteen major meat processing plants. While the large
plants are being restructured, small-scale private processing plants are being established and the number is
growing.



- 11 -
2.37         Grain processing is the largest and most vertically integrated processing subsector in Latvia.
It has also been the last subsector to initiate significant restructuring efforts. This subsector has been under
control by a state monopoly, Latvia Labiba (LL), which used to own and operate a group of 28 enterprises
comprised of flour and feed mills, grain elevators, seed plants, and bakeries. Since January 1, 1993, the
LL has been dissolved and two interim entities with distinct and scparate functions have been created.
Labibas Birojs, is a regulatory agency which provides gover_nental services and regulations; and Latvijas
Dzirnavas, which is a joint stock holding company designed to oversee and supervise commercial activities
and manage the privatization process. Individual enterprises are to operate independently and would
eveally be privatized. This is a positive and significant step towards privatizing the grain sector.
2.38         Enviromnental protection needs to be improved and better monitored. Many meat plants
and tanneries are not equipped with adequate waste treatment and discharge facilities and pose health and
pollution risks to their urban environments. The agro- and forest industry subprojects to be financed under
the project would have adequate funds far appropriate waste treatment facilities. There are ongoing, albeit
small-scale, TA projects to assist Latvian enterprises in improving environmental standards.
2.39         Product quality must be improved for new export markets. The low quality products,
packaging, and product mix previously produced to serve the PSU markets are clearly inadequate for new
export markets. Products are often over-processed and have lost taste and nutritional values. Packaging
is traditional and unappealing. Control and measuring systems are simple and in many cases not working
at all. In most cases, processes need to be upgraded to meet the food inspection requirements of export
markets. The industry also needs to identify marketable product mixes and brand strategies (including
private labels) in order to penetrate export markets.
2.40         In order to overcome the loss of markets and inputs, many enterprises are looking to the
West for joint venture partners to bring in capital, expertise, and market outlets. While so far Western
firms have been hesitant because of their perception of high political and financial risk in Latvia, there are
several joint ventures in potato starch, edible oil, and forest product processing.
I. Inernatonal Trade
2.41         Due to its relatively small size, Latvia has a high trade/GDP ratio. Exports at current prices
accounted for 43 percent of GDP in 1989 and in 1990. Import dependence was even higher; ratios of
imports in the GDP were around 50 percent during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
2.42         Latvia is relatively richly endowed with open land and would therefore be expected to have
a comparative advantage in agricultural and forestry products. This expectation is borne out in the high
share of agricultural and forestry products in total trade. The share of (unprocessed) agricultural products,
food industry products and wood and paper products in total exports amounted to almost 30% in 1990.
Agriculture used to be a net-earner of foreign exchange.
2.43         Prior to independence, agricultural exports were wholly directed to the FSU, and thus were
significantly affected by the economic collapse in these countries. To compensate for such loss, Latvia is



- 12 -
in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with the other Baltic States and some western European
countries. However, the relevant agreements among the Baltic States have not yet been reached because
of political problems. An agreement with Sweden has been ratified and others with Norway, Finland, and
Austria are still in process. These agreements however do not entail concessions for free trade in
agricultural products, particularly in EC narkets. Meanwhile, trade to the East has, in general, been
reduced to triangular transactions.
2.44          The Latvian export regime for agricultural products has been widely liberalized. Whereas
export taxes apply for many industrial goods, only exports of rawhide, leather, and leather products are
taxed. There are no formal restrictions for other exports of agricultural products. At the time of price
liberalization in December 1991, export licensing was established to control the outflow of food products.
In June 1992 these restrictions were removed. Exporters still have only to pay the normal sales tax of 6%
that is also charged for sales on the domestic market. In most other countries however, this sales tax is a
consumer tax that is charged for domestic sales only.
2.45          In contrast to the export regime, the import regime has become more protective over time
since price liberalization. The Council of Ministers approved a specific import tariff schedule on July 31,
1992. In general tariffs are set lower for raw products than for processed products. Moreover, tariffs are
specified in US dollars per unit, leading to highly non-uniform tariff rates. These tariffs are currently under
revision, and a tariff committee is considering applications of domestic producers who are requesting higher
tariff rates. The Bank Group is currently assisting the Govemment in evaluating tariff levels and structure
so as to avoid re-introduction of excessive tariffs designed to protect inefficient domestic producers.

III. THE RURAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. Background
3.1         In 1988, the Soviet authorities initiated reforms in the financial sector, establishing a two-tier
banking system, separating the commercial banking operations from the State Bank (Gosbank), and creating
specialized banks. The Agriculture Bank, the Industry and Construction Bank, and the Social Bank were
established as se arate banks and permission was granted to create private commercial banks. The other
previously existing specialized institutions, the Savings Bank and the Foreign Trade Bank, continued their
former operations.
3.2          Latvia began to restructure the financial system immediately after it declared independence.
In September 199i 'he regional branches of the Soviet specialized banks were "nationalized" and placed
under authority of the Bank of Latvia (BOL). The Savings Bank was the exception and remained
independent of the BOL. In June 1992, Parliament passed legislation that separated BOL commercial
banking functions from its functions as the Central Bank.
3.3         In December 1992, the 49 commercial branches of BOL were transferred to the control of
the Bank Privatization Committee, consisting of representatives of the BOL, the Ministry of Finance and
parliament. The objective of the committee was to privatize the branches as quickly as possible. Initally,
each of these branches operated as an independent bank. In the second quarter of 1993, privatization began
to move ahead quite rapidly; some of the former branches of BOL have been privatized individually, and
some have been sold to existing commercial banks. The committee plans to create one "core' bank
incorporating 18 former BOL branches. The World Bank is actively involved in this effort to coordinate
the insdtutional development for the "core" bank so that it can be privatized as soon as possible.
B. The Banldng System
3.4          At the end of 1992, the banking system comprised four main components: the BOL, the
former commercial branches of the BOL, the newly formed commercial banks and the Savings Bank. In
addition, the Investment Bank of Latvia (IBL) was in the process of being established with the assistance
of the Nordic Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). IBL
has initiated lending operations in April 1993. The 49 former commercial branches of BOL accounted for
about 65 percent of total bank assets and for about 88 percent of credit. The Savings Bank with 37
branches (and about 500 sub-branches) and holding the bulk of household deposits, had about 27 percent
of total assets, but only 1.6 percent of credit. The commercial banks held 7.7 percent of assets and about
10 percent of total credit. Although, currently, over 40 commercial banks have been licensed, only an
estimated 30 are operational. Many have very low capital levels and even the largest of these banks only
has capital equivalent to US$ 1.5 million. Only a very few have capital exceeding US$ 0.5 million. Total
capital for all the commercial banks was about US$ 10.0 million. After the reform of 1988, the owners
of these banks were mainly the public sector enterprises, and while private involvement is increasing, a
significant number are "agent" banks for enterprises or individuals who are also shareholders. The scope
of their banking activity is narrow and most of the commercial banks concentrate at present only on the
provision of short-term trade financing which carries little r.sk and very high interest spreads.



- 14 -
3.5          At end-1992, the consolidated balance sheet of the 49 former BOL branches showed total
assets of LVR 45.0 billion and total outstanding credit of LVR 22.2 billion, which represent about 88
percent of total credit in the banking system. The ratio of capital and reserves to assets was only 1.6
percent, before taking into account the creation of provisions to cover potential losses. A comprehensive
portfolio review, which was carried out by expatriate consultants and completed in March 1993, concluded
that in view of the poor quality of the loan portfolio, the branches would require a capital injection of LVR
10.0 billion (US$ 80.0 million) to achieve an adequate level of capitalization. In 1993, privatization
proceeded rapidly, following a multi-track approach, which involved the conversion of some individual
branches into joint stock companies and the sale of others to private commercial banks. In April 1993,
Government created a Mortgage Bank which has ambitious plans for an extensive branch network and a
wide range of banking services. This bank is not yet operational.
3.6          The Savings Bank occupies a unique position in the Latvian banking system. It is the largest
fnancial institution in terms of the number of branches and still holds the bulk of the household deposits
which are effectively guaranteed by Government. However, its financial position has been seriously
disturbed and its liquidation inpaired because assets held by the former Soviet Savings Bank in Moscow
(50% of total) were not repatriated after independence. The bank has sought to remedy its problems by
continuing to repress the rates of interest paid to depositors and by developing a commercial lending
portfolio of high yielding, but potentially risky, assets. It has continued lending to enterprises in the
rapidly changing economic environment, without having the necessary expertise in lending in general, and
in credit appraisal techniques in particular. Analytic work is in progress which would provide the basis for
preparation of a longer term strategy for the institution.
3.7          Key Structural Issues. The most pressing issues at present revolve around the recovery of
the banking system. Strategies need to be developed to deal with the bad loans on the books of the
remaining branches of the BOL (which would now be in the core bank). The future of the Savings Bank
must also be addressed urgently, focussing first on resolving the problem of the assets held in Moscow.
Finally, the future of the significantly undercapitalized commercial banks and their narrow ownership
stucture needs to addressed. There is a need to continue to strengthen, through technical assistance, the
capacity of the BOL to conduct sound monetary policy through mnarket-based mechanisms and to provide
effective prudential supervision of the banking system. The infrastructure of the financial system, (i.e. the
legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, the payments system and accounmg, auditing, and
financial/banking training) is in need of substantial attention.
C. Present Aictural Financing Ontions
3.8          A&ericuItura Credit from the Banlding System. By end-1992, total credit from the banking
system to the agricultural sector amounted to about LVR 5.0 billion (US$ 30.0 million), equivalent to about
25% of total credit to the economy. About 90 percent of this amount was in short-term credits and the
remaining balance was classified as medium- and long-term loans. The share of private farmers was 11
percent, comprising 6% of short-term and 50% of investment credits. Credit to the agricultural sector was
provided by the former BOL branches and credit from the emerging private banks is practically non-
existent. Assuming that only 2,500 private farmers (equivalent to 5 % total of private farmers) benefitted
from institutional credit, the average outstanding loan per borrower would amount to US$ 1,200 equivalent.



- 15-
3.9          The currently available credit to the private sector is likely to decrease following the
privatization and restructuring of the BOL branches, and private commercial banks would not become
purveyors of credit to the sector in the foreseeable fubure, given the fact that they lack resources, banking
skdlls, branch networks, and are averse to assuming the lending risks. Generally, during the first half of
1993, there has been disintermediation from the former BOL branches as well as from the Savings Bank.
Commercial banks have offered higher interest rates to attract deposits, and are able to lend at very
profitable margins for quick turnover trade transactions.
3.10         Other Sources of Financing. In May 1992, Govemment through MOA, established a
parastal joint stock company, AGROINVEST, to make loans to private farmers, and deposited in the
company LVR 175 million (about US$ 1.0 million) from the proceeds of the US food aid program. With
an office in Riga and a staff of four, Agroinvest made about 800 loans to individual private farmers,
averaging about US$ 1,200 per loan. The bulk of the funds, about 70%, were utilized to finance the
purchase of agnculuWal machinery, and the balance fnanced construction of farm buildings, home
improvements and the purchase of assets from state and collective farms. Despite its accomplishments,
Agroinvest lacks an appropriate credit delivery system, has exhausted its available resources, and should
be considered as a temporary or an ad-hoc arrangement made to fulfil GOL's conmnitment to the U.S.
authorities regarding the use of counterpart fiuds.
3.11         In April 1992, AGROLEASING was established by Govermnent as a joint venture with
three Finnish companies producing tractors and other agricultural machinery. With an export credit of
about US$ 12.0 million from Finland and a guarntee by GOL, Agroleasing has already imported and leased
to farmers 90 grain combines (costing about US$ 46,000 each), 60 grain dryers, and was planning to import
about 250 tractors during the second quarter of 1993. Leasing charges are payable in foreign exchange and
becase of the high prices of the imported equipment and the associated lease charges, Agroleasing is not
expected to play a major role within the credit system serving the private sector. It is likely to continue
operations with a narrow and high income stra of private farmers considered capable of servicing large
debts for agricultural machinery, which, by Latvian standards, is considered very expensive.
D. Bank Strae  for A          to  nancal Sector
3.12         The Bank is assisting the Government in developing the needed reforms targeted at
performance improvement in the banidng sector, addressing the key structural issues mentioned in the
preceding paragraphs, and plans to provide financial assistance i direct support of these activities. Direct
Bank technical assistance would continue to focus on policy advice and on identifying weaknesses in the
institutional framework which are imping the creation of an efficient banking system. Furthermore, the
Bank has agreed to act as coordinator among mulidlateral and bilateral donors of the various technical
assistance programs to establish the "core" bank and Government's financal restructuring strategy. A Bank
'operation, to support the overall and specific refortms in the entrprise and banking sectors, is presently
uxder preparation.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Obiectives
4.1          The rain objectives of the project are to help newly-emerged private farmers and to enhance
on-going privatization of agriculture, the agro-processing, and forest industries through provision of
investment credit that is virtually lacking at present. These efforts would raise agricultural output, increase
efficiency of production, generate employment, increase exports, and improve the standard of living. The
project aims to achieve this through: (a) financing credit to private farmers for on-farm investment and
incremental working capital in order to create viable private farming units and increase production; (b)
credit for the development, modernization, or rehabilitation of private/privatized agro- and forest industries;
and (c) an insdtutional development technical assistance program to be financed in part by various donors
and in part from the proceeds of the Bank loan. Within this broad framework, the project would support
fiancially and economically viable sub-projects in private sector enterprises, including those where a
majority stake in the company is privately owned (more than 50 percent).
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.2           The Government has requested the Bank's timely assistance for the agricultural sector.
Latvia was one of the first of the FSU countries to enter into an IMF stand-by agreement, and the
Government has made a serious commitment to economic stabilization. With such initiatives, the Bank
Group should be pro-active in providing early guidance on the course of reforms and the design of future
investment programs, and advising the Government on short- and medium-term development strategies for
the sector. These efforts would require significant technical and financial assistance from the international
communty in the short- and medium-term.
4.3          Crucial to the stabilization program, however, are policy reforms that increase the efficiency
of production and expenditures. The first Bank rehabilitation loan to Latvia is suppordng such policy
reforms, and the proposed agricultural loan, with specific investment supports, would help limit the decline
in output and employment resulting from the disruptions in the inter-republic trade of the FSU while the
Government is formulating and implementing its structural reform program. Key areas for early action to
rehabilitate agriculture include: (a) the strengthening of the rural financial system; (b) the elimination of
agricultural production and marketing monopolies; (c) price and agricultural trade liberalization; and (d) the
prompt implementation of the land privatization law.
4.4           The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and subsequent sector work, as well as the
preparation and appraisal of this project, have confirmed that agriculture is likely to remain an important
sector in Latvia in the long run, and in the short term it has the potential to be an important engine for
economic growth. The CEM set the agenda for reform and laid the basis for policy dialogue which is
complemented by the Sector Review and the proposed lending operations. Bank intervention in these areas
is proposed within the framework f a medium-term strategy aimed at continuing privatization of the sector



- 17 -
and at promoting stability, production efficiency, and profitability. Bank involvement is also expected to
catalyze financial support from other lenders and bilateral sources.
C. Summary Project Description
4.5          To achieve the above objectives the project would support the following activities:
(a)    Credit to Faers: The project would provide both on-farm investmnent credit and
initial working capital credit to private farmers. In the absence of a suitable
alternative financial intermediary capable of serving the new private farmers, a
temporary financial institution, the Agicultural Finance Company (AFC), would
be established to channel the World Bank funds (see Annex A).
(b)    Credit Support for Agro-and Forest-Industries: The project would provide
investment credits and initial working capital to small and medium-scale private
enterprises. Enterprises with a majority stake (more than 50 percent) of private
ownership would also be eligible for financing under the project.
(c)   Institutional Development TA Program: The project would support priority TA
programs which would directly enhance the viability of the project. In addition,
parallel TA activities for general sectoral development would also be supported.
The underlying principle of TA would be to enhance both human and institutional
skills required in a market economy.
D. Detailed Features
4.6       Credit to Farmers      nent. The proposed credit program to farmers would provide
financing of medium- and long-term investment credit, including initial incremental working capital to
private farmers with the objective of creating viable family farm units, increasing crop and livestock
production, and raising prodtiction efficiency. Given the expected large number of beneficiaries, the
average size of the subloans is expected to be around US$ 5,000. Main on-farm investment categories
would include:
(a) farm buildings and other construction, including rehabilitation and modernization of
livestock stables, hay, silage, and machinery storage sheds as well as provision of fences
and livestock watering facilities;
(b) machinery and equipment, such as tractors and ancillary machinery and equipment,
including hay-making equipment and forage choppers, as well as milking and milk cooling
devices;
(c) livestock, including cows and heifers, sheep, egg and broiler production, etc.; and
(d) seeds, fertilizer, and other high quality inputs as necessary.



- 18 -
4.7       Agro- and Eorest- Industries. The project would support small and medium scale private agro-
and forest-industries. Agro-industry investments would include privately-owned meat and dairy processing,
feed mill, potato and starch processing, and vegetable and fruit processing. Forest-industry investment
includes saw mills, plywood mills, and furniture making. Selection of final beneficiaries would be based
on the findings of feasibility studies, availability of self-contributed funds, financial and economic viability,
and repaymnent capacity.
4.8       The Government, with help of the Swedish and Finnish TA teams, has been carrying out
selection and appraisal of agro- and forest- industries subprojects. This work is continuing and feasibility
studies are under preparation for joint Government and Bank review, and the Investment Bank of Latvia's
(IBL) final approval. Appraisal of already identified subprojects as well as new projects in the pipeline
would continue throughout the project implementation period. Since the project was announced by the
Ministry of Agriculture earlier this year, approximately 250 agro- and 75 forest- industry proposals have
been submitted for consideration. They represent a wide variety of activities and investment requirements,
ranging from small bakeries and mediam-sized milk and meat processing units, to a number of large-scale
processing plants.
4.9       It is anticipated that about 16 subprojects in forest industries, and about 40 subprojects in agro-
industries with an loan amount ranging from US$14,000 to about US$1,000,000 would be supported. A
list of pre-appraised subprojects for which feasibility studies are under preparation is provided in Annex
D and summarized below.

- 19-
4.10         The Investment Bank of Latvia (IBL) has been selected to be the financial intermediary for
the agro- and forest-industry component. The IBL would re-appraise the sub-projects pre-appraised by the
two TA teams and would have full autonomy for final selection. Risk would be borne by the IBL. Several
agreements have been reached with the IBL management. An agreement was reached at negotiations
reaarding IBL's on-lening  anagmt and other modalities as follows:
(a)   IBL would reassess the investment proposals as necessary and select the final sub-
projects from the package.
(b)   IBL would have the full autonomy to approve, revise, or reject any of the sub-
projects but would advise and consult with the Bank about those which IBL decides
to reject from the original package.
(c)   IBL would complete the reassessment of the original package before considering
any new investment proposals.
(d)    For those new proposals, IBL would send to the Bank for prior review the first
three proposals irrespective of the sub-loan size and any additional sub-loans in
excess of US$200,000 equivalent.
(e)   IBL would maintain a separate project account which would be audited by
indeendent auditors.
(t)   IBL has agreed that there will not be any minimm size restriction on sub-loans to
be financed ;nder the project.
4.11          1h1 A. The TA component would be provided through collaboration of the
Bank, EC-PHARE and BITS of Sweden. The Bank would provide equipment necessary for land reforms;
the EC-PHARE would, among others, complement the Bank's support for land reforms by providing TA
and training in utiliaiDg the equipment; and BITS of Sweden would provide various TA for advancing
privatization of the agricultural sector. A three-year TA program for 1993-1995 critical for the success of
remainig reforms has been identified. Key TA activities include support for land reform and creation of
a land market, strengthening of Agricultural Advisory Services, applied research, training of technicians
and farmers, improvement of the agricululral information basis including market and prices information,
establishment of an up-to-dae agricultal library including subscriptions to trde journals, varietal field
tesdng and demonstation work on private farmers' fields, and increasing competition among marketing,
transportation and distribution system.
4.12         The main TA components are as follows:
(a)    Support for Land Reforms: The proposed project would provide TA to the State
Land Serces (SLS) which is responsible for overall land (both urban and rural)
reforms and privatization. Some support would also be provided to the Ministry
of Justice for land registration, but SLS would e;ecute and manage the TA support.
The proposed project would provide support for purchasing equipment for land
cadastre, registration, and iding. Institutional support and training for land



- 20 -
cadastre and registration, including legal reforms would be provided by EC-PHARE
and a bilateral source (BITS) under the supervision of SLS. Such collaboration
between the Bank (in providing equipment) and the donors (in providing the
consultants and training) was necessary due to restrictions placed on the donors in
the procurement of equipment, while no such restrictions existed for grant financing
of consultants and training. The total requirement for equipment amounts to over
US$ 5 million over the period of five years. The project, during the three year
implementation period, would provide about US$ 1.2 million equivalent to support
equipment purchases necessary for land reforms. This TA component would be
financed by the Bank. However, there is a possibility for a bilateral financing at
a lower rates. Once such a financing arrangement is completed, the Government
would be able to choose the cheaper financing source and the loan proceeds would
be reallocated (see Annex E. 1 for complete list of equipment). The Goverunent's
minimum targets for titling and registration of private farms are the following -
500 farms to be registered by January 1, 1994; 10,000 by January 1, 1995; and
20,000 by January 1, 1996. Upon registration, the owners of these farms would
enjoy full ownership rights including the right to sell, mortgage or otherwise
transfer the property.
(b)    EC-PHARE Parallel TA Support for Agriculture: A preliminary agreement has
been reached on the pastllel three year TA program for agriculture which would
be implemented by EC-PHARE. The total TA support by EC-PHARE between
1993-1995 (from 92-94 funds) would be about US$3.82 million equivalent. The
main elements of ihe parallel TA component include:
e     hImediate and long-term support for AFC management (1993-1995);
O     Agricultural Research: defining of research priorities and directions, and
establishment of a joint research library and information basis;
O     Agricultural Extension: training, field support, information technology and
statistical basis;
     Agricultural Marketing and Distribution system: assessment of systematic
constraints, development of wholesale mnarkets, and establishment of a
competition unit in the MOA.
(c)    Swedish BITS Parallel TA Support for Agriculture: Preliminary agreements have
been reached with BITS that over the three year period (1993-95), BITS could
provide support for parallel TA projects in agriculture for a total of about US$ 0.9
million. Their support would focus on land privatization, cadastre and registration,
for which BITS has already been providing support.
4.13         TA Coordination with NGOs for Agricultural Sector. In addition, voluntary services such
as Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA), International Executive Service Corps (IESC),
Enterprise Support Center (UAC-supported by EC-PHARE), and the Peace Corps have pledged their
support for the project and agreed to provide on-site, hands-on TA support to final beneficiaries of the
project for farm business management, financial accounting, marketing, etc.



- 21 -
4.14         TA Coordinator for the Sector. To ensure that the proposed TA programn would be
implemented efficiently, EC-PHARE also has agreed to set up a TA coordinator for the agricultural sector
within the project management unit (PMU), and tendering of a bid has already begun. The coordinator
would be responsible for designing, coordinating, and managing implementation of all TA work in the
agricultural sector and would liaise closely with the central aid coordinator. The coordinator would be
assisted by local staff and would report directly to the director of the PMU. The TA unit would help
implement and supervise the TA directly assisted under the Bank project in addition to all other TA
activities in the sector. Bank supervision missions would work closely with this TA unit.
E. Status of Preparation
4.15         Summary of Suipport during Project Preparation. Since this is the first project for the
agricultural sector, the counterpart has a tremendous learning-curve to overcome. Nevertheless, the
Government has been commnitted to project preparation and processing. Since Latvia lacks the technical,
financial, and marketing skills necessary for proper project preparation, the Bank has arranged for two
foreign consultant teams to assist the Government in preparation of agro- and forest industry sub-projects
with support of bilateral TA grants from Sweden and Finland. In addition, a Dutch bilateral TA grant has
been obtained to assist in establishing an Agricultural Finance Company (AFC), a temporary financial
intermediary to channel funds to newly emergent private farmers. TA coordination with EC-PHARE and
other bilateral interests has been arranged. Much of this work has already been implemented.
4.16         The Government has also set up a Project Management Unit (PMU) located in the Ministry
of Agriculture. The staff represent the MOA and non-governmental institutions. The management tean
of the PMU has fully been staffed and they are in the process of recruiting local staff for further training.
In addition to local sources, EC-PHARE has committed support to strengthen the PMU. The project would
also provide a limited amount for project management during the project implementation period.
4.17         Establishment of Agricultural Finance Companv (AFC). There is a general consensus that
there is an urgent need for a fmancial institution to support the production and development of the emerging
private agricultural sector. In the absence of a well-functioning banking system which has the necessary
skills and is prepared to provide credit to the private agriculture sector, a financial intermediary would be
established to channel funds to a large number of new private farmers. The Government has already
approved establishment of the AFC. The Bank is also playing an instrumental role in coordinating external
assistance from multilateral (EC-PHARE), bilateral, public, and private sources in AFC establishment. The
activities to establish AFC began in mid-1993. An outline which describes the proposed legal status,
organizational structure, financing arrangements and operating procedures of the AFC has been prepared
and approved by the Government. By early December 1993, the General Manager and key personnel are
in place, location of the headquarters and the first four satellite offices have been established, staff training
and other preparatory activities are continuing. The target date for start-up operation of the AFC is January
1994. This work would be closely coordinated with ti- - Bank Group's financial sector restnvcturing work
to minimize risk of diverting valuable resources from long-term agendas.
4.18         A team of experts from a major Dutch bank has been cooperating with the Bank to assist
the Government to establish the AFC and also to assist the AFC management during the initial years of



- 22 -
operation. An expatriate banldng expert has been in Latvia on an EC-PHARE contract since the beginning
of October to assist the AFC with it's day-to-day preparation work for the start of lending operations.
Long-term TA support during the initial phase of its lending operations would be critical for successful AFC
operations. EC-PHARE, with the agreement of the Government, has already included support for the
AFC in its 1993-1995 TA program and tendering has begun. A Special Govermnent Commission is
supervising the establishment of the AFC until the full Board of Directors for the AFC is in place.
4.19         EC-PHARE's hmnediate Support for APC and PMU: EC-PHARE has provide short-term,
immediate support for the AFC and PMU from the Counterpart funds (CPF). With the Council of
Ministers' approval, the PMU has been managing the CPF which has provided, among other things, office
and communication equipment and training of local staff.
4.20         Investment Bank of Latvia (IBL).  The IBL was established in 1992 by a cooperative
agreement between the Govermnent of Latvia and the Nordic Ministers of Finance. During its frs year
the IBL was assisted by the Nordic Investment Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD). The Govermment of Latvia has subscribed DM 6,475,000 to the bank's statutory
capital and has approved an additional DM 6,750,000. Negotiations with the EBRD are expected to bing
an additional US $3.5 million, which would raise the statutory capital to about US$ 10.0 million total. The
EBRD and Nordic Investment Bank have also pledged roughly ECU 10 million to provide for technical
assistance. After experiencing some initial difficulties, the IBL is fully staffed and is expected to resume
normal lending operations. A more complete discussion of the IBL is found in Annex B.
F. Imulementation Schedule
4.21         Preparatory work to set up the AFC has already begun. The AFC would start partial
operation within one month from the Board approval (tentativel-' January 1994) then grdually build-up its
operation in rural areas. The Credit component to support fan. s would be implemented over three years
(1994-1996). The agro- and forest-industries component would oe implemented over three years unless the
pre-selected investments are not fully implemented and substitute new investments are needed. In such a
case, the implementation would take place over four years. TA activities would take place over three years
and scheduling of specific TA activities would depend on the duration and urgency of the activities. The
project is expected to be completed on or before December 31, 1996 and the closing date is expected to be
December 31, 1997.
G. Cost E:ats_
4.22         The total project cost is estimated at $45.1 million. The Bank loan would finance 55% of
estimated total project costs which is equivalent to about 83% of the projected foreign exchange component
of the project. The project costs do not include taxes or duties as these are not currently levied on goods
projected to be financed under the project. Imported materials or equipment are exempt from duties for
Bank financed projects. (Cost estimates are based on prelmiary designs and unit prices currenly
prevailing in Latvia along with machinery and equiment prices lists from local and intemational sources).
Estimated costs are summarized in Table 4.2 below.

4.23           The proposed Bank loan of $25 million would cover 55%  of the project cost.  The
remaining 45% would be financed by sources summarized in Table 4.3. Of the sub-borrowers, the farmer's
share, including contributions in kind, would range from 20 to 25%. The industrial sub-borrowers would
contribute at least 30% of the project costs.

I. Procurement
4.24           A major portion of the credit component under the project would be directed toward a large
number of small and medium-size private farmers and private enterprises. These project beneficiaries would
generally be free to purchase tractors, combines, and other farm machinery in accordance with their own
choice. The beneficiaries would be expected to carry out procurement of goods and equipment using
normal local commercial practices. It is expected that the purchaser would obtain at least three competitive
bids in order to select the lowest price consistent with quality and service of the goods and equipment. With
sufficiently liberalized import regulations, foreign suppliers are already active in the Latvian market on a
competuive basis. The credit and commercial risk in private entities would accelerate development of



- 24 -
private initiatives and gradually reduce the role of the government. Through TA and support from NGOs,
the project would contribute to the development of a competitive network of private dealers/factory agents
of agricultural equipment. In addition to small equipment, other goods likely to be financed would include
construction material, farn inputs, livestock for breeding or fattening, etc. Given the large variety of items
to be procured and the estimated small size of an average of US$ 5,000 per farm, grouping of orders in bid
packages would not be possible and the procurement procedures described above for agriculturai goods
would be applied.
4.25         The project would support about 56 small and medium sized privately owned agro- and
forest industries. Goods and services required for investments in agro- and forest industries would be
procured as follows. Contracts up to US$ 100,000 equivalent each, would be procured on the basis of at
least three price quotations from qualified suppliers. Contracts from US$ 100,000 to US$ 1.0 million would
be executed on the basis of at least three price quotations from three countries. All contracts above US$
1 million would be procured under the simplified international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.
Procurement of Bank-fianced goods and services would follow the Bank's procuremen' guidelines (1992)
and use of the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Goods (May 1993) would be mandatory for all ICB
procurement.

J. Disbursements
4.26         The proposed Bank loan of US$ 25.0 mnillion would be disbursed over a period of three
years (1994 - 1996) and the expected project closing date would be December 31, 1997. A mid-term
evaluation would be undertaken by the Bank and the Borrower during the last quarter of calendar year 1995
or when the disbursement reaches 50% of the total loan amount, whichever is earlier, to examine the pace
of implementation and the flow of loan funds. Commitments for major contracts would be approved until
June 30, 1996.
4.27         Up to US$ 2 million would be financed retroactively for eligible subloans approved and
disbursed by PFIs starting from September 1, 1993 provided all lending criteria including procurement
guidelines were followed. A schedule of the estimated disbursement of the proposed Bank loan is shown
in Annex F.
4.28         Loan funds allocated to finance credit for on-farm development and for agro- and forest
industries would be disbursed as follows: 100% of eligible subloans approved in the first year; 85% of
eligible subloans approved in the second year; and 70% of eligible subloans approved in the third year and
later. These disbursement percentages are necessary because both financial intermediaries are new
institutions and would not be in a position to raise internal resources at inception of their lending operations.
As the AFC and IBL build up equity and their own funds over the years from retained earnings,
repayments and other sources, these intermediaries' share would gradually increase up to 30% of subloans
to be approved in year 3. Loan disbursements for the TA component would be 100% of foreign
expenditures and 80% of local expenditures (see table 4.5).

- 26-
4.29         The first year represents the period of one year beginning on the dates that the AFC and
IBL each have approved their first subloan for on-farm development or agro- and forest industries
respectively. The percentage calculations are based on the assumption that subloan approvals would amomnt
to US$ 8.5 million in the first year, US$ 10.0 million in the second, and US$ 9.8 million in the third and
final year. Various indicators show that the demand for credit is considerably higher than the proposed loan
amount of US$25 million. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the proposed project could be
implemented in three years.
4.30         Statements of expenditures (SOEs). All withdrawal applications for category I & II would
be made on the basis of certified statments of expenditures (SOEs), except for contracts above US$ 250,00
for which withdrawals would be based on full documenaon. All supporting documentation would be
retained by MOF, AFC and IBL and consolidated by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the
Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation would
be made available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank missions.
4.31         Snecial Account. To facilitate disbursements, the Bank would provide funds to the MOF
to establish a Special Account in a bank acceptable to the Bank. This Special Account would be maintained
in US dollars and managed by the PMU under supervision of MOP. An aareement was reached at
negotiations that the SpecWa_ Account uR to US$2 million would be established at a forei-n bank acceptable
to the Bank. The PMU would prepare and submit applications to the MOF for replenishment of the Special
Account monthly or whenever the account has been drawn down to half of its initial deposit amount,
whichever comes first.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Coordination and Manaement
5.1          The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), through a Project Management Unit (PMU), would
be responsible for coordinating project implementation and maintaining overall financial control, based on
accounts and reports submitted to the PMU by the Ministry of Finance (MOP) and the participating
implementing agencies. The PMU would be headed by a director, who would have a full-time deputy
director, to manage day-to-day affairs, and clerical staff as considered necessary. A World Bank Project
Management Commission (the Commission) chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and with representatives
of Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, Environment and Regional Development, Economics, and the Bank
of Latvia has been established. Th.e main function of the commission is to provide policy guidelines and
to supervise the activities of the PMU, monitor the operations of the participating agencies and facilitate
inter-ministerial coordination and problem solving. The MOF would administer the Bank Loan, and the
Agricultural Finance Company (AFC) and the Latvian Investment Bank (IBL) would onlend Loan proceeds
to ultimate project beneficiaries. Loan proceeds for financing technical assistance would be made available
by MOF to the respective Government agencies under normal Government budgetary financing procedures.
An a_reement was reached at negotiations that the Government would maintain the PMU during thc lifetime
of the project.
5.2          The project would be implemented with the aid of existing institutions and agencies, and
would assist in the establishment of the AFC. Given the present status of the banking system and the
complete lack of institutional credit to the emerging private agricultural sector, the speedy establishment
of the AFC is considered necessary to temporarily fill the gap in financial services support for the
privatization of agricultural production.
B. Credit Operations
5.3          Institutional Arrangements. The MOF would on-lend these funds to the AFC and IBL
(Anmex A and B), which would in turn extend subloans to ultimate beneficiaries. At present, because of
the ongoing restructuring of the banking system, these arrangements are considered to be the most
appropriate for channelling loan funds to individual private farmers and processing industries. However,
it is envisaged that with the development and strengthening of the commercial banking system, one or more
commercial banks would be in a position to meet the eligibility criteria detailed in para 5.6 and also
participate in the project. Furthermore it is intended that the AFC, or branches (satellites) of the AFC, with
their respective loan portfolios and liabilities, would be transferred to and taken over by eligible
commercial banks (see Annex A, para 1).
5.4          Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Each of the two participating institutions would sign a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the MOF, satisfactory to the Bank. This agreement would, inter alia,
specify that both the AFC and IBL would:



- 28 -
(a)    undertake lending operatiors in accordance with lending guidelines and procedures
acceptable to the MOF and the Bank;
(b)   submit to the Bank for prior review the first three subloan proposals, irrespective
of the subloan size, and any additional subloan proposals in excess of US$ 200,000
equivalent. An agreement was reached at negotiations on the prior-review criteria;
(c)    ensure that funds provided under Project-financed subloans are used by sub-
borrowers for the purposes intended and that appropriate procurement proce ures
are followed;
(d)   supervise subprojects as appropriate and provide the PMU and the Bank with
periodic reports on the status of subprojects and subloans, including information on
loan recovery perfonmance;
(e)    provide the MOF, PMU, and the Bank with such information as they may
reasonably request; and
(f)    maintain all necessary documentation.
5.5           Conclusion of Subsidar Loan A&ments between the MOF and at least one of eitherth
AFC or the LBL would be a condition of Loan effectiveness.
5.6          Eligibility Cr teria for Financial Intermediaries: Selection criteria for the participating
fmancial institutions (PFI) was as follows:
(a)    good standing with regulatory agencies;
(b)   sound financial policies, satisfactory to the Bank, particularly with regard to credit
administration and asset and liability management, and satisfactory capital structure
according to BOL requirements;
(c)    a technical unit, specialized in medium- and long-term investment lending,
adequately staffed, trained, and considered capable of undertaking loan appraisal,
supervision and monitoring;
(d)    an adequate network of branch offices/agencies in the rural area for the farm-credit
component;
(e)    presentation of annual financial statements audited by independent auditors in
accordance with international auditing standards; and
(f)    a statement of lending policy and procedures, acceptable to the Bank, designed to
facilitate the efficient conduct of PFI operations and affairs, including the carrying
out of its activities under the Project.



- 29 -
5.7          MOF Operating Procedures. The principal functions to be performed by MOF with regard
to the Project would be as follows:
(a)    maintain the Loan and Special Accounts and the consolidated Project Accounts;
(b)   consolidate reimbursement applications received from the AFC and IBL (para 5.1),
submit withdrawal applications to the World Bank, onlend and channel the Loan
funds to the PFIs and maintain adequate records of all project related expenditures;
(c)    maintain the loan accounts for AFC and IBL, and collect principal, interest, and
other charges payable by AFC and IBL on their respective shares of the Loan;
(d)   ensure compliance with audit requirements, as stipulated in the Loan Agreement;
and,
(e)    provide the PMU and the Bank with such information on the above as they may
reasonably request.
5.8          Eligibilityof Beneficiaries and Subloan Financing. Loan funds would be onlent to individual
private farmers and agricultural processing, marketing and service enterprises, operating as joint stock
companies, farmers' associations, cooperatives, partnerships or individuals. The Loan would not be utilized
to finance public sector activities or enterprises in which the majority shareholding is public. However,
majority privately owned (more than 50 percent) enterprises would be eligible for financing under the
project. Activities eligible for financing would include on-farm investments and incremental working capital
and investments in agro- and forest industries (limited to mechanical wood processing and excluding the
pulp and paper industry), storage, marketing and agro-services. The Loan would not be utilized to finance
land purchase or lease, amd housing construction or improvement. Preference would be given to investment
subprojects which conserve energy, improve energy consumption, and have a positive impact on the
environment.
5.9          Investment subprojects in agro- and forest industries, storage, marketing and agro-services
would have to satisfy the following eligibility criteria:
(a)   subprojects must be expected to be completed within 18 months from the date of
signature of subloan agreement;
(b)   the financial and economic rates of return for any proposed subproject should each
be not less than 15%;
(c)   appraisal projections should demonstrate a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3
over the life of the project, calculated on the basis of the entity's total debts;
(d)   sub-borrower's contribution of own funds towards subproject cost would be no less
than 30% for new investment subprojects and no less than 20% for investments in
moderni7zaion, rehabilitation, expansion, etc. of existing facilities;



- 30 -
(e)    each beneficiary of a subloan exceeding US$ 500,000 would introduce an
appropriate cost accounting and management information system not later than 12
months after subloan approval by the AFC/IBL, and a commitment to this effect
would be included in the subloan agreement; and
(f)    no safety hazard or environmental deterioration should result, directly or indirectly,
from any investment to be financed under the Project.
5.10         Eligibility criteAia, as stipulated in para. 5.9, sub-paras. (b), (c) and (f) would also be
applied to subprojects for on-farm development. However, for these subprojects, the sub-borrower's
contribution towards subproject cost would be no less than 15 %.
5.11         Appraisal Methodology. Subloan applications for investments in agro- and forest industries
would be supported by detailed feasibility studies and appraisal reports. These studies would cover the
following:
(a)   the technical feasibility, financial viability, commercial soundness and economic
justification of the proposed investment. Particular emphasis would be placed on
assessing the marketing possibilities for the incremental production of the
subproject;
(b)    an evaluation of the proposed scale of the subproject, the need and adequacy of the
civil works and equipment to be procured, the location of the enterprise, its layout
and design, and the estimated investment costs in domestic and foreign currencies;
and of compliance with pollution control and other environmental protection
guidelines set by the authorities; and,
(c)    an evaluation of the sub-borrower's ownership structure, creditworthiness,
organization, management and financial position, and of the technical staff and
know-how available for implementing the subprojects and its operation.
5.12         Simplified appraisal procedures would be applied to subprojects with an estimated cost not
exceeding US$ 100,000 equivalent, for replacement of equipment, modernization, expansion, etc. These
procedures would include, as applicable:
(a)   review and assessment of the viability and financial soundness of the enterprise and
its capacity to service the subloan; and
(b)   the technical verification that the equipment, materials and spare parts to be
purchased are appropriate and are intended to be used in the existing production
process, to break any existing production bottleneck, increase efficiency of the
existing process or contribute to improving quality and meet higher product
standards.
5.13         An agreement was reached at negotiations that participating financial institutions would
adhere to the eliibbility criteria and appraisal procedures as described in paras. 5.8 through 5 12 above.



- 31 -
5.14         Terms and Conditions of Financin . The MOF, on behalf of Government, would onlend
the proceeds of the loan in US dollars to the AFC and IBL. (para 5.3). However, the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement with AFC (para. 5.4) would stipulate that for the first US$ 1.0 million withdrawn by the AFC
and for amounts equivalent to 15 percent of each subsequent withdrawal from the Loan account, the AFC
would allocate shares to Govenmment. The shares would be denominated in LAT and would be equivalent
to the amounts withdrawn in US$ on the date of each withdrawal. The share capital of the AFC would not
form a part of the subsidiary loan and would not be repayable by the AFC. The onlending interest rate
charged by the MOF to the AFC and IBL would be based on the Bank's variable interest rate, which is reset
semi-annuaiiy, plus a margin of at least 10% of the Bank's rate to cover the commitment fee, the MOF's
cross currency risk between the Bank's currency pool and the US dollar exchange rates, and MOF
administrative expenses.
5.15         The AFC and IBL would make subloans to ultimate beneficiaries denominated and repayable
in US dollars equivalent at variable interest rates which would reflect the cost of funds paid by the AFC
and IBL to the MOF (para 5.14) and their spread based on the risk assessment made in each case.
5.16         There is no comparable reference rate for on-lending rates, as there is a complete absence
of long-term credit for agriculture in Latvia today. The financial sector conditions are such that there are
no discount rates for inter-bank borrowing nor markets for certificate of deposits which could serve as a
reference rate to compare the project's on-lending rate. The on-lending rate for the project would be
positive in real terms. Furthermore, all on-lending interest rates would be reviewed annually by the MOF,
the Bank, and PFIs to ensure that they are mintaind at a level which is not unduly onerous to the
beneficiary, but adequate to cover the AFC and IBL's operating expenditures and leading risks and the
MOF's cross currency risks and administrative expenditures.
5.17         Repayment schedules of funds on-lent by the MOF to the AFC and IBL would be based on
the amortization schedule of the Bank loan. Repayment schedules of project financed subloans would differ
from the amortization schedule of the Bank loan. Subloans would have a term of up to 12 years, inclusive
of grace periods of up to 3 years. Grace and amortization periods would be based on the type of investment
financed and the projected cash-flow and be commensurate with the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers.
Repayment periods would not exceed the usefil life of the investment financed. Any amounts of principal
repaid by sub-borrowers to the APC or IBL, and that are not immediately needed for repayment of the Bank
loan, would be kept by the AFC and IBL in a separate rollover account which would be utilized by them
to finance additional investments aimed at pursuing the objectives of the projects, and conforming with the
agreed terms, conditions and eligibility criteria for the Project. Lending risks would be borne by
participating financial institutions.
5.18         Subloan Processing and Administration. For farm credit, the AFC would be responsible
for identifying prospective sub-borrowers and for determining the type of subproject to be financed,
following the eligibility criteria for investments and subloan beneficiaries described in paras 5.8 and 5.9
above. Subloan applications, farm plans, feasibility studies, etc. would be prepared by beneficiaries with
assistance of mobile credit officers of the AFC and the staff of the Latvian Agricultural Advisory Services
(LAAS), in accordance with the AFC's lending procedures and the cooperation arrangements established
between the APC and LAAS.



- 32 -
5.19         For agro-processing and forest industry subprojects, detailed feasibility studies are being
prepared by teams of expatriate consultants in coordination with the Bank appraisal mission for investment
subprojects in agro-processing enterprises and forest industries. The package of pre-appraised subprojects
would be given to the IBL for further processing. Given the time that has elapsed since preparation of the
feasibility studies, the rapidly changing agribusiness enviromnent in Latvia and the likely changes that may
have occurred in the original assessmeAls of viability, marketing possibilities financial coniditions of
prospective beneficiaries, etc., the IBL would reassess the investnent proposals and feasibility studies as
necessary, and select the subprojects which would be financed by the IBL. The IBL would have full
autonomy to approve, revise, or reject any of the pre-appraised subprojects; however, the IBL would
complete the reassessment of the pre-appraised subprojects before considering any new investment
proposals.
C. AccQou  and Audit
5.20         Financial statements of participating financial institutions would be audited for each fiscal
year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. These audits would be in accordance with
international standards and would also conform with requirements of the MOF and the BOL. The MOF's
project accounts, the Special Account and statements of expenditure would also be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The auditors' reports would be of such scope and in such detail as the
Bank shall reasonably request, and should contain, inter alia, separate opinions on the special account and
the statements of expenditure. At negotiations. an agreement was obtained that copies of the audited
accounts relating to the Proiect and the Bank Loan. as well As thLe audited financil sWtatmet of the AFC
and IBL. would be submitted to the Bank within six monhls of the end of each fiscal year. AMro- and
forest-industr entelry ses would be required to submit eriodicallv to the IBL financial and other reports
including their annmal financial staemens. These documents would be made available tc, Bank supervision
missions for review.
D. Reportg  and Evaluation
5.21         The PMU, in cooperation with the AFC and IBL, would be responsible for monitoring and
evaluating the impact of the project. The AFC and IBL would supervise the physical subproject
implementation at the farm/enterprise levels through field visits and review of documents, invoices and key
indicators provided by sub-borrowers and identify bottlenecks, problems, and constraints affecting project
implementation and its expected impact and results, and take appropriate remedial actons considered
necessary. The AFC and IBL would also keep the PMU informed of their findings and the actions taken
or proposed to be taken.
5.22          fepr. Based on information collected from the MOF, and the AFC and IBL, the PMU
would prepare a semi-anmnal progress report (June and December each year) wlich would be submitted to
the Bank within 30 days of the end of the period under review. These reports would include a copy of the
project account, a summary stement of the financial status of the project and the Bank loan, and a brief
descriptive section on the physical implementation of subprojects and on the problems encountered during
implementation. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the PMU would coWly with all reporting
reLuarements.



- 33 -
5.23         Proiect Completion Report (PCR). Promptly after completion of the project, but no later
than six months after the closing date, the PMU, with the collaboration of the MOF and the AFC and IBL,
would prepare and furnish to the Bank the required data, as would be prescribed by the Bank, for the
preparation of a PCR. The information to be submitted to the Bank would also include an assessment of
the performance of the various participating institutions and agencies in discharging their respective
obligations under the project.
E. Bank Supervision
5.24         Intensive, semi-annual Bank supervision would be required, focusing particularly on: (a)
AFC/IBL capacity for project implementation and loan servicing; (b) reviewing the performance of the
agricultural sector and the progress in privatization of production and processing; (c) the adequacy of agreed
lending terms and conditions and compliance; (d) the possibility of involving commercial banks in Project
implementation, and the transfer of the AFC to one or more restructured commercial banks; and (e)
reviewing progress in implementation of project-related technical assistance activities financed by various
donor agences and their impact on the Project.
F. Envrnment
5.25         The AFC and IBL would stipulate in subloan agreements that sub-borrowers using project
funds should comnply with all laws and regulations of Latvia related to environmental protection and they
would also supervise compliance. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the appraisal reports for
ar  and forest-industr subnrojects would contain a section describing the environmental analvsis
gieformed and the enviromnental imac of the Lronsd_ investment, (Mm 5.2 (t) and 5.1 1 (b.

VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, RISK, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
A. I-emdlts
6.1          The project's potential benefits include increased production of various crops and livestock
products, diversified and improved quality in processed goods, increased export revenues, and economic
stabilizaton in rural ares. This would be achieved by providing credit which is currently lacking for
financially sound private investments in agriculture, agro-processing, and forest-industries. The project
would also serve as vehicle for further reform in agriculture that would lead to private ownership of land
and other productive assets through enhancing compedtion and allowing for new entries in the sector while
improving the efficiency of existing enterprises. The project would also improve agro-chemical
management, soil conservation, and agro-industrial effluent control, and thus contribute to environmental
protection.
6.2          Additionally, the project would provide the basis for creating a financial system to serve
the private agricultural sector, especially the emerging private farme,. It would establish operating
procedures and banfldng skills necessary for investment lending and produce a team of trained credit
officers. The procedures, as developed and tested by the AFC, could be replicated by commercial banks
and skilled staff could be transferred to commercial or any other banks after the AFC has completed its
designaed role.
6.3          Lending to private farmers would be closely linked to intensive technical assistance, which
wowd provide farm and financial nmnagement sldlls in addition te production technology. It would also
educate/itill crekdit repayment discipline as a condition for continued access to institutional credit and
develop a pattern of sound financial management. Agriculture advisors and the AFC credit officers would
work closely together to achieve these objectives. Similarly, technical assistance would be provided to the
private or privatized agro- and forest- industries, focussing on those skills needed in a highly competitive
market economy, including; management, planning and budgeting, accounting and cost control, and
management information systems.
6.4          Support for land cadastre, land dtling, and registration would accelerate the establishment
of legal property rights and a finctioning land market. Secure land tenure would foster long-term
investment and provide farmers with the ability to offer land as collateral in financing agreements.
Technical assistance for the LAAS would strengthen the technical support which is indispensable for the
success of the emerging private farming community. The AFC and LAAS would work closely together at
the frm level, thus providing farmers with combined TA support in farm" business management as well as
in technical areas.
B. Jtiflmdo ons
6.5          Demand for credit, particularly for medium- to long-term credit is likely to be high in
Latvia. The agricultural sector has not received, either from public nor private sources, any long-term
investnent credits for some time. As farms are going through structural and ownership changes, the

requirement for farm restructuring and recapitalization with appropriate equipment and fixed assets is
enormous. During the project preparation period, the Govermnent of Latvia announced that support by the
World Bank for the agricultural and agro- and forest-industry was likely. Following the announcement,
more than 300 agrn- and forest-industry proposals were submitted and more than 430 private farmers
submitted the initial loan application to the Ministry of Agriculture in a 5 week period (late April-May,
1993). The total demand based on this initial round of inquiry was in excess of US$ 200 million.
Although the initial show of interest was not based on precise information, and not all the applications merit
financial support, it does illustrate the magnitude of credit demand in the economy. The actual subprojects
to be supported under the project would be selected based on a careful analysis of not only financial and
economic viability, but also marketing prospects. Based on much of the ground work already completed
on subproject pre-screening, the actual disbursement could exceed the rates assumed in para. 4.28 and
Annex F.
6.6          Latvia is a low cost producer of most of its major agricultural products and consequently
agriculture shows a good returns on investment. A per hectare base crop oudget has been prepared for the
10 most commonly grown crops in Latvia. Under the assumption that farmers would have access to
necessary inputs and farm management would improve with the help of extension services. The "with
project" case Benefit:Cost (B:C) ratios for wheat, rye, rapeseed variety "00", potato, and forage maize are
1.58, 1.93, 1.69, 1.81 and 1.93 respectively. Marginal benefit for every LVRI of investment range from
LVR1.31 for wheat, to 2.99 for fodder beet, and 2.92 for rapeseed.
6.7          Commercial farming (as opposed to part-time farming) operations are likely to prevail
because such operations can and would provide the driving force required to substantially restructure and
upgrade the overall farmning sector. Mixed farming (crop and livestock/dairy) was chosen for several
reasons - this mixed farming is typical for smaller private farms, it affords reasonable security since failure
of any one product is likely to be offset by others, it affords higher levels of on-farm employment than
cropping alone at a time when rural unemployment is high, and it provides a more balanced cash flow to
support the farner throughout the year. Furthermore, such a small- to medium mixed-farming base could
be flexible and responsive to developing trends in Latvian competitiveness. As the demands of Latvian
consumers and agro-industries change, and as sources of longer term competitive advantage for Latvian
production enterprises become more clear, it is likely that a farming sector composed of such farms would
be well suited to shift and/or consolidate production to complement the changing profile of demand.
6.8          Based on the above assumptions, in order to illustrate the economics of additional
investment, integrated farm-models for typical farms have been developed which illustrate a substantial
increase in farmers' income indicating the financial strength of supporting farmers. The farms evaluated
range in size from 10 ha to over 50 ha and usually have integrated production patterns including crops and
some livestock. The models are based on underlying assumptions that include major changes in present
crop mixes, an increase in perennial forage legumes, introduction of modern forage maize production,
intensification of permanent grassland use, and additional fixed investment such as building, equipment,
animal stock, etc. The rates of return for selected farm models range between 16% to 31%. The crop
budget, farm models, and input and output prices are in Annex C.
6.9    An economic analysis was carried out for selected subprojects. This project would only support
investments which on average were likely to show expected economic and financial rates of -etum in excess
of 15%.  The total economic investment costs include physical contingencies but exclude price



- 36 -
contingencies, subsidies, poverty grants and taxes. Local financial prices have been adjusted for the purpose
of economic analysis by distinguishing outputs and inputs as tradeable and non-tradeable. World Bank price
projections or average export prices actually realized in Latvia were used to estimate the farm-gate economic
prices in 1993 constant terms for traded inputs and outputs. Based on these assumptions and an assumed
project life of 15 years, the base case ERRs for selected processing sub-projects range between 18% to
35%.
C. ,Risi
6.10         Risks associated with the project are: (a) macroecononmic instability; (b) political instability;
(c) possible reintroduction of excessive import tariffs and/or export duties; (d) delays in implementation of
land titling, registration, and fully functioning land markets; (e) high financial risk inherent in new private
farming; (f) slower than expected start-up of the Agricultural Finance Company (AFC); and (g) market
fluctuations, particularly for those sub-projects requiring long gestation periods. Given the commitmnent by
the Government to continue economic reforms, the first three risks are somewhat mitigated. For market
and financial risks, the project would strengthen institutional capacities in credit assessment and market
analysis, and risk is likely to be reduced by careful analysis of future market potential of each sub-project.
Institutional risks are minimized by technical assistance already in place to establish the AFC and strengthen
the financial intermediaries. Substantal TA is incorporated in the project to strengthen agricultural
extension and training and the farm business management capabilities of the project beneficiaries, hence
reducing the risks in lending to new private farmers.
D. Envirownental impac
6.11         The environmental impact resulting from the project would be limited. All necessary
precautionary measures would be included to promote an environmentally sustainable agricultural sector.
However, as in all other agricultural projects, there would be increased application of agro-chemicals and
potential industrial enviromnental effects, e.g. air, water and noise, to be managed.
6.12         The potential environmental impact from agro-chemical application is likely to be decreased
however, with the use of modem application methods, better equipment, and training in application and
equipment use. The need to pay higher world market agro-chemical prices would ensure less wastage of
fertilizers and pesticides and adherence to minimum application rates necessary for adequate crop
production. Animal waste disposal and nitrogen and ammonia buildups resulting from intensive livestock
production are also likely to be reduced substantially with the breakup of large state-owned feed lots and
production facilities.
6.13         The complete sub-project list has not been finalized, but during the selection process, the
final selection criteria would include enviromnenal criteria to ensure that adequate preventative measures
uild be taken. To minimze any potential environmental impacts, the Bank's guidelines on pesticide use
would be followed, and all sub-projects in the agro- and forest-industries component would be selected



- 37 -
based on satisfactory compliance with local environental standards acceptable to the Bank.  The
Government's decision to liberalize the prices of fertilizer and pesticides has induced farmers to better
manage agro-chemica) application. The industrial component would include adequate funds for proper
effluent and air discharge and treatment of waste water. In light of this focus, this project has been rated
Category B.

LATVIA
Agricultural Development Proiect
The Agricultural Finance Companv (AFC'
1.           Rationale and Objectives. Privatization of agricultural production, which started in
1988/89, greatly accelerated in 1992, and according to official statistics the number of private farm
holdings, exceeded 50,000 by December 1992. In light of the present status of the financial sector, i.e.,
given the uncertainties surrounding the future of the public banks (the former Bank of Latvia (BOL)
branches) and the fact that the private commercial banks are still in their initial stages of development,
institutional credit to support the land reform process and to provide start-up capital for private farmers
is practically non-existent. Because of the urgent need to provide the supporting services for the ongoing
privatization of agricultural production and the absence of any alternative financial institution, agreement
has been reached with Goverment to establish the Agricultural Finance Company (AFC), which could
be organized in a relatively short time and could become operational by January 1994. It should be noted
that the AFC should be considered as a temporary solution to a pressing problem. It is envisaged that
after completion of the restrcturing and strengthening of the commercial banking system, AFC's lending
activities, its outstanding loan portfolio, as well as its trained specialized staff, would be taken over by
one or more commercial bank.
2.           The pr; ipal and short-term objective of the AFC is to assist the beneficiaries of the
ongoing reform and ; .vatization program, through short, medium and long-term credits for on-farm
development and working capital. This would be coupled with intensive technical assistance, to be
provided by the La - '*n Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS), in an effort to increase the efficiency of
production and create viable prvate owner-operated farming enterprses.
3.           The proposed APC organizational set-up, staffing, operating procedures, and sources of
financing, are briefly outlined in the following paragraphs. However, it should be noted that these are
not intended to establish hard and fast rules for any of the subjects addressed and AFC management
would have to be very alert in carefully monitoring its operations, testing the systems and procedures,
and introducing changes considered necessary. The guiding principle should be that AFC would be
organized and operate as a lean, efficiently functioning, cost-effective and financially viable and
sustainable institution.
4.           Lea Status. The AFC would be registered as a joint stock company, with Government,
initially being the sole shareholder. It is, however, the intention of Government to give farmers and
farmers' organizations, and some private commercial banks interested in cooperation or co-financing
arrangements with the AFC, the opporunity to purchase AFC shares in order to take part in an institution
created to serve the farming community. Detailed programs for promoting the sale of AFC shares to the
public, and the terms and condidons of such offer of shares would be developed



- 40 -
ANNEX A
Page 2 of 11
by AFC management in consultation with the Bank. The AFC would not be a licensed bank (and would
not accept deposits from the public or from its borrowers) and would operate and be registered and
licensed by the BOL as a non-bank financial institution and be subject to supervision of the Central Bank,
as applicable to non-bank financial institutions. However, the AFC would observe the rules and
regulations applicable to banks with regard to capital adequacy ratios, exposure limits, classification of
loan portfolio and loan provisioning.
5.           Share-Caital. The AFC's initial registered share capital would be US$ 4 to 5 million
equivalent. Government would subscribe to shares equivalent to about US$ 2.5 million and pay for the
shares using, in part, the proceeds of the World Bank loan and about US$ 1 million currently invested
in AGROINVEST's loan portfolio (see para. 26).
6.           Board of Directors. The AFC would have an "active" Board, comprising five to seven
members. The Board would convene at least once a month and would delegate some of its authority and
responsibilities to commtees, including a Loan Committee of three members, which would meet more
fiequenty to ensure the fast and efficient operation of lending activities. The first members of the Board
would be appointed by Government and would include representatives of the private sector, from both
armers' organizations and leading commercial banks. Subsequently, directors would be elected by the
shareholders, according to procedures established in the statutes of the company. The expatriate consul-
tants assisting in setting up of the AFC would prepare and conduct induction seminars for board members
to advise them about the responsibilities of elected directors and to make them familiar with the AFCs
opeating procedures, loan evaluation, financial planning, budgeting, western accounting and auditing
standards, and other related operational matters.
Qganizatiod Strucxre.
7.           AFC Management. The AFC head office would be located in Riga, and be staffed
initially by 18 to 20 employees (including all management positions). The nmber of head office staff
could increase gradually to about 25, cording to work requirements. Organization of the head office
(see Attachment 1) would be as follows:
(a)          General Manager
(b)          Financial Controller - responsible for finance, accounting, electronic data
processing and information systems;
(c)          Manager - Credit Operations;
(d)          Manager - Internal Operations;
8.           Satelite Offices, The AFC would establish satellite offices in most regions/districts of
the country; each such office would be staffed initially by a team of two "mobile development/credit
officers" (MCO).  Each team would consist of one senior and one junior MCO. At least the senior
MCO is expected to be a university graduate - preferably in agricultural economics and



- 41 -
ANNEX A
Page 3 of 11
have had practical experience in managing farming activities. Experienced agricultural technicians would
also be considered for the positions of junior MCO. The senior MCO is expected to spend at least 60%
of his time in the field, maintaining contact with potential and actual borrowers, identifying investment
opportunities, evaluating loan applications, and monitoring borrowers' activities, etc. It is projected that,
in the first year, each team would deal with at least 50 borrowers and that this number would gradually
grow to about 200 per team. Once the numbers of borrowers of a satellite office exceeds 200, an
additional senior MCO would be posted to that office, raising the number of staff to three, with the junior
MCO assisting two senior MCOs. The Manager - Credit Operations (see para 7 above) would have one
Assistant (Chief Credit Officer) and three Senior Credit Officers (SCO), each to be in charge of a certain
region (comprising a number of districts) and supervising, guiding and training up to five teams of
MCOs. With the increase in the number of satellite offices, the number of SCOs would grow
accordingly.
9.           Each satellite office would be provided with a rented one-room office, to be located,
preferably, on the premises of a local bank or, alternatively, in the office of the local agricultural
advisory (extension) service, or even in the home of the MCO. Each satellite office would be equipped
with one (or two in case of 2 senior MCOs) four-wheel drive vehicle, one PC and a telephone/ fax.
10.          The establishment of 10 satellite offices is planned in the first year and these should be
operational by January 1994. Information regarding the number of potential clients in each district has
already been collected and the tentative locations for the first group of satellite offices has been
determined. Ultimately, by the end of year three, about 30 to 35 satellite offices would be in operation.
The AFC would closely monitor the performance of each satellite office to ensure financial viability and
that the number of clients and volume of lending justifies maintining a satellite office.
11.          Salary Structre. In order to attract highly qualified staff, the AFC would establish a
salary structure which would be competitive with those of financial and other similar institutions.
Remuneration of staff would consist of basic salary and bonus schemes based on measurable performance
indicators which would include, among others, the number of clients served, quality of loans and
repayment performance of borrowers. Total basic salaries would amount to about 70 percent of total staff
remuneration, leaving 30 percent for distribution of premiums to staff based on annual performance
review and evaluation.
12.          Lending Operations. The AFC would provide medium/long term investment credit for
on-farm development and short-term/seasonal working capital loans, to private farmers - beneficiaries of
the current land reform and privadzation. investment lending would be diversified and include
construction of farm buildings, purchase/breeding of livestock, land improvements, agricultural
machinery and equipment, etc. and any other investments assessed to be economically and financially
viable and within the capacity of the beneficiary to undertake and manage. The AFC would not fimance
agro-industries, processing, agri-businesses and services. Loan evaluations would have to demonstrate
economic and financial viability of the investments to be financed and satisfactory debt service coverage
ratios, and include an agreed farm/production plan (see para 14). Loan repayment periods would be
based on the projected cashflow and borrowers' repayment capacity, but not exceed the useful life of the
investment financed. Until the economic situation stabilizes and inflation is brought under control, loans
would be



-42 -
ANNEX A
Page 4 of 11
denominated in either German marks or US dollars and bear interest at market rates plus an adequate
spread for the AFC. It is estimated that lending nterest rates would, initially, range around 12 to 13
percent.
13.          Eligible Borrowers. As mentioned above, borrowers would include private farmers now
in the process of establishing a farming enterprise. Priority would be given to already existing or
potential full-drne farmers who have been allocated land or whose rights to land have been restituted but,
for lack of start-up capital, have not yet started production or are in the initial phase of establish-
ment/development of their farming enterprises. The AFC would lend not only to irdividual farmers but
also encourage the formation of farmers' groups for economic activities of conmnon interest (for example
thejoint purchase of agricultural machinery), including partnerships, associations and farning enterprises
legally registered as companies. Part-time farmers who produce marketable surplus would also be eligible
to borrow from the APC; however, lending to this categ ,ry snould start at a later date and possibly be
done through group lending to reduce costs and provide isk sharing arrangements in the form of mutual
guarantees by group members.
14.          Cooperation with LaIan Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS). MCOs would perform
their functions and responsibilities in close coordination and cooperation with the local agricultural
advisory staff, who would participate ii the preparation of annual farm plans and be continuously
involved in providing technical assistance and guidance to borrowing farmers in farm planning and
management, optimal land use, production technology, marketing and prices, etc. An agreement would
be drawn up between the AFC and LAAS which would clearly define and delineate the respective
functions of MCOs and extension agents, to ensure cooperation and coordination, and prevent duplication
and overlapping. Borrowers' compliance with agreed farm plans and guidance from extension agents
would be a condition for borrowing from the APC and would be stipulated in loan agreements.
15.   Collateral for Loans. Repayment capacity of a borrower should be determined by the appraisal
of the productive capacity of his holdings and this should constitute the principal security for AFC
lending. However, borrowing from the AFC would not be a one-time operation and the AFC should
endeavor to create permanent ("floating") securities, in order to save time, cost, registration, etc.. These
would include a mortgage on the farnholding and pledges (liens) on moveable assets. Until legal
registration of mortgages is possible, borrowers should be required to give the AFC an irrevocable power
of attorney authorizing the AFC to register and receive title, on behalf of the borrower, to his/her land
and, simultaneously register a first mortgage in favor of the AFC to secure current and future debts. In
addition, borrowers should be required to open an account in a commercial bank and instruct the bank
to transfer to the AFC, according to payment notices issued by the AFC and on maturity dates, the
installments of principal and interest fallen due for repayment.
16.          Loan Approval and Onerating Procedures. Initial appraisal of loan application would be
done by MCOs and submitted to the head office for review and approval. Approval limits would be
established for a head office loan committee, consisting of the General Manager or, in his absence, the
Financial Controller, the Manager for Lending Operations and the SCO responsible for the area. Loans
exceeding the above limit would be submitted to the Board loan comnmittee for consideration.



- 43 -
ANNEX A
Page 5 of 11
17.          During the initial phase of operations, loan approval authority would not be delegated and
would be concentrated in the head office. During this phase the head office loan comniittee would
convene at least once weeldy (or more often, if required, to speed up the loan approval process). The
documents required by the loan committee (as stipulated in AFC lending guidelines) would be submitted
by the respective teams of MCOs to the SCO in charge of the area (or group of MCOs), accompanied
by the team's joint recommendation. During this initial phase, tiie head office loan committee would
include all the SCOs. Joint review and discussion of all loan applications would be part of the on-the-job
training and would contribute to ensuring coordination and uniformity in a4plication of lending procedures
and decision-making.
18.          With the objective of decentralizing decision-making, it is envisaged that in the later
phase, after about 15 to 18 months of the AFC operations, to the extent possible, the SCOs would move
from the head office to their respective areas of responsibility and have their offices in one of the satellite
offices. At that time, "area" loan committees would be established, each comprising the SCO and at least
two MCOs of the area, and these committees would be accorded approval authority within specified limits
and for specified purposes of financing.
19.          MCOs would be authorized to reject, for valid reasons, loan applications without referring
them to their supervisors (SCO) or a higher level of authority. However, MCOs would be instructed to
maintain brief records of all rejected applications, indicating also the reason for rejection. These records
would be inspected periodically by SCOs and their supervisors.
20.          Loan agreements would be signed in the satellite office, or, even in the field, during the
visit of the MCO. Disbursement instructions would be given by the MCO and disbursements would
generally be made through transfers to the account of the borrower in a commercial bank. All loan
accounts would be kept in the head office; auxiliary records would be maintained in the satellite offices,
which would be provided with monthly printouts (or diskettes) showing the status of their portfolio.
Satellite offices however, would maintain detailed information on each borrower, using the PCs at their
disposal. The initial source for this information would be the loan application which would include a
detailed list of all assets, details on loan use, etc. and this infonnation would be updated periodically.
21.          Accounts and Audit. AFC accounts would be maintained in accordance with western
accounting practices and standards, applying the new chart of accounts for commercial banks prescribed
by the Central Bank (BOL), and financial statements would be audited by independent auditors. As
mentioned above, the AFC would also follow BOL instructions regarding loan classification and
provisioning.
22.          Cost of Administration and Sustainability. Preliminary estimates and projections of
administrative costs, based on the organization structure described above, 10 satellite offices, an average
loan portfolio per satellite office equivalent to US$ 1.5 million with about 200 borrowers and a staff of
two, would be less than 3 percent of the total average annual portfolio. With the increase in the number
of offices and the volume of lending, costs should gradually decrease (costs calculations include salaries,



- 44 -
ANNEX A
Page 6 of 11
rents and all operating expenditures and depreciation vehicles and office equipment, but do not include
the cost of expatriate technical assistance). A spread averaging 5 percent above the cost of funds to be
earned during the initial phase of operations, and decreasing subsequently to about 4 percent should be
sufficient for achieving positive financial results. However, given the specific nature of prospective
borrowers, consisting of newly settled peasant farmers who lack capital, farm management experience,
credit history, guarantees and collateral customarily required by banks, it is difficult to assess the amount
of provisions required for doubtful debts and the likely loan losses which could affect the AFC's income
and financial viability. Operating procedures would be tailored to deal with the type of borrowers
described above and all efforts would be made to ensure sound lending and satisfactory loan repayment.
Various donor funds have beer. secured to cover the cost of organization prior to start-up as well as the
expatriate technical assistance for the setting up and the initial phases of AFC operation.
23.          Expatriate Technical Assistance. Expatriate advisers, for a total period of about 36 man-
months (not continuousiy) would be required to assist AFC management in the setting up of the AFC and
during the first two years of operation. The success of the AFC hinges on the xjuality and continuity of
the technical assistance. An agreement has been reached with a Dutch Consulting company to provide
the necessary technical assistance. The first consultant team visited Latvia in May 1993, agreed with
Government and the Bank on a detailed program of activities to be carried out during the comning months
and leading to the start-up of operations by January 1994.
24.          One adviser, or team of advisers, specialized in organization and management of lending
operations, including computerization and selection of appropriate software, would assist in establishing
all operating systems and procedures for loan processing, disbursements, collection, computerized
budgeting, accounting and information systems, including fine-tuning the systems during the initial period
of operation and training of staff.
25.          The second team, comprising agricultural credit specialists with extensive experience in
lending and supervised credit operations to peasant farmers, would assist in establishing loan evaluation
and loan servicing procedures, including formats for loan applications, farm plans, feasibility studies and
the design of a computerized informadon system on borrowers. This team would also prepare and
conduct training courses for MCOs and SCOs, supervise their activities and performance after inception
of operations, and actively participate in loan appraisal (on-the-job training) and quality control of loan
evaluations prior to approval. Both teams mentioned above, would jointly prepare a brief and concise
lending operations and procedures manual, conduct training seminars for members of the Board, and
participate in the selection of candidates for the key management and SCO and MCO positions.
26.          AGROII4VEST. At the inception of its operations, the AFC would take over the
management of Agroinvest's loan portfolio (amounting to about US$ 1 million equivalent, and described
in para. 3.7 of the SAR). According to a resolution of the Council of Ministers, Agroinvest would be
liquidated after its loan portfolio has been transferred to the AFC. In managing the portfolio the AFC
would act as an agent and would not assume any lending risks. For its services, including loan
accounting,



- 45 -
ANNEX A
Page 7 of 11
collection, monitoring borrowers' performance and financial position, administering collateral for loans
and maintaining information on borrowers, the AFC would receive a monthly management fee to be
agreed upon by the AFC and Government (estimated at 0.2 percent per month calculated on the
outstanding monthly balances of principal). Collected principal and interest (less the management fee)
would be used by Government to pay for its shares in the AFC.
Schedule of AFC Lending Operations Start-Up
27.          The current schedule for the AFC start-up of lending operations to private sector farmers
is outlined below. Lending is sent to start in January 1994. The program lists the principal activities
and is not exhaustive as the details for each of the activities would have to be established by the team of
consultants, the PMU, and the key AFC management staff after it has taken up its positions.

Agricultural Development Project
The Investment Bank of Latvia
Badkgromd
1.           The Investment Bank of Latvia (IBL) was first incorporated in April 1992 as part of the
Baltic Investment Program developed by the Nordic Ministers of Finance in order to assist the Baltic
countries in their transition to a market economy. As the bank's role in providing medium and long-term
foreign and domestic credits to small and medium sized businesses required special legal provisions not
found in existing legislation, a special law creating the IBL was adopted by the Latvian Parliament on
March 30, t993.
2.           The first year of the bank's existence has been a period of organizational development,
corporate planning, recruitment and training of staff, and preparation of its operating systems and
procedures. In these efforts IBL has been assisted by a wide array of foreign expertise including the
Nordic Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Den Norska
Bank, the Kreditanstalt flr Wiederaufbau of Germany, the Soros Foundation, and others. Currently, the
bank's total staff numrbers about 20, many of whom have been educated in universities in the U.S. and
Canada. An international accounting firm has recently been hired to review and analyze IBL's internal
management structure and information systems and to recommend improvements deemed necessary.
3.           The bank's share capital is denominated in German Marks. Currently, its statutory capital
of DM 6,475,000 has been subscribed by Government of Latvia and a fiuther capital injection of DM
6,750,000 has already been approved by the Government. Negotiations are continuing with EBRD
regarding an equity contribution in IBL equivalent to about US$ 3.5 million, which would raise the
statutory capital to about US$ 10.0 mnillion equivalent, with EBRD holding about 35 percent of the share
capital.
4.           The IBL is also exploring other sources of financing. The EBRD and the Nordic
Investnent Bank have allocated ECU 30 million for technical assistance, equity contributions and lines
of credit for the three Baltic Investment Banks. Close cooperation and possible funding has also been
discussed with the Swedish Export Credit Institutions and similar negotiations with the Danish counterpart
are contemplated for the near future.

5.           According to the IBL's business plan, its principal objectives are:
mobilizing and attracting medium- and long-term foreign and local capital from
both external and domestic sources; particular attention will be devoted to
attracting foreign investment;
channelling these resources to economically viable and financially profitable
investment projects in the Latvian private sector, with an emphasis on small and
medium sized enterprises, and in companies undergoing privatization;
engaging in co-financing activities with other financial institutions prepared to
support productive investments in Latvia; and,
providing financial advisory services on a fee basis, mainly to prospective
investors, but also to financial institutions, government donor agencies, and to
other parties engaged in private sector development activities.
Lendlng Prioridtes
6.           In line with the above objectives, the IBL would initially concentrate on those sectors
generally recognized as the most promising in this period of economic transition. These include:
wood processing (furniture, building materials but not pulp and paper);
tourism and services (hotels, restaurants, etc.);
food and agricultural industries;
computer software;
textiles and shoe manufacturing; and
transportation and related services.
7.           In order to further reduce the risk involved in Latvian investment projects, certain criteria
would be considered when weighing the viability of projects even in the most promising sectors. Priority
would be given to m    in projects if:
there exist reasonable marketing arrangements to purchase the product in
convertible currency (whether domestically or abroad);
production utilizes local raw materials;
the enterprise is already operating and products are being exported; and
the project does not involve serious foreign exchange risks.

first quarter of 1993. Actual loan disburseme  started in mid-1993 with the first loan of US$ 220,000
for an investment project in a wood processing enterprise. In July 1993, twelve other investmenm projects
were under active consideration by IBL management.

Agricultural Development Project
A,rno and Forest Industries Subprojects
1.           The industrial component of the Project would include a wide variety of subprojects in
agro-processing and forest industries, many of which have been pre-appraised by technical assistance
teams from Sweden and Finland or by directly by the LIB, the agency through which the industrial
lending would be channelled. Total r tential lending for projects already appraised is just over US$10
million. A list of the preappraised projects is included at the end of this annex and a general description
of the project types follows below.
Mllig of Grain and Bakenes
2.           There are 6 subprojects in this category. Three of these would mill rye and wheat on a
small scale for a local market, two are bakeries serving the local market and surrounding area, and one
would be a combined mill and bakery. The milling units would produce about 1500 tons per year each,
and the bakeries about 500 to 700 kg/day of various types of bread.
3.           The investors are typically small entrepreneurs, normally a family, which already have
a shop and want to expand their activities. Investment levels range from US$30,000 to 50,000. These
small plants would be operated by the family owners and would provide good quality bread to the nearby
areas. Until now, these communities are served by one of five large state-owned bakeries and by the tine
bread reaches the consumer it is no longer fresh.
4.           Total employment in this category would be about 50 persons. Although the job creation
is low, these new units would form a nucleus for further development, and are a good start for newly
emerging entrepreneurs.
Meat Procsing Plants
5.           There are ten units in this category, all of which would be established by farmers, many
of whom obtained land during the first attempts at privatization in 1989. Production is primarily in pigs,
and in some cases also cattle. Farmers are inclined to establish processing facilities because of low prices
and late payment for animals by existing state slaughter houses, even though the price of meat to
consumers is relatively high. The small processing plants would typically slaughter 10 to 15 pigs or 3
to 4 cattle per day, and process the meat into sausages and smoked meat. Retail sales would be in the
main cities, especially Riga, and for export to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Several of the investors
have good relations with the FSU and it is expected that a relatvely large part of the processed meat
would be exported to the East, either directly or through barter deals.

ANNEX D
Page 2 of 4
6.           All the investors have experience in slaughtering and processu..b, and would manage the
plants themselves. A typical plant would employ 12 persons. The average investment ranges from
US$100,000 to 200,000 which is mainly for slaughtering equipment and sausage and smoking units. The
average plant would produce about 400 tons/year of various products, selling for LAT960 to 1400/ton
of finished product.
7.           The main benefits from establishing small meat processing plants is that they would be
able to pay higher prices for animals because of lower overhead and administrative costs, and higher
utilization of the installed capacity than the existing large state-owned slaughter houses.
Mk Procing
8.           Investments in milk processing plants would be mainly to improve existing pre-processing
plants, which earlier collected and pre-processed milk by separating the cream and returning skim milk
to the farmers for pig and cattle feed. Several of these plants have now been taken over by previous
managers, workers and farmers, and would employ about 50 to 80 persons in a typical plant. The plants
need equipment to allow packaging of milk for the consumer market. The market demand and profit
margins are high for pasteurized liquid milk. The dairies would produce some 10,000 liters/day of milk
for sale in nearby cities and Riga.
Modified Starch Procig
9.           A large Swedish company would enter into a joint venture as a minor partner (35%) with
an existing starch factory owned by the manag.-nent and several other private shareholders, and would
provide know-how and technical assistance. The factory currently processes about 10,000 tons/year of
potatoes supplied by some I500 farmers and collective farms, into 1500 tons/year of starch, of which
80% is exported. Investment in equipment is planned to produce modified starch for food products and
for the paper industry. Modified starch comnands a price of about US$600/ton compared with normal
starch at about US$280/ton. The subproject would produce about 1000 tons/year of modified starch.
The expected markets would be the Baltic Republics and other FSU countries. The Latvian market alone
is estimated at 300 to 500 tons/year.
Frit Juice Procing
10.          The existing factory of Agro-Skibe in the Dobele district owns a relatively large apple
orchard and has a new press with which it produces apple juice in 10 liter glass containers. However,
the market is disappearing due to competition from imports which provide juice in one liter paper
containers preferred by the consumers. It is therefore proposed to provide equipment for sterilization,
separation, and aseptic packaging of apple juice in one liter laminated paper containers. The enterprise
would then be able to produce juice of a quality equal to imports, and plans to export about 50% of its
output to Russia, particularly St. Petersburg where it has good connections with distributors. During the



- 62 -
ANNEX D
Page 3 of 4
off season, the factory would use its facilities to re-constitute orange juice concentrate. Total production
of all juices would be about 2 million liters/year.
11.          The enterprise is managed by several of its shareholders which bought the factory from
an earlier collective farm.
Vegetable Freezing
12.          Latvia has a good production of blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, and blackberries,
much of which is grown wild and uses a large labor force to harvest. Installation of freezing facilities
in an existing plant for these berries as well as for vegetables is proposed. Most of the output would be
exported to Western Europe where marketing contacts have already been established. The new freezing
plant would process some 500 to 700 tons/year of berries and vegetables, focusing or labor intensive
products. The existing enterprise is owned by former employees who have a long tradition of canning
various types of vegetables.
Forest Industries
13.          A wide range of investments are proposed in the forest industries subsector, including
three sawniill developments, and one subproject each to produce veneer, particleboard, furniture, joinery,
and edge-glued boards. Investments range from US$200,000 to over US$7 million. The larger projects
are for plants already under construction, for which much of the equipment and civil works has been
completed and paid for, but which need additional investment in equipment to make them operational.
The emphasis on all subprojects is quality improvement in order to add value and improve export
potential.
14.          Three of the subprojects would be undertaken in formerly state-owned enterprises which
are now being operated as private companies formed by a combination of former employees, local private
interests, and foreign joint venture partners. Most of the subprojects have sales connections with Western
European and Scandinavian companies of international stature in forest industries.
