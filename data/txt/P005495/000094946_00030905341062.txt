IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan Nos. 3365-MOR through 3373-MOR
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Kingdom of Morocco's
Financial Sector Development Project.  This project consisted of nine loans: a structural
adjustment loan to the Kingdom of Morocco and eight investment loans to seven commercial
banks and one state-owned development bank. The structural adjustment component (Loan No.
3365-MOR) in the amount of US$125 million equivalent was approved on June 25, 1991 and
made effective on November 14, 1991. The investment component (Loan Nos. 3366-MOR to
3373-MOR) in the amount of US$110 million equivalent was approved on June 25, 1991 and
made effective April 10, 1992 through May 7, 1992, as the individual borrowers fulfilled their
obligations. The adjustment loan was closed on June 30, 1993, six months after the original
closing date of December 31, 1992. The first tranche, released upon effectiveness, was disbursed
by January 6, 1992; the second tranche was released on June 17, 1993, and the loan was fully
disbursed by July 1, 1993. Seven of the eight loans in the investment component of the project
were closed on December 31, 1997, as planned. Loan No. 3366-MOR to Banque Nationale pour
le Developpement Economique was closed on December 31, 1998, one year after the original
closing date. Disbursements for the investment component totaled US$76.7 million equivalent,
and the remaining US$33.3 million was cancelled.
The ICR was prepared by Stephanie Gober and Leila El Hafi and reviewed by Lorenzo
Savorelli of the Private Sector Development and Finance Department of the Middle East and
North Africa Region. Some borrowers provided completion reports that are included as
appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission,
November 30 through December 11, 1998. It is based on materials in the project file. The
borrowers contributed to the ICR by commenting on the text and, in some cases, by submitting
their own evaluation reports.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan Nos. 3365-MOR through 3373-MOR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Financial Sector Development Project (FSDP, or "the project") was the follow-up to
two previous World Bank lines of credit, the Industrial Export Finance Project (IEFP) and the
Industrial Finance Project (IFP). The new project was a hybrid of eight lines of credit to
Moroccan banks and an adjustment loan targeted at financial sector reforms. The adjustment
component built on reforms which were begun by the Moroccan government in the 1980s and
which have continued under current World Bank operations.
Project objectives
The FSDP was designed to support financial sector reforms while simultaneously
providing medium- and long-term financing for the private sector. The project's structural
adjustment component was to promote indirect instruments of monetary management, the
development of financial markets, the liberalization of most interest rates and the elimination of
directed credit policies, and the strengthening of bank supervision and regulations. The project's
investment component was to encourage the broad participation of Moroccan financial
institutions operating on a sound commercial basis by making available a package of lines of
credit to be on-lent to a large and diversified base of private firms.
In total there were nine loans totaling US$235 million equivalent. The adjustment
component was a loan to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of US$125 million equivalent.
The investment component comprised eight loans, guaranteed by the Kingdom of Morocco,
totaling US$110 million equivalent.  The borrowers were:  Banque Nationale pour le
Developpement Economique (BNDE, a state-owned development bank), Banque Marocaine du
Commerce Exterieur (BMCE), Banque Commerciale du Maroc (BCM), Wafabank, Banque
Marocaine pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (BMCI), Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), Societe
Generale Marocaine de Banques (SGMB), and Credit du Maroc (CM).
The objectives of the project were directly related to the Bank's country assistance strategy
for Morocco, which included completing the remaining phases of macroeconomic reforrns and
developing the private sector. Tranche releases were tied not only to the completion of specific
financial sector reforms, but also to continued satisfactory overall macroeconomic performance.
The investment component was expected to cover about 18% of the projected demand for
industrial investment credit during the commitment period of the Bank loans.

Implementation Experience and Results
The release of the adjustment loan tranches was predicated on well-defined criteria. The
first tranche of $75 million was released at effectiveness. The second tranche for US$50 million
was originally expected to be released in early 1992, dependant on (a) fulfillment of six
conditions specified in the Loan Agreement, (b) satisfactory progress on the overall financial
sector reform program as set out in the policy matrix, and (c) continued satisfactory overall
macroeconomic performance. The second tranche was actually disbursed in June 1993, when
the majority of the conditions had been met. It was noted that although not all of the
macroeconomic indicators were on target, the shortfalls could be attributed to exogenous factors
rather than to policy slippages.  The macroeconomic framework was therefore deemed
satisfactory for the tranche release.
The objectives of the investment component were broadly defined as encouraging the
participation of Moroccan financial institutions which operate on a sound, commercial basis, and
supporting investment financing by a large and diversified base of private firms. With the
exception of BNDE, the participating Moroccan financial institutions generally achieved the
objective of operating on a sound commercial basis. BNDE's audit reports have been qualified
due to non-compliance with regulatory standards (which has since been corrected) and non-
consolidation of accounts. BNDE did not complete the technical assistance program for which
US$200,000 of its loan had been designated.
It is difficult to assess the overall impact of the credit lines on the Moroccan economy.
Only 70O of the US$110 million investment component was used. Sub-loans under the US$2
million free limit were expected to represent about two-thirds of the World Bank funds. In the
end, more than 80% of the disbursed amount was for sub-loans less than US$2 million, with the
average sub-loan amount estimated to be about US$780,000. About 80% of the Bank loans were
expected to finance industrial investment; this was very close to the actual result of
approximately 81% of sub-loans in industrial sectors. A total of 98 projects were funded under
the FSDP, and the overall portfolio was diversified, reaching eight different economic sectors.
With the cancellation of 30% of the credit lines, the investment component seems to have only
partially achieved the objective of reaching a large and diversified base of private firms.
When the FSDP became effective, banks participating in the investment component were
facing a shortage of medium- and long-term resources. Since 1994-95, the Moroccan banking
system has had surplus liquidity, with deposits significantly exceeding loans. Moreover, the
gradual suppression of the Plancher d'Effets Publics (PEP--mandatory placements in Treasury
bonds) during the life of the project made more funding resources available for medium- and
long-term lending. Other donors also provided funds to Moroccan banks, and some of these
funds were denominated in local currency, reducing the cost of funds by eliminating foreign
exchange risks. In addition, implicit costs such as administrative follow-up and delays caused by
World Bank approval procedures made the credit lines less attractive than other sources of funds.
Because less expensive resources were readily available in the Moroccan market, it was
financially rational for most of the participating banks to cancel the undisbursed amounts of their
World Bank credit lines. For banks such as BNDE who maintained their loans as an additional
source of potential liquidity, the expectation that they would eventually use the funds led to



- v -
disbursement delays. The original disbursement estimates and project design are therefore
judged to have been realistic, given the market conditions at the time of appraisal.
The reforms undertaken under the project's adjustment component are likely to be
sustainable. The financial sector reforms achieved under the FSDP provided a solid base for
follow-on projects. The sustainability of the investment component is uncertain. Although the
borrowers have indicated that the World Bank lines of credit provided long-term resources at a
time when they were needed and that the system now has sufficient liquidity, they did not
provide numeric data to show the actual impact of the credit lines in the private sector. The
effect of the investment component and its potential sustainability are therefore unclear.
Overall Bank performance on this project is rated as satisfactory. The identification and
preparation of the project were satisfactory, as was appraisal. Bank supervision of the project is
rated as deficient, with 15 months passing between supervision missions on three different
occasions. More regular supervision might have allowed significant issues such as the slow
disbursements for some of the banks to be handled more proactively.
The performance of the Borrower on the adjustment loan is rated satisfactory. Both sets of
tranche release conditions were achieved with only minor delays, and macroeconomic policies
upheld the framework set at project appraisal. The Guarantor for the investment component
failed to comply with the covenant of the Guarantee Agreements for the Foreign Exchange Risk
Coverage Scheme: in the case of BNDE, the Guarantor accumulated substantial arrears on
foreign exchange losses, creating financial problems for BNDE and affecting its utilization of the
credit line. The overall performance of the banks participating in the investment component was
satisfactory. The lines of credit were on-lent to a diversified group of private firms, and the
banks generally operated on a sound commercial basis. BNDE's compliance with covenants is
rated as deficient, due to its non-completion of the technical assistance program and to continued
deficiencies in its audit reports.
The outcome of the adjustment component is satisfactory. The adjustment loan achieved its
major reform objectives, paving the way for future financial reforms under other Bank projects.
The outcome of the investment component is satisfactory. The funds were used to finance a
variety of private investment projects, and when market conditions changed and the funds were
no longer needed, most of the banks cancelled their credit lines in a timely manner.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
Using successive projects to build sectoral reforms can be an effective development
strategy. The investment component of the FSDP was a continuation of the IEFP and the IFP,
and the adjustment component supported a series of financial sector reforms which have been
added to by successive operations such as the Financial Markets Development Loan and the
Contractual Savings Development Loan I. The cancellation of 30% of the investment loans was
due in part to the inflexibility of past Bank lending products to changing market conditions, and
also possibly to the lack of regular and proactive supervision when favorable conditions for
disbursement were existing. New LIBOR-based products should allow clients to use Bank funds
more effectively in a changing rate environment.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan Nos. 3365-MOR through 3373-MOR
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.  Statement/Evaluation Of Objectives
Project Objectives and Design
1.    The Financial Sector Development Project (FSDP, or "the project") was designed to
support financial sector reforms while simultaneously providing medium- and long-term
financing for the private sector. Its central objective was to increase the supply of long-term
capital to private entrepreneurs, while supporting financial sector reforms to encourage efficient
allocation of investment and broader participation by the various segments of the private sector.
Specifically, the project's structural adjustment component was to promote: (i) the transition
towards indirect instruments of monetary management; (ii) the development of financial markets,
in particular for Government securities; (iii) the liberalization of most interest rates and the
elimination of directed credit policies; and (iv) the strengthening of bank supervision and
regulations. The objective of the project's investment component was to encourage the broad
participation of Moroccan financial institutions operating on a sound commercial basis by
making available to them a package of lines of credit to be on-lent to a large and diversified base
of private firms.
2.    The project consisted of two components: a financial sector adjustment component and
an investment component. In total there were nine loans totaling US$235 million equivalent.
The adjustment component was a loan to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of US$125
million equivalent. As of January 1, 1998, US$117.89 million equivalent of this loan was
converted to a single currency pool loan in US$ (Loan No. 3365S-MOR), while US$7.11 million
equivalent remains a currency pool loan (Loan No. 33650-MOR). The investment component
comprised eight loans, guaranteed by the Kingdom of Morocco, totaling US$110 million
equivalent. The borrowers were: Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique
(BNDE, a state-owned development bank), Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE),
Banque Commerciale du Maroc (BCM), Wafabank, Banque Marocaine pour le Commerce et
l'Industrie (BMCI), Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), Societe Generale Marocaine de Banques
(SGMB), and Credit du Maroc (CM). The amounts of these loans were as follows:

The loan to BNDE included a technical assistance component of US$200,000 for the preparation
of a program to insure the institution's long-tenn viability in a market-determined environment.
Table 4 shows the borrowers' performance in terms of loan disbursements.
Evaluation
3.    At the inception of the project, the Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS) for Morocco
was: i) to complete the remaining phases of macroeconomic adjustment reforms with steady and
high rates of growth, a sustainable budget deficit, and balance of payments viability; ii) to
develop the private sector and its role in the economy as the driving force; and iii) to strengthen
the social dimension of growth. The objectives of the FSDP were directly related to points i and
ii, above.
4.    In the mid-1980s, the Moroccan authorities undertook a program  of progressive
elimination of direct monetary controls, with a view to increasing the efficiency and
responsiveness of financial intermediation. By the end of that decade, improved macroeconomic
stability and the projected decline in the needs for domestic financing of the budget deficit
encouraged the authorities to move to a second phase of reforms. This second phase of
liberalization was supported by FSDP's adjustment component, with tranche releases tied not
only to the completion of specific financial sector reforms, but also upon continued satisfactory
overall macroeconomic performance (Table 5, Part II). Although the use of macroeconomic
indicators provided an important link between the FSDP and the CAS, the measurement of the
project's impact could have been improved by including some financial sector indicators in the
project design.
5.    The investment component followed two similar Bank projects, the 1987 Industrial
Export Finance Project (EEFP, Loan Nos. 28060-MOR to 28067-MOR) and the 1990 Industrial
Finance Project (IFP, Loan Nos. 31360-MOR to 31367-MOR). Both projects comprised eight
lines of credit to the same eight banks as the FSDP investment component. According to the
President's Report, this investment component was estimated to cover about 18% of the
projected demand for industrial investment credit during the commitment period of the Bank
loans. Such a significant contribution to support the private sector's role in the Moroccan
economy was a good fit with the CAS; however, the central objective of the investment
component was rather broadly defined ("to increase the supply of long-term capital to private
entrepreneurs"), making it difficult to evaluate the component's actual impact.

B.  Achievement of Objectives
Adjustment Component
6.    The release of the adjustment loan tranches was predicated on the achievement of well-
defined criteria. The first tranche of $75 million was released at effectiveness. The second
tranche for US$50 million was originally expected to be released in early 1992, dependant on (a)
achievement of the six conditions specified in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement, (b)
satisfactory progress in terms of the overall financial sector reform program as set out in the
policy matrix attached to the Government's Letter of Development Policy, and (c) continued
satisfactory overall macroeconomic performance. The second tranche was actually disbursed in
June 1993, when the original implementation plan had been substantially complied with in terms
of the transition toward indirect monetary control, the development of domestic financial
markets (in particular for government securities), the elimination of directed credit policies, and
the strengthening of the regulatory and supervision framework for the banking system. The
following specific measures were taken:
* credit ceilings were removed;
* the reserve requirement instrument was strengthened;
* the central bank's automatic preferential refinancing rate was reduced by limiting the
eligibility of small-scale enterprises for medium-term loans and export credit;
* the ratio of mandatory placements of sight deposits in Treasury bonds at below-market rates
was reduced;
* the ratio of mandatory placements of bank deposits in rediscountable medium- and long-term
housing loans was reduced;
* the treasury bill auction market was opened to insurance companies and enterprises;
* a legal framework for capital market operations was adopted;
* a new banking law was enacted;
* the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for banking operations was strengthened;
and
* capital adequacy standards were raised to international levels.
7.    The release of the second tranche was also predicated upon continued satisfactory
macroeconomic performance (see Table 5, Part II). In the President's Second Tranche Release
Memorandum, it was noted that although not all of the indicators were on target during 1991-92,
and some were expected to continue to fall short of target in 1993-94, the shortfalls could be
attributed to exogenous factors rather than to policy slippages. The primary exogenous factors
cited were the 1992 drought, which caused an agricultural downturn, and the economic
slowdown in Europe, Morocco's main export market. The macroeconomic framework was
therefore deemed satisfactory for the tranche release.
8.   In view of the compliance by the Moroccan government with the six specific conditions
for second tranche release and the Bank's satisfaction with the overall progress in carrying out
the financial sector reform program, the Bank approved the release of the second tranche of $50
million of the adjustment component of the FSDP. Measures that were included in the



- 4 -
Government's policy matrix but that were not part of the Loan Agreement were all completed
except for the following, which were delayed:
*  The elimination of the government guarantee on CIH's loan to the tourism sector was
delayed at the time because of the negative impact of the Gulf War on the sector. This
measure has not yet been completed;
*  The action plan to harmonize the fiscal treatment of financial instruments was initiated
in 1994 with the taxation of treasury bonds;
*  The harmonization of accounting procedures between banks and SFIs (BNDE, CIH, and
CNCA) was only effective in January 1993 for CIH and July 1993 for BNDE, instead of
June 1992;
*  The replacement of a priori administrative controls on CNCA by a posteriori control by
the Ministry of Finance was delayed; its control on CNCA has been made more flexible
over the last several years and should now disappear with the current changes in
CNCA's by-laws.
Investment Component
9.    The objectives of the investment component were broadly defined as follows: i) to
encourage the broad participation of Moroccan financial institutions which operate on a sound,
commercial basis, and ii) to support investment financing by a large and diversified base of
private firms. For the most part, the participating Moroccan financial institutions achieved the
objective of operating on a sound commercial basis. Supervision missions noted that the quality
of audit reports improved significantly over the life of the project. Furthermore, although the
cancellation of 30% of the credit lines (Table 4, Part II) limited the project's outreach to private
firms in Morocco, given that less expensive resources had become available, the decision of most
participating banks to cancel the undisbursed amounts of their World Bank lines was financially
rational.
10.   BNDE's decision to continue paying commitment fees on US$16.5 million (56% of its
loan) for almost two years, only to cancel that amount at loan closing, seems somewhat less
logical, although it did allow the bank to maintain a potential source of liquidity. After 1995-96
supervision missions, a letter was sent to BNDE management and the Moroccan authorities
requesting a substantial revision of BNDE audits to bring them into compliance with standards
for loan classifications, interest accrual on non-performing loans, and the treatment of equity
participation in other companies. By March 1997, BNDE had complied with prudential
regulations on loan classification and provisioning. However, BNDE's 1997 audit report was
still qualified due to the non-consolidation of its accounts with those of a majority-owned bank.
BNDE did hire an international consulting firm to assist it in a restructuring project, but the
US$200,000 technical assistance component of BNDE's loan was never used, and the specific
strategic study for which it was designated was never completed.
11.   The borrowers did not provide statistical information on the effect of the credit lines on
the Moroccan economy, and it is difficult to assess the impact of the investment component.
Only 70% of the US$110 million investment loans were used. The pace of disbursements varied
among the participating banks, and those banks which disbursed most quickly were able to use
their lines more fully. For example, only three banks (BMCE, BCM, and CM) had disbursed



- 5 -
more than 50% of their credit lines by the end of FY 1993, and in the end, they were also the
only banks to use more than 90% of their lines. The banks which disbursed more slowly at the
beginning of the project canceled larger portions of their loans.
12.   The maximum size of an individual sub-loan was limited to US$6 million, and the free
limit for sub-loan approvals was US$2 million. According to the FSDP President's Report, sub-
loans under the free limit were expected to represent about two-thirds of the World Bank funds.
In the end, more than 80% of the disbursed amount was for sub-loans less than US$2 million,
with the average sub-loan amount estimated to be about US$780 thousand.
13.   At the time of appraisal, about 80% of the Bank loans were expected to finance industrial
investrnent, and the rest for tourism and other projects. This estimate was very close to the
actual result: about 81% of sub-loans financed were estimated to be in various industrial sectors.
A total of 98 projects were funded under the FSDP, and the overall portfolio was diversified,
reaching about eight different economic sectors (Figures 1 and 2). It should be noted that in
several instances, more than one participating bank funded the same sub-project. For example,
Nestle Maroc received sub-loans totaling US$5.5 million from three participating banks,
Polymedic received sub-loans totaling US$4.6 million from 5 participating banks, and ICOZ
received sub-loans totaling US$2.4 million from 3 different banks. Although this type of loan
syndication presumably allowed the participating banks to diversify their credit risk, it also
reduced the number of final borrowers which received World Bank funds. With the cancellation
of 30% of the credit lines, the investment component seems to have only partially achieved the
objective of reaching a large and diversified base of private firms. It is difficult to evaluate the
actual impact of this component, however, due to the absence of defined development indicators
in the project and the scarcity of information received from the borrowers. By using defined
statistics such as sectoral growth in relation to sub-loans granted by sector, it might have been
possible to gain a better picture of the achievement of the investment component's objectives.

C.  Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.   When the FSDP became effective, banks participating in the investment component were
facing a shortage of medium- and long-term resources. Some banks were covering as much as
75% of their investment loans through short-term deposits and borrowings. At the time, banks
had to choose between following sound asset-liability management policies while losing
important customers, or defending their market share while taking on increased liquidity risk.
Hence, at the outset of the project, the participating banks were very interested in using the
World Bank lines of credit. Changes in the Moroccan financial market over the life of the
project caused this interest to wane, however. The World Bank funds were relatively expensive,
and the market developed excess liquidity, making cheaper resources available. This resulted in
the cancellation of about US$33.3 million equivalent, or 30% of the credit lines. According to
the participating banks, the following factors contributed to this significant cancellation:
Compression of Interest Margins: The banks' profit margins on the World Bank credit
lines declined due to the decrease in lending rates (Figure 3). In 1994, the Moroccan
government changed the calculation for the lending rate ceiling. In compliance with the first
tranche release conditions for the adjustment loan, the maximum lending rate had been set at
one and one-third times the weighted average rate on banks' six-and 12-month deposits for
the preceding six months. This ceiling was adjusted every semester and ensured a steady,
positive interest margin for banks. In 1994, the method for calculating the ceiling lending
rate was set at a fixed margin above the deposit rates. The banks perceived this new method
as having reduced interest margins.

1993       1994       1995       1996       1997
Availability of Cheaper Resources: Since 1994-95, the Moroccan banking system has had
surplus liquidity, with deposits significantly exceeding loans.  Moreover, the gradual
suppression of the Plancher d'Effets Publics (PEP--mandatory placements in Treasury bonds)
during the life of the project made more funding resources available for medium- and long-
term lending. Other donors such as the European Investment Bank and Proparco also
provided funds to Moroccan banks, notably for the financing of SME projects. Some of
these funds were denominated in local currency, reducing the cost of funds by eliminating
foreign exchange risk.
Between 1991 and 1994, the interest rates applied by participating banks to sub-loans on this
project were as high as 14% to 17%. The on-lending rates were based on the following
elements:
a) The cost of World Bank funds to the participating banks averaged 7.37% between 1991
and 1994 (Figure 4).
b) Participating banks pay the MoF a fee for the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage Scheme.
This fee is equal to the difference between a reference rate and the cost of World Bank
funds mentioned above. The reference rate is the weighted average of the six-and 12-
month deposit rates, plus 0.75%. By requiring banks to pay the difference between these
two rates, the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage Scheme theoretically made banks and
final borrowers indifferent to whether funds were domestically or externally borrowed.
When deposit rates were highest due to the liquidity shortage early in the life of the
project, the difference between the reference rate and the World Bank rate was more than
6%.
c) Participating banks pay the MoF a flat fee of 1% for on-lent amounts.

15.   These three elements added together reached a peak of about 14.5%, creating final on-
lending rates of close to 17% after participating banks added their profit margin. Early in the
project's life, these rates were roughly equivalent to prevailing market rates. The situation
changed in 1995, when the banking system became more liquid. As six-and 12-month deposit
rates fell, the cost of the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage Scheme decreased. Eventually,
however, deposit rates fell below the cost of World Bank funds, making domestic resources less
expensive than external financing. In addition, other costs such as the flat fee mentioned above
and implicit costs such as administrative follow-up and delays caused by World Bank approval
procedures, made the credit lines less attractive than other sources of funds.
16.   Because less expensive resources were readily available in the Moroccan market, it was
fimancially rational for most of the participating banks to cancel the undisbursed amounts of their
World Bank credit lines. For banks such as BNDE who maintained their loans as an additional
source of potential liquidity, the expectation that they would eventually use the funds led to
disbursement delays. During the first two years after the effectiveness of the investment
component, the actual pace of disbursements exceeded appraisal estimates; disbursements did
not begin to lag until FY 1995, when the market became more liquid. The original disbursement
estimates and project design are therefore judged to have been realistic, given the market
conditions at the time of appraisal.
17.   Because cheaper sources of funds are now available, many of the participating banks
have expressed an interest in prepaying their World Bank loans. To date, only Wafabank and
CM have prepaid. Several other banks have requested permission from the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) to prepay their loans, but the MoF has asked them to wait until exchange rates are more
favorable, to avoid too great a foreign exchange loss for the Treasury. Some participating banks
have also recently been deterred from prepayment due to the World Bank's prepayment
penalties.

D.  Project Sustainability
18.   The project's adjustment component is likely to be sustainable. The financial sector
reforms achieved under the FSDP provided a solid base for follow-on projects, the Financial
Markets Development Loan (FMDL, Loan Nos. 39280-MOR and 39281-MOR), and the
Contractual Savings Development Loan I (CSDL I, Loan Nos. 43400-MOR and 43401-MOR).
These projects aimed, respectively, at deepening the financial markets and improving long-term
savings mobilization. The sustainability of the investment component is uncertain. Although
borrowers have stated that the World Bank lines of credit provided long-term resources at a time
when they were needed and that the system now has sufficient liquidity, without statistical
information to support these statements, the actual impact of the credit lines in the private sector
and the potential sustainability of any such impact are unclear.
E.  Bank Performance
19.   Overall Bank performance on this project is rated as satisfactory. The identification and
preparation of the project were satisfactory, as was appraisal. The hybrid adjustment/investment
product was well matched to the objectives of the CAS for the financial sector, although
performance indicators for the investment component could have been better defined. In
retrospect, given that the large cancellation of the credit lines was due to the relative cost of the
World Bank funds, some of the Bank's new LIBOR-based products would have been well suited
to the FSDP; however, these products were not available during the preparation of this project.
20.   Bank supervision of the project is rated as deficient. Including the completion mission,
seven supervision missions were conducted during this project's six year life span. On three
occasions, there was a 15-month gap between supervision missions. With more regular
supervision, significant issues such as the slow disbursements for several banks, especially
BNDE, might have been handled more proactively. It is important to note, however, that the
Bank's December 1995 mission did uncover a significant project problem: the Government's
arrears in foreign exchange loss payments to BNDE. These arrears represented a default on a
covenant of the Guarantee agreement, and through the Bank's action, the problem was resolved.
F.  Borrower Performance
21.   The performance of the Kingdom of Morocco as Borrower on the adjustment loan is
rated as satisfactory. Both sets of tranche release conditions were substantially achieved with
only minor delays, and macroeconomic policies upheld the framework set at project appraisal. It
should be mentioned, however, that the Kingdom of Morocco, acting as Guarantor for the
investment component, failed to comply with the covenant of the Guarantee Agreement
stipulating that the Gurantor shall at all times maintain the Foreign Exchange Risk Coverage
Scheme in respect of the Loans. Under this Scheme, the participating banks paid a fee to the
MoF, allowing it to accumulate funds to reimburse the banks for any foreign exchange losses
incurred on World Bank lines of credit. In the case of BNDE, the MoF accumulated substantial
arrears on foreign exchange losses, creating financial problems for BNDE and affecting its
utilization of the credit line. The net arrears, related to several different credit lines for BNDE,



- 10-
amounted to $532 million. In 1996, thanks to the Bank's intervention, the MoF consolidated
these arrears in 7-year Treasury bonds with a negotiated annual yield of 7%.
22.   The overall performance of the banks participating in the investment component was
satisfactory. The lines of credit were on-lent to a diversified group of private firms, and the
banks generally operated on a sound commercial basis. A highly satisfactory rating is not given
since 30% of the credit lines were unused, although the banks' decision to cancel was financially
rational and demonstrated their ability to adapt to new market conditions to prevent the erosion
of profit margins. BNDE's compliance with loan covenants is rated as deficient, due to its non-
completion of the World Bank technical assistance program and to continued deficiencies in its
audit reports.
G. Assessment of Outcome
23.   The outcome of the adjustment component is rated as satisfactory. The adjustment loan
achieved its major reform objectives, paving the way for future financial sector reforms under
other Bank projects. A highly satisfactory rating is not given because some of the policy
measures that were enhancing the set of reforms were not completed or were delayed. The
outcome of the investment component is satisfactory. The funds were used to finance a variety
of private investment projects, and when market conditions changed and the funds were no
longer needed, most of the banks cancelled their credit lines in a timely manner. A highly
satisfactory rating is not given because, due to the lack of information received from borrowers,
the precise impact of the investment component on the Moroccan market can not be measured.
H.  Key Lessons Learned
24.   Using successive projects to build sectoral reforms is effective.  The investment
component of the FSDP was a continuation of the credit lines financed under the IEFP and the
IFP. At the inception of the FSDP, there was a shortage of long-term investment resources in
Morocco, the project's credit lines helped meet that need. As market conditions changed during
the life of the project, alternative resources became available, and the borrowers made financially
rational decisions. The adjustment component achieved a series of financial sector reforms
which has been added to by successive operations such as the FMDL and the CSDL I. A second
CSDL is currently being considered. This kind of long-term partnership between the Bank and a
client is a successful means of building long-term sectoral reform.
25.   The FSDP also demonstrates the potential importance of the Bank's new financial
products. The major reason for the cancellation of 30% of the investment loans was the high
cost of World Bank funds in relation to decreasing Moroccan interest rates. It was also possibly
due to the lack of regular and proactive supervision when favorable conditions for disbursement
were existing. The investment loans were the standard lending instrument at the project's
inception and were based on the Bank's own cost of funds, which tends to lag in a falling rate
environment. If the Bank's new LIBOR-based products had been available and were used in this
project, the Bank's funds might have remained competitive, allowing the participating banks to
use the funds fully.

Nous evoquerons d'abord le contexte macro-economique de l'exccution du
projet avant d'examiner la mise en zuvre des mesurcs corntcfnucs danis le programme.
A - Le contexte Macro-6cono   q
Los indicateurs macro-6conorniques du Maroc ont connu entre 1991 et 1996
des dvolutions asscz disparatcs.
TLc taux dec croissancc 6conomiquc a conniu une evolution en dents dc scic
durant la periode sous revue; celui-ci est pass6 en rnoycnnc de 1,4 % en 1991-92 i
4,7% en 1993-94 avant dc rcvenir a 2,8% en 1995-96.
Quant au deficit budgetaire, on rcl&vera unie d6t6rioration de celuii-ci cntrC
1992 et 1995, puisqu'il est passe de 2,2 % a 5,2 % du PT7B. Cc deficit a neanmoins
_t6 ramen6 a 2 % en 1996.
Concemant le taux d'invcstissement, il coinvient de noter que cclui a connu uln
certain fl6chissement depuis 1993. Mais, en moycnnc les taux realises durant la
pcriode sous revue ne s'ecartcnt pas trop des objectifs retenus dans Ic programm-ne.
S'ag6sizent de P'kxohutinn cle. 1-4 rc-li  evtArie1iire, on souli_-nera que son
comrportcmcnL  sLUiti pratiquement colnfoM-mo A Iobjectif rcLcnu. En effet, le ratio
dette/PIB estpass4 de 75,5 % en 1991- 92 L 63,2 % en 1995 - 96.

94 et 1995-96.
B - Mise en oeurva  des r6fornies
L'cx6cution dii programme s'est deroul6e dans de bonnes conditions. Ainsi, la

Les mesures de la 1 rc traniche ont ete toutes realisees, car leur mise eni oeuvre
conditionriaiL la pr6scntation et I'approbation du projet de d6veloppoment du secteur
financier par le conseil d'adminisLration de la Banquc N4onldialc.

ex6cut6es. En c frTt, ]cs mesures specifiques ont ete toutes mises en cxuvre. 11 s'agit

La reforme s'est traduiLc par une arn6lioration dc l'intcrrnCcliation bancaire et un
ronforcement de la solidit6 du systemc bancaire.

d'intdrtt, quasi- suppression des emplois obligatoires) a cntrain6 un renforcement
substantiel du r6le du systeme bancaire danis la collecte des d6p6ts et le financemnt ndc

annouelle durant la p6riodc 91-97 de 11,7 % portant leur part dans le PID a 51,3 %'
en moyenne contre 37,9 % durant la periode 1986-90.
Quant aux credits, ils ont augment6 en moyenne de 11 1 /I% durant la ptriode
1991-97. Lcur part dans le PIB est ainsi pass6e de 33,5 % durant Ia p6riode 1986-90 a

Les performances sectorielles des lignes BIRD
Le secteur textile datient 36%  des prtts a iec   a56  millions  de  DH  utiiise    hauteur de 98%.
Le nombre de sous-projets textile finances s'eleve A 52 unites dont la majorite implantes sur
Casablanca. Cette forte presence du textile s'explique par les performances realisees par le
secteur durant la periode 1980 A 1995.
En effet, les statistiques du secteur montrent bien son explosion entre 1980 et 1995. Pendant
cette periode, les exportations du secteur ont enregistre une forte croissance avec un effet
d'entrainement sur les effectifs employes et sur les investissements dans le secteur.
En revanche la crise declenchee en 1991 (guerre du Golf) a surtout affecte l'investissement
comme le montre le graphique des investissements dans le secteur (1980-1995)
1980      1985i        1990       1995
En 1996 le secteur employait 176.500 personnes pour 13 milliards de DH d exportations et
1.86 mil'liard d'investissement. les pays de l'Union Europeen absorbent 92% des exportations.
Le secteur de l'agroalimentaire a utilise 61 millions de DH representant 10% des utilisations
globales. Pourtant, les autorisations sont de 136 millions de DH, soit un taux d'utilisation de

RAPPOFRT D'EVALUATION SUR LA LIGNE BIRD III
*  Sous le contrble des eutorit6s mon6taires marocaines, la BMCI a obtenu des
lignes de financemerf aupres de la Banque Mondiale, destin6es & financer des
programmes d'investissement pr6sent6s par la Client%le de Is banque.
* Le montant de la ligne BIRD s'61&ve au d6part au USD 9 500 000 mais utilis6 &
USD 5 872 346,64 at dont i'6ch6ance final est le 15/07/2011.
* Sur les hult projels finances dan le cadre de la ligne BIRD l1l, un seul n'a pas ot6
concluant faute de stratgle et reste aL4ourd'hui tributaire des problAmps
financiers en atte7ndant un repreneur. Le bilan est ju24 donc positif.
* Le BIRD a pr6t6 A la 1lMCI a des taux d'int6rkts variables et en devises, alors que
ies prqjets finant6s 4ont & lnt6r6ts fixes et en MvlAD. De ce fait, lors des
rftemiants des lterbt. et remboursements en capital a la BIRD, to BMCI powrrkit
3tre p6nalis6e & cawse de la volatilit6 des taux d'int6r6ts et I ou la variation des
taux de change. Cepeandant, le Tr6sor marocain, conform6ment aux accorda on
viguour prend en charge le risque de change relatif & la ligne BIRD ill moyennant
Is versement d'un diff6rentiel d'int6r6t.
*  Malgr6 cette prise en charge par le Tr6sor du risque de change, la BMCI est
p6nalLs6e a cause de Iz d6faillance d'un client, puisQu'elle continue d servir non
soulement des Int6r6ts sur l'encours du client en question & la BIRD, mals austl
au Tr6sor marocain un Ciff6rentiel d'int&rbts chaque ann6e.
* D'une manibre g6n6ralo, la ligne BIRD III comme toutes les eutres lignes BIRD
font preuve de lourdour. et de lenteur dans les proc6dure du fait de la multiplicit-
des Intervenants (BRD, Banque Interm6dialre, Tr6sor du pays emprunteur). En
outre, il complicit* du $ystbme de prbt mis en place par la BIRD ne nous permet
pas de comprendre les iI6ments de la facture de palement semestriel foumle par
la Banque Mondialt et par i& cerner nos remboursements voire les prevoir.
* En guise de conclusion, les lignes BIRD reste tout de mbme coQteuses pour la
Banque, sachant qu'a4ourd'hul on peut lever des fonds sur des march6s
Internatipnaux & des taux Int6ressants. Pour ces, ralsons, nous avons 6tuwi4
t'opportunit6 d'un 'paiet?ent par anticipation des trots lignes BIRD I, II, Ill,
-cependant le montant des p6nalit6s A verser & la BIRD resto dissuasit.

CREDIT DU MAROC
Direction des Engagements
Mesdames.
Comme suite a votre lettre visee en reference et a votre visite du 02.12.98 relatives au meme objet, nous
vous apportons des e1lments de reponse aux questions posees.
- ESTIMATION DES OBJECTIFS. STRUCTTJRE. EXECUTION ET OPERATION DU PROJET
Les objectifs de notre Etablissement ont ete atteints et les lignes de credit BIRD ont 6t6 utilis6es en
iotalit&.
- EVALUATION DE LA PERFORMANCE DU CREDIT DUl MAROC PENDANT LE PROJET. AVEC
LES LECONS ACQUiSES
Les lignes BIRD ont pu etre utilisees tres rapidernent et ont connu du succes. Notre Etablissement a pu
financer plusieurs proiets dans differentes regions du Maroc ei des secteurs d'activite divers (agro-
alirnentaire. textile. BTP. industrie pharmaceutique, industrie automobile. equipements de securite.
industrie plastique ......

- EVALUATION DE L.A PERFORMANCE DE L.A BANQUE MIONDIALE DUTRANT LE PROJET
La methode d'approche de la BIRD rejoignait celle du Credit du Maroc dont la rigueur dans P&tude du
risque esi une lignie de conduite perrnanente.
Nous avons pu. a l'occasion de nos contacts avec les experts et cadres de la BIRD. avoir de bonnes
relations de cooperation.
- REMAROUES FINALES
Ceci etani dit. nous nous pernmettons toutefois de vous faire part de quelques remarques relevees durant la
-estion de ces lignes. depuis leur mise en place jusquta leur remboursemenm integra] et anticipe par le
Credit du Maroc le 07.10.96.
* Tout d'abord. nous avons et confrontes a la multiciplite des interlocuteurs et surtout leur changement
ce qui a parfois rendu difficile les contacts.
* Nous avons aussi constate une insuffisance de coordination entre les services (Evaluation.
Decaissement et Remboursemeni des prets) puisque nous avons ete parfois relances (a tort) pour payer
des echeances deja remboursees. Le Credit du Maroc a mrnme pu b6n6ficier de l'abandon par la BIRD
de certaines charges puisqu'il pavait dans les delais.
* Enfin. une certaine lourdeur dans la mise en place et la gestion des lignes est 6ealement a relever car il
faut reunir des conditions prealables (conditions suspensives), foumir une consultation juridique et des
iustificatifs. elaborer des rapports sur les sous projets. foumir des audits (globale et de lignes), ..., ceci
est exremement contraignant par nos services intemes qui. au lieu d'assister les agences, sont
accapares par la confection de rapports de suivi (les rapports d'audit auraient suffi).
Ceci etant dit. nous nous felicitons des excellents rapports que nous avons eu avec tous nos interlocuteurs
de la BIRD qui. a ]'occasion de leurs multiples visites, ont ete recus par la Direction Generale du Credit du
Maroc.
Veuillez agreer. Mesdamnes. lexpression de nos salutations distinguees.

respectivement 25,5 %0, 23t.2 % er 19,6 % en montant de crddits debloques.
1II. - Difficultes de commercialisation de la liane BIRD I)I
Le taux d'utilisation de la ligne a atteint  71,83 % soil un montant debloque
de6.824.101 SUS.
Cettc insuffisance au niveau de la cominercialisation des crcdits BIRD est
due essentiellement aux facteurs suivants:
-  la surliquiditr  des Banques en  gen6ral pouvant etre rransform~e
partiellement en einploi 'a movcn terine.
