Page  9
1.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be awarded through

published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines), subject to the
following modifications:
      (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the
following is substituted therefor:
      "2.8 Notification and Advertising
            The international community should be notified in a
      timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
      advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a bidder's
      invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid;
      such advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper
      of general circulation in the Borrower's country and, in
      addition, in at least one of the following forms:
            (i)    a notice in the United Nations publication,
                   Development Forum, Business Edition; or
           (ii)    an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                   technical journal of wide international circula-
                   tion; or
          (iii)    a notice to local representatives of countries
                   and territories referred to in the Guidelines,
                   that are potential suppliers of the goods
                   required."
      (b)  The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
            "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
      the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
      used in international trade and specified in the bidding
      documents."
      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.
2.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded:
      (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Borrower's public
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of
such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found
acceptable by the Bank;
      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded
on the basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations obtained
from suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct
contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines; and
      (c)   by any purchasers, for the supply of commodities, on the
basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations obtained from more
than one supplier.
3.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, two
conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a description of the
advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
4.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 2 of
Page  10
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect thereof, such documentation
and information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.
5.     The provisions of the preceding paragraph 4 of this Schedule
shall not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account on the basis of
statements of expenditure.
                            SCHEDULE 4

framework consistent with the objectives of the Program, as
reflected by indicators acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank.

Borrower, so that the total principal amount of such Treasury bonds
outstanding from time to time required to be held by such banks

maintained by said banks from time to time, as calculated on the
basis of guidelines satisfactory to the Bank.
3.    Adoption of regulatory measures reducing the level of
rediscountable medium-term loans and housing loans which domestic
banks are required to make so that: (a) the total principal amount
of such medium-term loans required to be made by a domestic bank and
outstanding from time to time shall not exceed 2.5% of the aggregate
amount of deposits maintained by said bank from time to time; and
(b) the total principal amount of such housing loans required to be
made by a domestic bank and outstanding from time to time shall not
exceed 2.5% of the aggregate amount of deposits maintained by said
banks from time to time, all as calculated on the basis of
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank.
4.    Presentation to the Council of Government of the Borrower of
a draft banking law designed to facilitate the proper supervision by
the Central Bank of banking institutions and the proper management
of monetary policy.
5.    Adoption of regulations requiring each domestic bank to
maintain a ratio of equity to risk-weighted assets of not less than
8%, as determined on the basis of guidelines satisfactory to the
Bank.

its risk exposure in respect of any group of related beneficiaries
