APPRAISAL OF A FOTJRTH EDUCATION PROJECT IN TANZANIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a fourth education project in Tanzania for
which a credit of US$10.3 million is proposed.
ii.       The country's philosophy of social and economic development is one
of socialism and self-reliance and within this framework its major goal is to
improve the living standards of the rural population.  Some 90%e of Tanzania's
population live in rural areas, mostly scattered or in small communities
where it is difficult to provide social services. Nevertheless, rural devel-
opment leading to gradual improvements in the lives of the rural people is
being given priority over urban and industrial development.
iii.      The rural development strategy includes incentives to encourage
dispersed rural populations to organize themselves into ujamaa (Swahili for
'family') villages or communities engaged in cooperative or communal farming.
The incentives take the form of basic infrastructure such as education,
potable water supply, health services, and agricultural extension services.
iv.       The education plan supports the rural development program and the
national objective of universal primary education (UPE) by 1989. The plan
also regulates secondary and higher education in accordance with manpower
needs, with a view to achieving self-sufficiency by 1980. The implementation
of the plan has already been assisted by IDA. A first project financed in
1963 and successfully completed in 1967 helped the expansion of secondary
education; a second credit in 1969 is assisting teacher and technical educa-
tion together with a further expansion of secondary education; a third project
financed in 1971, is assisting agricultural education. The second and third
projects encountered initial delays but are now proceeding satisfactorily.
v.        Although the implementation of Tanzanian educational policies has
generally been good, financial constraints suggest that UPE is unlikely until
well after 1989. Immediate needs of the education system are the expansion
of teacher training, medical education, training of skilled craftsmen and the
integration of various types of rural education and training schemes. A new
policy that aims at decentralization of the education system and emphasizes
work-oriented education and training for youths and adults is now being
implemented.
vi.       The proposed project is based on a review of the education sector,
initiated by the Association, and carried out by the Overseas Liaison Committee
of the American Council on Education. It would support educational develop-
ment in line with the requirements indicated above by providing facilities to
expand: (a) primary school teacher training; (b) diversified secondary edu-
cation; (c) skilled worker training; (d) the training of medical doctors; and
(e) basic education and training for adults and children in ujamaa villages.
Specifically, it would provide buildings, furniture and equipment for:



-ii -
-    two new primary teacher training colleges and an extension
to the national teacher orientation center at Bagamoyo.
-    three new general secondary schools, with agricultural,
commercial, craft and home science options,
-    two new vocational training centers,
-    extensions to the University of Dar es Salaam Faculty of
Medicine at Muhimbili Hospital, Dar es Salaam, and the
Rural Health Center, Bagamoyo, and
-    eight new village community education centers.
vii.      The total project cost is estimated at US$14.6 million.  The pro-
posed credit would meet the estimated US$5.9 million foreign exchange com-
ponent of the project and US$4.4 million (51%) of the local costs (US$8.7
million). The credit would be apportioned as follows: US$5.2 million for
civil works, US$1.2 million for furniture and equipment, US$1.8 million for
technical assistance and professional services, and US$2.1 million, unallocated.
viii.     The staff of the project unit already established in the Ministry
of Education would be augmented so as to provide the capability for design,
implementation, and supervision of the combined projects. Contracts for
civil works (except for a minor part to be executed on a "self-help" basis),
furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding. It is likely that most civil works and furniture contracts
would be won by local contractors. Nearly all equipment would be imported.
Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be awarded a margin of
preference equivalent to the existing customs duties applicable to competing
imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever is the lower. Implementation
would be completed within five years of the effective date of the Credit Agree-
ment.
ix.       Subject to the conditions set down in paras. 6.01 - 6.03, the
proposed project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of US$10.3 million
equivalent to the Government of Tanzania.



INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tanzania has received three IDA credits for
education. The first, signed in December, 1963 (No. 45-TA) provided $4.6
million for the expansion of general secondary education and was successfully
completed in June, 1967. The second credit (No. 149-TA) of $5.0 million was
signed in May, 1969, and provides for the development of general secondary
schools, including the introduction of practical subjects into the curriculum,
the expansion of primary teacher training and the Dar es Salaam Technical
College. After a somewhat slow start due to problems in the building indus-
try, delayed delivery of construction materials and revision of sketch plans,
implementation of the second education project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
The third credit (No. 232-TA), signed in February 1971, provided $3.3 million
for the expansion of agricultural training; implementation has been delayed
by lack of technical manpower and inability to survey sites in troubled areas
near the Uganda border, but an accelerated construction program is expected
to assure completion of the work by December, 1974 as originally scheduled.
1.02      In response to a Government request, a review of the education
sector was undertaken in 1971 by the Overseas Liaison Committee of the American
Council of Education. Its report was discussed with the Government by an
IDA mission which visited Tanzania in January, 1972. The discussion led to
broad agreement on the composition of a possible fourth education project
which was appraised in June-July, 1972, by a mission composed of Messrs.
R.F. McMahon (technical educator), F.C. Gamble (general educator), A.S. Naimie
(architect) of the Bank, N. McEvers (economist, consultant), D.W. Eastwood
(medical educator, consultant) and C. Gilpin (non-formal educator, consultant).
1.03      The objectives of Tanzanian educational strategy are as follows:
(a)  to give every child a primary education as soon as the
financial circumstances of the Government permit, presently
planned for 1989;
(b)  to provide vocational training so as to achieve self-sufficiency
at all skill levels in the economy by 1980;
(c)  to provide secondary, technical and university education only
to the extent justified by the estimated manpower requirements
of the economy; and
(d)  to bring programs of non-formal education, on a continuing
basis, within reach of the population, particularly in rural
areas.
1.04      While the dates for achieving some of these targets may be too
optimistic, the objectives are sound. The proposed project would assist in
the realization of these goals by providing additional facilities for primary
teacher training, expanding secondary education and vocational training,
developing the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Dar es Salaam, and
by introducing experimental community education centers into selected ujamaa
("family" in Swahili) villages.

II. THE SETTING
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Tanzania has a land area of 937,000 sq. kms., some 13.5 million
(1972) people and a population density of about 15 inhabitants per sq. km.
(Kenya 19, Uganda 51). Most Tanzanians live on family smallholdings that are
widely dispersed throughout rural areas; only 6% live in towns and cities.
The population growth rate is 2.7% p.a. and the per capita GNP US$105 (1971).
Life expectancy averages 40-45 years and 45% of the population is less than
14 years old.
2.02      Some 90% of the total labor force works in agriculture, mostly in
subsistence farming. Less than 10% of the total labor force are in the slowly
growing wage employment sector: over two-thirds of the primary school leavers
every year must seek a livelihood in the rural sector. On the other hand, there
is still a shortage of local skilled manpower. In 1969, when the last compre-
hensive survey was carried out, Tanzanian citizens occupied only 34% of the
posts requiring university or equivalent education and 85% of those requiring
secondary education.
2.03      Agriculture, the main source of income and foreign exchange earnings,
contributes 40% of Tanzania's GDP and 80% of its commodity exports. Manufac-
turing, mining, construction, transport and communications together account
for 23% of GDP while public utilities, commerce, finance, government and
other services account for 37%. Efforts to promote manufacturing have not
as yet yielded significant results; growth of the economy depends heavily
upon agriculture.
Development Strategy
2.04      President Nyerere's Arusha Declaration of 1967 defines the broad
aims of Tanzanian development: to create a socialist economy and society
devoid of tribal privilege and economic exploitation and to achieve rapid
economic growth in order to improve the material and social well-being of
the mass of the population. Foundations for socialism and for economic
growth are to be established in the rural sector and strict priority is to
be given to rural development. The strategy for achieving these aims calls
for: (a) reduction of inequalities in the distribution of income; (b) public
otzznership and control of all major companies and firms; (c) modernization of
Jigriculture and reduction in the size of the subsistence sector; and (d)
growth of manufacturing mainly to support rural development.
2.uz     In conjunction with other measures, a more equitable distribution
or tiacome is being sought through wage and price controls and by heavy taxes
oVl higher income groups.  The Government now owns or controls nearly all
iimoortant enterprises. Private investment has declined sharply and many
foreigners, a substantial number of whom were managers, have left the country.
As a result, the shortage of managerial personnel for the public and private
sectors has been exacerbated.



2.06      Reorganization of the rural sector on a cooperative basis is pro-
gressing; inhabitants of dispersed hamlets are moving into ujamaa villages,
forming multipurpose agricultural cooperatives which would advance, after a
period of government assistance, to financial self-sufficiency. The number
of ujamaa villagers has now increased to 1.5 million or about 15% of Tanzania's
entire rural population. Thus far, about 2% of ujamaa villages have reached
the stage of viable cooperative units. An array of learning services, e.g.,
agricultural extension, community development, adult literacy, craft, health
and nutrition training, has been extended to improve the villager's skills
and capability for earning his livelihood and to enable the primary school
leaver to create opportunities for self-employment - in short, to develop
rural "self-reliance". These services have not yet been fully decentralized
and coordinated in the field. The government's recent decentralization, which
transferred much of the administrative apparatus and decision-making process
from the capital to rural areas, may aggravate problems in the near future,
but in the long run should facilitate the implementation of these programs.
2.07      Development planning provides for directing industrial invest-
ments to designated growth centers in the interior, which are to act as
catalysts for rural development by generating demand for rural goods, employ-
ing labor from adjacent areas, processing local products and supplying con-
sumer goods to local populations and some material inputs for agriculture.
New investment in manufacturing has risen substantially and much of it has
been directed to Mwanza, Tanga, Moshi and Arusha, which have become major
regional growth centers. However, the shortage of skilled labor continues
to be a constraint on the growth of manufacturing output.
III. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The education system
3.01      A general description of the system, its structure, and the education
pyramid is given in Appendix 1 and Charts 1 and 2. The 1971 primary school
enrollment of 903,000 represented some 37% of the 7-13 age group. 1/ (Annex 1).
Instruction is in Swahili. The number of periods in the primary school time-
table (over 40 a week) is high and subject courses need consolidation. The
pupil-teacher ratio is also high at 45:1 (Annex 2) and many of the teachers
(Grade C) have only primary education plus a two-year training course. The
statutory salaries of Grade A teachers, who have secondary education, are
some 50% higher than Grade C teachers and, as may be expected, financial
constraints prevent their appointment in greater numbers.
1/   Uganda 46% (1969), Kenya 56% (1968), Zambia 84% (1968).



-4-
3.02      Methods of reducing costs to allow universal primary education (UPE)
by 1989 are being studied by the government in preparation for the next five-
year plan. Based on forecasts of growth in government revenues and on the
needs of other parts of the education sector, and assuming that present policies
regarding length of course, size of classes, and teacher salaries remain un-
changed, a projection of possible school enrollment increases (Annex 1) points
to the difficulty of achieving UPE before the late 1990's. Cost savings to
achieve UPE earlier could be effected by reducing the length of primary school-
ing from its present seven years or possibly by extending the present practice
of half-day school in Grade 1 to the first four grades. However, the govern-
ment recognizes that these modifications could adversely affect the quality
of primary education.
3.03      Pre-service primary school teacher training is presently given in
21 colleges; their enrollment in 1971 was 4,200 and their output 2,400. Most
courses require two years following primary education (Grade C teachers) or
secondary education (Grade A teachers). About 600 students were enrolled
in a one-year "crash" program the effectiveness of which has not yet been
evaluated.
3.04      Secondary enrollments in public general and technical schools are
controlled to accord with estimated manpower needs; in 1971 they totalled
32,600 or about 2% of the 14-19 years age group. Instruction is in English.
The curriculum is still largely academic although progress is being made in
the introduction of practical subjects, such as agricultural and commercial
subjects, craft training and home science. A limited expansion is needed at
the lower level to supply the middle level manpower required by the mid 1980's
(para 4.03). Unit costs are high, due partly to the policy of providing
boarding facilities for most pupils and partly to the low pupil-teacher ratio
(19:1). Lower cycle secondary teachers are trained in the Dar es Salaam
teachers college where the program includes practical subjects and home
science. Enrollment in 1971 was 240, and outputs from the college and the
university appear to be greater than the long term need for secondary level
teachers even when calculated on the present low student-teacher ratio
(Annex 2).
3.05      Vocational training is provided in Dar es Salaam at a center which
opened in 1968 with UNDP/ILO support. It has a capacity of 300 places and an
annual output of 150 craftsmen. The National Apprenticeship Scheme sponsored
by the Ministry of Labor and small training centers operated by religious
groups and parastatal organizations have an annual output of about 200, many
of whom require further training before they become proficient as craftsmen.
3.06      Numerous short specialized courses for managers are provided by
government departments and industrial concerns. The uncoordinated multiple
efforts in management training have splintered training resources, resulting
in duplication of training and inability to provide more advanced training
in modern management techniques. An inventory of on-going programs and a
master plan for management improvement programs are therefore urgently needed.



3.07      The Dar es Salaam Technical College is the only institution in
Tanzania offering technician training; its 1971 enrollment in the 3-year full-
time technician course was 420. The College is short of experienced teaching
staff, partly because expatriate teachers have been phased out very rapidly.
The shortage is being partially alleviated through bilateral technical assist-
ance. With the assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany, the government
is establishing a new technical college at Arusha and a Faculty of Engineering
at the University of Dar es Salaam.
3.08      The University has faculties of Agriculture, Arts, Law, Medicine
and Science. Its Department of Education trains graduate secondary school
teachers in a three-year course; recent enrollments have averaged 600. The
University Institute of Education provides curriculum development and in-
service courses for practicing teachers. Development of a Faculty of Engineer-
ing (para 3.06) should assist Tanzanian industrial development. Pending the
completion of the next Plan, investments in higher education should be directed
only to the most obvious high priority needs.
3.09      Doctors are trained abroad and in the University's Faculty of Medi-
cine at Muhimbili, Dar es Salaam. The Faculty of Medicine was founded in
1968 and the present facilities at Muhimbili hospital are sufficient to
produce about 30 doctors a year. Medical specialists, dentists, pharmacists
and dental assistants are trained abroad. The Ministry of Health trains all
medical auxiliaries, including nurses. Enrollments and other details regarding
various health education and training programs are given in Appendix II.
Education finance
3.10      Total expenditure on education in Tanzania amounted to 4.5% of GDP
in 1970/71; this figure is normal when compared with other African countries
but has risen rapidly in the recent past and is expected to further increase
to 5.8% by 1984/85 (Annex 3). Virtually all expenditure in 1970/71 was fi-
nanced by public resources. The share of private education is very small
although, at the secondary level, its proportion is rising rapidly (Appendix
I). Funds for education are channelled through the Ministry of Education.
Small fees are charged in primary schools and no fees in secondary schools.
University tuition and boarding fees are fully covered by Ministry of Education
bursaries. Other Ministries (e.g,, Agriculture, Health, Labor) finance spe-
cialized courses.
3.11      While the government's total expenditure grew at 16.5% p.a. during
the period 1964/65 - 1970/71, its annual outlays for education increased
14.5% p.a., the slower growth due primarily to financial constraints on cap-
ital expenditure. As a result, the proportion of government expenditure for
education fell from 18% to 16%. However, recurrent spending on education
continued to grow at a rapid rate (17.6% p.a.) and absorbed an increasing
share of the government's total recurrent expenditures: 21% in 1970/71 as
compared with 17% in 1964.



-6-
3.12      For the Government's capital program under the Second Five-Year
Plan (1969/70-1973/74), 11%, or 297 million shillings, was earmarked for the
Ministry of Education. Of this amount, 138 million was scheduled for invest-
ment in the first two years of the Plan period, over half of it for primary
and secondary school construction. However, financial constraints have led
to a cut-back in the planned rate of investment and the Ministry of Education's
actual capital outlays have totalled only 75 million shillings over the first
two years of the Plan period.  About 75% of the Ministry's capital expenditure
was devoted to new primary schools and extensions to teacher training colleges
and the University. Other ministries made significant investments in new
agriculture training institutes, rural training centers and para-medical
training facilities (Annex 4).
3.13      Tanzania receives assistance for education from a variety of sources,
such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United
States, IDA and UNDP. During the First Five Year Plan period (1964/65-1968/69),
external loans and credits for capital expenditures alone totalled US$11.1
million. For the first three years of the Second Five Year Plan, 1969/70-
1973/74, foreign assistance to capital expenditure is expected to total about
US$24 million.
Future expenditure on education
3.14      Forecasts of future expenditures (Annexes 3 and 4) are based upon
the government's order of priorities for allocating resources to education,
namely (a) to provide national self-sufficiency in the supply of skills at
the middle and higher manpower levels, and (b) to use the remaining resources
available for the achievement of UPE at the earliest date that such resources
will permit. The estimate of available resources assumes that economic
growth will average 5.7% p.a. through 1985. Recurrent expenditures on educ-
ation by the government are expected to absorb about 24% of the government's
total recurrent expenditures by 1984/85. Capital outlays will be especially
heavy in the early years of the forecast period, as on-going projects to
extend secondary school, teacher training and university facilities are com-
pleted. After 1974/75, however, capital expenditures on education will be
clevoted mainly to primary school building, for which labor will be donated on
a local, self-help basis as heretofore. During the period of 1975/76-1984/85,
capital outlays on education are expected to average 70 million shillings p.a.
or roughly 5% of the Government's annual total capital expenditures. Together,
recurrent and capital expenditures on education are expected to be 18% of total
government expenditures by 1984/85.
3.15      Based on present policies, UPE by 1988/89 would require the govern-
ment to allocate 36% of its total recurrent budget in that year to education
alone. In all probability, Tanzania will not have sufficient resources to
achieve UPE by the target year, 1989. The forecast described in the preceding
paragraphs indicates that the government's financial resources would enable
primary school enrollments to expand to 2.4 million pupils by 1984/85 or to
65, of the relevant age group in that year.  However, to reach this level of
enrollment, the government would have to devote 60% of its annual recurrent
education budget to primary education by 1984/85. After providing 27% for



- 7-
education and training related to manpower needs and 5% for administration,
only 8% would be left available to finance non-formal education schemes which
were to be a major element of Tanzania's education strategy (para 1.03 and
Annex 4). Since the cost of UPE could retard development of non-formal
training, the government is considering modification of the primary school
system in order to obtain UPE at lower cost (para 3.02). It is also planning
to base the development of non-formal training on the modified village primary
school along the lines of the experimental "community education centers"
included in the proposed project (paras 4.11 - 4.12).
IV. NEED FOR THE PROJECT
4.01      General secondary education.  The latest manpower survey, completed
in 1969 by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development Planning (DEVPLAN)
covering wage employment in all sectors except estate agriculture, was the
mission's basis for estimating future requirements. It showed that in 1969,
52,000 out of 255,000 wage earners were to be found in high and middle level
occupations, classified as follows (Annex 5):
No.                  Category
High Level     Professional               5,300     A - Jobs normally requiring
university degree or
equivalent.
Professional/
Sub-Professional         13,000     B - Jobs which require
successful completion
of 4 years of secondary
education plus one to
three years of further
education or training.
Middle Level   Sub-Professional
and Skilled                          C - Jobs which require
Office Workers           33,700          successful completion
of 4 years of secondary
education.
About 34% of Category A and 85% of Category B jobs were held by Tanzanians
(para 2.02).
4.02      DEVPLAN is now revising its 1970-1985 forecast of high/middle
level manpower requirements (which assumed 6.5% GDP growth p.a.) in the
light of actual economic performance since 1968 and future trends. A pre-
liminary estimate of requirements assumes that GDP will average 5.7% growth
p.a. during 1970-1985 with monetary GDP growing at 6.9% p.a. and that labor
productivity will increase at 2.0% annually. The estimate also assumes a
modest upgrading in the occupational structure, with Categories A, B and C



- 8 -
representing together 27% (20% in 1969) of wage employment in these sectors
by 1985. On this basis, wage employment is estimated to grow to 573,000
by 1985 and the number of workers required in that year for Categories A, B
and C will amount to 155,000. Assuming complete replacement of non-citizen
personnel, manpower requirements for 1970-1985 are:
Replacement      Expansion      Total
Category A                4,700         6,600        11,300
Category B                9,900        41,300        51,200
Category C                1            55,QQ0        66,000
Total               25,600       102,900       128,500
4.03      The basic source of high and middle level manpower is the qualified
output from secondary schools at Form IV.  At this level the total qualified
output from existing and presently planned public and private schools during
1970-1985 is estimated at 125,000, leaving a shortfall of 3,500. A limited
further expansion of lower secondary education appears necessary if Tanzania
is to achieve self-sufficiency at high and middle manpower levels in most
areas by the mid-1980's. At Form VI level the output should be adequate to
meet the needs of Category A jobs.
4.04      Primary teacher training.  Although detailed enrollment targets will
be worked out in connection with the next Plan, the orders of magnitude summa-
rized in Annex 2 indicate that an average of 3,400 additional primary teachers
per year over the period 1971-1985 will be needed. Government policy is to
provide pre-service courses in a region other than the trainees' home regions.
However, a primary teacher training college (PTTC) is needed in each region
because of the importance of locally-based in-service training. The national
need is sufficient to require at least one PTTC in each of the eighteen regions.
4.05      At present, some of the PTTCs are inadequately housed; some regions
have several colleges, others have none. In 1976, when planned PTTC projects,
including the proposed second IDA project, are completed, the total enrollment
capacity will reach 5,400 and the output 3,000, assuming that the temporary
one-year course is retained (para 3.03). The two PTTCs included in the proposed
project would therefore provide the teachers required to support a reasonable
increase in primary enrollments. As they would be located in regions where no
PTTC at present exist, they would conform to government policy.
4.06      Skilled craftsmen.  Few data exist on occupations at the middle and
lower levels of wage employment, which are not included in Categories A, B
and C above. It is estimated that industry, construction, transport and public
utilities employed about 135,000 workers in 1969. This figure would rise to
about 260,000 by 1980, assuming an average growth rate of 6.0% p.a. in employment
employment and 8.0% p.a. in the output of these sectors. Some 10,000 workers
em.ployed in these sectors or 7.5% of the total were identified as skilled
craftsmen. Tanzania's development would require that by 1980, at least 10%
of the labor force employed in these sectors be skilled workers. The estimated
net increases of 16,000 from 1970 to 1980, or 1,600 p.a. are therefore minimum
skilled labor requirements.



-9-
4.07      Medical personnel.  The government's strategy for the development
of economical health services calls for Rural Health Centers, each with out-
lying dispensaries, to provide health services other than those requiring
hospital care, and for rural hospitals at district and regional levels to
provide major curative services. These basic programs would be complemented
by health services at the national level, consultation hospitals at three
major centers, and three hospitals specializing in tuberculosis, mental
disease and obstetrics respectively.
4.08      It is known that the main constraint to the implementation of the
government public health strategy (Appendix II) is the insufficient supply
of medical doctors. In 1971 there were only 480 medical doctors in Tanzania
(1 per 27,900 inhabitants, compared with 1 per 12,400 in Kenya, 1 per 14,000
in Zambia and 1 per 14,600 in Uganda), 320 of whom were expatriate. Over 500
were needed at the time for the rural services alone; consequently the health
care given by para-medical personnel in rural areas suffered from lack of
professional guidance. It is estimated that a total of 950 doctors by 1980,
rising to 1,400 by the mid-1980's, are the desirable numbers required for the
health care system to function at optimum efficiency (Annex 6 and Appendix
II). Output of doctors from the present Medical Faculty at Dar es Salaam
would fall significantly short of requirements.
4.09      In order to keep within planned overall recurrent expenditures, the
government at cabinet level has decided:
(i) to plan for a maximum of 700 doctors working in Tanzania by
1980, representing nearly 75% of optimum requirements. (No
estimates have been made for subsequent years.); and
(ii) to increase annual intakes to the Medical Faculty to a
maximum of 64 students.
4.10      By 1980, the output from the Faculty coupled with the existing stock
with due allowance for wastage, would make available about 400 doctors. The
deficit of 300 doctors for the planned service would be met through overseas
training of 200 doctors and employment of 100 noncitizen doctors provided
through external assistance or expatriate service. The ensuing shortage of
250 doctors necessary to meet the 1980 optimum requirements would be alleviated
by the use of assistant medical officers who would perform the duties of doc-
tors in the less exacting positions in rural areas. The faculty can now
admit only 35 students per annum of whom about 30 graduate and the proposed
project would provide an extension to the Faculty of Medicine to accord with
the cabinet's decision (ii) above.
4.11      Non-formal education.  The broad objectives of the government's
educational development strategy (para 1.03) include the extension of non-
formal education and training for adults in support of the ujamaa village
concept. The government has decided to base this development on the primary
school, to minimize recurrent and capital costs. The primary schools would
become community education centers (CEC) and complement the Rural Training



- 10 -
Centers which train village and community leaders. The recent decentraliza-
tion of many government administrative services, including the transfer of
primary school administration to regional and district levels, should make
possible a closer coordination between the different agencies for agriculture,
education, health and community development which would be involved in an
effective rural adult education program.
4.12      Most of the instruction for adults will be given by primary school
teachers, the instruction time to be obtained by reduction of primary pupil
contact hours. The curriculum of the primary teacher training colleges is
being broadened to include practical subjects - agriculture, crafts, home
science - which are of particular relevance to the rural community. The
services of the better trained teachers will be complementary to those pro-
vided by agricultural extension agents and health service workers, who would
use the facilities of the CEC when visiting the villages. Villagers with
special skills or talents will also teach in the CECs. The implementation of
the program on an experimental basis would be possible only through the avail-
ability of CEC physical facilities, financed from other than the government's
investment budget.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The proposed project would assist Tanzania's education strategy by
developing education and training facilities for children and adults in ujamaa
villages, expanding and improving pre-service and in-service training of
primary school teachers, expanding secondary and vocational education, and
providing additional facilities for training doctors. It would comprise:
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for:
Additional                 Staff
Student      Boarding   Housing
Places        Places      Units
Three general secondary schools                 1,920         1,260       72

- 11 -
(b)  a total of 49 man-years of technical assistance and 35
man-years of fellowships for (i) staff development at the
Faculty of Medicine; (ii) a study of the needs for develop-
ment and coordination of management training programs; and
(iii) the strengthening of the project implementation unit
(Appendix III).
Project Items
5.02      General secondary schools.  Over the period 1970-1985 the shortfall
of Form 4 graduates entering the labor force is expected to be about 3,500
(para 4.03). The proposed project would therefore include three general
secondary schools which are expected to have an output of about 3,000 over
the same period. While initially a small deficit may remain, it is considered
that further expansion is inadvisable at this time because at capacity the
annual output of 350 from the three schools would be above the average annual
need of 250 over the whole period. The estimates of student places and output
are based on an acceptable class size of 40.
5.03      The three schools would be identical with four streams in Forms 1-4.
They would be located in Kibondo, Lindi and Maswa. Initially, because of the
relative inexperience of the teaching staff, the class size would be 35. A
diversified curriculum with agriculture, commerce, crafts, and home science
options during the last two years of the four year course would be offered.
The allocation of students to the schools would be made nation-wide, based
on the results of the primary leaving examinations. Boarding would therefore
be provided. Graduate teachers for the schools would come from the Faculty of
Education, University of Dar es Salaam, and diploma level general teachers
from the Chang'ombe Teacher Training College, which would also supply specialist
teachers in commerce, crafts and home science. Specialist teachers of agricul-
ture would come from the Butimba Teacher Training College and the Faculty of
Agriculture, Morogoro.
5.04      Pre-service primary teacher training colleges (PTTCs).  The deficit
between primary teacher supply and demand over the next fifteen years is
estimated at 400 p.a.(paras.4.04 and 4.05). The two new colleges included
in the proposed project would meet this deficit. They could enroll 960 students
at 40 students per class but present government policy is to limit PTTC class-
units to 30 each in view of the limited experience of Tanzanian teacher educ-
ators. The enrollment in the colleges during their first years of operation
would therefore amount to 720, providing an annual output of about 360. Full
boarding facilities would be provided as would housing for about half the
teaching staff. During negotiations the government gave an assurance that
it would, within two years of the signing of the Credit Agreement, under-
take an evaluation of the present one-year primary teacher training course
(para 3.03) and draw up a rationalization plan for the primary teacher train-
ing program to determine, in accordance with,future primary teacher needs,
the optimal size and location of each region's PTTC(s) and the most appropriate
length and structure for the training program (para 4.05).



12 -
5.05      The proposed colleges would be built in the Mtwara and Mbeya regions
where there are no PTTCs at present. Both regions are in the less developed
southern areas of the country. They would serve as focal points for in-service
training courses for the teachers in their respective regions and for commer-
cial activities connected with rural development.
5.06      The curriculum would stress agricultural training, handicrafts and
home science, all fields of particular importance to rural development.
Applicants for the courses would have completed primary or lower secondary
education. No shortage at either level is expected. The training program
would be flexible to produce either Grade A or Grade C teachers, depending
upon the Government's ability to finance the higher salaries of Grade A
teachers. Teacher trainers to staff the PTTCs would be available from the
Faculty of Education at the graduate level and from Chang'ombe (Dar es Salaam)
and Butimba Teacher Training Colleges at the diploma level. Chang'ombe pro-
duces primary teacher trainers in craft work and home science and Butimba in
agricultural subjects.
5.07      Extension to an in-service primary teacher training college.  This
College, located at Bagamoyo, some 40 miles north of Dar es Salaam, has been
providing in-service courses for primary school teachers to help them assume
the responsibilities of community leaders in ujamaa villages. The proximity
of the College to Dar es Salaam enables the trainees, many of whom come from
remote areas, to visit the capital and attend lectures by national leaders.
5.08      It is estimated that asout 15,000 teachers require these courses,
The proposed item would provide additional facilities to increase the capacity
of the College from 120 to 360 students so that, with the present 4-week
courses, each teacher would be able to attend a course about once every five
years. College staff are specially selected from experienced staff of other
teacher training collegQs and other appropriate institutions, and extensive
use is made of specialist part-time lecturers.
5.09      Vocational training centers (VTCs).  The two proposed centers would
help to alleviate the shortfall in the supply of skilled workers (para 4.06).
Sited at Tanga and Mwanza in conformity with the policy of decentralizing
industrial development (para 2.07), they would operate in the same manner
as the Dar es Salaam VTC in which apprentices are given a 4-year course
following primary education. Attendance at the VTC is full-time during the
first year; during the following three years the apprentices are employed in
industry and attend the VTC on a part-time day and evening basis. The new
centers would each have a capacity of 300 trainees and an annual output of
about 150 craftsmen. In addition to apprentice training, the new VTCs would
also offer ad hoc courses to meet the special needs of industry.
5.10      The Dar es Salaam VTC is assisted by a UNDP/ILO project and by the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). It operates effectively
and in close cooperation with industry. Until now it has been staffed almost
entirely by CIDA and ILO experts but sufficient local instructors are being
trained at the VTC and overseas to staff present and projected VTCs. However,
in the initial stages technical assistance would be essential. The Government



- 13 -
has applied to UNDP for six experts (13 man-years) and for 24 fellowships,
mainly for instructor training to cover workshop practice, instructor training,
training systems and methods, supervisor training and vocational guidance.
Discussions with UNDP indicate that this application will be favorably consi-
dered. It is also likely that CIDA is prepared to consider a government
request for the provision of experts to cover mechanical, automobile, elec-
trical and building trades. Hence, no difficulty is expected in the provision
of suitable instructional staff.
5.11      Community education centers (CEC).  This item would provide for
the construction and equipment of eight CECs in developing ujamaa villages
initially in the Dodoma region. They would be experimental and designed to
support government plans for rural development (para 4.11). Eight village
sites have been tentatively chosen. In each case the existing primary school
is several miles away and is to be resited in the new village. The CECs
would serve as primary schools and also include basic facilities for instructing
resettled adults in village crafts, agricultural activities, work-oriented
literacy, home science, and health care. Courses for adults would be held
in the late afternoon and evening.
5.12      Dodoma has been selected for these pilot CECs because of the
success of pioneer ujamaa villages in this area. Furthermore, the Region
has an efficient Rural Training Center incorporating a mobile construction
unit satisfactorily staffed and equipped to handle simple building construc-
tion. The unit augmented by technicians financed under the Credit, would
build the CECs with materials, furniture and equipment supplied under the
Credit with general supervision from the project implementation unit. Cost
estimates have been based on the assumption that all labor would be provided
by the villagers on a "self-help" basis.
5.13      Most of the instruction at the CECs would be done by primary school
teachers who are now being trained in appropriate practical subjects at
primary teacher training colleges. The teachers would be assisted by visiting
specialists from the Rural Training Center and by the agricultural and rural
development (home economics) assistants attached to each village.
5.14      Management development study.  The most important obstacle to
development is the lack of managerial and associated skills to implement
Tanzania's national strategy. Present management education and training
programs are in the early stages of development and are uncoordinated. They
should be rationalized within the framework of a master plan for managerial
and associated learning services. Two man-years of technical assistance on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Association are therefore included
in the proposed project to survey the needs for management education and
training. This study would inventory on-going programs, evaluate their
effectiveness and prepare a master plan for management training to serve all
sectors of the economy.



- 14 -
5.15      Faculty of Medicine.  This project item would provide additional
facilities for the Faculty of Medicine at Muhimbili hospital in Dar es Salaam
and for a Rural Health Center in Bagamoyo to permit the annual output of
doctors to be increased from 30 to about 60 in line with government policy
(para 4.10). The facilities in Bagamoyo, a small community, would give the
students experience in the practice of community medicine. All the facilities
to be provided would be geared to medical teaching and would consist of labor-
atories, workshops, seminar rooms, boarding facilities for the students and
staff housing for a small proportion of the staff.
5.16      In addition to the training of doctors, maximum use of the extended
facilities would be assured in the training of assistant medical officers,
nurses and other medical auxiliaries all of whom would benefit from working
in close association, an experience likely to be of considerable value in
their future employment as members of rural medical aid teams.
5.17      The training of medical doctors lasts five years and graduates
are bound to serve the government for at least five years thereafter.  The
teaching program is divided into three main components: (i) Basic Sciences;
(ii) Clinical Medicine; and (iii) Community Medicine. The curriculum is
designed to prepare predominantly for service in rural areas: emphasis is
placed on diagnosis and treatment of common diseases, the surgical management
of injuries and infection and public health preventive measures.
5.18      The present teaching staff numbers 52 of whom only ten are
Tanzanians. By 1980 the Faculty would need a full and part-time staff of
about 110 of whom it is expected that about 50 would be local. Recruitment
of overseas staff would be made through bilateral technical assistance
agencies and UNDP in association with WHO. It is anticipated that such as-
sistance will be forthcoming. In the event that sufficient assistance does
not become available, the project would include funds for 35 man-years of
technical assistance to complement the assistance provided by other agencies.
The 35 man-years provided represents about 2 man-years in specialties
within the three main components listed in para 5.17 but would be deployed
flexibly in those areas requiring assistance in program and curriculum
development (Appendix III). The project would also include 35 man-years of
fellowships for the training of Tanzanian teachers for the medical faculty.
Assurances have been obtained that technical assistance specialists would be
eiployed upon terms and conditions mutually satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Association and that fellowships would be awarded to appropriately
qualified candidates.
5.19      Mfuhimbili hospital presently operates under dual management.  The
Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital and its associated clinical
facilities while the Ministry of Education is responsible for the Faculty of
Medicine and its physical plant located at Muhimbili. The government has
given assurances that within six months after the date of the Credit Agreement
it would submit to the Association a plan for the operation of Muhimbili
Hospital as a teaching hospital for the expanded Faculty of Medicine, and
introduce such changes as the Association might reasonably request.

5.22     ('eneral.  Construction cost estimates have been derived from recent
school and university building costs in Tanzania. The average cost per square
foot amounts to ITSS2.80 for the CECs, excluding labor costs, US$7.00 per square
foot for the Vocational Training Centers, US$9.25 for the secondary schools
and PTTCs and US$14.70 per square foot for the Faculty of Medicine. The
proposed schedules of accommodation for the physical facilities to be provided
are functional and economical, e.g., utilization factors in the vocational
training centers would be 85% for classrooms and 80% for workshops, based on
a 40-hour working week. Furniture and equipment cost estimates are reasonable;
detailed lists would be prepared during the design stage and reviewed by the
Association before procurement.
5.23      Unit costs.  The estimated capital costs for the project institu-
tions are considered reasonable; e.g., the estimated costs of academic and
communal facilities per student place in the secondary schools (about
US$1,000) compared with an estimated cost of about US$720 in the second
Tanzanian education project (Cr. 149-TA) signed in Tay 1969. In the inter-
vening three years there has been a rapid price escalation and recently, in
July, 1972, an increase in the minimum wuage which is expected to affect
project costs.
5.24      Contingencies.  Contingency allowances are shown in detail in
Annex S.  For unforeseen factors 10% has heen added to the cost estimates of
site development, construction, equipment and professional services and 5%
to the cost estimates of furniture. Unit costs of 1972, in both local
currency and foreign exchanRe, are expected to increase by 7-10% p.a. and
therefore an additional 18% contingency has been included for civil works,
15% for furnituire and equiDment, 1% for professional services and 15% for
technical assistance.
5.25      Foreign exchanae components.  The foreign exchange components have
been calculated as follows: (a) site development and construction costs,
28%; (b) furniture, 25%; (c) equipment, 90%; (d) technical assistance, 81%;
and (e) professional services, 20%. Including contingencies, the foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$5.9 million or 40% of the total project
cost.
Project Irmplementation
5.26      Administration.  The existing Project Unit, established in the
'finistry of Education for imDlementation of the first and second education
projects, would also be responsible for the overall supervision of the
project and liaison with the Association. It would be augmented to enable
it not onlv to issue tenders, evaluate bids and award contracts for civil
works, but also to provide architectural services for all project institu-
tions excent the extension to the Faculty of Msedicine. Technical assist-
ance would be provide(d for the Project Unit to undertake these additional
responsibilities.  The Project Unit would comprise the following full time



- 18 -
staff: (i) a project coordinator, (ii) a deputy project coordinator, (iii) an
accountant, (iv) a procurement officer, (v) four qualified architects (8 man
years technical assistance), one of whom could function as project coordina-
tor, (vi) a civil engineer (2-1/2 man years T.A.), (vii) a clerk of works
(1-1/2 man year T.A.); all of the above to be appointed in consultation
with the Association, (viii) draftsmen, (ix) three full-time building in-
spectors, and (x) adequate supporting staff. Consulting firms of quantity
surveyors would be utilized to assist the Project Unit as required. Con-
sulting architects specializing in the design of medical facilities would
be employed for the master planning and design of the extension to the
Medical Faculty. All consultants would be selected and employed on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Association. The Credit would help finance,
in addition to the staff mentioned under (v), (vi) and (vii) above, three
building inspectors, draftsmen as required for the Project Unit and technicians
for the mobile unit of the Community Education Center, appropriate supplementary
expenses of the Project Unit. As a condition of effectiveness, the government
should appoint the project coordinator.
5.27      Procurement.  Except for civil works and locally manufactured
construction materials at the CECs and VTCs, contracts for civil works,
furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's guidelines for
procurement. Construction work at the CECs and VTCs would not be suitable
for international competitive bidding due to their small size and remote
locations and the availability of voluntary labor at the village level.
For the CECs, construction work would be performed by a mobile construction
unit attached to the rural training center (para 5.12). Imported construction
materials, furniture and equipment would be procured through international
competitive bidding. Locally manufactured construction materials would be
procured through local competitive bidding. Pre-qualification procedures
for civil works contracts would be acceptable to the Association. All civil
works contracts for the first and second education projects were won by local
contractors and this is likely to be repeated.
5.28      The bulk of instructional equipment would be procured abroad and
furniture locally.  Contracts for books would be awarded in accordance with
the normal book procurement procedures of the Borrower. Items would be
grouped to the extent practicable to encourage competition and to permit
bulk procurement. Domestic manufacturers would be accorded a preferential
margin of 15%, or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower,
above the C.I.F. price of competing importers.
5.29      Sites.  Suitable sites have been selected and are available for the
three secondary schools and two VTCs. Because all land in ujamaa villages is
community owned, no problems in acquiring sites for the project CECs are
anticipated. Land adjacent to their present sites is available for the ex-
tensions to the Bagamoyo Teacher Training College and the Medical Faculty.
5.30      Disbursements.  A forecast of disbursement is shown in Annex 9.
The proposed credit of US$10.3 million would cover all foreign exchange costs
(US$5.9 million) and 51% (US$4.4 million) of local costs. The credit would



- 19 -
finance 71% of the total estimated project cost (US$14.6 million). Imple-
mentation would be completed within 5 years of the effective date of the
Credit Agreement. Undisbursed funds would be subject to cancellation.
Disbursement would be on the basis of:
(a)  100% of the C.I.F. price of imported construction materials,
equipment and furniture and of the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured furniture and equipment;
(b)  80% of total expenditure for technical assistance and
professional services, supplemental project unit expenses; and
(c)  65% of total expenditure for civil works and locally
procured construction materials.
VI.  RECOM!ENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Borrower would within two years of the signing of the Credit Agreement under-
take an evaluation of the present one-year primary teacher training course
and draw up a rationalization plan for the primary teacher training program
(para 5.04).
6.02      In addition to the customary conditions, a condition of effective-
ness of the Credit would be the appointment of the project coordinator
(para 5.26).
6.03      During negotiations the government agreed to provide within six
months after the date of the Agreement a plan for the operation of Muhimbili
Hospital as a teaching hospital for the expanded Faculty of Medicine and to
introduce such modifications as the Association might reasonably request
(para 5.19).
6.04      Subject to the conditions in paras 6.01 - 6.03 above, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Credit of US$10.3 million to the
Government of Tanzania for a term of 50 years including a 10 year grace
period.

THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Administration
1.        Public primary schools are directed by 18 Regional Education Of-
ficers operating through 64 District Education Officers. Secondary, tech-
nical, teacher training and higher education are under the direct control
of the MIinistry of National Education. Private schools are controlled by
the government but receive no financial support. The Ministry of Education
is generally well organized but has lost some able personnel to the regions
during the recent moves to decentralize the government.
2.        Primary education begins at age seven and is a seven year course
(Standards I-VII). Swahili is the language of instruction but English is
taught at all levels. Fees, varying from region to region, are charged;
these range from 10 shillings per year in the lower grades to 60 shillings
in the highest. Exemption is allowed in case of need. A promotion examina-
tion at grade 4 for pupils in rural schools is being progressively phased
out and the last such examination will be held in 1973.
3.        In the decade since independence (1961-71), enrollments in public
schools have increased from nearly 500,000 to over 900,000, representing
about 37% of the relevant age group. Grade I enrollment in 1971 amounted
to about 48% of the children aged seven. Enrollment in private schools was
estimated at nearly 30,000; some of these schools cater for minority groups.
There were in total about 4,500 schools, 400 of them private.
4.        Nearly 90% of primary school leavers terminate their formal educa-
tion at this level and the curriculum is designed principally to meet their
needs rather than for the minority who proceed to secondary schools. Most
primary schools have a garden and some 20% have a practical subjects room.
Increasing emphasis is being given to agriculture, home science and simple
craft work.
5.        General secondary education comprises a four-year lower secondary
course (Forms I-IV) followed by two years pre-university (Forms V and VI).
All post-primary education is in English and no fees are charged in public
schools. Dropout and repetition rates are negligible. After completing
Form IV pupils sit for the National School Certificate examination and at
the end of Form VI for the National Higher School Certificate examination.
These examinations were first instituted in 1971, replacing the East African
examinations which themselves had replaced the Cambridge University examina-
tions.
6.        The enrollments in public secondary schools are geared to manpower
needs. Total enrollment during the decade 1961-1971 nearly tripled to over
32,600 while at the pre-university level enrollments increased more than
seven fold to over 3,000. Even so, secondary enrollments amounted in 1971



APPENDIX I
Page 2
to only 1.9% of the 14-19 years age group, 2.5% at the lower level and 0.6%
at the upper. Enrollments iii privace secondary schools in 1971 were one-
third of those in public sc"hools. This proportion is rapidly increasing;
in 1969 private secondary scbnool enrollment was only one-sixth of the public
enrollment.
7.        Secondary school stiadards are reasonably good.  Over 60% of the
teachers are trained Tanzaniarns (1971) as against only 15% in 1967. The
curriculum is still largely academic though it has been adapted to the local
background in such subjects as history, geography and biology. Increased
emphasis will in future be given to practical subjects such as agriculture,
commerce, craft training and home science.
8.        Nearly three-fourths of secondary students are boarders; only in
Dar es Salaam are there schools where the day pupils outnumber boarders.
The need for boarding facilities arises from the low population density and
the large catchment area of all secondary schools dutside Dar es Salaam.
In addition, secondary school pupils require facilities for study which are
provided in boarding schools but which are lacking in many Tanzanian homes;
the performance of boarding school pupils in examinations is considerably
better than that of day students.
Primary Teachers and Teacher Training
9.        In 1971 there were nearly 20,000 teachers in public primary schools
and about 500 in private schools. About 6,000 of these teachers were Grade
A (two years teacher training following completion of Form IV), some 12,700
were Grade C (two years training following completion of Standard VII) and
the rest were unqualified.  Government policy is to use Grade A teachers
for the upper primary grades 5 through 7 and Grade C teachers for the lower
grades. The salaries of Grade A teachers are on average 50% higher than
those of Grade C.
10.       In 1971 there were 21 Primary Teacher Training Colleges (PTTCs)
offering pre-service training for primary teachers with an enrollment of
4,200 in the Grade A and C programs. In addition, in-service courses for
practising teachers are given in the Bagamoyo College of National Education.
11.       With the increased emphasis on regional development and autonomy
the government plans one PTTC in each of the 18 Regions; new PTTCs are now
under construction in Lindi and Singida and the second IDA credit will ex-
pand those in Korogwe and Katoke. Where there is more than one PTTC in a
Region the smaller PTTC where facilities are inadequate are planned to be
converted into other types of schiools (e.g. primary schools); no timetable
has yet been worked out for this rationalization.
12.       With only 37% of the age group enrolled in primary schools and a
high pupil/teacher ratio of 45:1 there is need for more teachers. The main
constraint on expansion is financial.  There is no lack of candidates for
primary teacher training courses and the government could effect significant



APPENDIX I
Page 3
economies by gradually eliminating Grade A teachers and establishiag a new
grade of "primary school teacher" to be paid on the Grade C scale irrespec-
tive of qualifications prior to admission to the PTTC source.
Secondary Teachers and Teacher Training
13.       In 1971 there were 1,706 secondary school teachers in public sec-
ondary schools of whom 1,064 were trained Tanzanians, The student/teacher
ratio is low at 19:1 and the government is reluctant to increase it in view
of the relative inexperience of the Tanzanian teachers who are steadily re-
placing expatriate teachers. Nevertheless, this low ratio is difficult to
justify in view of the country's financial position. In 1971 private sec-
ondary schools employed 405 teachers, giving a student-teacher ratio of
26.5 to 1.
14.       Diploma level teachers for Forms I-IV are trained in a two-year
course at the Chang'ombe (Dar es Salaam) Teacher Training College. Courses
offered include training for technical subjects and domestic science. Total
1971 enrollment was 240. Graduate teachers are trained at the University
in three-year courses; recent total enrollments have averaged 600. The
entry to both diploma and graduate courses is the Higher School Certil'icate
and planned outputs of teachers are adequate to meet requirements to 1980.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
15.       The two secondary technical schools at Moshi and Ifundi provide
4-year post-primary courses with emphasis on engineering; the courses would
also lead to the School Certificate, thereby allowing students to pursue
higher education. The present enrollment is about 1,200 with the main devel-
opment at Moshi where additions are being made to provide for Forms V and VI
and leading to Higher School Certificate.
16.       Supported by the Vocational Training Act, 1972, trade training
is the responsibility of the MIinistry of Labor and Social Welfare which
has an agreement with UNDP to develop a National Industrial Training Pro-
gram incorporating an apprenticeship scheme. The project is being executed
by ILO with CIDA assistance and the first stage is scheduled to be completed
in March, 1973. The Canadian and UNDP contributions amount to $1.4 million
of which nearly $240,000 is for equipment and the remainder for expert as-
sistance and fellowships. A second stage, to include development of voca-
tional training centers at Tanga and Mwanza, is planned for execution during
January, 1973, to June, 1975. The Government has asked UiDP for US$479,000
for six experts and 24 fellowships and the Association has been asked to
provide the relevant physical facilities. CIDA may also supply experts.
The Vocational Training Center at Dar es Salaam has an output of 150 crafts-
men p.a. supported by a technical teacher training scheme designed to meet
the Program's future needs. Other training facilities with an output of
about 200 p.a. are being developed using improvised accommodation.



APPENDIX I
Page 4
17.       Numerous short specialized courses for managers are provided by
Government departments and industrial concerns. Considerable duplication of
effort is apparent and a master plan, taking into account manpower needs for
management training is urgently needed.
18.       The only institute for higher technical education in Tanzania is
the Dar es Salaam Technical College which operates full-time and part-time
day and evening courses mostly at technician level. A diploma course at
the professional level is being developed but would appear largely to du-
plicate the engineering course being developed at the University. Because
of very rapid phasing out of expatriates the College is short of expe-
rienced engineering staff. Enrollment in the 3 year full-time technician
course in 1971 was 420 and 13 were enrolled in the 3-year full-time diploma
course which follows the technician course. The Federal Republic of Germany
is assisting the development of a new technical college at Arusha to train
technicians in 4-year courses of which three years would be full-time in
the college and one-year in industry. There would be an intake of 120 stud-
ents p.a. with an output of 100 technicians yearly.
19.       Engineering training at the degree level takes place at the Uni-
versity of Nairobi or overseas but the Federal Republic of Germany is de-
veloping a Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dar es Salaam which
is expected to open in July, 1973. Intake to the 4-year course after com-
pleting Form VI will be 120 students per year.
Educational Radio
20.       Radio Tanzania broadcasts 12 hours of radio programs weekly for
primary schools and 10 hours for secondary schools. The language of in-
struction are Swahili for primary schools and English for secondary schools.
Subjects covered for secondary schools include English, history, civics, and
science. There is no national television service and none is planned for
the immediate future.
Higher Education
21.       In July, 1970, the three constituent colleges of the University
of East Africa became the three separate Universities of Makerere in Uganda,
Nairobi in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The University of Dar es
Salaam comprises Faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Science in Dar itself
and a Faculty of Agriculture at Morogoro some 120 miles away.  The University
also houses a Department of Education for the pre-service training of graduate
secondary school teachers and an Institute of Education which gives in-
service courses and works on curricula. Both degree and diploma courses
are offered; the total enrollment is about 1,600. In addition, nearly 500
Tanzanian students are enrolled in degree or diploma courses in Makerere
and Nairobi and a similar number in post-secondary courses overseas.



APPENDIX II
Page 1
HEALTLI EDUCATION
1.        Although their precise effect on economic growth is difficult to
measure, short life expectancy and a high incidence of illness in Tanzania
adversely affect the productivity of the labor force. In Tanzania, 41% of
the population is affected by tuberculosis of the lung. Child mortality is
high: one child in ten dies before reaching 5 years of age in the rural areas,
due co malnutrition, pneumonia or diarrhea. Infectious and parasitic dis-
eases, including malaria, affect two-thirds of the country's inhabitants.
2.        Prior to independence in 1961, health facilities in Tanzania con-
sisted of a few urban hospitals supplemented by a small number of scattered
health centers. This urban hospital-based system could not provide adequate
curative nor preventive services to the mass of the rural population.
3.        The Government's strategy is to develop an economical rural based
system organized around: (a) a Rural Health Center with 5 outlying dispen-
saries per 50,000 population, designed to cater for the entire health needs
of the family except those which can be provided only in hospital; and (b)
rural hospital at the regional and district levels, equipped to provide
major curative services. These facilities are complemented by health serv-
ices at the national level, provided in consultation hospitals in Dar es
Salaam, Moshi and lwanza and in three government hospitals specializing in
tuberculosis, mental disease and obstetrics respectively. By 1972, Tanzania
had surpassed its targets on a nationwide basis for dispensaries and for
rural hospital beds (1 per 1,000 population), although these facilities
were unevenly spread and were well below minimum targets in some districts.
However, the number of Rural Health Centers increased during 1969-1971 to
only 40% of the required number. Further development will be aimed at (a)
achieving the target for Rural Health Centers and (b) expanding rural fa-
cilities and dispensaries, as required for population growth and for equality
of distribution. Tanzania can meet all its targets for rural health facil-
ities within the next ten years, without having to increase the recent aver-
age rate of annual investment in this area. External aid will probably pro-
vide a substantial portion of investment requirements (up to 50%), as in the
past. To finance the additional recurrent costs of operating the system, the
Government has recently decided to increase its recurrent health budget by
at least 10% p.a. (compared with 5.7 p.a., 1970/71-1972/73). This would
raise the share of health in the total Government recurrent budget from 8%
in 1972/73 to approximately 9.5% by 1980.
4.        This strategy calls for medical auxiliaries to operate the coun-
try's health care facilities at all levels, under the overall supervision
of physicians. Key auxiliary personnel are Medical Assistants (MAs) and
Rural Medical Aides (RMAs) who operate, respectively, the rural health
centers and the dispensaries. Together with Assistant M4edical Officers, 1/
1/   An Assistant Medical Officer is an upgraded medical assistant.



APPENDIX II
Page 2
MAs also staff the hospitals substituting to a large extent for physicians.
A summary of Tanzania health education institutions is in Table 1.
5.        The supply of auxiliary personnel has not been adequate for the
proper staffing of Tanzania's health care facilities. However, in recent
years, the training of auxiliaries has expanded considerably; furthermore,
this training is expected to keep pace in the future with the country's
expanding network of facilities. The annual output of MAs and RMAs was
increased from 60 in 1965 to 150 in 1971 with the establishment of 3 new
schools. As a result of extensions to five existing schools, now under
way, and the construction of additional schools with German, Finnish and
Swedish aid, the combined yearly output of MAs and RMAs will gradually in-
crease to a level of 480 by 1978, which will be adequate to meet needed through
1985. The establishment of 5 new nurses' training schools will more than
double the annual output of nurses from 170 in 1966 to 500 in 1974; no
further expansion of nurse training capacity will be needed. Considerable
progress has also been made in augmenting the supply of other categories of
personnel, e.g., midwives, health officers, pharmacy assistants and laboratory
technicians. The supply of auxiliaries should be sufficient in most categories
to staff the country's Government and private facilities by the mid-1980's
(Annex 6).
6.        The role of the physician or Medical Officer (MO) is to manage the
health care system as a whole and to serve as supervisor, exemplary prac-
titioner and teacher for the cadre of auxiliaries. As leaders of Rural
Medical Teams, MOs manage the system from regional and district medical
headquarters and they direct the running of rural hospitals. A 140 is 4aso
needed to supervise each rural health center complex, i.e., to supervise
the administration of health care to about 10,000 families. To carry out
these functions about 950 1IOs will be needed by 1985 or one M0O per 25 aux-
iliaries. An additional 500 will be required to staff Dar-es-Salaam hospi-
tals, national consultation hospitals and the University MIedical Faculty,
as well as to direct the training of medical auxiliaries and allied staff
in over 60 schools and centers. A total of about 1,400 doctors in govern-
ment and private employment by the mid-1980's is the minimum number required
for the health care system to function satisfactorily. However this figure
cannot be attained and expatriate physicians cannot be replaced unless 1,300
new Tanzanian doctors become available for employment during 1972-1985.
7.        Medical Officers are the one category of personnel in which supply
is not keeping pace with development of the health system. At the end of
1971, there were in Tanzania about 480 doctors (1 per 27,000 inhabitants,
compared with 1 per 12,400 in Kenya, 1 per 14,000 in Zambia and 1 per 14,600
in Uganda in 1969), 320 of whom were expatriates. Over 500 were needed at
that time for rural services alone and consequently the health care given by
auxiliaries in rural areas suffered from a lack of professional guidance.
Doctors are presently trained in Dar es Salaam and in foreign medical facul-
ties (including Makerere, where no places will be available to admit
Tanzanians after 1977). The Dar es Salaam Faculty can admit only 35 students

per annum of whom about 30 graduate. The total supply of about 420 new MOs
in 1972-1985 from the Faculty falls short of estimated needs by some 880,
leaving unfilled 68% of the MO posts required by 1985. A deficit of this
kind would jeopardize the development of Tanzania's health care system.
Not only would MOs still be spread too thinly to give effective management
and technical guidance to the system, but the training of auxiliaries would
lack professional direction - resulting in lower quality personnel.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        The proposed project would include 49 man-years of technical as-
sistance and 35 man-years of external fellowships. The total cost is estim-
ated to be $1.91 million.
2.        The program would consist of the following:
Cost - US$ Equivalent
(a)  Faculty of Redicine                                   1,445,0G0
1)   Medical specialists (35 man-years),
to complement as necessary the assist-
ance available from other agencies, for
the development and adaption of instruc-
tional programs and teaching methodology
to local conditions, and the identification
of appropriate reference books and mat-
erials. The 35 man-years provided repre-
sent about 2 man-years in each of the
specialities within the three major com-
ponents of the teaching program, as follows:
follows:
(i) Basic Sciences, comprising anatomy-
histology, physiology, biochemistry, micro-
biology, pharmacology and pathology; (ii)
Clinical Medicine, comprising surgery-
opthalmology, otolaryngology, anaesthesiology,
medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, child-
health and pediatrics, and psychology; (iii)
Community Medicine, comprising community health,
epidemiology-biostatistics, behavioral sciences,
and parasitology-entomology.
However, the assistance would be deployed
flexibly in those areas requiring curricula
development or additional staff.
2)   Fellowships (35 man-years) for the training
of Tanzanian teachers for the medical
faculty.
(b)  Management Study                                         82,000
Management training specialists (2 man-years)
to assist in surveying and evaluating the scope
of on-going management training programs, identify-
ing the needs for further development of training,



APPENDIX III
Page 2
and drawing up a master plan for management educa-
ation to serve all sectors of the economy.
(c)  Project Unit                                           383,000
1)   Four architects (8 man-years)
2)   One civil engineer (2-1/2 man-years)
3)   One clerk of works (1-1/2 man-years)
3.        In view of potential technical assistance from bilateral and inter-
national agencies, the program would be flexible. Within the total amount
allocated to technical assistance and subject to IDA agreement, the length
of specialists' services could be varied as needs and circumstances may
warrant over the project period. Assurances should be obtained that tech-
nical assistance specialists would be employed upon terms and conditions
mutually satisfactory to the Borrower and the Association and that fellow-
ships would be awarded to appropriately qualified candidates.
