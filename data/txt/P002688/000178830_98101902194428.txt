INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent of US$10.3
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Education Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.        An economic mission visited Tanzania during August and September
1971. Volume I of the mission's main report (AE-26) together with annexes
was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 22, 1972 and June 22, 1972.
An updating mission visited Tanzania in August and September 1972 and its
report was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 11, 1972.
Basic data on the Tanzanian economy are given in Annex I.
3.        Tanzania celebrated its first decade of independence in December
1971. In the past eleven years gross national product increased in real
terms by some 65 percent to the present level of about $1.5 billion. During
the same period, life expectancy at birth increased from 35 to 41 years,
infant mortality declined from 250 to 160 per thousand live births, maternal
mortality declined from 4.7 to 2.7 per thousand deliveries, and the primary
school enrollment rate increased from about 28 to 37 percent of the relevant
age group. While this sample of economic and social indicators shows that
significant progress has been made, it also gives some idea of the magnitude
and difficulty of the development tasks facing the country. For example,
while GNP grew at 4.7 percent per annum in real terms during these years,
these gains were to a large extent offset by the growth of population and
with the result that per capita income increased at only 2.4 percent per
annum.
4.        Tanzania was one of the few African states to emerge with a
one-party system at the time of independence. The system has since
been consolidated, and the interests of political and economic leader-
ship have been brought together. In economic policy making the long
term objective of social equality prevails over economic interests of
minority groups, and some progress towards reducing inequality of income
distribution within the category of employed workers has been



-2-
made, but large gaps continue to exist between urban and rural standards
of living.
Economic Performance and Resource Mobilization
5.        Although short of the targets enunciated in the Second Five-
Year Plan (1969-74), Tanzania's effort to mobilize both domestic and
foreign resources has been impressive. The marginal national savings
rate was in fact as high as 50 percent in 1970 and 1971. However, the
absolute levels of savings (about 25 percent of GDP) were lower than
expected because the growth rate was lower. Recurrent revenues
(excluding profits from parastatal corpanies) amount to about 25 percent
of monetary GDP at market prices, and the overall rate of taxation is
one of the highest among developing countries of comparable economic
structure and per capita income level. In terms of current foreign aid
disbursements, the Peoples Republic of China is presently Tanzania's
principal donor, supplying about 75 percent of the net capital inflow
in 1971. In terms of outstanding commitments, however, the Bank Group
is the largest donor to Tanzania followed by Sweden, Norway and the
Soviet Union. Including Tanzania's notional one-third share of the
debt of the East African Community Corporations, the IBRD is presently
carrying 13.Q percent of Tanzania's total external debt and IDA 9.6
percent.  Most capital aid, to Tanzania is made available on very
favorable terms; about 50 percent of the total is tied to procurement
in the donor country. Supplier credits have been kept to minimum. The
overall debt service ratio is around 9 percent, which although quite
manageable is higher than projected because of a shortfall in exports.
In view of the poor market prospects of Tanzania's main export crops, it
is important that aid be kept as soft as possible so as not to over-
burden the balance of payments.
Current Constraints
6.        The investment rate has recently levelled off after reaching
a record high or nearly 33 percent of monetary GDP at market prices in
1971.  This is more than the country can sustain in the long run, but
the investment rate is expected to decline somewhat following the
completion of the Tanzanian portion of the Chinese financed Tanzania-
Zambia railway project near the middle of 1974. This project has
accounted for about one quarter of total investment in Tanzania in
recent years. The combination of exceptionally high investment rates
and lower than planned national savings gave rise to severe pressures
on resources, resulting in some price inflation between 1966-1967. In
addition, the balance of payments situation became very tight because
much of the investment required imported goods and equipment. These
pressures have now eased somewhat as a result of credit restrictions



-3-
and a temporary contraction of capital expenditures by Government
ministries. Even with the expected decline in the rate of investment
and recovery in national savings, Tanzania will require a continued
capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange component of high
priority projects; some foreign financing of local expenditures will
therefore be justified.
7.        The increased rate of investment has not been significantly
reflected in the growth of gross national product. This was mainly a
result of the heavy bias in these investments towards infrastructure.
As a consequence, the Government has decided to shift the emphasis of
its investment programns to more productive quick yielding investments,
particularly those which generate increased export earnings. The
effects of these new policies can already be seen, particularly in the
rural sector which will for the foreseeable future remain the mainstay
of the country's economy. Policies and programs designed to raise
agricultural production and provide the necessary institutional support
are being developed and implemented.
Rural Development
8.        To establish a viable framework under which essential services
can be economically delivered to a scattered rural population and con-
comitantly to reflect Tanzania's socialist ideals and organization in the
countryside, the Government is promoting and supporting the establishment
of cooperative or "ujamaat' villages. In such villages most or all of the
land is communally owned and production is organized on a communal basis.
Only the very basic infrastructural needs are provided by the Government,
and self-help and local initiative are the keys to the production success
of these cooperatives. Normally these villages have to function success-
fully for some years before they become eligible for registration as
cooperative societies and consequently for credit. About 15 percent of
the rural population is now concentrated in some 4,500 ujamaa villages,
but only about 200 of these have so far qualified for registration as
creditworthly cooperatives.
9.        The response to the ujamaa movement has not been uniform
throughout the country; progress has been particularly slow in areas
where small farmers are already engaged in the production of well
established cash crops and hence often do not feel the necessity to
change to a new and untried way of life. While the Government is
anxious to speed up the formation of ujamaa villages, it recognizes
that the movement will gain ground and be successful only if the
principle of voluntary association is preserved. The process of bring-
ing the bulk of Tanzania's rural population into ujamaa villages will
take a long time, and it is still too early to assess the full signi-
ficance of the movement for agricultural production. However, there are
indications that the program could in due course have a significant,
favorable impact on the rural sector.



-14-
10.       To make Government more responsive to the needs of rural deve-
lopment and better able to respond to local initiative, greater power
and responsibility for the formulation and execution of development
projects was recently given to regional and district authorities. The
Government expects that this important decentralization of its adminis-
trative structure will increase the country's absorptive capacity and
facilitate the shift in emphasis of public sector investment from social
and economic infrastructure to agriculture and rural development in
general. It is too early to assess the impact of decentralization, since
in the early stages difficulties in determining the most desirable
distribution of authority between the central Government and the regions
are bound to arise and the transfer of high ranking officials from
Dar es Salaam to the regions is inevitably at the expense of the smooth
functioning of the central Government. In the longer term, however,
considerable improvements in project identification, preparation and
implementation, should be possible as a result of this new structure.
Other Sectors
11.       While the rural, agricultural sector has to play a major role
in Tanzania's development, other sectors offer possibilities for a
broadening and diversification of the economic base. This is despite
a number of considerable disadvantages. Industrial growth, which was
until recently rapid, has slowed as the most obvious possibilities for
import substitutions are now nearing their limits. The small domestic
market severely limits the scope for further industrial expansion, and
the East African Comnon !iarket has not yet realized its potential.
Frequent duplication of new industrial ventures in East Africa continues,
and trade and currency restrictions between the three member countries
are tending to increase rather than decline. In light of these limiting
factors, the Tanzanian Government is placing increasing emphasis on
promoting small industries catering to the needs of the rural popula-
tion and on processing crops, such as cashew nuts, for export.   The
contribution of the transport sector to the economy is exp)ected to
increase significantly with the completion of the railway to Zambia and
the complementing Bank financed expansion of Dar es Salaam harbor.
Economlc activity along the railway line in both countries is also
expected to surge ahead following its completion. Tourism is another
sector with considerable potential, and the Governnment is presently
considering a ten-year plan for the development of this important
source of foreign exchange earnings.
Consultative Group
12.       A meeting on Tanzania of the Consultative Group for East Africa
was held in Paris from January 16-17, 1973.   The relatively slow growth



of agricultural production and the increased importation of capital goods
had caused severe pressure on resources, but temporary investment cutbacks
and credit restrictions had successfully overcome the resulting financial
pressures. The Group noted with satisfaction the Government's policy of
pursuing its development goals under conditions of financial stability
and its intention to maintain or increase domestic savings which are
already high in comparison with many developing countries. The Group
recognized that external aid inflows would have to increase substantially,
and that most if not all capital assistance would have to be made avail-
able on soft terms in order to avoid an excessive debt servicing burden
in the future.
Expropriations
13.       In pursuit of its development and social policies, Tanzania
has nationalized a number of enterprises, many of them foreign owned,
over the past six years. Between February 1967 and April 1971 banks,
insurance companies, sisal estates and industrial companies were
taken over by the state and satisfactory compensation arrangements have
been made or are expected to be concluded shortly with the former
owners. In April 1971 legislation (The Acquisition of Buildings Act)
was enacted empowering the President on behalf of the state to acquire
any rental or commercial property, the construction cost of which was
over 100,000 Tanzanian shillings ($14,000). About three thousand
properties were acquired under the Act. The Act provides for compensa-
tion and contains a formula which in general terms states that compensation
will be limited to the cost of construction of the building less ten
percent for each year the building has been owned. The Act, however,
provides for an Appeals Tribunal to which an owner of expropriated
property may appeal in respect of the acquisition of his building or
the amount of compensation. The Tribunal is authorized to restore
property to previous owners. Moreover, the President has power under
the Act to return the building or to pay compensation above that provided
for under the formula in the Act, and the Tribunal may make recommenda-
tions to the President on such additional compensation.   A committee has
also been established outside the Act to return properties to owners
who can prove that they have suffered hardship as a result of the
acquisition. Some five hundred and sixty claims and appeals have
been made and are being dealt with in the order they were lodged;
less than ten percent of these are on behalf of foreign owners. To
date about two thirds of the total have been dealt with under the



-6-
various review procedures; about ten foreign cases have been settled
so far, all in favor of the claimant. There remain about forty
foreign cases at various stages of the review procedure, none of
them having yet exnausted the local remedies available.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO TANZANIA
l4.       Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and I@C in 1962.   Beginning
with an IDA credit for education in 1963, it has so far received
eleven credits and three Bank loans amounting to $120.2 million.
In addition, Tanzania has been a beneficiary of 8 loans, totalling
$197.3 million which have been extended for the development of common
services operated on a regional basis by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda
through their association in the East African Community. The only
IFC investments in Tanzania to date, totalling $4.4 million, were made
in the Kilombero Sugar Companlr in 1960 and 1964. This comoany en-
countered financial difficulties, and in 1969 IFC and other investors
sold their interest in the company to the Government. Annex II contains
summary statements of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and IFC investments in
Tanzania and the East African Community organizations as of March 1973
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Our lending program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian
Government attaches to agricultural development is increasingly focus-
ing on directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to the
end of FY 72 ten out of fourteen loans and credits were for infrastrac-
ture. All but one of the Loans to the East African Community Organiza-
tions, of which Tanzania is a beneficiary, have been extended for
imorovements in transoortaticn and communications.   However, the approval
by the Executive Directors of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit
No. 217 TA) in October 197( opened a new phase in our lending. The
Smallholder Tea Development Project (Credit No. 287 TA) was approved
in March 1972; the forthcoming livestock project constitutes a major
development effort in this sector. A project to support the expansion
of Navy Bean production ancd processing is being examined and may be
presented for consideration by the Executive Directors later this year,
and a project for expanding cotton production was appraised in
February.   The GovTernment of Tanzania has received three IDA credits
for education totalling $12.9 million which have supported general
secondary education, the expansion of primary teacher training, and
technical and agricultural training. Although a few problems were
encountered, progress has been generally satisfactory.



-7-
16.       Our Permanent Mission in East Africa, which was involved
in the preparation of three of the above projects, is currently
assisting Tanzania in preparing a regional rural development project
and a cashew nut development project. Our capability to provide
such assistance has proved to be particularly valuable in a country
where project preparation capacity is and for some time will be
limited.  Tanzania is developing an institutional structure, stress-
ing greater regionalization and development of ujamaa villages,
designed to promote and respond to development initiatives. These
institutions are still in their formative stages, and related
organizational and staffing difficulties have sometimes resulted in
the project delays referred to in Annex II. Bank Group projects
supporting these institutions have reinforced their viability at
an early stage.
17.       In addition to our Tanzanian projects, we plan to continue
our support of East African Community projects. A loan of $26.5
million to the East African Harbours Corporation was approved by the
Executive Directors on November 21, 1972. A loan of $31 million to
the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has been
negotiated.
PART III - EDUCATION IN TANZtNIA
Education Strategy
18.       Tanzania's formal and non-formal education programs form a
nation-wide learning system geared to rural development within the
ujamaa community concept. The system is divided into 18 Regions and
64 Districts. The Regional and District Officers direct the operation
of public primary schools, while the Ministry of Education controls
secondary, technical, teacher training, and higher education. Non-
formal education for adults and for specific community needs is
flexible and directly reinforces community action. The objectives of
the Tanzanian education system as set forth in the 1967 Arusha
Declaration and subsequently confirmed are: a) to develop the knowledge
and skills of the labor force relevant to national economic growth;



-8-
b) to engender understanding and enthusiasm for communal participa-
tion in building a rural-oriented, socialist society with basic
necessities for all people; c) to stress the individualts role
within the family, the obligation of everyone to work, and the
self-reliance of each community; and d) to enhance both economic
growth and equality of income distribution by reducing the
difference between the real incomes of urban workers and the rural
masses. Tanzania has spEcific goals for skill sufficiency, uni-
versal primary education, and adult access to non-formal education.
These are discussed below.
19.       To date Tanzania's actual education developments have been
in accordance with its announced strategy, and the Government has a
good record of accomplishments in gearing secondary and higher education
to the manpower needs of the modern sector. Leadership and managerial
capacity at the local level are major bottlenecks and are points of
emphasis in the proposed project. Expansion of the education system is
better planned than in many developing countries. Under the Second Five-
Year Plan (1969/70 to 1973/74), 11 percent of the capital program was
earmarked for the Ministry of Education. Because of financial constraints
actual expenditures on education have fallen short of plan targets.
About 20 percent of the central Government's recurrent expenditures are
allocated to education; the share is expected to rise to 24 percent by
1984/85. This rise will be sufficient to meet the additional recurrent
burden of planned education investments in secondary and higher educa-
tion, and in teacher, technical, and vocational training as well as phased
development of the primary and rural learning systems.
Implementation of Education Strategy
20.       In spite of the shortfall, total expenditure on education in
1970/71 amounted to 4.5 percent of GDP, nearly all of which was
financed by public resources.   Total Government expenditure grew at the
rate of 16.5 percent per year during 1964/65 to 1970/71, while annual
outlays fcr education increased at the rate of 14.5 percent per year,
the slower growth due primarily to financial constraints on capital
expenditure. However, recurrent Government spending on education grew
rapidly and absorbed an increasing share of the Government's total
expenditure:  21 percent in 1970/71 compared with 17 percent in 1964.



-9-
Primary Education
21.       Primary education in Tanzania is a seven year system starting
at age seven. Swahili is the language of instruction, but English is
taught at each level. Fees vary by region and by grade; exception
based on need is allowed. Public primary school enrollment has
increased from nearly 500,000 to over 900,000 from 1961 to 1971. In
1971 about 37 percent of the primary school age group was attending
school (compared with 17 percent in Ethiopia, 44 percent in the Ivory
Coast, and 65 percent in Kenya) while grade I enrollment included about
48 percent of children aged seven.  There were about 4,500 primary
schools in Tanzania in 1971, of which 400 were private (enrolling nearly
30,000 students). Nearly 90 percent of those who enter primary school
terminate their formal education at some level of the primary school
system; the curriculum is designed for them ratiier than. for the iiinc-r-vt.-
who proceed to secondary school. Increasing emphasis is being given to
agriculture, home science, and simple craft work.
22.       The Government has set the goal of realizing universal primary
education (UPE) by 1989. However, financial constraints may prevent
achievement of this target, and the Government is studying ways of
reducing the costs.
General Secondary Education
23.       General secondary education consists of a four-year lower
secondary course followed by two years of pre-university education.
Secondary enrollment is determined by manpower needs; from 1961 to
1971 it tripled to over 32,600. In 1971 secondary enrollment was 1.9
percent of the 14 to 19 year age group, extending from 2.5 percent at
the lower level to 0.6 percent at the upper. Private secondary schools
in 1971 had one quarter of the total secondary school population; the
private share is increasing. No fees are charged in the public schools.
All secondary instruction is in English. Dropout and repetition rates
are negligible. After completing four years of secondary school,
pupils take the National School Certificate examination, and after six
years they take the NIational Higher School Certificate examination.
These examinations were first instituted in 1971, replacing the East
African examination which in turn had replaced the Cambridge University
examinations.
24.       Secondary school standards are reasonably good.   The curricula
in history, geography, and biology have been adapted to local needs.
Until recently practical subjects have not been stressed, but more
attention is now directed towards agriculture, commerce, craft training,
and home science. In 1967 only 15 percent of the teachers were
Tanzanians; by 1971 this percentage had risen to 60. Because of low
population density, nearly three-fourths of secondary students are
boarders; only in Dar es Salaam schools do day pupils outnumber boarders.



-10-
Day pupils require study facilities at the school since many homes lack
adequate facilities. Boarding students perform considerably better than
day students. Both the cost of boarding facilities and the low student-
teacher ratio (19:1) result in high unit costs for secondary schools.
Community Education Centers (CECs)
25.      In line with the Government's rural development strategy-
(paragraph 8 above) the Government is introducing a program of Community
Education Centers. These centers complement rural development activities
and emphasize the priorities given to ujamaa settlements. They are to
serve as primary schools and make available basic facilities for instruc-
ting adults in crafts, agriculture, work-oriented literacy, home science,
and health care. These multifunctional and non-formal education centers
will serve to integrate those bypassed by formal education programs.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
26.      Vocational training is the responsibi:Lity of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare. This Ministry is developing a National
Industrial Training Program including an apprenticeship scheme with the
ILO, UNDP, and the Canadian International Development Agency (C IDA).
At present, vocational training is provided in Dar es Salaam in a
center opened in 1968 with IUDP/ILO support.  This center has a 300
place capacity and an annual output of l10 craftsmen.  The National
Apprenticeship Scheme sponsored by the Ministry of Labor and small
training centers operated by religious groups and parastatal organiza-
tions have an annual output of about 200, marny of whom require further
training before they become proficient craftsmen. Government depart-
ments and industrial concerns provide short specialized courses for
managers and commercial workers.
27.      Two secondary technical schools provide four-year post-primary
programs with an engineering orientation and leading to the School
Certificate. Their combined enrollment is 1,200. The Dar es Salaam
Technical Coilege which has been assisted by the Second Education project
(Credit 149-TA) is at present the ornly institute for advanced technical
education in Tanzania. It offers both full-time and part-time day and
evening courses, most of th.em at the technician level; its 1971 enroll-
ment in the three year full-time technician course was 420. The College
is short of experienced teaching staff, partly because expatriate
teachers have been phased out rapidly.  The Government with assistance
from tuhe Federal Republic of Germany is establlshing a new technical
college at Arusha.  The college will offer a four-year program, three
years to be spent in college and one in industry. Planned intake is for
120 students per year, with an output of 100 technicians yearly.
28.      Tanzanian engineers at the university degree level currently
study either at the University of Nairobi or e:Lsewhere outside the
country. The Federal Republic of Germany is supporting a Faculty of



-11-
Engineering at the University of Dar es Salaam which is expected to open
in July 1973. Intake to the four-year course after completion of secondary
grade 6 will be 120 students per year.
Primary Teachers and Teacher Training
29.       In 1971 there were nearly 20,000 teachers in public primary
schools and about 500 in private schools. About 6,000 teachers were
qualified to teach upper primary grades, and 12,700 were qualified for
lower primary grade instruction; the remainder were unqualified.  With a
student/teacher ratio of 45:1, more teachers are needed. There is an
ample supply of candidates for primary teacher training courses. In 1971
there were 4,200 students in 21 Primary Teacher Training Colleges (PTTCs)
offering two-year pre-service training for primary teachers with an out-
put of 2,400. About 600 students were enrolled in a one-year "crash"
program which has not yet been evaluated. In-service courses for
practicing teachers are also offered. With increased emphasis on regional
development and autonomy, the Government plans one PTTC in each of the 18
regions. New PTTCs are now under construction or are being expanded, two
of which are being assisted by the Second Education Project (Credit 149-TA).
Secondary Teachers and Teacher Training
30.       In 1971 there were 1,706 secondary school teachers in public
secondary schools of whom 1,064 were Tanzanians. The student/teacher
ratio was low at 19:1, and the Government is reluctant to increase it in
view of the relative inexperience of Tanzanian teachers who are steadily
replacing expatriate teachers. Nevertheless, the low ratio is difficult
to justify in view of the financial constraints under which the country
is forced to operate. In 1971 private secondary schools employed 405
teachers, a large number of them expatriates. The student/teacher ratio
in these schools was higher than the public schools (26.5 to 1) because of
the more experienced and highly trained faculties.
31.       Diploma level teachers for secondary grades 1 through 4 are
trained in a two-year course at the Dar es Salaam Teacher Training College.
Courses offered include training for technical subjects and domestic
science. Total 1971 enrollment was 240. Graduate teachers are trained
at the University in three-year courses; recent total enrollments have
averaged 600. Planned outputs of teachers are adequate to meet require-
ments until 1980.
Higher Education
32.       The University of Dar es Salaam comprises Faculties of Arts, Law,
Medicine and Science, and Agriculture. The University Department of
Education annual-ly enrolls 600 students in a three-year degree course to
train secondary school teachers. An Institute of Education gives in-
service courses and develops curricula. Both degree and diploma courses



-12-
are offered; the total enrollment is about 1,600. Establishment of the
Faculty of Engineering mentioned above will assist industrial growth.
Health and Health Education
33.       Although their precise effects on economic growth are difficult
to measure, short life expectancy and a high incidence of illness in
Tanzania adversely affect the productivity of the labor force. In
Tanzania, 41 percent of the population is affected by tuberculosis of the
lung. Child mortality is high: one child in ten in rural areas dies of
malnutrition, pneumonia, or diarrhea before reaching 5 years of age.
Infectious and parasitic diseases, including malaria, affect two-thirds
of the population.
34.       The Government's strategy is to develop a rural based system
including rural health centers with satellite dispensaries, and rural
hospitals at the regional and district levels equipped to provide major
curative facilities. The facilities are complemented by health services
at the national level, provided in major hospitals at Dar es Salaam,
Moshi, and Mwanza, and in three Government hospitals specializing in
tuberculosis, mental disease, and obstetrics. Tanzania can meet all its
targets for rural health facilities within the next ten years without
having to increase the recent average rate of investment in health
services. To finance the additional recurrent costs of operating the
system, the Government has recently decided to increase its recurrent
health budget by at least 10 percent per year: a manageable increase.
35.       Tanzania's health strategy provides for medical auxiliaries to
operate the country's health care facilities at all levels, under the
general supervision of physicians. Key auxiliary personnel are Medical
Assistants (MAs) and Rural Medical Aides (RMAs) who operate, respectively,
the rural health centers and the dispensaries. Assistant Medical Officers
and Medical Assistants also staff the hospitals substituting to a large
extent for physicians. Although the supply of auxiliary personnel has
been inadequate, training has increased and is now expected to keep pace
with the country's expanding network of health care facilities.
36.       The role of the physician or Medical Officer (MC) is to manage
the health care system and to serve as supervisor, practitioner, and
teacher for the cadre of auxiliaries. About 950 MOs, or one per 25
auxiliaries will be needed by 1985. Another 5@0 will be required to
staff Dar es Salaam hospitals, national consultation hospitals, the
University Medical Faculty, and to direct training of medical auxiliaries
and allied staff in over 60 schools and centers. The health care system
will require about 1,400 doctors in Government and private employment by
the mid-1980's.  To reach this figure and to replace expatriate
physicians, 1,300 new Tanzanian doctors are needed for employment during
the period 1972-1985.



-13-
37.       Doctors are presently trained at the University of Dar es
Salaam and in foreign medical faculties (including Makerere where no
places will be available for Tanzanians after 1977). Experience has
shown that foreign medical training does not orient future physicians
towards the practice of social medicine in Tanzania's rural environ-
ment, and the Government plans to rely solely on the Dar es Salaam
Medical Faculty after 1975. However, the supply of Medical Officers
will not keep pace with the development of the health system unless
the medical faculty of Dar es Salaam is expanded from the present
intake of 35 students per year, of whom about 30 graduate. The total
supply of about 420 new MOs in 1972-1985 from the faculty falls short
of estimated needs by some 880, leaving unfilled 68 percent of the MO
posts required by 1985. The inadequate supply of medical doctors would-
result in ineffective direction of the system and deterioration of train-
ing standards at the next level of qualification.   In order to avoid
jeopardizing the entire health program, the Government proposes to
expand the Faculty of Medicine and to implement compensatory measures.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Fourth Education
Project in Tanzania" is being circulated separately. A Credit and
Project Summary are provided as Annex III of this report.
39.       This project was identified by a mission of the Overseas
Liaison Committee (OLC) of the American Council on Education, commissioned
by the Bank Group to analyze the education sector in Tanzania. The
Association discussed the OLC report of Novenxber 1971 with the Government
of Tanzania in January 1972.   The project was appraised in June and July
of 1972. Negotiations were held from February 1, 1973 to February 6,
1973. The Tanzanian delegation was led by Mr. E. K. Meena, Principal
Secretary in the Ministry of National Education.
40.       The proposed project would be the fourth IDA credit for
educaticn in Tanzania. It would develop education and training facili-
ties for children and adults in ujamaa villages, expand and improve pre-
service and in-service training of primary school teachers, expand
secondary and vocational education, and provide additional facilities
to train medical doctors.
Project Items
41.       General Secondary Schools. The proposed project includes three
general secondary schools. The output of graduates from these schools
would overcome a projected shortfall of secondary school graduates in the 1973
to 1985 period of about 3,000. The school would have a class size of 35
students, and a diversified curriculum with agriculture, commerce, crafts,



-14-
and home science options during the final two years. The project would
provide for 1,920 additional students, board 1,260 of them, and provide
housing for 72 staff members.
42.       Primary Teacher Training Colleges.   Two new colleges included
in the project will reduce a foreseen deficit; of 400 primary teachers per
year for the next 15 years. Annual output would be about 360 teachers.
The facilities include full boarding capacity and housing for about half
the teaching staff. The colleges are in the less developed southern area
of Tanzania and would serve as focal points for training teachers in
their regions, and for commercial activities connected with rural develop-
ment. The project would also increase the capacity of an existing
teacher training college at Bagamoyo from 120 to 360 students. The
Bagamoyo facility provides instruction to enable primary school teachers
to assume the responsibilities of community leadership in ujamaa villages
and permits trainees from remote areas to visit the capital and attend
lectures by national leaders. The project would provide for 240
additional places, all of which would be boarding places, and would provide
housing for 15 staff members.
43.       Vocational Training Centers (VTCs).   Two proposed centers at
Tanga and Mwanza would help alleviate the shortfall in the supply of
skilled workers and reinfcorce the Government's policy of decentralizing
industrial development. The new centers would each have a capacity of
300 trainees, an annual output of about 150 craftsmen, and would offer
ad hoc courses to meet special industrial needs. The project would
create places for 600 additional students.
4a.       Medical Facilities.   The project wculd provide teaching
facilities for a Rural Health Center in Bagamoyo and additional facilities
for the Faculty of Medicine at Muhimbili Hospital in Dar es Salaam.
The 2.cilities which would permit the annual output of physicians
to be increased from 30 to about 65 in line with government policy would
be geared to medical teaching and would include laboratories, workshops,
seminar rooms for an additional 145 students, boarding facilities for
l40, and 33 new staff housing units. The Muhimbili Hospital and the
Faculty of Medicine are presently managed by    separate       adminis-
trations. The Government agreed to put into effect an arrangement of
management structure acceptable to the Association for the effective coordl.na-
tion of the Muhimbili Hospital and its associated clinics with the
expanded Faculty of Medicine, as a teaching hospital.
45.       Community Education Centers (CECs).   The project would provide
for construction and equipment of eight CECs expected to be located
in developing ujamaa villages in the Dodoma region, with additional
student places for about 2,400.



46.       Technical Assistance.  The project would finance a total of 49
man-years of technical assistance and 35 man-years of fellowships for
staff development at the Faculty of Medicine, strengthening of the
project implementation unit, and identification of management training
needs and preparation of a national plan to develop management training.
h7.       Project Costs and Financing Plan.  The total project cost
is $14.6 million equivalent net of taxes. The $10.3 million credit
would finance 71 percent of total project cost. The proposed credit
would meet the estimated $5.9 million foreign exchange component and
$4.4 million (51 percent) of the local costs; the Government would
finance the remaining $4.3 million. The estimated capital costs of the
project institutions are reasonable compared with similar construction
costs in other African countries.
48.       Project Administration.  The project unit already established
in the Ministry of Education under the Second IDA education project
would be responsible for project implementation. To accommodate the
new work load the unit would be augmented by twelve man-years of technical
assistance. The project unit would organize, design, implement, and
supervise the project institutions and prepare contract documents, thereby
eliminating the use of consultants except for preparation of the manage-
ment training plan and design of the teaching facilities for extensions
to the Medical Faculty where specialist consultants would be employed.
A condition of effectiveness would be the appointment of a project
coordinator in consultation with the Association and the provision of
suitably equipped premises for the project unit. (See section 8.01
of the Development Credit Agreement.) Implementation would be completed
within five years of the effective date of the Credit Agreement.
Procurement Arrangements
O9.       Except for civil works and locally manufactured construction
materials at the CECs and VTCs, contracts for civil works, furniture
and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive biddirgin accordance with the Association's guidelines for
procurement. Construction work at the CECs and VTCs would not be
suitable for international competitive bidding due to their small size
and remote locations and the availability of voluntary labor at the
village level. For the CECs, construction work would be performed by
a mobile construction unit attached to the rural training center.
Imported construction materials, furniture and equipment would be procured
through international competitive bidding. Locally manufactured construc-
tion materials would be procured through local competitive bidding. Pre-
qualification procedures for civil works contracts would be acceptable
to the Association. All civil works contracts for the first and second
education projects were won by local contractors and this is likely to be
repeated. The bulk of instructional equipment would be procured abroad



-16-
and furniture locally. Contracts for books would be awarded in accordance
with the normal book procurement procedures of the Borrower. Items would
be grouped to the extent practicable to encourage competition and to
permit bulk procurement. Domestic manufacturers would be accorded a pre-
ferential margin of 15 percent,or the existing rate of import duties,
whichever is lower, above the C.I.F. price of competing importers.
Disbursements
50.       Disbursements would be made against the C.I.F. price of imported
construction materials, equipment and furniture; the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured equipment and furniture; 80 percent of total expendi-
tures for technical assistance and 65 percent of expenditures for civil
works and locally procured construction materials.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Develooment Credit Agreement between the Association
and the United Republic of Tanzania and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for education
projects.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply withthe
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. FROJECTS IN EXECUTION -1
There are currently nine projects under execution.
AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Credit No. 132-TA - Beef Ranching Development Project: $1.3 Million
Credit of October 31, 1968; Closing Date December 31, 1973
Initial management difficulties were overcome by replacing
managers with more experienced staff. Drought conditions brought high
cattle mortality on one ranch. A problem of low fixed meat prices was
alleviated by a substantial increase in 1972. The project is expected
to be fully disbursed by the scheduled closing date (December 1973).
This project has demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an
efficient beef industry in Tanzania.
Credit No. 217-TA - Tobacco Project: $9 Million Credit of October 9,
1970; Closing Date September 30, 1976
Implementation of this project is running behind schedule
because of slow farmer recruitment due to lack of clear directives by
the Government to regional officials regarding resettlement policy.
However, following Central Government intervention farmer recruitment
has shown signs of improvement and the project should now gain in-
creasing momentum. An IDA supervision mission which visited Tanzania
in October 1972 reviewed the project and accepted adjustments to the
design of village water systems and changes in the curing and grading
facilities in the new villages. The project is being kept under very
close supervision.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5 pages
Credit No. 287-TA - Smallholder Tea Project:   $10.8 Million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date December 31, 1976
This project became effective on July 26, 1972 and only $375,000
have so far been disbursed from the credit account. Because of delay
in the effectiveness of the credit, the project has commenced about six
months behind schedule.
On both these credits, a lack of understanding of IDA procure-
ment procedures by the Project Authorities has been the cause of consi-
derable delay. This matter was discussed recently with the Government
and it is proposed to send an IDA mission to Tanzania in the near future
to hold a seminar on procurement procedures for the benefit of concerned
staff.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 715-TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $30 Million Loan of
December 14, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 1976
This project has encountered four major problems: (i) price
escalation during the 1971 bidding process because of high interest
rates and because of new legislation during 1972; (ii) currency
parity rate adjustments which have increased costs; (iii) unfavorable
rock conditions encountered during underground escavations causing cost
increases and the possibility of serious delay; and (iv) vacancy in the
top management position for the entire year in 1972. All these problems
have contributed towards possibility of serious delay and cost increases
which may be one-third higher than the original estimate.   The Govern-
ment is now considering a request jointly to the Bank and a bilateral
source for supplementary finance in 1976.
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Credit Nos. 48-TA/115-TA - First Highway Project: $14 Million Credit of
February 5, 1964 and Supplementary Credit of $3 Million of March 21, 1968;
Original Closing Date December 31, 1971; Revised Closing Date June 30, 1973
Engineering and construction work on this project has been
completed, but arbitration proceedings in respect of a contractor's
claim ended only in June 1972. The Government has accepted the award
and U$450,ooo remains in the credit account for disbursement against
payments to be made in respect of arbitration awards.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5 pages
Loan No. 586-TA and Credit No. 142-TA - Second Highway Project: $7
Million Loan and $15.5 MiJllion Credit of February 24, 1969; Original
Closing Date December 31, 1972; Revised Closing Date December 31, 1973
Construction work on this project has also been completed, but
outstanding claims by both contractors and consultants are substantial.
To enable the Government to settle these claims, the Closing Date of the
Loan has been postponed to December 31, 1973.
Credit No. 265-TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 Million Credit of
August 6, 1971; Closing Date December 31, 1974
The project consists of (i) improvement of paved standard
of the existing Mtwara-Masasi road (200 km),  (ii) betterment of 475 km
of agricultural feeder roads in the Geita district and in the Mara
region by two departmental units to be established, (iii) pre-invest-
ment studies for the project roads and another 250 km of high priority
roads, and (iv) continuation of the staffing and training program
initiated under the first highway project.
Due to delays in completing contracts with consultants and
finalizaing tender documents, commencement of construction work has
fallen about one year behind schedule. The consultant's contracts are
now being finalized.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149-TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 Million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date September 30, 1973
A shortage of counterpart funds in FY 72 for scheduled
construction of about five project institutions was a main cause of
the project falling 12-18 months behind schedule. Contracts for 24
of the 28 project institutions have been awarded with construction
completed on 16 of the institutions; construction on the remaining
four is expected to start by July 1973. The project will likely be
completed with a total 24 month delay beyond the original schedule.
Credit No. 232-TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 Million Credit of
February 5, 1971; Closing Date June 30, 1975
This project is about 12 months behind schedule because of
site access problems in the areas near the Northwestern border, technical
services bottleneck now resolved, and technical assistance recruitment
difficulties. The project will probably be completed 12 months behind
schedule.
