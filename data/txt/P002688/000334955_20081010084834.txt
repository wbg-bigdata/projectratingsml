               This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Fourth Educa-
tion Project i n Tanzania f o r which an IDA Credit of USS10.3 million equiva-
l e n t was approved i n March 1973.  The Credit was closed i n December 1980,
18 months l a t e r than anticipated and an undisbursed balance of US$100,000
was cancelled.

               The report has been prepared by the Eastern Africa Projects
Department on the basis of a UNESCO mission which visited Tanzania i n
April/May 1981 and a desk review.

               The draft Project Completion Report was sent t o the Borrower
on October 5, 1982, and comments received i n January 1983 were taken into
account by the Region i n revising the PCR.     The Borrower's comments a r e
reproduced as Attachment I.

               The Operations Evaluation Department did not undertake an audit
of t h i s project.

                             TANZANIA FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
                                          (CREDIT 371-TA)



                                            HIGHLIGHTS


                 The Credit Agreement f o r the Tanzania Fourth Education Project
(Credit 371-TA) signed on April 13, 1973, provided for a credit of USS10.3
million equivalent t o (a) expand lower secondary education enrollment; (b)
increase the number of primary school teachers a s well a s upgrade t h e i r
qualifications, particularly i n mathematics and science; (c) r a i s e the out-
put of s k i l l e d craftsmen for industry; (d) add t o the supply of doctors and
provide supplementary training i n r u r a l health a c t i v i t i e s ; (e) establish
community education centers f o r primary and adult education i n r u r a l areas;
and ( f ) improve the country's management training system.               During implemen-
tation, the project was modified a s follows: (a) three general secondary
schools were deleted because of cost overruns resulting from implementation
delays and higher than expected inflation and (b) the original project
closing date of June 30, 1978 was extended t o December 31, 1980.

                 The Fourth Education Project was the f i r s t t o require a substan-
t i a l Project Implementation Unit (PIU).              The P1U's effectiveness was i n i t i a l l y
slowed by the delay i n the provision of b i l a t e r a l technical assistance and
the lack of preparation of some project components a s well as by t h e i r vari-
ety and geographic dispersion.                However, a s the PIU gained experience, its
performance improved, especially i n l i g h t of such unforeseen constraints
a s high inflation and the Ugandan war.               I n terms of quantitative outcomes,
with the exception of the Community Education Centers (CECs) and the in-
service primary teacher training program, the r e s u l t s of the project were
positive.      The qualitative performance of the project has been l e s s good,
particularly with regard t o the CECs, the Colleges of National Education
(CNE) and the Vocational Training Centers (VTC) because, i n t e r      -alia
                                                                              -9    of
insufficient and inappropriate equipment, lack of maintenance, and delays
i n the start-up of operations of some institutions.                The health education
part of the project appears t o be operating relatively successfully and the
study of management training resulted i n improving the rationalization of
t h i s system.     With regard t o the Bank's performance, supervision missions
tended t o be too short, inappropriately staffed, and attempted t o monitor
too many project items without adequate s i t e inspection.

                 Other points of special i n t e r e s t a r e a s follows:

       (a)       lack of coordination between program development and the prepa-
                 ration of equipment lists f o r the CNEs and the VTCs (para. 4.21);

       (b)       d i f f i c u l t y of ensuring sufficient recurrent funding t o purchase
                 raw materials f o r the workshops i n the CECs (para. 6.37); and

       (c>       the success of the Bagamoyo Rural Health Center i n integrating
                 practical r u r a l concerns i n t o formal health training (para. 6.54).


                        I - SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


Project Objectives


1.01    The principal objectives of the Project included: (i) the expansion
of lower secondary education for the achievement of self-sufficiency in
high and middle-level manpower needs in most areas by the mid-1980s; (ii)
an increase in the production of primary school teachers in view of the
objective of universal primary education; (iii) an in-service training
program for the qualitative improvement of primary teachers, particularly
in the fields of mathematics and science; (iv) an increased output of
skilled craftsmen to meet the growing needs of industry; (v) an expanded
supply of doctors and their supplementary training in rural health
activities; (vi) the establishment of community education centers on an
experimental basis to provide both primary and adult education to improve
the social-economic viability of the cooperative (Ujamaa) villages; and
(vii) a study to rationalize the management training system.

Project Content

1.02    The Project as appraised consisted of the design, construction,
furnishing and equipping of three general secondary schools, two
pre-service primary teacher training colleges, two vocational training
centers and eight community education centers. The Project also included
the extension and supplementary furnishing and equipping of one in-service
primary teacher training college, the Faculty of Medicine of the University
of Dar es Salaam and the rural health center in Bagamoyo. Operational
expenses for and supplementary furnishing and equipping of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) were funded by the Project as were a total of
about 49 man-years of technical assistance and 35 man-years of fellowships.
In addition, a study of management training was to be carried out.
However, during implementation the Project was modified as follows:

        (i) the three general secondary schools were dropped from the
Project due to cost overruns as a result of implementation delays and
higher than expected inflation; and

       (ii) the original Project Closing Date of June 30, 1978 was extended
to December 31, 1980.

Project Implementation

1.03   The Fourth Education Project was the first to require a substantial
PIU. The development of this unit, especially the provision of substantial
technical assistance from a bilateral donor, did not occur until several
months after Credit effectiveness and even then did not become productive
immediately. However, the PIU became in time an effective and efficient
organization and was assigned by Government to implement additional

projects, including those funded by other donors.                              Implementation of t h e
Fourth Education Project, however, suffered delays t h a t were never
recovered.          I n addition, project preparation was not a s advanced i n some
areas a t appraisal a s it should have been; i n one case, the s p e c i f i c a t i o n
of schedu'ss of accommodation was not completed u n t i l months a f t e r effec-
tiveness.          Project implementation a l s o suffered from t h e f a c t t h a t com-
ponents were of such v a r i e t y and so geographically dispersed.                             However,
given t h e commitment of Government and t h e Bank t o equity considerations
and r u r a l development, t h i s dispersion w a s probably i n e v i t a b l e and w a s
handled i n most cases with increasing effectiveness as t h e PIU gained
experience.

1.04           The cost of the Project a t a p p r a i s a l was estimated a t US$ 14.6
million.          Actual c o s t s were USS14.2 million o r about 2% lower than t h e
appraisal estimate although t h e c o s t i n Tanzania S h i l l i n g s (T.Shs.) was
13%above appraisal due t o t h e appreciation of t h e US$.

1.05           Design and construction of project components was s a t i s f a c t o r y i n
general, t h e exceptions being t h e Muhumbili Hospital and some of t h e Com-
munity Education Centers (CECs).                     I n i t i a l design defects i n t h e school
f u r n i t u r e provided t o t h e CECs were l a r g e l y overcome f o r other components
such a s t h e Colleges of National Education (CNEs).                           The equipment provided
t o t h e CNEs and t h e Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) was i n s u f f i c i e n t
and i n some cases inappropriate, hampering t h e implementation of instruc-
t i o n a l programs.       To overcome these deficiencies, more equipment was
provided under the Sixth and Seventh Education Projects.                              Technical assis-
tance t o t h e health education component was s u b s t a n t i a l l y reduced although
t h i s did not a f f e c t the r e l a t i v e l y s a t i s f a c t o r y outcome of t h i s project
component.


Project Operating Outcome

1.06           I n terms of t h e objectives and project content, a s s t a t e d i n t h e
appraisal report and the Credit agreement a s compared t o a c t u a l outcomes,
the project cannot be termed a complete success.                             Design of some components
was inappropriate, technical a s s i s t a n c e provided by a b i l a t e r a l donor was
slow i n becoming e f f e c t i v e , t h e PIU could have used more building inspec-
t o r s and equipment lists were i n somecases not provided when needed.                               I n
addition, a lack of coordination existed between equipment provision and
construction and Bank supervision missions were o f t e n too s h o r t , inap-
propriately s t a f f e d , and t r i e d t o supervise too many project components
without s u f f i c i e n t a t t e n t i o n t o s i t e inspection.        However, given t h e com-
plexity of t h e p r o j e c t , t h e heavy workload imposed upon t h e PIU a s well
a s unforeseen and unavoidable c o n s t r a i n t s (especially high i n f l a t i o n and
t h e Ugandan war), it is probably remarkable t h a t t h e project outcome has
been s a t i s f a c t o r y i n many instances.            The ultimate impact of t h e project
cannot be assessed properly a t t h i s point.                       To date, t h e r e s u l t s may be
termed p o s i t i v e i n terms of q u a n t i t a t i v e outcomes with t h e exception of t h e
CECs and t h e in-service primary teacher t r a i n i n g program (Bagamoyo).                         F i n a l
evaluation of q u a l i t a t i v e outcomes would be premature a t t h i s time a s t h e

d e f i c i e n c i e s presented concerning t h e CECs, CNEs and VTCs have not yet been
overcome.            F i n a l l y , it would appear t h a t t h e r e s u l t s of t h e management
study have already been unusually successful.

4.15           The provision of t h r e e new secondary schools i n order t o increase
t h e output of Form I V graduates was cancelled due t o project c o s t escala-
t i o n , a s well a s t o t h e a n t i c i p a t i o n t h a t other sources of financing could
be found f o r t h i s type of project.

1.08           The two new CNEs have been operational f o r t h r e e years.                     However,
due t o s t a f f shortages and t h e l a c k of appropriate equipment, t h e colleges
have been unable t o o f f e r t h e prescribed program of s t u d i e s , o r t o promote
a genuinely a c t i v e teaching-learning process.                        On t h e other hand, I n t e r n a l
e f f i c i e n c y and e x t e r n a l productivity i n terms of q u a n t i t a t i v e outprut and
subsequent employment, a r e s a t i s f a c t o r y .

1.09           The upgrading of primary school teachers i n t h e f i e l d s of mathe-
matics and science a t t h e Bagamoyo CNE was not implemented when t h e UNESCO
mission v i s i t e d Tanzania.             Thus, t h e science l a b o r a t o r i e s and equipment had
not been used.                By agreement between t h e Government and t h e Bank, these
courses were t o commence i n 1981182.                       Although t h e location of t h e program
a t Bagamoyo was considered advantageous a t t h e time of a p p r a i s a l , a recent
Government report s t a t e s t h e contrary, a t l e a s t i n terms of t h e on-going
courses i n educational management.

1.10           A s with t h e CNEs, t h e i n t e r n a l e f f i c i e n c y and external productivity
of t h e two new VTCs have been s a t i s f a c t o r y and contributed s u b s t a n t i a l l y
t o t h e n a t i o n a l output of s k i l l e d labor.         On t h e o t h e r hand, i n s u f f i c i e n t ,
and i n some cases, inappropriate equipment has hampered t h e implementation
of t h e i n s t r u c t i o n a l program a s i n t h e case of t h e CNEs.

1.11           The experimental program i n formal and non-formal education through
t h e CECs has only been p a r t i a l l y successful t o date.                    The programs of adult
education have not been conducted a s planned i n some of t h e four opera-
t i o n a l CECs.        I n t h i s connection, four of t h e CECs have yet t o become
operational.             Furthermore, t h e r e a r e s e r i o u s maintenance problems a t the
CECs.         The l o c a t i n g of a l l e i g h t of t h e CECs i n one p a r t i c u l a r region of
t h e country was questionable given t h e experimental nature of t h e program.
This would be i n contradiction with paragraph 1.03 above ( t h e problem of
geographical dispersion) unless some of t h e CECs had been located c l o s e t o
other f a i r l y a c c e s s i b l e project items t o f a c i l i t a t e supervisory coverage.
I n any case, it appears t h a t t h e Government i n s i s t e d upon l o c a t i n g a l l t h e
CECs i n t h e Dodoma region.               F i n a l l y , it should be recognized t h a t t h e c o s t s
involved i n t h i s item p r o h i b i t its generalization.

1.12          The h e a l t h education element appears t o be operating r e l a t i v e l y
successfully although t h e non-completion of t h e two operating t h e a t r e s a t
t h e Muhumbili Hospital has reduced t h e e f f e c t i v e n e s s of t h e i n s t r u c t i o n a l

program. Perhaps more important, it is reported that the conduit of elec-
trical wires has not been properly installed and may jeopardize the reli-
able functioning of instruments and equipment.

1.13    The improvement of the management training system as a result of
the recommendations of the management training study appears to have been
achieved. Thus, the component is considered to be very successful in
meeting the objective of the rationalization of the system.

Recommendations

1.14    Government should closely monitor the utilization of science
laboratories and equipment at the Bagamoyo CNE and the problems of staff
shortages and lack of appropriate equipment at the two new CNEs and, in
the case of equipment, at the VTCs.

1.15    The CECs have clearly failed as a general solution to formal and
non-formal education because, inter alia, of high costs but other experi-
ments should be tried in this area as the need remains. It appears thus
far that the self-help aspect of the CECs has not been successful either
with regard to construction or maintenance; the reasons for this should be
evaluated and appropriate action taken especially with regard to urgent
maintenance problems.

1.16    The deficiencies in the operating theatres of the Muhambili hospi-
tal, especially the electrical services, should be examined as soon as
possible so that remedial action can be taken.

Lessons Learned

1.17    Project preparation was in some instances not well advanced at
appraisal suggesting that in the future appraisal should exclude items not
well prepared if there is a risk that preparation will not be accelerated
early in project implementation.

1.18   The project required a significant strengthening of the PIU which
was largely beyond the control of the Bank or Government since expatriate
technical assistance was provided by a bilateral source. The Bank might
have anticipated such a problem and taken a more aggressive approach to
resolving it during project preparation.

1.19    In addition, the PIU suffered from its low administrative position;
while it is a sensitive point, the Bank might have been more persuasive in
its efforts to convince Government that the PIU should have been given the
equivalent of departmental status due to its heavy responsibilities in
project planning and implementation.

1.20    While the PIU has in most cases performed well, especially with
regard to the hardware components of the project, it has been less success-
ful with software; additional assistance is needed especially in the
evaluation, procurement, and installation of equipment and furniture.


                              I1 - INTRODUCTION


2.01    This com~letionreport is based on the findings of a UNESCO mission
which visited Tanzania in ~~ril/May1981 with the final report prepared in
November 1981. The mission attempted to determine how the project was
executed as compared with appraisal estimates and to analyze the impact
on education and manpower development of project institutions. The
methodology employed by the UNESCO mission included an analysis of World
Bank and Government reports and correspondence, interviews with Government
and Bank personnel and visits to all project sites. The UNESCO report was
completed by a desk study of the project by Bank staff. This report repre-
sents the views of the World Bank.


                         111 - PROJECT BACKGROUND


Socio-Economic Characteristics

3.01    Tanzania has a land area of 965,100 sq.km., some 18 million people
(1980) and a population of about 19 inhabitants per sq.km.  (Kenya +/- 19,
Uganda +/- 51).  Most Tanzanians live on family smallholdings in Ujamaa
villages in rural areas with only 13 per cent living in urban areas. The
population growth rate is 3.4% per annum and the GNP per capita was
estimated at US$260 in 1980. Life expectancy averages 50 years and about
46% of the population is less than 15 years of age. Kiswahili is the
national language and the medium of instruction in the primary schools.
English is the medium in the secondary schools.

3.02    Some 90% of the total labor force works in agriculture, most in
subsistence farming. About 10% of the total labor force is in the slowly
growing wage employment sector; over two-thirds of the primary school
leavers every year must seek a livelihood in the rural sector. On the
other hand, there is a shortage of local skilled manpower.  In 1969 when a
comprehensive survey was carried out, Tanzanian citizens occupied only 34%
of the posts requiring university or equivalent education and 85% of those
requiring secondary education.

3.03    Agriculture, the main source of income and foreign exchange earn-
ings, contributes 54% of Tanzania's GDP and 69% of its commodity exports.
Manufacturing, mining, construction, transport and communications together
account for 19% of GDP while public utilities, commerce, finance, govern-
ment and other services account for 27%. Efforts to promote manufacturing

have not a s yet yielded s i g n i f i c a n t r e s u l t s ; growth of t h e economy depends
heavily upon agriculture.

Development Strategy

3.04          The Arusha Declaration of 1967 defines t h e broad aims of Tanzanian
development:           t o c r e a t e a s o c i a l i s t economy and s o c i e t y devoid of t r i b a l
privilege and economic exploitation and t o achieve rapid economic growth i n
order t o improve the material and s o c i a l well-being of t h e mass of t h e
population.          Foundations f o r socialism and f o r economic growth a r e t o be
established i n t h e r u r a l s e c t o r and s t r i c t p r i o r i t y is t o be given t o r u r a l
development.           The s t r a t e g y f o r achieving these aims c a l l s for: ( a ) reduc-
t i o n of i n e q u a l i t i e s i n t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n of income; ( b ) public ownership
and control of a l l major companies and firms; ( c ) modernization of agricul-
t u r e and reduction i n t h e s i z e of t h e subsistence sector; and (d) growth of
manufacturing mainly t o support r u r a l development.

3.05         I n conjunction with o t h e r measures, a more equitable d i s t r i b u t i o n
of income i s being sought through wage and p r i c e controls and by heavy
taxes on higher income groups.                       The Government now owns o r controls nearly
a l l important enterprises.                  P r i v a t e investment has declined sharply and
many foreigners, a s u b s t a n t i a l number of whom were managers, have l e f t t h e
country.       A s a r e s u l t , t h e shortage of managerial personnel f o r t h e public
and p a r a s t a t a l s e c t o r s has been aggravated.

3.06         Reorganization of t h e r u r a l s e c t o r on a cooperative basis is
progressing; inhabitants of dispersed hamlets a r e moving i n t o Ujamaa v i l -
lages, forming multipurpose a g r i c u l t u r a l cooperatives which would advance,
a f t e r a period of Government assistance, t o f i n a n c i a l self-sufficiency.                      It
i s reported that the number of Ujamaa villagers has now increased t o 13
million, o r about 90% of Tanzania's                        e n t i r e r u r a l population. An array of
learning services, e.g..                a g r i c u l t u r a l extension, community development,
adult l i t e r a c y , c r a f t , health and n u t r i t i o n t r a i n i n g , has been extended t o
improve t h e villager's             s k i l l s and c a p a b i l i t y f o r earning h i s livelihood and
t o enable t h e primary school leaver t o c r e a t e opportunities f o r
self-employment          -    i n s h o r t , t o develop r u r a l "self-reliance".

3.07        Development planning provides f o r d i r e c t i n g i n d u s t r i a l investments
t o designated growth centers i n t h e i n t e r i o r , which a r e t o a c t a s c a t a l y s t s
f o r r u r a l development by generating demand f o r r u r a l goods, employing l a b o r
from adjacent areas, processing l o c a l products and supplying consumer goods
t o l o c a l populations and some material inputs f o r agriculture.                           New invest-
ment i n manufacturing has r i s e n s u b s t a n t i a l l y and much of it has been
directed t o Mwanza, Tanga, Moshi and Arusha, which have become major
regional growth centers.                  However, t h e shortage of s k i l l e d labor continues
t o be a constraint of t h e growth of manufacturing output.

The System of Education

3.08           The emphasis of t h i s d e s c r i p t i o n of t h e system is upon t h e types
and l e v e l s of formal and non-formal education and t r a i n i n g pertinent t o
t h e Fourth Education Project.             Aspects of primary, secondary and primary
teacher education a r e b r i e f l y covered, followed by vocational t r a i n i n g and
a d u l t education i n t h e Community Education Centers (CECs).

3.09           The general education system c o n s i s t s of seven years of primary
education (Standards I-VII),            four years of lower secondary (Forms I-IV),
and two years of upper secondary (Forms V-VI).                             After t h e primary l e v e l ,
t h e r e a r e various types of t e c h n i c a l and teacher t r a i n i n g courses.                  The
s t r u c t u r e of t h e system is presented i n Annex 1.

3.10           Comparative enrollment d a t a i n d i c a t e t h e rapid expansion of primary
education due t o t h e policy t o reach universal primary education as soon a s
possible (Annex 2).            I n 1980, primary school enrollment w a s reported a s
3,367,674 which represents a gross enrollment r a t i o of t h e 7-13 old
age-group of 96.5% and a net r a t i o of 70.7%.                       A t t h e secondary l e v e l ,
enrollments grew rapidly i n t h e public schools between 1961 and 1975 but
stagnated t h e r e a f t e r due t o f i n a n c i a l c o n s t r a i n t s , p a r t i a l l y because of t h e
c o s t l y student boarding t r a d i t i o n .    Due t o s o c i a l demand, t h e s l a c k w a s
taken up by t h e increase of p r i v a t e schools.

3.11          The time-table of t h e primary school is reported t o remain 'over 40
periods per week, but under t h e consolidation of education programs, it is
envisaged t h a t t h i s w i l l soon be reduced (Annex 3).                      This is important i n
terms of t h e time-tables of t h e colleges of n a t i o n a l education (CNEs:
primary teacher t r a i n i n g colleges) which a r e a l s o over-loaded.                          According
t o Ministry of National Education (MNE) o f f i c i a l s , u n t i l t h e former
time-table is reduced, those of t h e CNEs must remain as they a r e (Annexes 4
and 5).

3.12        I n 1980/81, t h e t o t a l number of primary school teachers was 81,266
including 22,922 (28%) student-teachers t r a i n i n g on-the-job                  under t h e
Distant Learning Program (DLP).                These student-teachers a r e primary school
graduates who enter i n t o teaching without any professional tLaining.                            After
t h r e e years(1) of in-service t r a i n i n g while teaching part-time,               t h e stu-
dent-teachers qualify a s Grade IIIc teachers.                     It is reported that about
24% of t h e 1980/81 t o t a l teaching s t a f f were graduates of Form I V o r above
with professional training.

3.13        Currently there a r e two pre-service programs f o r the t r a i n i n g of
primary school teachers.           The Grade I I I a course e n t r a n t s a r e Form I V
graduates who, a s of 1981, receive two years of t r a i n i n g instead of one.
The Grade I I I c course e n t r a n t s a r e primary school graduates receiving t h r e e
years of t r a i n i n g instead of two, a l s o a s of 1981.

3.14        There are 36 CNEs with one (Bagamoyo) devoted e n t i r e l y t o
in-service training.           The o t h e r s have provided pre-service education f o r
Grade I I I a o r Grade I I I c students, o r both.            I n addition, some CNEs offered
in-service t r a i n i n g courses.      Under a reorganization plan, t h e number of
pre-service CNEs w i l l be reduced s i n c e 12 of t h e largely c-type CNEs a r e t o
be converted i n t o full-time in-service t r a i n i n g i n s t i t u t i o n s .    This would
seem t o imply an increase of participants i n the DLP with a decrease i n the
annual production of IIIa and I I I c teachers, p a r t i c u l a r l y since each of t h e
latter courses has been lengthened by one year.                        I f the plan is c a r r i e d
out, the need f o r new pre-service CNEs would appear t o be necessary.

3.15        Enrollments i n t h e t h i r t y - f i v e CNEs t o t a l l e d 11,357 i n 1980/81 of
whom 10,490 were being trained as primary school teachers with t h e remain-
ing being prepared as teachers f o r t h e lower secondary l e v e l o r f o r home
economics.       Enrollment s t a t i s t i c s are confused by t h e f a c t t h a t t h e dura-
t i o n s of t h e Grades I I I c and I I I a courses have recently been lengthened t o
t h r e e and two years, respectively, and t h a t t h e school years of t h e two
courses are not concurrent ( I I I c : January-November;                    IIIa: July t o May of
t h e following year).

3.16        Enrollments i n May 1981 f o r t h e two project pre-service CNEs,
Mtwara and Tukuyu, were 316 and 431 respectively, i n both a-and c-type
courses.       Enrollments at both CNEs a r e l i k e l y t o reach planned capacity
(480 student places) i n t h e near f u t u r e since a t h i r d year of residence has
been added t o t h e former two-year Grade c course, and a second year t o t h e
previously one-year Grade a course.                   This is l i k e l y t o lead t o a shortage
of teaching f a c i l i t i e s unless t h e r o t a t i o n scheduling system is introduced
and a maximum use of specialized f a c i l i t i e s f o r general courses is
included.




1. In the third year, the student-teachers spend s i x weeks i n residence at
a CNE.

3.17    The National Vocational Training Scheme operates under the close
collaboration of Vocational Training Centers (VTCs) and the industrial
sector. This was formalized in 1974 with the adoption of the National
Vocational Training Act establishing the National Vocational Training
Council which includes representatives of employers, employees and the
Government.

3.18    Vocational training operates under the responsibility of the Divi-
sion of Vocational Training (DVT) of the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare. Vocational training consists of basic training of one year fol-
lowed by three years of in-plant training under an apprenticeship contract.
Trainees sit for trade tests after (a) the first year of in-plant training
(Grade 111), (b) the second year (Grade 11), and (c) the third year (Grade
I).   In addition, on-the-job trainees without an appreticenship contract
can prepare for the trade tests by attending evening classes in the VTCs.
There are three VTCs, one at Dar-es-Salaam and the two project centers
located at Mwanza and Tanga. Enrollments are given in Annex 6.

3.19    An interesting pilot project component consists of eight CECs
established in the Dodoma region. The underlying principle is to make the
CECs the focal point of a Ujamaa village(2) thus integrating formal and
non-formal education programs as well as providing basic services such as
health, community development, agriculture and administrative services.

3.20     In terms of formal education, the CECs offer primary education
(Standards I-VII) with a program similar to those of other primary schools
but with more emphasis upon vocationally-oriented activities in the areas
of agriculture, carpentry, masonry, tinsmithery and handicrafts. The
non-formal adult education program includes the above areas of ski1.ltrain-
ing as well as literacy courses. Enrollments in the four completed CECs
are given in Annex 7.

3.21    The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Dar-es-Salaam began
medical training in 1969 using the clinical facilities at Muhumbuli Hospi-
tal and classrooms previously used by the Medical Assistants School. The
intake of medical students for the five year M.D. degree was 30-35 annually
which was insufficient for the country's needs especially since the train-
ing of doctors abroad was often unsuccessful and inappropriate. Govern-
ment's decision to double the output of doctors from the Faculty of
Medicine was justified but required more adequate facilities for clinical




2. A Ujamaa (family) village consists of a collective society developed
under the concepts of self-reliance and socialism and rural development.
Scattered rural families are brought together to operate as a self-reliant
economic unit. This collectivity also facilitates the provision of social
services. A village committee is responsible for the operation of the
local CEC.

training, particularly for training in community health, and additional
a p p r o p r i a t e l y t r a i n e d f a c u l t y . In addition to the training of doctors, an
expansion of the Faculty of Medicine and community health facilities would
improve training of assistant medical officers, nurses and other medical
auxiliaria, who would benefit from working in close association, a valuable
experience for their future employment as members of rural medical aid
teams. In addition to increasing the quantity of Tanzanian medical person-
nel, the project component attempted to make medical training more relevant
to the health needs and the health care system in Tanzania by improving the
curriculum and facilities for teaching notably in rural health and com-
munity medicine.

Project Formulation

3.22         Of the first three Education Projects, the First (Credit 45-TA)
was signed in December 1963 and provided USS4.6 million for the expansion
of general secondary education. The Second (Credit 149-TA), signed in May
1969, consisted of USS5.0 million for general secondary education, the
expansion of primary teacher training and the Dar-es-Salaam technical
college. The Third (Credit 232-TA), signed in February 1971, provided
USS3.3 million for the expansion of agricultural training.

3.23         The World Bank appointed the Overseas Liaison Committee (OLC) of
the American Council on Education to review the formal and non-formal
education sectors in Tanzania and to identify project items suitable for
Bank financing in a Fourth Education Project. The OLC team of seven mem-
bers visited Tanzania in June/July 1971 and its report entitled: Tanzania                         -
A Nation-Wide Learning System was submitted to the Bank in November 1971.
In addition to reviewing the various aspects of education and training and
proposing project items for financing, the OLC report paid particular
attention to the development of an integrated learning system in Tanzania.

3.24         In January 1972, a Bank reconnaissance mission discussed the OLC
report with the Tanzanian Government. The Government indicated that it was
broadly in agreement with the conclusions and recommendations of the
report. Priorities for possible Bank assistance were discussed and it was
agreed that the following items would be included in project preparation
and appraisal:

             (a) two new primary teacher training colleges (CNEs);

             (b) extension of facilities at the Bagamoyo CNE to provide
                        for primary in-service teacher training;

             (c) equipment for fifteen existing primary teacher training
                        colleges for teaching practical subjects;

             (d) four new diversified secondary schools;

             (e) extensions to the Dar-es-Salaam technical college;

          ( f ) two new vocational t r a i n i n g centers;

          (g) expansion of t h e faculty of medicine;

          (h) ten-fifteen model primary schools (CECs); and

          ( i ) t h e design of a r u r a l learning system and preparation
                  of a master plan f o r para-medical training.

          The follow-up letter from t h e Bank s t a t e d that financing of t h e
proposed model primary schools would depend on agreement being reached
between t h e concerned Government ministries regarding coordination.

3.25      The project was prepared(3) and appraised by a Bank mission i n
June-July 1972.        The appraisal mission recommended the following changes t o
t h e project items identified:



          (a) further extensions t o the Dar-es-Salaam           technical college
                  should be postponed u n t i l extensions under Education I1
                  had been completed, particularly i n view of under-staffing
                  and poor management a t the college;

          (b) i n t h e absence of any inventory, additional equipment
                  f o r the f i f t e e n existing primary teacher t r a i n i n g
                  colleges could not be j u s t i f i e d ;

          ( c ) only three new secondary schools could be j u s t i f i e d on
                  the basis of Development Plan manpower projections;

          (d) based on the lack of agreement between Government
                  ministries on coordination and joint a c t i v i t i e s , t h e
                 mission recommended the provision on a p i l o t basis of
                  eight CECs i n t h e Dodoma Region deferring t h e study
                  t o design a r u r a l learning system;

          ( e ) the para-medical study should not be included since
                  SIDA was interested i n financing t h i s study.

Project Objectives

3.26     A s stated i n the appraisal report, t h e project was designed t o
further the following objectives of t h e Tanzanian educational strategy
although not necessarily within t h e time frame targeted by the Government:




3. Preliminary preparation f o r t h e f i r s t eight items was conducted l o c a l l y
before t h e June-July 1972 preparation/appraisal mission.

         (a) t o give every child a primary education a s soon a s
               the financial circumstances of the Government permit,
               then planned f o r 1989;

         (b) t o provide vocational training so a s t o achieve self-
               sufficiency a t a l l s k i l l levels of the economy by
               1980;

         (c) t o provide secondary, technical and university education
               only t o the extent justified by the estimated manpower
               requirements of the economy; and

         (d) t o bring programs of non-formal education, on a continuing
               basis, within reach of the population, particularly i n
               r u r a l areas.

The proposed project would a s s i s t i n the realization of these goals by
providing additional f a c i l i t i e s f o r primary teacher training, expanding
secondary education and vocational training, developing the Faculty of
Medicine a t the University of Dar-es-Salaam,           and by introducing experimen-
t a l community education centers i n t o selected Ujamaa villages which would
offer both primary and adult education.

                 Implementation Unit (PIU).


3.28       The project was negotiated i n February 1973 and agreement was
reached between the Government and t h e Bank Group without further substan-
t i v e change.   The only s p e c i a l condition of effectiveness was the appoint-
ment of a Project Coordinator t o head t h e PIU.           By l e t t e r of June 18, 1973,
the Ministry of Education advised t h e Bank of t h e appointment of t h e

Project Coordinator and the project was declared effective on July 2,                         1973,
ten days e a r l i e r than the effectiveness date specified i n the Credit Agree-
ment.

3.29            It should be noted that the procedures for project formulation
included the telescoping of the preparation and appraisal a c t i v i t i e s .                This
short-cutting may have resulted i n a less thorough and specific project
formulation than is normal, contributing t o the problems of implementing
the project i n terms of t i m e delays, cost overruns, and t o qualitative
shortcomings i n certain project components such a s inadequate curriculum
development and the provision of inappropriate equipment.(4)



                                     I V- PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION


Overview

4.01           The planned and actual implementation schedule (Annex 8) shows that
the completion of every component i n the project extended beyond the
planned period and that f i v e have yet t o become f u l l y operational.(5) Some
causes of the d i f f i c u l t i e s of implementation were unavoidable.               Some of the
problems of implementation could have been avoided i f the project had
focused upon fewer sectors with the components less dispersed throughout
the country.           Given the commitment of Government and the Bank t o equity
considerations and t o r u r a l development, however, it is questionable
whether, for example, more intensive preparation would have resulted i n
l e s s dispersion of the project components.                  Delays i n staffing the expanded
PIU with b i l a t e r a l technical assistance certainly contributed t o the
extended duration of the project.               Further, many of the supervision m i s -
sions (see the Basic Data) were of too short duration and inadequately
staffed t o f a c i l i t a t e the implementation process.               I n addition, supervision
was sometimes combined with identification, preparation and appraisal
a c t i v i t i e s as w e l l a s coverage of e a r l i e r and l a t e r projects which com-
pounded t h i s problem.




4. For example, a t appraisal time the VTC component was still ill defined.
No consensus was reached as t o what trades the two VTCs should offer, how
the VTCs would be used when i n operation, or what the interrelationship
between theory and shop practice would be.                     In f a c t , whereas the Credit
became effective i n July 1973, as l a t e a s November 1974                   -  that is, some 16
months a f t e r Credit effectiveness - there was an exchange of correspondence
between the Bank and the PIU a s t o the schedule of accommodation.

Mkoka.

4.02            On t h e o t h e r hand, t h e UNESCO mission w a s impressed with t h e
thorough manner i n which records a r e maintained i n both t h e PIU and t h e
World Bank's Regional Office i n Nairobi.                                  These records i n d i c a t e i n general
t h a t t h e problems of implementation were r e a l i s t i c a l l y i d e n t i f i e d and t h a t
e f f o r t s t o    resolve them were c o n s i s t e n t l y pursued i n s p i t e of t h e heavy
workload imposed upon both u n i t s .

4.03            I f viewed s t r i c t l y from t h e standpoint of t h e a p p r a i s a l report and
Credit Agreement, t h e implementation of t h e project cannot be termed an
unqualified success.                   Financial c o n s t r a i n t s and c o s t overruns due t o long
delays and higher than a n t i c i p a t e d i n f l a t i o n l e d t o t h e t h r e e secondary
schools being dropped from t h e project.                                 Certain covenants have yet t o be
m e t .     Further t h e r e e x i s t o t h e r negative aspects concerning p r o j e c t
implementation such a s t h e following.                              It is reported that inappropriate
building m a t e r i a l s a r e l i k e l y t o reduce t h e l i f e of t h e physical f a c i l i t i e s
at some of the CECs i f there is no regular maintenance.                                  Five project
i n s t i t u t i o n s have y e t t o become f u l l y operational.                 The equipment provided
t o c e r t a i n i n s t i t u t i o n s such as t h e CNEs and VTCs was i n s u f f i c i e n t and i n
some cases inappropriate.                     I n one CNE t h e f u r n i t u r e and equipment were
inappropriately d i s t r i b u t e d throughout t h e teaching f a c i l i t y due t o t h e
lack of layout plans and project supervision.                                   Two CNEs a r e still under-
s t a f f e d a f t e r t h r e e years of operation and one cannot o f f e r t h e prescribed
program of studies.

4.04            On t h e o t h e r hand, and a s noted above, t h e v a r i e t y and dispersion
of t h e project components rendered implementation d i f f i c u l t .                            To t h i s
inherent problem, one must add those which could not be a n t i c i p a t e d o r

avoided.            F i n a l l y , it should be noted t h a t some of t h e equipment deficien-
c i e s i n t h e Fourth P r o j e c t a r e being supplied under t h e S i x t h (VTCs) and
t h e Seventh (CNEs) World Bank Education Projects.

Project Management

4.05            The PIU was established under t h e Second Education P r o j e c t which
became e f f e c t i v e i n 1969.            During t h e e a r l y years, most of t h e design work
and t h e supervision of c o n t r a c t o r s was contracted out t o p r i v a t e consult-
ants.        With t h e commencement of t h e Fourth P r o j e c t i n 1973, PIU's                         respon-
s i b i l i t i e s were g r e a t l y expanded.             These increased r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s neces-
s i t a t e d a s u b s t a n t i a l t e c h n i c a l a s s i s t a n c e input which was eventually
provided by DANIDA.                   However, t h e team a r r i v e d i n January 1974, some s i x
months a f t e r t h e e f f e c t i v e d a t e of t h e Credit and its e f f o r t s were s o
diffused during t h e f i r s t t e n months of service, t h a t t h e implementation of
t h e project was thereby delayed.

4.06           The current s t r u c t u r e of t h e PIU is provided i n Annex 9.                        Under
t h e Project Coordinator, t h e r e a r e four major sections:                           building, procure-
ment, accountancy, and administration.                                 Expatriate technical a s s i s t a n c e

t o t a l s 26, with 24 working i n t h e Building Section.(6) One problem was t h e
shortage of e x p a t r i a t e and n a t i o n a l building inspectors during most of t h e
construction stage.                     Currently t h e PIU is responsible f o r about 169
p r o j e c t s funded by several i n t e r n a t i o n a l and b i l a t e r a l sources a s well a s
f o r a l a r g e program of school maintenance.

4.07            This rapid growth of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and consequently of s t a f f has
l e d t o bureaucratic problems.                     According t o one recent supervision
report,(7) t h e Project Coordinator has t o go through t h r e e administrative
l e v e l s t o o b t a i n a decision from t h e P r i n c i p a l Secretary.                  I n t h i s regard,
d i f f i c u l t i e s are reported i n t h e recruitment and r e t e n t i o n of .qualified
national technicians due t o a l a c k of f l e x i b i l i t y i n t h e system of rewards
and promotion.

S i t e s

4.08           The s e l e c t i o n and procurement of sites apparently d i d not con-
s t i t u t e a major problem, although t h r e e of those o r i g i n a l l y s e l e c t e d f o r
the CECs were changed.

4.09           Concerning t h e experimental, p i l o t CEC program, it might have been
b e t t e r i n t h i s case t o r i s k t h e problems associated with dispersion and
t o l o c a t e some CECs i n regions with varying economic and environmental
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s r a t h e r than e s t a b l i s h them a l l i n t h e same area with t h e
same c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s .      Commenting on t h i s PCR, t h e Borrower made t h e same
point.          However, t h e concentration of a l l e i g h t CECs i n one region was
s p e c i f i c a l l y requested by Government.                  Government f e l t t h a t with its own
commitment t o t h e development of Dodoma and t h e r e l a t i v e l y strong commitment
of Dodoma l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s and communities t o t h e idea, a well-supported
l o c a l network of CECs had a b e t t e r chance of taking r o o t and forming an
example f o r r e p l i c a t i o n elsewhere.                The a p p r a i s a l mission having v i s i t e d
Dodoma accepted t h i s l i n e of thinking.

Professional Services

4.10           Consultant a r c h i t e c t s were appointed f o r t h e medical education
project components i n J u l y 1973.                     The designs produced by t h e consultants
a r e considered appropriate, but problems developed during t h e construction
phase with t h e r e s u l t t h a t t h e two new operating t h e a t r e s a t t h e Muhumbili
Hospital a r e not yet i n use.                   The site supervision by t h e h o s p i t a l consult-
a n t a r c h i t e c t s has been l e s s than s a t i s f a c t o r y .         The consultants employed a
very competent mechanical and e l e c t r i c a l consultant full-time i n t h e i r
Dar-es-Salaam             o f f i c e u n t i l about April 1979.           The d e t a i l e d design and
s p e c i f i c a t i o n of t h e mechanical and e l e c t r i c a l engineering had been
prepared by t h e consultants and it was p a r t of t h e i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t y t o
supervise it t o s a t i s f a c t o r y completion.                During the l a s t two years t h i s
s p e c i a l i s t supervision has been one v i s i t every s i x months o r                      SO,    although

frequent.             The Bank a l s o recommended t h e replacement of t h e e l e c t r i c a l
i n s t a l l a t i o n sub-contractors, and and t h i s transpired i n February 1981.
The general contractor had objected but l a t e r accepted under protest.                        The
new i n s t a l l a t i o n contractor found t h a t v i t a l switch gear and other special-
ized e l e c t r i c a l items were needed before e i t h e r the l i g h t i n g or the
air-conditioning could be completed f o r the two operating theatres.                         The
consultants offered i n February 1981 t o obtain a l l of these items i n Europe
and t o a i r f r e i g h t them out.           The Bank agreed but apparently the Tanzanian
Treasury refused t o sanction t h i s unorthodox procedure e a r l y i n May 1981.
The s i t u a t i o n is now a stalemate.

4.11            I n order t o make up f o r l o s t time, since t h e PIU was working on t h e
f i r s t three projects a s w e l l a s t h e fourth, another consultant a r c h i t e c t
firm was appointed f o r t h e Bagamoyo in-service CNE i n May 1974.                   These
consultants finished t h e i r work within the contract period; t h e i r perfor-
mance was very satisfactory.

Architectural Designs

4.12            During the development of design drawings there were a number of
changes from t h e brief described i n the appraisal report and working
papers, some of them q u i t e fundamental.                These a r e described i n t h e foot-
note t o Annex 10.               The only post contract changes of any significance were
the two CNEs i n November 1979 where e x t r a expenditure, approved by the
Bank, appears w e l l justified.

4.13            During 1974, a major design problem arose i n t h a t the building cost
index rose dramatically due t o the o i l price increases and the r e s u l t a n t
world-wide i n f l a t i o n (Annex 11).            The Bank wrote t o the PIU i n December
1974 recommending complete replanning of a l l project i t e m s t o save money
and thus t o avoid the elimination of e n t i r e buildings from the project.
The PIU was urged t o re-examine every element of its design and compare
costings of various material specifications.                     Early i n 1975 during a super-
vision mission, it w a s agreed t o omit from t h e project t h e three secondary
schools and t o reduce a s necessary the contribution of t h e Credit t o medi-
c a l fellowships so a s t o keep expenditure within bounds.                  Further c u t s a t
t h i s stage would have been necessary had it not been f o r t h e use of stand-
ardized buildings.

4.14            I n t h i s l a t t e r connection, while t h e main body of the DANIDA team
was being recruited, a small group of Danish a r c h i t e c t s already i n t h e PIU
was designing a standardized system of building construction f o r t h e eight
CECs.         The systems was developed and extended f o r t h e two CNEs and two
VTCs.         The consultants f o r Bagamoyo CNE a l s o used the system with s l i g h t
modifications.             The r e s u l t s a r e appropriate and suitable, providing a
pleasant ambiance inside and out.                    The design gives pleasant w e l l - l i t
cross-ventilated rooms with great f l e x i b i l i t y and i n t e r n a l sub-divisions.

It is with good reason that the system has been used with slight modifica-
t i o n s throughout the F i f t h and Sixth World Bank Education Projects and is
intended t o be used i n the Seventh.(8)

4.15            The disposition of t h e buildings on t h e s i t e s i s generally excel-
lent.         The s i t e s were usually well chosen and many of them were n a t u r a l l y
splendid.             The separate buildings had been s e n s i t i v e l y arranged t o enhance
t h e c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of t h e site and t o c r e a t e an a t t r a c t i v e and pleasant
ambiance.             The buildings a r e usually modest and simple, appropriate and
suitable.             The a r c h i t e c t s were c a r e f u l t o avoid any wastage of money and
any unnecessary expenditure on t h e buildings themselves.

4.16            However, it is considered t h a t t h e PIU was designing f o r a more
sophisticated way of l i f e than is appropriate f o r an educational i n s t i t u -
t i o n i n r u r a l Tanzania.              WCs and water-borne           s a n i t a t i o n usually do not work
there; the u n r e l i a b i l i t y of t h e water supply, the absence of t o i l e t paper,
t h e d i f f i c u l t i e s of c l e a r i n g a blocked drain, and f i n a n c i a l con-
s i d e r a t i o n s a l l point t o t h e provision of p i t l a t r i n e s .                This conclusion
is disputed by the Borrower i n i t s comments on the PCR.                                      Indeed, Bank
supervision r e p o r t s urged PIU t o provide p i t l a t r i n e s instead of water-
borne sewage i n March 1977 and September 1977.                                 I n addition, e l e c t r i c and
gas-fired kitchens a r e so unpopular and unsuccessful t h a t provision is being
made f o r firewood cooking; t h e u n r e l i a b i l i t y of e l e c t r i c i t y and gas supplies,
t h e preference f o r firewood-cooked food and t h e p r e d i l e c t i o n s of t h e cooks
a l l m i l i t a t e against "~uropeanization"of i n s t i t u t i o n a l cooking.                     Further,
t h e design of s t a f f houses should pay much more regard t o t h e Swahili
t r a d i t i o n a l way of l i f e where cooking is on J i k o (charcoal cookers) and an
open yard is needed f o r t h e washing of c l o t h e s , maize pounding and t h e
entertainment of women and children.                              The PIU did design a very a t t r a c t i v e
s p l i t l e v e l roofed bungalow which does not seem appropriate f o r t h e
t r a i n i n g college s t a f f .

Construction

4.17            Tenders were obtained and contracts signed with approved contrac-
t o r s and suppliers according t o Bank procedures.




8. There are, however, some design defects i n the VTCs and CNEs.                                       A s an
example, those found i n t h e VTCs a r e as follows: ( i ) inadequate storage
f a c i l i t i e s ; ( i i ) too generous a l l o c a t i o n of s t a f f rooms; ( i i i ) good cross
v e n t i l a t i o n , but r a i n may e n t e r workshops; ( i v ) windows not burglar proof,
had t o be replaced; (v) individual student lockers not f e a s i b l e , unused;
( v i ) "western t o i l e t s " not f e a s i b l e ; ( v i i ) no provision o r i g i n a l l y f o r
c u b l i c l e s f o r i n s t a l l a t i o n p r a c t i c e (added l a t e r on by t r a i n e e work);
( v i i i ) no functional grouping of workshop u n i t s i n one workshop building
(e-g..        combination of p r i n t i n g and fitting-turning,                       o r forging/blacksmithy
and carpentry); and ( i x ) no provision of exhaust system f o r e i t h e r car-
pentry o r foundry.

4.18            Supervision of the s i t e works proved t o be very d i f f i c u l t , par-
t i c u l a r l y i n view of the shortage of building inspectors.                         With the excep-

t i o n of one i n Dar-es-Salaam                    and t h e two i n Bagamoyo, a l l s i t e v i s i t s
require from two t o four days f o r the round t r i p .                         Of these l a t t e r , the
v i s i t s involve only one s i t e per journey other than the CECs.                          Further,
journeys a r e often f r u s t r a t e d o r prolonged by r a i n , poor road conditions,
vehicle breakdowns, and t h e cancellation of scheduled f l i g h t s .

4.19           Under these conditions, it i s d i f f i c u l t t o ensure a high standard
of construction and of appropriate f u r n i t u r e and equipment i n s t a l l a t i o n .
Nevertheless, the standard of the construction was acceptable except a t
the Muhumbili Hospital and c e r t a i n of the CECs.                         I n addition t o the elec-
t r i c a l i n s t a l l a t i o n problem a t t h e hospital, the roof leaks and v i r t u a l l y
every trade f i n i s h was below t h e acceptable standard f o r an operating
theatre.          The problem of s u i t a b l e building materials and maintenanc~ea t
some of the CECs is discussed elsewhere (para. 6.36).

Furniture

4.20           Much of the school f u r n i t u r e such a s chairs, desks and laboratory
was designed by PIU and constructed i n hardwood locally.                                Improper design
has resulted i n many chairs and desks a t t h e CECs being damaged beyond use
(50 t o 100 per center).                    Had it not been f o r t h e r e p a i r work i n the wood
workshops, many more would be unusable.                            The design deficiencies were
remedied before similar f u r n i t u r e was produced f o r the CNEs and VTCs.
However, there have been many complaints t h a t the c h a i r s a r e uncomfortable,
notably because the backrest is too low.                            The l a t e s t models have s l i g h t l y
higher backrests.                 Although the PIU s t a t e d it had provided f u r n i t u r e
lay-out plans t o each i n s t i t u t i o n , the PIU building inspector and the
o f f i c i a l s a t the Mtwara CNE denied receiving such plans.                        A s a r e s u l t , i n
t h e l a t t e r i n s t i t u t i o n , f u r n i t u r e and equipment a r e not properly placed.




4.21           The f a i l u r e t o provide s u f f i c i e n t and appropriate equipment t o the
CNEs and the VTCs under the Fourth Education Project(9) has created serious
problems within these i n s t i t u t i o n s (para. 6.04-6.07                     and 6.24).   Among the
reasons c i t e d f o r t h i s a r e t h e lack of s p e c i f i c program of s t u d i e s a s a
basis f o r preparation of the d e t a i l e d lists, and the absence of s u f f i c i e n t
assistance t o t h e PIU from the pertinent technical departments within MNE.
According t o t h e Project Coordinator, a t t h e t i m e when t h e equipment lists
were prepared, more money could have been made available f o r additional
equipment.           I f t h i s is correct, l i b r a r y books, additional i n s t r u c t i o n a l
equipment and transport should have been procured.




9. Further equipment is t o be provided under the Sixth Project f o r the VTCs
and under the Seventh f o r the CNEs.

Technical Assistance

4.22           Technical assistance consisted of expatriate s t a f f and fellowships
f o r the health education component and s t a f f f o r the project unit (Annex
12).       Supervision reports mention delays i n technical assistance f o r the
former due t o the indecisiveness of local medical authorities and lack of
coordination with WHO.                A s noted i n Annex 12, funds f o r such assistance
were drastically cut.                However, the technical assistance component was
adequate and successful except f o r the implementation of a short-term
exchange program which, i n any case, did not greatly affect the program's
outcome.

4.23           I n terms of the recruitment of expatriate s t a f f financed by a
b i l a t e r a l donor f o r the project u n i t , delays i n recuitment and subsequent
diffusion of t h e i r work a c t i v i t i e s during the f i r s t ten months contributed
substantially t o the delay i n project implementation.                         On the other hand,
the high quality of the present s t a f f makes possible an e f f i c i e n t operation
i n s p i t e of a very heavy workload.

Covenants

4.24          Based upon the evidence available t o the mission, a l l Covenants
have been s a t i s f a c t o r i l y f u l f i l l e d with the exception of 3.09, 4.02, 4.03,
and 4.04.          I n the case of 3.09 concerning mobile construction u n i t s f o r the
CECs, there is only one mobile unit which moves from s i t e t o s i t e on a
prolonged schedule basis, reportedly due t o the short supply of skilled
workers.         This, along with other reasons, has resulted i n serious delays i n
project implementation and led t o cost overruns.

4.25          Regarding Section 4.02 on the appropriate operation and management
of project components, t h i s is adequate except f o r the CNEs which are
under-staffed and lack funds f o r practice teaching.                      The in-service train-
ing courses f o r the Bagamoyo CNE a r e still under preparation.                        I n addition,
essential equipment and books a r e lacking at CNEs so that even i f s t a f f
were available the program of studies could not be followed.                            The lack of
equipment at the VTCs also makes it impossible t o conduct viable courses i n
certain specialities.               Two operating theatres i n the teaching hospital a r e
not i n use, which certainly a f f e c t s the instructional program.

4.26          Section 4.03 requires that a maintenance program be established
but i n i t i a l r e s u l t s a r e not yet available.        The lack of appropriate main-
tenance t o date is leading t o serious problems at the CECs and the CNEs.

4.27          According t o two Bank supervision reports, the study of the evalua-
tion and rationalization of the primary teacher training program i n terms
of optimal s i z e and location and the length and structure of the program
has been completed (Section 4.04).                      The repeated e f f o r t s of the UNESCO
mission t o obtain a copy of t h i s study failed.                  A meeting with o f f i c i a l s of
the PIU and the MNE indicated that such a study had not been carried out.

The officials did state that from time to time various studies have been
conducted, but apparently these were not the in-depth comprehensive study
called for in the covenant. A survey of educational facilities in secon-
dary schools and the CNEs is presently being conducted under the Fifth
Education Project. The survey is unlikely to be completed prior to the
departure of the two expatriate experts working on it. In any case, the
survey does not deal with the problem of curricular reform called for in
the covenant. Finally, there was a study of primary teacher training
conducted by a combined national and UNESCO group for the May 1981 UNESCO
Sector Study on the future development of education. This report indicates
the need for curriculum development and reform in this sub-sector of educa-
tion as stated in Section 4.04 of the Credit Agreement.

Bank Grou~Performance

4.28    The project was supervised by 16 missions excluding the completion
mission. The intervals between missions were between two and nine months
with two thirds in the five to seven month bracket.  Supervision missions
which were essentially staffed from the Bank's Regional Mission in Nairobi,
averaged two persons for about two weeks although other projects were being
concurrently supervised in many instances. Architects participated in 13
of the missions, general educators in eight, technical educators in four
and a medical educator in two. The Bank was most successful in the super-
vision of the construction components of the project and less successful in
the software components, particularly equipment and furniture. On the
whole, Bank Group staff supervising the project and Government officials
established and maintained a good relationship which allowed them to
anticipate and solve problems. This is particularly true of the close
collaboration in reshaping the design of many project components as a
result of higher than expected inflation in 1974 and in keeping costs
essentially in line thereafter.   However, it appears that supervision
missions were too short and not adequately staffed to supervise the
numerous, separate and varied project components. In retrospect it would
seem that a more intense supervision, more frequent site inspection and
better coordination of hardware and software parts of project components
would have improved project execution and outcome considerably.




                     V - PROJECT COST AND FINANCING


Capital Cost

5.01    Annex 13 shows that the final cost is T.Shs. 117,273,000 compared
with the appraisal total of T.Shs. 104,110,000 or 13% above the appraisal
estimate. In US$ however, the deflation of the Tanzanian currency during
the period of project implementation reverses the picture. The final cost
in dollars is expected to be US$14,249,000 or 2% lower than the appraisal

estimate of US$14,581,000.                    Annex 14 gives t h e d e t a i l e d breakdown of
project cost.              A much l a r g e r overrun w a s avoided by omitting altogether
t h r e e new secondary schools and by reducing t h e expenditure on medical
s p e c i a l i s t s and fellowships.           This was agreed upon with the Bank e a r l y i n
1975.         T h e f a c t t h a t c o s t s have been controlled since t h a t d a t e and t h a t no
f u r t h e r omissions were needed is evidence of t h e care and r e s t r a i n t of t h e
PIU.        Annex 11 shows t h a t t h e r e w a s another important wave of i n f l a t i o n i n
1980.         Annex 1 5 presents the a c t u a l disbursements compared t o t h e a p p r a i s a l
forecast year-by-year.                   This is shown i n graphic form i n Annex 8.              Actual
disbursements followed a very s i m i l a r p a t t e r n t o the a p p r a i s a l f o r e c a s t ,
although they were delayed f o r t h e reasons already given (paras.
4.05-4.07).


Space Allocations

5.02            Space a l l o c a t i o n s per student shown i n Annex 10 are commendably
close t o a p p r a i s a l expectations.             The exceptions a r e pointed out and
explained by t h e footnotes.                  Calculations of gross a r e a s per student place
a r e not applicable f o r t h e medical f a c i l i t i e s and have therefore been
omitted from t h e annex.                 Annex 16 shows again how f l o o r areaa and student
c a p a c i t i e s as b u i l t were c l o s e t o appraisal estimates.            Increased c o s t s a r e
largely t h e r e s u l t of i n f l a t i o n .



                                      V I  - PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOME




Primary Teacher Training

6.01            Mtwara and Tukuyu.            The establishment of these two new pre-service
CNEs t o expand t h e production of primary school teachers was c e r t a i n l y
j u s t i f i e d i n view of t h e ~overnment's objective t o achieve universal                        -

primary education.                Further, it was expected t h a t t h e increased production
would lead t o a reduction i n t h e output of t h e DLP and hence t o a progres-
s i v e improvement i n t h e q u a l i t y of t h e teaching s t a f f .           I f the q u a l i t y of
i n s t r u c t i o n has suffered from t h e lack of s t a f f and equipment, t h e i n t e r n a l
efficiency and external productivity of t h e two CNEs a r e s a t i s f a c t o r y .
Drop-outs and f a i l u r e s are few and there is no problem of employment f o r
t h e graduates.           Further, enrollments should reach the designed capacity i n
t h e near future.

6.02            The Mtwara CNE is one of f i v e CNEs which a r e supposed t o o f f e r
s p e c i a l i s t courses i n r e l a t e d f i e l d s (Annex 5).     I n t h e case of Mtwara, t h e
f i e l d is mathematics and science.                  However, a f t e r t h r e e years of operation,
t h e CNE has been unable t o conduct t h i s b i a s and has offered t h e general
course instead (Annex 4).                    This i s due t o t h e lack of s u f f i c i e n t and
appropriate s t a f f and equipment.

6.03           Although both of the CNEs a r e supposed t o have a teaching s t a f f of
24, when they opened i n July 1979, Mtwara and Tukuyu had s t a f f s of 5 and 8
respectively.            A s of April 1981, Mtwara had 18 professional s t a f f and
Tukuyu 17.           These figures include four administrators who teach part-time.
I n f a c t , due t o staff shortages, the administrators teach up t o 26 hours
weekly.

6.04            The shortage of appropriate and sufficient equipment and of library
books has not only had an adverse e f f e c t on program content, but on teach-
ing methods which a r e largely r e s t r i c t e d t o lectures.          The small amount
of science equipment a t Mtwara appears t o have been v i r t u a l l y unused,
possibly because it is too sophisticated, particularly for grade I I I c
teaching candidates.             The e l e c t r i c a l kitchen and laundry equipment f o r
home-economics certainly is too elaborate f o r the candidates, most of whom
w i l l teach i n r u r a l villages.        This equipment has not been used since it
was placed i n the needlework room where there a r e no e l e c t r i c a l outlets.
Also unused are 40 typewriters and the related "shorthand-typing"                        rooms is
used a s a general classroom.

6.05           A t Mtwara, the instructional equipment and school furniture were
scattered i n a hodge-podge manner.                    For example, laboratory and general
classroom furniture were dispersed a t random throughout the teaching areas.
I n addition, the audio-visual and science laboratory preparation rooms were
being used a s s t a f f offices.          I n explanation, college o f f i c i a l s a s well as
the local PIU building inspector said they had never received a blue print
of the school plant nor room plans for the placement of equipment or furni-
ture, which is reported t o be normally provided by the PIU.                     I n t h e l a t t e r
connection, school furniture appears t o be of good quality, although there
a r e complaints t h a t the chairs a r e uncomfortable.

6.06            I n addition, such science laboratory needs as a wash basin and gas
burning equipment have never been installed a t Mtwara so that the pos-
s i b i l i t i e s f o r student practical work are severely restricted.

6.07            I n terms of communal equipment, the two CNEs were provided e l e c t r i -
c a l kitchen equipment which neither the cooks nor the students 1ik.e.
Hence, new outdoor-type kitchens a r e being constructed a t both CNEs.

6.08           Again a t Mtwara, cupboards for s t a f f houses a r e stored i n covered
open areas i n the teaching f a c i l i t y rather than being used a s intended.
They were intended t o be assembled inside of the houses but they were
assembled outside and are too large t o pass through the doors.

6.09           The quality of construction a t Mtwara appears t o be satisfactory,
but there a r e maintenance problems.                   For example, the ceiling of o.ne class-
room was broken and i n danger of collapsing i f repairs were put off much
longer.          Although there a r e a carpenter and plumber on t h e s t a f f , they have
been used a s kitchen help instead of maintenance men.

6.10         Finally, a t Mtwara, there is a serious problem i n that the sewage
frequently backs up i n t o s t a f f housing sanitary f a c i l i t i e s .

6.11         When queried about t h e obvious insufficiency and inappropriateness
of the instructional equipment and the lack of library books, PIU personnel
gave a s the cause the f a i l u r e of the MNE t o specify a firm program of
studies prior t o the preparation of the equipment lists. While t h i s
explanation may be p a r t i a l l y correct, it cannot account for the absence
of procuring obvious needs i n general science, home-economics,                         audio-visual
equipment, library books, furniture, and vehicles.

6.12         Bagamoyo.   The extension t o the Bagamoyo in-service CNE was aimed
a t s t a f f qualitative improvement, notably i n the f i e l d s of science and
mathematics.       This has yet t o be implemented.            The f a c i l i t i e s have been
used exclusively for courses i n educational administration assisted under
the Sixth Education Project.          Thus, the science laboratories and equipment
have never been used.       However, according t o MNE o f f i c i a l s , the primary
in-service training courses w i l l begin i n July 1981 with 240 places
retained for t h i s purpose and 80 places for the continuing courses i n
educational administration.          The new course w i l l be i n the f i e l d of science
with a duration of three months given three times a year.                         Hence, 720
teachers should pass through the course annually.                 When asked about s t a f f
recruitment, MNE o f f i c i a l s stated that they w i l l be selected from the
s t a f f s of other CNEs.  This may pose a problem given existing staff
shortages i n some of the CNEs.

6.13         Although the courses i n educational administration appear t o be
successful, a MNE report indicates there are organizational conflicts
resulting from the merger of the two programs under a single administration
within the CNE.       Further, t h e report is c r i t i c a l of the choice of Bagamoyo
for the program c i t i n g such d i f f i c u l t i e s as transport t o and from
Dar-es-Salaam,      communications and the under-development of the town i n
relation t o many others.        These same problems could be applied t o the
in-service teacher training program.                The Bank's appraisal report (para.
5.07) cites the proximity of Bagamoyo t o Dar-es-Salaam                  as an advantage.

Vocational Training

6.14         The external productivity of the VTCs is shown i n two tables below.
These tables demonstrate that immediately a f t e r commissioning, the VTCs
went into f u l l operation f o r basic training, and the year thereafter for
night classes (i.e. a t a time when trainees for night classes would be
available i n adequate numbers owing t o the f i r s t year basic trainees being

6.16     The two VTCs have thus assumed an important place within the
national vocational training scheme.          The reason for t h i s i s said t o be
twofold:     (a) the urgent demand f o r skilled workers made it imperative that

t h e f a c i l i t i e s be used immediately, even i f t h e equipment was not yet f u l l y
adequate; and (b) t r a i n e e s and i n s t r u c t o r s a l i k e show such dedication t o
vocational t r a i n i n g t h a t i n i t i a l shortcomings a r e e i t h e r accepted a s some-
thing unavoidable, o r a s correctable with t h e means a t t h e disposal of VTCs
(Annex 6).

6.17           There is, however, a l e s s p o s i t i v e development t o be noted.                    The

The picture r e l a t i v e t o night c l a s s e s is less c l e a r , a s these take
a longer t i m e to develop.

6.18           From a purely q u a n t i t a t i v e viewpoint, it appears t h a t t h e VTC Tanga
is performing slightly better than the VTC Mwanza both with regard t o day
courses and t o night courses.

6.19           The VTCs maintain contact with employers during t h e time of t h e
trainee's         in-plant training.             This way, they a r e w e l l informed about t h e
placement of trainees, and t h e i r performance; i n f a c t , p r a c t i c a l l y a l l
t r a i n e e s have been placed, and are reported t o be performing t o t h e s a t i s -
faction of employers.                  The e x t e r n a l productivity of t h e two VTCs must,
therefore, be considered e n t i r e l y satisfactory.(lO)

6.20           I n terms of effectiveness, t h e operation of t h e Tanga and Mwanza
VTCs put t h e national vocational t r a i n i n g scheme t o t h e test:                          would t h e




10. A follow-up study of graduates from National Vocational Training Center
had been undertaken i n 1977, i.e. p r i o r t o t h e operation of t h e Tanga and
Mwanza VTCs.             The study demonstrated t h e high degree of employers' s a t i s -
f a c t i o n with t h e r e s u l t s of VTC training.              Based upon informal enquiries,
t h i s s a t i s f a c t i o n continues with t h e t h r e e VTCs i n operation (including t h e
Dar-es-Salaam            VTC).

and i n s t r u c t o r s , t h a t were c l e a r l y f e a s i b l e during a t i m e when t h e r e was
but one VTC (i.e.                 t h a t of Dar-es-Salaam)          a l s o work when t h e scheme was
expanded t o o t h e r p a r t s of t h e country?                   The r e s u l t s obtained thus f a r show
t h a t it is.

6.21           Concerning c o s t s , t h e c e n t r a l accounts f o r vocational t r a i n i n g t h a t
a r e kept i n Dar-es-Salaam                    a r e not arranged i n such a way a s t o permit t h e
establishment of u n i t c o s t s f o r e i t h e r VTC full-time t r a i n i n g o r night
classes.           This i s i n l i n e with t h e a p p r a i s a l report which does not contain
estimates of unit costs f o r VTCs.

6.22           There a r e indications, however, t h a t i n t e r n a l efficiency is
decreasing somewhat as t h e number of t r a i n e e s decreases and t h a t of

6.23           Again under t h e aspect of i n t e r n a l efficiency, t h e VTC Tanga
appears t o perform s l i g h t l y b e t t e r than t h a t of Mwanza.                    This is thought t o
be i n d i c a t i v e of a somewhat more advanced i n d u s t r i a l environment i n Tanga
as compared t o Mwanza with a consequence that the former has slightly more
t r a i n e e s than t h e l a t e r .

6.24           A s i n t h e case of t h e CNEs, t h e r e e x i s t equipment problems.                 For
example, t h e power t o o l s a r e too l i g h t generally, and not adequate f o r
heavy duty usage i n VTCs ( t h i s goes i n p a r t i c u l a r f o r t h e machine shop and
t h e carpentry shop).                    E l e c t r i c a l equipment (motors, etc.) have not been
procured due t o an oversight.                            The plumbing shop is equipped f o r pipe
f i t t i n g only, and not, as curriculum would c a l l f o r , a l s o f o r sheet m e t a l
work.        The p r i n t shop o f f e r s only a very limited range of p r a c t i c a l train-
ing p o s s i b i l i t i e s ( o f f s e t only, but without p l a t e making f a c i l i t i e s ) .     The
foundry workshop is one i n name only s i n c e t h e r e is no foundry equipment.

The c i v i l engineering l a b and mechanical e l e c t r i c a l engineering l a b can be
used f o r general sciences only (mainly by using t h e blackboard f o r demon-
s t r a t i o n s ) owing t o lack of materials since it is not equipped f o r t h e
storage of general school materials and components.                   The drawing o f f i c e can
be used f o r free-hand sketching only due t o lack of T-squares.
Audio-visual a i d s a r e stored i n a way t h a t makes t h e i r use by i n s t r u c t o r s
d i f f i c u l t . The duplicating room ( i n t h e building drawings indicated as t h e
printing room) has no equipment and thus cannot be used.

Community Education Centers

6.25           The objectives of t h e CECs embrace both formal and non-formal
education programs.              The innovative approach of using CECs i n support of
Government development programs f o r Ujamaa v i l l a g e s was designed t o be
implemented on a p i l o t basis i n c e r t a i n selected v i l l a g e s and, depending
upon t h e outcome, was t o be eventually expanded across t h e nation.               Hence
t h e CEC project component was experimental i n nature, both from t h e point
of view of the program of s t u d i e s and project implementation.              The latter
was t o rely heavily on self-help schemes whereby members of the community
would be mobilized t o provide f r e e labor and limited material f o r t h e
construction of project buildings.(ll)

6.26          A t t h e t i m e of appraisal, eight sites f o r t h e centers were tenta-
t i v e l y chosen i n the Dodoma Region which was believed t o have a concentra-
t i o n of r e l a t i v e l y successfully organized Ujamaa villages.        Since then
t h r e e of t h e sites had t o be changed (within t h e same region) t o more
conducive areas, namely, Bereko, Mondo and Mkoka.

6.27          Upon completion of the project, e x i s t i n g primary schools were t o be
moved i n t o t h e newly established CECs.           The construction of t h e CECs was
t o be undertaken by a building team comprising a building inspector, eight
masons and ten carpenters, a l l of whom would be trained a t t h e Rural Train-
ing Center i n Dodoma.             Later, t h e number of masons and carpenters was
increased t o 10 and 12, respectively.              A s regards unskilled labor, 80 t o
100 would be trained on t h e job f o r each center and would provide a core of
workers who would a s s i s t u n t i l the center was completed.          The masons,
carpenters and t h e building inspector on completion of t h e i r respective
tasks would move from center t o center u n t i l a l l eight centers were con-
structed.          Four CECs (Mpunguzi, Mlowa Uarabarani, I d i f u , and Mbabala) were
constructed under t h i s scheme, a f t e r which t h e semi-skilled laborers were
s p l i t i n t o four groups covering t h e remaining f o u r centers where they are
still working a t present.




11. In 1973 it was estimated that one CEC could be constructed, furnished
and equipped a t a cost of T.Shs.             436,000 with l o c a l contribution through
self-help, and T.Shs.             871,900 without it.

6.28    There was no problem anticipated in staffing the CECs at the time
of appraisal. The primary school teachers were to conduct the regular
academic program as well as part of the community adult education programs,
primarily in literacy.

6.29    The eight CECs are directly administered by PIU/MNE at the national
level, bypassing the Dodoma Regional Administrative and/or Educational
Offices. The PIU has one administrator who is exclusively assigned to the
follow--upand supervision of the implementation of the CECs. The
administration is usually involved in expediting the release of project
funds, award of local tenders, purchase and delivery of construction
materials, equipment and furniture, as well as field supervision. The
actual construction is supervised by a project architect who is posted at
the PIU and, at the local level, by a building inspector.

6.30    In retrospect, the management responsibilities of this component
should have been largely delegated to the regional authorities in order
to try to make significant savings on construction costs and in time, In
some of the centers (Mondo, Bereko) the biggest obstacle which caused
considerable delays in construction was the unavailability of the necessary
unskilled labor. In the project preparation phase, under the Government
policy of self-help, it was assumed that the community contributions would
be forthcoming. However, the result has not been satisfactory. The
project completion date for the Mondo CEC had to be postponed four times in
order to allow more time for finalization. To date, the center has still
not been completed. In other cases, such as the Bereko CEC, the construc-
tion of buildings requiring production of soil-cement bricks coincided with
the peak agricultural season, causing a delay of three months at one time.
Taking into consideration these and other similar localized problems, it
appears that the regional office would have been in a better position to
initiate and mobilize participation of the villagers.

6.31    Another factor which inadvertently contributed to delays and
increased cost is the decision to stagger the construction of the CECs over
a period of about six years. There were two main advantages in using this
approach. Firstly, it would enable the use of the same masons and car-
penters in all centers, thereby ensuring the availability of skilled and/or
semi-skilled labor which might have been in short supply at the time of
appraisal. Secondly, the PIU could deliver construction materials to one
site at a time without overburdening its limited transport facilities as
compared to delivering to four or five sites at a time.

6.32    Looking at the present status of the four incomplete CECs, it is
clear that the cost overrun did not justify the staggering of construction.
The first four CECs which were constructed prior to 1978 were completed
more or less within the appraisal cost estimates of about T.Shs. 400,000
(US$50,000)- However, the estimated completion cost for Mondo and Bereko
is T.Shs. 1,068,481 (US$$133,685) and for Mkoka T.Shs.  1,084,126
(US$135,515), respectively. Additional expenditure to complete the Huzi
CEC will require T.Shs 68,942 (US$8,617) according to PIU estimates. This

would seem t o i n d i c a t e t h a t had t h e construction of a l l e i g h t CECs been
completed within the f i r s t four years, most of t h e c o s t overrun indicated
above might have been avoided.                I n any case, it should be noted t h a t the
high c o s t s o f , t h e CECs prevent generalization of t h e present scheme.                        This
could represent a p o s i t i v e outcome i n t h a t t h i s r e a l i z a t i o n could lead t o a
new s t r a t e g y t o achieve s i m i l a r objectives with l e s s f i n a n c i a l cost.

6.33            Three CECs, namely, Mpunguzi, MlowaBarabarani, and I d i f u , have been
equipped and furnished 100%. It should be noted t h a t equipment and furni-
t u r e provided f o r i n t h e project w e r e determined on t h e b a s i s of 375
primary pupils i n each of t h e CECs.             However, at present, enrollment has
increased by 50% t o 250% over and above t h i s estimate, thus c r e a t i n g an
acute shortage of equipment and furniture.

6.34           By and l a r g e , t h e equipment delivered was relevant t o t h e learning
program and i n accordance with t h e project objectives.                     I n p a r t i c u l a r , t h e
wood workshop (carpentry) and, t o some extent, t h e domestic science
f a c i l i t i e s have been productively used i n manufacturing f u r n i t u r e f o r o t h e r
primary schools and i n t h e process, contributed t o t h e t r a i n i n g of
semi-skilled a d u l t workers from t h e i r respective Ujamaa v i l l a g e s               (Mpunguzi,
Mbabala).          The metal workshops have been less u t i l i z e d because of lack of
raw materials t o work with and.in two cases (Idifu and Mbabala)
unavailability of qualified (technical) i n s t r u c t o r s .            I n I d i f u CEC, all
workshop equipment is still unpacked from its c r a t e , hence never used since
its delivery i n 1977.

6.35           School furniture appears t o be poorly designed.            Some of the chairs
and desks (50 t o 100 i n each center) have been damaged and are out of use.
Had it not been f o r the repair work i n the wood workshops, many more would
have been ruined.            The main defects i n the design a r e t h e use of too many
protruding joints which can cause accidents and also the use of short
screws which easily come off when the furniture is moved around.                    The
justification for the design was based on cost savings and easy packing and
assembling, which i n the long run proving t o be unacceptable.                  These
defects appear t o have been largely eliminated through re-designing the
furniture for the CNEs and VTCs.

6.36           Early CEC construction used f i r e d bricks u n t i l it was realized t h a t
the use of t r e e s f o r f u e l was destroying the ecology of the area.
Soil-cement bricks were accepted a s an alternative.                 Although more frequent
maintenance is required f o r s o i l cement buildings a f t e r each rainy season,
the materials a r e a t hand and villages usually regard t h i s maintenance a s
routine.         The maintenance of project buildings with respect t o CECs,
however, presents a serious problem which must be redressed immediately.
The Mlowa Barabarani CEC is already facing maintenance problems with which
other CECs w i l l be confronted i n the near future.            A t Mlowa Barabarani, there
a r e serious doubts about the durability of soil-cement,                i f not maintained
annually, once the cement wall plaster f a l l s off and is exposed directly t o
rain.        I n t h i s center the exposed walls and columns a r e i n the process of
crumbling.          This would indicate that maintenance work should be undertaken
as soon a s cracks develop on the wall plaster.             Hence, it becomes evident
that unless a serious e f f o r t is made t o provide adequate recurrent expendi-
t u r e for maintenance (no allowance hss been made so f a r ) the longevity of
the CECs'        physical infrastructure would be considerably reduced.             Moreover,
t h e community should be mobilized t o a s s i s t i n t h i s e f f o r t i n the s p i r i t of
self-reliance.

6.37           In terms of software inputs, the weakest part of the CEC program
appears t o be the adult education component.            I n one CEC (Idifu) no adult
education programs other than l i t e r a c y have been s t a r t e d (Annex 7).        I n
Mbabala and Mlowa Barabarani, the metal workshops have not been used due t o
lack of working material and qualified teachers.               Recurrent expenditure
needed for the purchase of raw material t o be used i n the workshop is
t o t a l l y lacking i n four CECs.     I n the centers (except Idifu), the wood
workshop (carpentry) has been r e l a t i v e l y well u t i l i z e d i n training adults
and i n the process of manufacturing school furniture under consignment f o r
other primary schools and repairing broken project furniture.

6.38          There is doubt a s t o whether or not the adults trained a t the
centers have acquired the kind of s k i l l s they could profitably u t i l i z e i n
the Ujamaa villages.            It has been reported that these trainees do not earn
t h e i r living by using these s k i l l s because the standard of l i v i n g of the
villagers is so low that they cannot afford t o pay f o r the kind of goods
and services t h a t these s k i l l e d trainees could render.         Under these circum-
stances it w i l l not be surprising t o find that a majority of these trainees
migrate t o the more prosperous urban centers.

6.39            The informal adult education program should have been heavily
biased t o the major economic a c t i v i t y which is agriculture.                  The Ministry
of Agriculture through its extension service should be closely involved
i n developing the type of educational program that w i l l have positive
results on increased productivity through the introduction of improved
cultural practices, providing modern inputs such as f e r t i l i z e r s and insec-
ticides, and introduction of intermediate technology.                         A t present a l l of
the four operating centers a r e visited occasionally by an agricultural
coordinator.            Two of the CECs (Mpunguzi and Mbabala) have extension agents
posted.          However, t h e i r presence has not brought any significant impact on
production.

6.40            On the other hand, the health education and training programs seem
t o be progressing satisfactorily i n all four centers.                       The center's  dispen-
sary is used t o provide basic medical services and an educational program
f o r incoming patients.             Topics covered include:            motherlchild health,
nutrition, midwifery, basic hygiene, vaccination, etc.                         I n the Mbabala CEC,
it was reported that an average of 2,500 individuals are exposed to such
educational programs each month.                I n other centers, village participants
meet a t the center three t i m e s a week for about an hour t o undertake orien-
tation courses i n health education a s w e l l as p o l i t i c a l education.             I n
general, although participation i n such a c t i v i t i e s appears t o be encourag-
ing, there is a need t o determine the extent of the effectiveness of the
program i n meeting the f e l t needs of the community.

6.41           An adult l i t e r a c y program is being coordinated by a l l the opera-
tional CECs (Annex 7).               The centers themselves conduct only one o r two
classes; most are organized within t h e Ujamaa villages using such
f a c i l i t i e s a s may be available, i.e. under a tree, borrowed rooms, etc.
It is reported that the average attendance is about 30%of the initial
enrollees.

6.42           The CECs provide other related useful functions f o r the community
and are gradually becoming the main focus of Ujamaa village activity.
Among others, the centers provide day-care centers f o r pre-school age
children, a primary school f o r children of school age, metal/woodwork shops
and home-economics centers f o r adults, village shop, dispensary, village
administrative office, assembly h a l l and community library.

6.43            It w i l l be recalled that all eight CECs i n the project are located
i n the Dodoma region.             A s indicated e a r l i e r , t h i s was done mainly t o com-
plement the increased villagization o r Ujamaa movement launched by the
Government a t the time of appraisal.               Consequently, the experience gained
i n establishing CECs a s p i l o t projects has been limited t o t h i s particular
area which is characterized by sparse population, semi-arid climate and low
economic potential.             It now appears that some of the CECs should have been
established i n other regions with different economic and environmental
characteristics i n order t o find out whether or not the CEC concept is more

readily adaptable under different circumstances. However, it appears that
this localization was demanded by the Government.

6.44    The present sites on which the CECs are located are in agricul-
turally marginal areas with an average annual rainfall of about 500 mil-
limeters and for the most part, sandy clay soil. It appears that a careful
study should have been undertaken prior to site selection.

6.45    In retrospect, it may have been that the CECs were not successful
because of design faults in the implementation (the emphasis on self-help)
rather than because of the overall CEC conception. It would therefore seem
appropriate for Government to conduct other CEC pilot projects using a
different   self-help scheme or other means of construction.

The Study of Management Education and Training

6.46    The objective of this study was to evaluate of the needs of the
various training programs, especially the award system, and to make recom-
mendations. By way of background, it should be noted that since Independ-
ence, governmental, parastatal and cooperative agencies, and the university
have established and/or expanded management training programs in response
to long term as well as ad hoc demands. While the rapid growth of these
activities is indicative of the importance the Government attaches to
public management, the creation of institutions and the programs has not
been adequately coordinated. As noted in the study group's   report, this
has lead to duplication and over-lapping which affects the optimal use of
scarce teaching resources.

6.47    The recommendations of the Report are related to six general
issues:

        (a) the coordination of management training;

        (b) the relationship between the training institutions
             and their clients;

        (c) the relationship between management and accountancy
             training;

        (d) the position regarding management teachers;

        (e) the role of consultancy and research; and

        (f) the issue of awards (degrees, diplomas and certificates).

6.48    After receipt of the Report, the Government conducted an in-depth
analysis of the recommendations and issued an official document re-stating
these recommendations followed by, in each case, the Government's decision
on what action to take. This document states that "the Government has on
the whole accepted the MTS (Management Training Study) recommendations..."

6.49    One of the major recommendations was to establish a Public Manage-
ment Development Council (PMDC) to be chaired by the Principal Secretary
to the President. While such a body was not established in this form, a
unit with similar functions has been created. As explained in the Govern-
ment's Statement of August 27, 1976, the creation of the PMDC would  "...
constitute a duplication of the newly created Ministry of Manpower Develop-
ment (MMD) which has a whole division to coordinate Training including
Management Training."  However, the Government did establish The National
Management Development Advisory Council (NMDAC) within the MMD to review
regularly the planning, development, operations, education and specialized
needs of management training.

6.50    Within the NMDAC, the Standing Committee on Awards (SCOA) was
established in June 1478 with the following terms of reference:(12)

        (i) To ensure that the standardized classification of
             awards is adhered to and maintained and to keep
             NMDAC informed on the matter.

       (ii) To propose and analyze proposals on awards for new
             and revised training courses.

      (iii) To ensure the quality of syllabi and teaching is
             commensurate with the set standards of awards.

6.51    Based upon the available evidence this project component appears
to have been quite successful, probably due to the Government's  commitment
to the rationalization of management training as well as to the Report's
quality.

Health Education

6.52    The broad goals of the medical evaluation component were to
increase and improve resources of the Faculty of Medicine and thereby
increase the output of Tanzanian physicians and the relevance of their
training to national health problems. This overall goal has been achieved.
The annual intake of medical students has increased from 30 to 50 students.
The quality of students remains good and attrition is minimal (2-5 students
per 5 years of training). The faculty has increased in number and is
predominantly Tanzanian with a large proportion having completed good

t r a i n i n g programs abroad.              Bank-sponsored construction of faculty and
student l i v i n g quarters and of classrooms have contributed t o the increased
number of students and faculty                     who could be accommodated.              Recruitment of
good faculty, including short-term e x p a t r i a t e f a c u l t y has been f a c i l i t a t e d
by provision of these quarters and classrooms.                         The f a c i l i t i e s themselves
a r e functional, and though spartan, equivalent t o other f a c i l i t i e s a t t h e
medical center.              Without t h i s construction, it is unlikely t h a t student and
f a c u l t y numbers could have been increased without compromising educational
quality.           The u t i l i z a t i o n of the operating t h e a t r e s continues t o be a
problem.

6.53            The faculty t r a i n i n g support and support f o r expatriate faculty
have been somewhat less successful, although they have contributed t o t h e
overall improvement i n education.                      Fewer Tanzanian postdoctoral fellows
received t r a i n i n g abroad than was o r i g i n a l l y envisaged, and t h e number of
foreign nationals f i l l i n g short-term teaching positions was a l s o less than
anticipated.            Moreover, a greater emphasis on community medicine and
primary care was anticipated i n the t r a i n i n g programs than the actualized
emphasis on medical and s u r g i c a l s p e c i a l i t i e s .      Nevertheless, t h e r e has
been a remarkable increase i n t h e numbers and quality of Tanzanian f a c u l t y
trained abroad and returning t o t h e educational and r e f e r r a l centers.
However, other support mechanisms were available t o t h e Government, thereby

6.54            The development of t h e Bagamoyo Rural Health Center f o r teaching
community health practices is a resounding success.                            The s i t i n g of the
c l i n i c is important.              It is within two t o three hours vehicular t i m e from
the school, yet i n an area of authentic r u r a l health needs.                            While there
have been some construction problems, t h e general design is functional and
a t t r a c t i v e .  Training a t t h i s s i t e is an i n t e g r a l part of t h e medical
student curriculum, and has been e n t h u s i a s t i c a l l y received by the students.
The student experience a t Bagamoyo f u l f i l l s an important need i n the medi-
c a l curriculum f o r t r a i n i n g i n community health problems and teaching and

2.     Para. 1.03




             The delay i n project implementation has mainly been caused by delay

             i n design work and l a t e r by shortages of materials.




3.     Para. 1.04




             The lower a c t u a l c o s t noted a t t h e time of evaluation of USS14.2

             m i l l i o n does n o t i n any way represent t h e a c t u a l c o s t of t h e

             project due t o ongoing unfinished works.




4.     Para. 1.08




             The d e f i c i e n c i e s a f f e c t i n g the teaching-learning process i n CNEs

             point t o t h e improper appraisal of t h e project.                  The a p p r a i s a l

             r e p o r t was not comprehensive enough t o determine the r e a l needs of

             t h e f a c i l i t i e s required.          This inadequacy of a p p r a i s a l has made it

             imperative t o include t h i s component i n t h e Seventh Education

             Project a t a much higher c o s t and a consequent s t r a i n on the

             economy of t h e c l i e n t .

                                                          (Page 4 of 12)

5. Para. 1.09



        The location of Bagamoyo In-Service Teachers Centre was and is

        still advantageous.  The later decision to locate education

        management courses (Mantep, 6th IDA) has affected the full

        utilization of the in-service facilities. Experience has shown the

        difficulties of running two institutions at one centre due to

        administrative problems, social distance and financing of recurrent

         costs. There have been discussions of moving Mantep to another

        location. And this has led to delays in implementation of Mantep

        under the Sixth Education Project. All this points to the problem

        of inadequacy of appraisal.



6. Para. 1.10



        The inadequate provision of equipment was rectified under the Sixth

        Project, which arose to meet the real needs of the curriculum. If

        there is inadequacy now it is very minimal.



7. Para. 1.11



        The location of all 8 CECs in one region (Dodoma) with adverse

        environmental and economic conditions was very unfortunate.  It has

        denied this important pilot project a proper comparative

        evauation. The implementation of this project was hampered by

        problems of water, low productivity and lack of community

        participation.  Villagers are more preoccupied with their own

                                                           ATTACHMENT I
                                                           (Page 5 of 12)


         survival problems than voluntary participation in construction of

         the units as envisaged in the project concept. A wide geographical

         dispersion would have provided a worthy comparative assessment for

         duplication in other areas.




8. Para. 1.20



         Though the performance of PIU has been satisfactory against all the

         odds, problems in concept and organization and future projections

         were not fully taken into account. The role the Unit has been

         called upon to play has grown tremendously more than it is capable

         to undertake under the present set up.  The PIU was set up as a

         convenient point of contact and accountability. But very little

         support was given to it in terms of technical staff and training of

         local personnel.




9. Para. 3.07



         It should be noted that besides the industrial foci mentioned new

         ones have emerged in Mbeya, Tabora, Morogoro and Musoma.



10. Para 3.25



         The omission of three new secondary schools on the basis of

         manpower projections were not correct. There is still a great

         demand for manpower in secondary education. The social demand

         for secondary education was and still is on overriding factor in

                                                               ATTACHMENT I
                                                                (Page 6 of 12)


          provision of education facilities. In fact this omission was

          rectified in Seventh Education Project where additional secondary

          schools facilities were provided but at a much higher cost.



    Para. 4.01



          It is not true that the dispersion of the projects was a major

         factor in implementation. Mwanza and Tanga VTC, Bagamoyo and

         Tukuyu CNE were completed within the time schedule though

         dispersed. Muhimbili Operation had all the advantages of close

          supervision and yet to-date is not completed. The CECs located in

         the same area have seriously delayed in implementation.



         It should be noted that the dispersion of education facilities is

         very important for equitable distribution of opportunities and

         hence socio-economic development. The location of education

         facilities, which have pan-territorial intakes, has an important

         impact on the surrounding areas.



12. Para. 4.03



        The widespread distribution of equipment and furniture at Mtwara CNE

        noted in your report was unfortunate. This is rather an

        administrative problem. On the other hand it reflects lack of

         coordination of the various project activities. What happened was

         that the equipment and furniture were ordered and delivered before

         the buildings were completed resulting in lack of storage

         space.    We wish t o inform you that a l l the furniture has been

         properly i n s t a l l e d since then.




13. Para. 4.15




         Though our designs a r e generally good, there is more room f o r

          improvment.      There a r e problems reported i n buildings i n

         use--bedrooms      and furniture a r e singled out.    We still can produce

          cheaper and acceptable designs using local materials a s f a r a s

          possible.      The present designs use imported materials which a r e not

         available i n the country leading t o serious delays i n project

          implementation.




14. Para. 4.16




         The suggestions advanced here are unacceptable and retrogressive.

         Tanzania l i k e any other country is s t r i v i n g for changes i n the way

         of l i f e f o r the better.    To deny the country f o r the changes i s

          unacceptable and misconception.        Development e n t a i l s problems

          because of limited resources.        These problems should be solved a s

          one advances rather than stem the tempo of development.                The

         proposition that western W.C.s        and sanitation f a c i l i t i e s a r e not

         acceptable i s a serious proposition.        The problems of water and

         lack of t o i l e t paper a r e temporary ones due t o the present adverse

         economic conditions.

                                                           ATTACHMENT I
                                                           (Page 8 of 12)

         The allegation that electricity and gas-fired kitchens are

         unpopular and unsuccessful is not true. What is true is that there

         are problems of electricity and gas. The allegation that

         firewood-cooked food is preferred to electricity and gas-cooked

         food is a misconception. On the contrary, firewood cooking is

         cumbersome and troublesome. Cooks keep "crying" because of smoke,

         they smell of smoke, covered with soot and food smells of smoke.



         The proposition that designs should provide 'jiko' cooking, washing

         place and maize pounding and entertainment for women is not true

         under the present living conditions where even in rural areas

         villages own milling machines.



         It puzzles us where the Bank evaluation team obtained these very

         serious, ill-conceived ideas. This section should be omitted

         all-together. A better statement should be "that because of

          problems of water supply, gas and electricity, pit latrines and

         firewood kitchens should be provided as emergency solutions."



15. Para. 4.27



         The point on reorganization and rationalization of training of

          teachers at both levels has been dealt with from time to time. The

         question is also dealt with in the Presidential Commission on

         Education.

                                                                                      ATTACHMENT I
                                                                                      (Page 9 of 12)

16. Para. 6.04




         The u n d e r u t i l i z a t i o n of f a c i l i t i e s provided is accounted f o r by

          l a c k of q u a l i f i e d teachers r a t h e r than i n appropriateness of

          equipment.          What i s s o sophisticated about typewriters and

          needlework?           Certainly these f a c i l i t i e s a r e useful f o r primary

          school teachers.




17. Para. 6.05




          The problems of s c a t t e r e d f u r n i t u r e and equipment have been

          r e c t i f i e d . The use of c e r t a i n science rooms a s s t a f f rooms

          r e f l e c t s f a u l t i n preparation of schedule of accommodation.                    No

          s t a f f rooms were provided i n                t h e designs.   This s i t u a t i o n has been

          r e c t i f i e d by p a r t i t i o n i n g the locker space i n t h e administration

          classroom block i n t o s t a f f room and teachers' o f f i c e s . The

          f u r n i t u r e layout is normally issued t o t h e f u r n i t u r e supplier who

          assembles t h e f u r n i t u r e components and i n s t a l l s it according t o t h e

          layout.           That f u r n i t u r e was found stacked i n c o r r i d o r s was due t o

          t h e f a c t t h a t t h e f u r n i t u r e supplier completed h i s work when c i v i l

          construction works.




18. Para. 6.06




          The problem of laboratory f i t t i n g s and gas f i t t i n g s was

19. Para. 6.07




          It is true that cooks and students do not like the electrical

         kitchen euqipment.            The general problem is i n s u f f i c i e n t power

         supply and l a c k of funds f o r l i g h t i n g and c a t e r i n g services.   The

          firewood kitchens provided a r e meant t o solve the above problems a s

         emergency provisions.

         The cupboards a r e already i n s t a l l e d i n the s t a f f houses.       The

         assembly o u t s i d e was because the houses were not completed when the

         f u r n i t u r e assembly was i n progress.




21. Para. 6.10




          I wonder why the sewage system should only be a problem to staff

         houses and not i n dormitories and teaching areas?                   Something must

         be wrong somewhere!



22. Para. 6.11




         I would hope the program of studies for the facilities to be

         provided a r e determined i n project preparation and confirmed i n the

         The omission observed i s not c l e a r l y understood.                          Something was

         wrong i n p r o j e c t conception, a p p r a i s a l and subsequent

          implementation.




23. Para. 6.13




         This point is d e a l t with i n my e a r l i e r comment.                     However I, do not

         agree t h a t t h e in-service courses experience t h e same problems a s

         Mantep.            This is because management courses need contact with

          s i m i l a r i n s t i t u t i o n s and o t h e r establishments t o study management

          p r a c t i c e s , whereas in-service t r a i n i n g is supposed t o be i n t e n s i v e

          and p r a c t i c a l i n nature requiring a calm atmosphere with l e s s

                                                                    (Page 12 of 12)


25. Para. 6.30



         The suggestion that the construction of CECs could probably be

          b e t t e r done by regions has l i t t l e evidence. This is because under

          the F i f t h Education Project the regions/districts were given the

          responsibility of constructing s t a f f houses under a self-help

          scheme.        Out of 1,500 f o r VMTP only 325 were completed a t the close

          of the credit i n June 1982.



26. Para. 6.38



          The observation here points t o the mistake of locating the CECs i n

          one area.        There is a danger of generalization.     Both the centres

          a r e located i n a low productive and low-income area.       The

          experience could have been otherwise had the CECs been dispersed.




27. Para. 6.39



          It should be noted that Mlowa Barabarani and Mpunguzi have

          frequently been chosen the best villages i n the Dodoma' region.

          This points t o the f a c t that positive success can be drawn from

          t h i s p i l o t project.
