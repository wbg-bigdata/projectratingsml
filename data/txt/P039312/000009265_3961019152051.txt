REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
SECOND EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L. URBAN SECTOR
A. SECTOR OVERVIEW
1.1         Demographic Trends. The current urban population of Indonesia exceeds 55
million, or nearly 30% of the national total population of 190 million. Indonesia's urban growth
rates have accelerated during the past 15 years, averaging nearly 6 percent per year during the
past decade, more than double the overall national population growth rate. About 80 million
people, or 40 percent of Indonesians, will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Indonesia's urban
settlements include 15 metropolitan and large cities of at least half a million people, 40 secondary
cities of 100,000 to 500,000 residents (provincial capitals and incorporated municipalities), 200
smaller towns (mainly regency headquarters) of 20,000 to 100,000 population, and about 3,200
service centers and subdistrict headquarters with 3,000 to 20,000 people. Approximately 70% of
Indonesia's urban population reside in the cities and towns on the island of Java.
1.2         Institutional Framework. At the national level, there is no single ministry for
urban development. The National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS, is responsible for
overall planning and allocation of GOI development resources managed in the framework of Five-
Year Development Plans (REPELITA) and Annual National Development Budgets (APBN).
Within BAPPENAS, the Bureau for Urban Development, Settlement and Public Housing, under
Deputy Chairman V (Regional and Provincial Development), is responsible for oversight and
coordination of urban infrastructure development, in cooperation with other involved Bureaus
(e.g. Transport under Deputy I). All key central agencies with responsibilities in the urban sector
are represented in the Inter-agency Coordinating Team for Urban Development (Tim Koordinasi -
TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS.
1.3         The principal central ministries involved in urban issues are the Ministry of Home
Affairs, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs
(MHA) is responsible for oversight of the regional governments, primarily through its Directorate
General for Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) and Directorate General for
Regional Development (BANGDA). The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has technical
responsibility for oversight of most infrastructure development and resulting services provision.
Within MPW, the following directorates-general are responsible for urban infrastructure: the
Directorate General for Human Settlements (Cipta Karya or DGCK) is responsible for oversight
of city and regional planning, water supply, urban drainage, sanitation and sewerage, solid waste
management, kampung improvement programs (KIP), and market infrastructure improvement
programs (MIIP); the Directorate General for Roads (Bina Marga or DGBM) is responsible for
oversight of urban roads and bridges; and the Directorate General for Water Resource



- 2 -
Development (Pengairan or DGWRD) is responsible for urban flood control and bulk water
supply. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for central and local finance; the
Directorate General for Budget (Anggaran or DGA) administers budget transfers.
1.4         At the regional levels, provincial (Level I) and local (Level II) governments
operate with increasing responsibilities and delegated authority. In all, there are 27 provinces and
304 local governments, including 57 kotamadyas (urban municipalities) and 247 kabupatens
(regencies). Legislative powers at both provincial and local levels are held by elected People's
Representative Councils (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah or DPRD).
1.5         Under Indonesia's unitary system  of government, all units of sub-national
government are within the Ministry of Home Affairs. Provincial governments are headed by
appointed governors who represent the President and the central government; the governors also
head the semi-autonomous provincial administrations. Bupatis (regency heads) and Walikotas
(municipal mayors) represent provincial governments, and head their own local governments.
Regional Development Planning Agencies (BAPPEDA I and II) report directly to their respective
governors, regency heads or mayors, and are responsible for planning and resource allocation,
while the senior administrative officer at each level is the Regional Secretary (Sekwilda I and II).
Regional government services are provided by separate departments (Dinas I and II) analogous to
line ministries of the central government, who have their own deconcentrated regional offices
(KANWIL) for implementing central GOI projects.
1.6         Sectoral Coordination and Local Participation.  Due to the hierarchical
administrative system, coordination of the urban sector has been difficult. The large size and
diversity of the country, the rapid pace of urbanization, the number of concerned agencies, poor
resource allocation and cultural constraints to effective communication within and among
agencies, have led to a somewhat fragmented approach to urban development. In order to
improve coordination and targeting of resources to local urban services needs, the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI) policy of decentralization needs to be pursued more effectively.
1.7         Increasingly, it is becoming apparent from development experience worldwide that
effective community involvement leads to improved service provision.  GOI's desire to
decentralize is requiring the adoption of practical means of public participation, with increased
accountability of local leaders and government staff. By entering into constructive dialogue with
the community, officials are also able to better plan and program needed service improvements.
GOI regulations for annual development budget preparation (the RAKORBANG process) call for
community consultation and participation at all levels, but implementation of this process is
uneven.
1.8         Sector Constraints and Priorities. Average incomes in urban areas have risen
substantially over the past decade; however, income distribution remains relatively skewed and in
1990, more than 17 percent of Indonesian urban dwellers were estimated to live in "absolute
poverty" based on their expenditure levels. The problems of low income are exacerbated by
deficiencies in basic services and degraded environmental conditions. Country-wide, only about
20-25 percent of urban households have direct access to piped water supply, another 15 percent



- 3 -
buy drinking water from vendors or standposts, and the rest rely on shallow wells and sometimes
on surface water courses. Surface water courses in urban areas are almost universally polluted
due to inadequately treated wastewater. Only about 40 percent of urban households have access
to adequate sanitation facilities. In the larger cities, inadequate industrial water supply, and liquid
and solid waste disposal are serious problems. To meet GOI's service and equity objectives, more
investment is needed in local or tertiary systems in poorly served urban areas. The Bank's 1993
Urban Public Infrastructure Services Report (No. 12154-IND) estimated that the 1990
infrastructure investment backlog was at least some US$5 billion for the main five subsectors
(piped water, sanitation, solid waste, urban roads, and drainage). Further, a substantial backlog
prevails in the maintenance of facilities, which has resulted in decreased productivity of previous
infrastructure investments.
1.9          Sector Finances. Finances of provincial and local governments have long been
dominated by central government transfers and are characterized by weak local resource
mobilization, low per-capita budgets and limited use of credit for capital investment. The
traditionally dominant role played by GOI central government financing of local government
infrastructure is partly due to the GOI unitary system which limits local authority for levying
taxes. Grants and other revenue sharing mechanisms used by GOI are intended to resolve the
disparity between increasingly decentralized service responsibilities and local resource
mobilization. Although grant allocation criteria have been modified to respond better to local
needs and shortfalls (compared to minimum standards), there is a need to more closely relate
grant allocations to local performance and economic productivity requirements.
1.10        Local governments are required by MHIA to prepare and implement Revenue
Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) to improve revenues under their own administration. While
this has improved the situation in many local governments including those in East Java, there is
still much room for further local revenue growth. Restructuring of central-local government
financial relationships and improved fiscal capacities for local governments in Indonesia are topics
of on-going policy dialogue which are gaining increased urgency as growth in urban services
requirements outpaces local capacities to respond. The larger infrastructure projects are still
often financed directly from the national budget (APBN/DIP) and are executed by the regional
offices of central government agencies (Kanwil) for subsequent transfer to the local government.
However, these projects frequently lead to land acquisition and/or operations and maintenance
(O&M) obligations which the local governments are not fully capable of undertaking or
sustaining. Local government borrowing capacities are generally quite limited and incentives to
borrow are weak in the current financing pattern, although some capable local government are
willing to accelerate their development program by borrowing.
1.11        Urban Infrastructure Issues.  The main problems and issues faced by all
Indonesian urban areas are: (a) serious infrastructure deficiencies and O&M backlogs; (b) lack of
coordination in integrating infrastructure investments with land management and transport
objectives; (c) no administrative status for urban areas, other than the largest cities (Kotamadya);
(d) weak management of water enterprises; (e) poor financial management system including
deficient accounting practices, the lack of adequate cost recovery, weak revenue generation, and
little use of credit, as well as poor information systems; (f) inefficient programming of the design



-4 -
and construction cycles, often compressed into single fiscal years; (g) complex relationships
among local, provincial and central agencies with respect to responsibilities for project and
program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and O&M; and (h) shortage of trained
and experienced managerial and technical personnel at all levels.
B. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
1.12         UIUDP Approach. With large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and a fast-
growing urban population, GOI's strategy in the past has emphasized physical infrastructure
targets: length of roads to be built, percentage of population to be supplied with piped water,
sanitation services, etc.  These targets have a prominent place in the five year national
development plans (REPELITAs). In 1987, GOI issued a statement of urban policies,
representing a consolidated view of development in the sector. This Policy Statement for Urban
Development, incorporated in REPELITA V (for the period 1989-94) includes: (a) strengthening
local governments to build, operate and maintain local services; (b) improving the planning and
programming of urban infrastructure investments; (c) mobilization of local revenues and the
optimization of their use; and (d) strengthening consultative processes at various levels of
government, particularly the participation of municipalities and regencies.
1.13        GOI's Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development
Programs (IUMDP) as the operational approach for achieving the above objectives. The policy
was translated into action plans for local institutional strengthening (Local Institutional
Development Action Plan or LIDAP) and improvements in local resource mobilization (RIAP),
sector programming, and financing arrangements. GOI has also provided (with domestic funds)
further support to the reform effort of the local government revenue departments (DISPENDA),
initiated under . the Fifth Urban Project (Loan 2408-IND).  In the current five-year plan
(REPELITA VI), GOI has continued to develop the LUIDP process to emphasize the following
priorities: (a) expanding the scope of the IUMDP process to include additional subsectors which
are important in promoting the economic development of cities; (b) strengthening local
government institutional capabilities; (c) improving O&M of urban infrastructure; (d) improving
cost recovery and implementation of a more fully integrated system for the financing of urban
infrastructure services; and (e) increasing attention to urban land and environmental management.
GOI is also encouraging experimentation by local governments with various mechanisms for
private sector participation in urban services delivery.
1.14        GOI also issued regulations and policy clarifications to operationalize urban sector
policy and the IUIDP approach; with World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral
assistance, GOI created a nation-wide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation
beginning in 1987; and UNDP/UNCHS and the Bank supported a central assistance team to the
IUIDP process led by TKPP at BAPPENAS. To date more than 75 percent of local governments
have completed IUIDP program preparation and initiated implementation.
1.15        Local Borrowing. Under REPELITA V, GOI also gave priority to the expansion
of borrowing by local governments and their water enterprises (PDAMs). To induce a higher
level of credit financing, GOI adopted less conservative financial criteria for borrowing by local



-5 -
entities (debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 for local government general fuind
operations and not less than 1.3 for local enterprises such as PDAMs). This has brought the legal
borrowing capacity of local governments, particularly the larger municipalities, more in line with
their considerably underutilized financial capacity. There is, nevertheless, a natural preference for
grant financing on the part of local governments, especially for investments that do not directly
generate revenues through service charges. GOI's intent is to fix medium and long-term interest
rates for local governments and their enterprises at a level approximating market rates for
development borrowings, but suitable reference rates reflecting market conditions for long-term
borrowing are only now emerging from recent public sector bond sales. The Ministry of Finance
sets fixed rates for local government borrowings each year for loans initiated during that year; for
the past two years the rate has been 11.75% which has been positive in real terms and generally
approximates market borrowing costs.
1.16        REPELITA VI. REPELITA VI and the second 25 Year National Development
Plan, both of which started in April 1994, emphasize sustainable urban development through
improvement in the quality of the living environment, support for economic growth, reduction in
regional development disparities, and povertyalleviation. Perhaps the most significant change
reflected in REPELITA VI is to shift the focus of GOI urban programs from overcoming current
service deficits to a more forward-looking emphasis on the investments needed to realize the
economic potential of urban areas, including their functions as service centers for regional
development. While continuing the basic premises of REPELITA V and the National Policy
Statement for Urban Development mentioned above, REPELITA VI takes a more strategic
approach by expanding the IUIDP into an Integrated Urban Development Program (IUDP) that
includes: (a) a larger number of smaller cities and towns; (b) broader spatial planning and urban
planning in addition to public works infrastructure development plans; (c) expanding the scope of
the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) to cover low income and rental housing, infrastructure
provision for low-income areas, and urban renewal; (d) involving the private sector and
communities to a greater extent; and (e) strengthening environmental sustainability. To accelerate
decentralization and implementation of plans, emphasis is being placed on better use of resources,
mobilization of local revenues, developing financing mechanisms, and increasing cost recovery by
municipalities and their agencies. Better coordination and strengthening of local agencies is also
being sought. Financing policies for urban services emphasize local government revenue
improvement as well as greater efficiency in the deployment of the revenues, and increased use of
the central government lending and special urban grant mechanisms as the means of financing
urban development under local management.
1.17        Environment and Resettlement. In 1993, GOI enacted Government Regulation
51/93 on environmental impact assessment, mitigation and monitoring measures, and Presidential
Decree (KEPRES) 55/93 on land acquisition for the development of public facilities, to improve
on earlier decrees and their application. Government Regulation 51/93 makes refinements to
GOI's environmental assessment procedures, which are now substantially consistent with Bank
policies and best practices under Bank-financed projects. Implementing regulations for KEPRES
55/95 (Operational Directive 1/94 by the National Land Agency - BPN ) were issued in June 1994
and implementation of these improved procedures is currently underway. KEPRES 55/93 and
BPN-OD 1/94 seek to ensure persons affected by project land acquisition have adequate access to



- 6 -
information, fair negotiations, compensation packages based on market values, and grievance
procedures. However, there are still some policy matters, primarily in the areas of entitlement
eligibility, compensation calculations and funding sources, where there is some divergence from
Bank's Operational Directive regarding involuntary resettlement (OD 4.30).  One of the
institutional capacity building tasks of the project will be to assist East Java province and the local
governments to fully comply with GOI and related Bank requirements for environment and
resettlement issues (see paras. 5.30-5.35).
II. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
2.1         Overall Sector Experience. The Bank has been involved in the urban water
supply sector since the 1960s, with relatively little change in approach. While many projects have
provided substantial economic and health benefits, the experience indicates: (a) supply of water
has lagged behind increasing demand; (b) delays in project implementation are common; (c)
improving institutions and achieving cost-recovery have been slow, difficult and neglected; (d)
water quality is a persistent problem; and (e) disposal of waste water in densely populated areas
has been difficult.
2.2         Bank involvement in the urban sector started in the early 1970s with low cost
investment projects in shelter, water supply, sanitation, and urban transport, aimed at alleviating
urban poverty. Sites and services and slum upgrading projects were to demonstrate replicable
approaches benefiting the poor, while recovering costs and reducing the financial burden on the
public sector. Many of these projects succeeded in physical terms, but had little impact on the
policies of national and local governments and on urban management. The Bank had not paid
adequate attention to the policy and institutional requirements for improving the productivity of
the urban economy and reducing urban poverty, and improving management of the urban
environment. Further, as many of the urban programs did not achieve sustainable policy reform
and institutional development, project approaches were generally not replicable outside the
framework of Bank financial support.
2.3         By the mid-1980s the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to shifts in
approaches to the urban sector. It was recognized that central governments alone were unable to
meet the increasing needs for infrastructure services of rapidly growing urban populations and
greater efforts had to be devoted to: (a) improving the management capability of urban
institutions and inter-governmental fiscal relations; (b) improving local resource mobilization; (c)
enhancing the management and quality of urban infrastructure, particularly with regard to
maintenance; (d) establishing enabling rather than constraining regulatory frameworks; (e)
expanding financial services for urban development; and (f) promoting private sector participation
in urban service delivery. Recent initiatives by governments and donors in these areas reflect a
growing appreciation of the importance of policies, institutions, and regulations in formulating
effective strategies to manage urban growth.
2.4         Experience in Indonesia.  The Bank has financed 13 completed and eight
ongoing urban and water supply projects in Indonesia since 1974, for more than sixty local



- 7 -
governments and many of their water enterprises (see Annex 1). Urban lending operations in
Indonesia have progressed from demonstration projects in Jakarta through more programmatic
investments in selected other large cities, to sector lending within an agreed policy and
institutional framework (although still limited in terms of area and subsectoral scope). Water
supply projects initially covered only a few cities at a time, but later, like Bank projects in other
countries, assisted a large number of urban settlements under one operation. Details concerming
Bank-funded water and urban infrastructure projects are available from a study carried out by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in September 1995 entitled, 'Indonesia: Impact
Evaluation Report, Enhancing the Quality of Life in Urban Indonesia - The Legacy of Kampung
Improvement Program" (Report no. 14747-IND). In urban transport projects, or the transport
components of urban development projects, attention has focused on road construction and traffic
management and maintenance. Even so, implementation of road schemes has been slower than
expected, and quality of construction has frequently been the cause of reduced facility lifespan.
Inadequate attention was given to improvement of public transport services and facilities for non-
motorized vehicles or pedestrians.
2.5         Bank experience confirms that: (a) limited planning and implementation capacities
at the central government level, and the difficulties inherent in providing essentially local services
by central government departments, reduce the efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b) capacity
building at the local level is a long-term process that needs to be accompanied by structural and
institutional strengthening to achieve an increase in local responsibility and accountability; and (c)
to develop such responsibility and accountability, central-local financial relations need to provide
more local government autonomy and enable private sector involvement. Furthermore, the OED
study cited above concluded that under conditions of rapid economic development, targeted urban
sector improvement programs can have a very positive impact on low-income areas, and that
those impacts can be achieved at a low cost of investment that reaps high economic rates of
return. The mid-term review of the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project (EJBUDP - Loan
3304-IND) carried out in February 1994 supports this conclusion (see Annex 2). The proposed
project design takes into account these lessons. Significant responsibility in subproject selection
and implementation will be handled by the local governments and their water enterprises with
provincial support in the proposed programmatic approach to this project; suitable assistance in
project management, local revenue administration, and improvements in operations and
maintenance will be provided; and management advisory services will be provided to the water
enterprises.
2.6         Bank Sector Strategy. The Bank has oriented its overall sector lending to assist
the Government to deliver adequate urban infrastructure services in cost-effective ways. GOI and
the Bank emphasize improvements in: (a) service levels, particularly for lower income groups; (b)
urban productivity and the effectiveness of investments through better infrastructure planning and
programming, especially at the city level, (c) enhanced local government capacity for fiscal
management, revenue mobilization, project implementation and O&M; (d) the urban environment
by enhancing local government capacity to plan, build and operate infrastructure in an
environmentally sound fashion; and (e) by enhanced community participation.



- 8 -
2.7         In promoting efficient urban development, the Bank's strategy supports the
expanded IUDP approach; however, implementation should include both sectoral and integrated
approaches as appropriate. While all plans should be integrated, in some cases, implementation
could be handled through separate sectoral projects. For example, in smaller municipalities
multisectoral projects are generally of manageable size and complexity; an integrated investment
approach would, therefore, be more appropriate. In other cases, where the requirements of a
particular sector are sufficiently large and complex, both in technical terms as well as on policy,
institutional and financial matters, sectoral projects within the framework of an integrated plan
may be better suited to implementation capacities.
2.8         The Bank's urban development financing strategy in Indonesia emphasizes
increased local resource mobilization through the improvement and efficient deployment of local
government and water enterprise own-source revenues, including appropriate use of the enhanced
borrowing capacities which will arise as a consequence of the improvements in revenue. Even
with such improvements, however, the capacities of the local institutions to contribute to the
financing of the extensive urban infrastructure deficiencies will in most cases remain limited for
the foreseeable future, occasioning a continuing need for supplementary special assistance from
the central government in the form of non-repayable financing contributions. Recognizing the
need for such special assistance to be structured so as to provide an incentive for the mobilization
of improved local revenues into the urban infrastructure sectors, as well as to promote the
objective of decentralization of responsibilities to the local level, the Bank supports the provision
of assistance in the form of financial investment grants which complement local revenues and
borrowing contributions on a matching principle, with the implementation of the grants being
managed by the local institutions. In all these respects the Bank's strategy is fully in accord with
the policies enunciated in REPELITA VI.
2.9         The Bank's strategy also promotes establishing an enabling regulatory and planning
framework for urban land management. A key focus of the Bank's strategy will be to support
G0I efforts to establish an effective land management system and simplify other regulations to
facilitate more efficient and environmentally sound urban land use and strengthen land tenure.
The Bank is also assisting the Government to develop improved implementation frameworks for
addressing environmental and social impacts of urban projects.
2.10        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Indonesia discussed in March 1995 highlights the need for improving public service
delivery in the economy and to the poor in particular, greater decentralization of responsibilities,
and improved environmental management. In the urban sector, the Bank therefore supports the
integrated urban development concept and enhancing coordination of planning, implementation
and supervision among all levels of government, in order to improve the delivery of urban services
and enable local governments to assume greater responsibility for urban management. The
proposed project would help GOI meet these needs in the second most populous province of
Indonesia by emphasizing: the decentralization of responsibility for project management and
implementation; the integration of environmental considerations in urban development
management; the strengthening of local government institutions and human resources for urban
management; the improved access to services, priced at an affordable level to lower income



-9-
groups and under-serviced areas, as well as new development areas; community participation in
urban investment programs; and the generation of resources for infrastructure investment. The
thrust of the project is also consistent with the poverty alleviation and environmental improvement
objectives of the CAS as the project includes targeted interventions designed to improve the
standard of living and the quality of the environment in the poorer kampung areas of the city of
Malang and smaller urban areas throughout the province.
2.11        During the past two decades, the Bank has provided critical support and strategic
input to the evolving GOI urban policy agenda. With its tradition of administrative competence
and its diversity of local conditions, East Java has served as an appropriate venue for Bank-GOI
urban collaboration during this entire period, from early urban projects in Surabaya and two
provincial-scale water supply projects to the integrated program concepts now being
implemented.  The ongoing EJBUDP represents a radical departure from  previous urban
operations in an attempt to operationalize Bank support to implementing the GOI urban policy.
The EJBUDP pioneered approaches to decentralized Bank operation in Indonesia, including the
utilization of provincial capacities for intermediation and the programmatic application of
environmental assessment procedures. As documented by the mid-term review of EJBUDP in
1994 (see Annex 2 for summary), the remarkable success of East Java and Bali provincial and
local governments in preparing and implementing local integrated programs has established the
basis for further development of this decentralized model. The proposed operation provides an
opportunity for GOI and the Bank to address some of the remaining local services deficits and
issues identified in the mid-term review, while preparing a more strategic regional approach to
urban infrastructure and services provision, as called for in the GOI REPELITA VI and Second
25-Year Plan. The Bank's continued participation in the refinement of GOI urban strategy is a
cornerstone of the Bank's CAS and is essential to its success.
Im. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN EAST JAVA
A. POPULATION AND URBAN SERVICES
3.1         Population.  With over 32.5 million people in 1990, East Java province has a
larger population than Central Java and Yogyakarta combined, with only West Java province
having a larger population. The average population growth rate during the 1980s was 1.1%
annually, the lowest among Indonesia's provinces. This low total growth, however, conceals the
fact that East Java is a rapidly urbanizing province with the urban population growing at an
average annual rate of 4.5% during the 1980s. By 1990 East Java's urban population had reached
some 9 million, about 27.4% of the total population. The capital of East Java, Surabaya, is the
second largest city in Indonesia, with a population of over 3.5 million in 1990. The province has
three other large cities (i.e., Malang, Kediri, and Jember) of more than 250,000 inhabitants in
1990, as well as five additional incorporated cities and six unincorporated towns with urban
populations between 100,000 and 200,000. Perhaps most significantly, there are more than 100
unincorporated towns in East Java with populations ranging from 10,000 to more than 100,000
(see Annex 3 for list of towns and cities), nearly all of which are growing more rapidly than the
provincial total population. This urban growth is being driven by several factors.



- 10-
3.2          First, the composition of East Java's regional economy experienced a structural
shift during the 1970s and 1980s. The share of Gross Regional Products (GRP) contributed by
agriculture declined from some 50% in 1971 to less than 30% in 1987, and the industrial sector
(mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities, and construction) increased from about 14% to
nearly 24% over the same period, most of the change occurring after 1983. There was also an
increase in the services sector, mainly in the trade and transport sectors, from 36% to some 47%.
Moderate but sustained rates of growth were achieved in all the three sectors, agriculture
averaging 3.5% per year during 1983 to 1987, manufacturing 7.2%, and services 6.4%. This
balanced diversification of economic activities is what distinguishes East Java from other
provinces and is the major stimulant to East Java's development. Incomplete data from more
recent years suggest that these trends are continuing, even accelerating with nearly all growth
focused in urban areas. It is clear that East Java will be a focal point in the transition of
Indonesia's economy during the coming years.
3.3          Second, along with the shift of the regional economy, the central core region of the
province, bounded by Surabaya, Malang, Kediri, Pasuruan and Probolinggo, which has long been
a highly-productive plantation area for sugar cane and an extremely fertile rice-growing region,
became a center of manufacturing industry growth. This uniquely productive area contributes an
unusually high share of Indonesia's tax revenues. The poorest parts of the province are found on
the island of Madura, in the four southwestern regencies in the remote and relatively isolated
limestone hills (Pacitan, Ponorogo, Trenggalek, and Tulungagung) and in the northwestern
districts of Bojonegoro and Tuban along the Solo River valley. There is limited agriculture
potential in these areas due to water shortages or periodic flooding, and there is little prospect of
developing manufacturing industries on any significant scale because of locational disadvantages.
People therefore are moving out of these areas to the core urban region in search of employment
opportunities and higher income. Thus, East Java is urbanizing rapidly, and in combination with
the economic transition noted above, must aggressively prepare for faster urban growth while
protecting its unique natural resources and agricultural productivity.
3.4         Urban Services. Despite the initial efforts made under the EJBUDP and other
previous projects, the continuing rapid urban growth has exerted heavy pressures upon urban
infrastructure and there are significant backlogs in the provision of urban infrastructure services.
For example, in the water supply subsector, piped water connection coverage is typically low and
almost all existing distribution and connection pipes are cracked and leaking, causing water
contamination and large water losses. In the urban road transport subsector, some 7,000 km of
roads are in a state of serious deterioration. There is no integrated major road network and traffic
is congested on major roads and in business centers. In the solid waste management subsector,
less than half of the solid waste is being collected. Collection and treatment equipment falls short
of fast growing demand and access roads to waste disposal sites are also inadequate. In the
human waste/sanitation subsector, facilities and collection equipment are inadequate and
desludging volume is less than 20% of the volume produced. In the drainage/flood control
subsector, poor maintenance, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs lead to flooding
problems in many low lying areas and along river banks.



- 11 -
3.5         Lack of adequate basic urban infrastructure services hurts the poor most because it
is primarily they who do not have access to clean and affordable water and waste disposal
facilities, and who usually live in low-lying areas that are often affected by flooding. Income
disparities between the richest and the poorest groups in East Java are still wide by Indonesia
standards. The Bank's 1993 analysis of poverty in Indonesia showed that East Java has the largest
number of residents in poverty of any province. In addition, East Java's urban poor were found
to have the largest 'poverty gap" to overcome among those provinces with significant urban
populations.
3.6         Insufficient urban infrastructure services also restrain East Java's industrial sector
from fully realizing its potential. East Java has the second largest industrial complex in Indonesia
in terms of employment and establishments, and it contributes at least 21.5% of the national value
added by manufacturing. East Java also produces the highest non-oil gross domestic product
among all the provinces. However, inadequate infrastructure services make the industrial
production and distribution inefficient and frustrate foreign capital investments. In 1994 several
hundred approved foreign investment applications, which were expected to provide the needed
impetus to the regional economic development, failed to materialize at least in part because of the
infrastructure deficiencies, primarily in water supply, transport and waste disposal.
3.7         Utilizing the data and forecasts of economic activity in East Java presented in the
recent Bank report: 'Indonesia: Environment and Development: A World Bank Country Study',
Figure 3.1 on the following page graphically displays the potential environmental problems to be
faced by East Java provincial and local governments without an aggressive effort to develop
public and private infrastructure and institutional capacities, particularly environmental and natural
resource management capacities. The provincial government has recognized the implications of
economic growth for its natural resources and related land and water-dependent activities, and has
initiated efforts to strengthen regional management and regulatory frameworks, as noted in the
following section. The recent rates of conversion of farmland to urban uses, together with recent
water shortages and pollution problems with both water and air attest to the urgency of these
issues in East Java, and the high priority of efforts to articulate a regional development strategy.
B. STRATEGIC PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING
3.8         Both East Java Province and the city of Malang have recently prepared updated
spatial plans and development strategy documents. The City of Malang program focuses on the
city's role as a center of higher education and its potential as a tourism and retirement center.
The provincial plan emphasizes the industrial development potential of the north coast area and
the corridor fi am Surabaya to Malang. The potential for utilizing the regional cultural heritage as
the impetus for a strengthened tourism industry is also evaluated, but not developed in detail.
Further work is needed to define the policy framework required to realize the regional
development potential; this will be the focus of the efforts to prepare the proposed East Java
Strategic Regional Development Program (EJUDP 3).

than looking toward realizing economic potential; (b) the traditional spatial planning and
implementation tools available to provincial and local governments do not address many of the
critical issues now facing the region, nor are appropriate roles for private sector and public
participation provided in current procedures; (c) recent GOI attempts to streamline foreign
investment approvals have further undermined the provincial-local roles in spatial and
environmental management, and (d) the responsibilities for financing and managing the provision
of services remains unclear in many aspects, particularly regional-scale facilities serving key
economic activities and protecting public health/environmental quality.
3.10        GOI and East Java province have thus requested Bank support to prepare a further
operation, an East Java Strategic Regional Development Program which would define an
urban/regional investment and management strategy for implementation beginning with
REPELITA VII (1999-2004), to include at least the following major components:
-     Analysis of Regional Economic Potential and Strategy Development Options
-     Water Resources Management Strategy for Brantas River and Solo River Basins
-     Regional Transportation System Development Program
-     Cultural Assets Protection Program and Tourism Development Strategy
-     Spatial Structure Plans at Provincial and Local Levels (including programs for
protection of agricultural production capacity)
-     Development of Simplified Land Use Controls and Spatial Management Tools
-     Framework for Private Sector and Public Participation
-     Review and Clarification of Central-Local Financing and Management
Responsibilities for Infrastructure and Public Services
-     Medium-Term Capital Investment Budgets and O&M Programs for all Units
-     Urban Policy Action Plan (UPAP) for East Java, related to GOI UPAP with
emphasis on necessary institutional capacity-building.
3.11        The East Java Provincial Development Planning Agency (BAPPEDA I) proposes
to lead this ambitious effort to prepare coordinated regional and local development plans, in close
coordination with BAPPENAS and other involved central agencies. In much the same fashion as
the EJBUDP preparation provided a practical forum for Bank-GOI dialogue to operationalize the
1987 Urban Policy Statement, the proposed elements of the East Java Strategic Regional
Development Program will provide opportunities to design creative responses to the critical
urban/regional development challenges currently faced by East Java and most other urban areas of
Indonesia. It is GOI's stated intent to seek broad involvement of the donor community in
developing this strategic approach and building support for its implementation, with the Bank
providing overall guidance and assistance in coordinating this complex process. Arrangements
for initiating the input studies and coordination mechanisms, including the pending request for a
PHRD-Japan Grant to finance design and initiate preparation of the proposed subsequent
project, will be discussed during negotiations.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION
4.1         The proposed Second East Java Urban Development Project is requested by GOI
and East Java Province as an extension of the current East Java-Bali Urban Development Project
(EJBUDP). The Bank completed a mid-term review of the current project in June 1994 (see
summary in Annex 2) and agreed with GOI to a reallocation of loan funds which essentially
completed the commitment of the loan ($180.3 million) during the GOI fiscal year 1994-95,
ended March 31, 1995. Completion of major civil works and institutional strengthening
assis.ance, with minor additional new works will carry the current project through GOI FY 95-96.
The proposed project would provide a continuation of the modest and generally successful efforts
of 'Cast Java local governments to overcome current infrastructure and services deficits. The
significance of continuing urban project momentum in East Java can, in fact, be understood by
: eviewing the strategic nature and results to date of the current project.
4.2         The EJBUDP has been mutually regarded by GOI and the Bank from the outset of
project identification in 1987 as a 'pilot" or 'hew model" for urban infrastructure and local
services delivery programs, intended to give operational reality to the GOI Urban Policy
Statement adopted in 1987, underpinning the Urban Sector Loan (2616-IND). The EJBUDP
program reflects the six key priority areas of the GOI Urban Policy Statement and the related
Policy Action Plan, which was being implemented in parallel with the preparation of EJBUDP,
and which GOI recently reconfirmed and extended as the basis for policy actions in the current
GOI five-year development plan (REPELITA VI). The six policy themes were:
(a)   Decentralization of urban services delivery responsibilities to local governments
(kabupatens/kotamadyas), as their capacities permit;
(b)   Preparation and implementation of local urban improvement programs with the
framework of the GOI Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program
(IUIDP), defined to include physical infrastructure investment and O&M for public
works sub-sectors and programs;
(c)   Development of local government institutional capacities to manage and sustain
urban services delivery systems to rapidly growing urban populations:
(d)   Strengthening of local government capacities to mobilize resources and optimize
the use of funds under their control;
(e)   Improvement in the framework for coordination and consultation among the
involved agencies (i) new/revised mechanisms for local government borrowing and
(ii) improved criteria for allocation of grants; and



- 15 -
(f)   Rationalizing the procedures for coordination and consultation among the involved
agencies and levels of government (central, provincial, and local) to improve
communication and facilitate implementation efforts.
4.3   The preparation of EJBUDP (1988-1990) was extended and somewhat impaired by the
uneven progress achieved toward implementing the Urban Policy Action Plan, and in several
important areas it was left to the EJBUDP preparation team to provide an operational definition
or interpretation of the Policy Statement's implications for urban programs. In this context, the
EJBUDP incorporates significant departures from previous GOI and Bank urban operations,
while attempting to build on the positive features of past experience (e.g. KIP). The mid-term
review focused on the innovative components or major departures from previous projects in
attempting to assess the development impact of this 'pilot" effort. It must be noted that many of
the successful innovations/departures developed during EJBUDP have already been replicated in
other Bank urban projects, as well as projects financed by other donors (particularly ADB).
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.4         The medium-term development objectives of the proposed project are (i) to
improve urban infrastructure service delivery, and (ii) to develop necessary financial and
institutional capacity in local governments to sustain urban services; more specific operational
objectives of the project include:
(a)   to improve the provision of urban services (roads, water supply, sanitation,
drainage and solid waste management) to residential communities and economic
activities throughout East Java in line with the modest service standards targeted
by REPELITA VI, which gives priority to poor and underserved neighborhoods
(i.e. reduction of current infrastructure/service deficits);
(b)   to continue the institutional development assistance provided for local and
provincial government agencies under the EJBUDP, particularly to strengthen
local capacities for operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban services systems,
and increase the effectiveness of local resource mobilization and management; and
(c)   to support GOI and East Java efforts to operationally define the REPELITA VII
urban/regional development strategy to include environmental management, land
development controls, and private sector participation in an improved planning and
infrastructure investment framework for realizing regional development potentials
by supporting the preparation of an East Java Strategic Regional Development
Program (FY99S in the lending program).
4.5         Measuring Progress Toward Project Objectives. The project design further
refines the successful EJBUDP model of decentralized project implementation and 'bottom-up"
approach to selection of investment and action priorities, which implies that monitoring of
implementation progress and impact must be focused at the local government level. However, in
accordance with both GOI and Bank requirements, project progress reporting must support a



- 16 -
procedure to evaluate the performance of the project in aggregate toward achieving development
objectives for the province, including all 36 local governments and 7 subsectors. Given the wide
variation in current conditions, local capacities and priorities, the project design has been
structured to support a two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process to include: (a) the continued
operation and strengthening of comprehensive program management systems in each locality and
participating PDAM as used in EJBUDP and familiar to local officials (generally measuring
implementation performance in terms of actual input and output quantities and process milestones
versus agreed implementation/action plans), and (b) the selection of a few key measures or
'priority targets" within each local program (PJM) to be used as indicators of outcomes or
impacts of highest importance in the local context toward attaining project development
objectives. As in EJBUDP, the provincial compilation of all local project data will allow
aggregation of project results and provide an overview of total achievements of the project. Both
tiers of this progress measurement approach are presented in Annex 4.
4.6         Although the implementation monitoring will focus on local government
performance, the Province will compile and report the following aggregate measures of overall
project performance:
(a)   The percentage of urban households in East Java Province receiving the
REPELITA VI targeted levels of urban services (baseline data and measurement
methodology to be developed by East Java Provincial Government with DGCK
guidance);
(b)   Number of participating local governments attaining agreed targets for local
revenue improvement (RIAP), institutional strengthening (LIDAP), and
operations/maintenance expenditure (POMMS);
(c)   Percentage attainment of "priority targets" defined in participating local
government APIP/MPPT documents (see Annex 4); and
(d)   Conformance with agreed schedule for preparation of East Java Strategic Regional
Development Program (schedule to be developed before initial annual review of
project in October 1996).
4.7         It is proposed that the attainment of the selected 'priority targets" for each locality
and PDAM be used as the primary indicator of local government performance. Utilizing the local
'priority targets" as indicators to measure the overall progress of the project toward its
developiment objectives, however, requires that during the provincial approval of the Annual
Project Implementation Plan (APIP) for each local jurisdiction (see para. 5.3 and Annex 8),
mutual agreement be reached on the 5-7 priority targets which best summarize or capture the
project impacts/outcomes desired in each locality and which will vary widely with the priorities of
the local PJM and local conditions (e.g. targets may include institutional capacity outcomes,
O&M performance results for drainage, or key process steps such as site selection for solid waste,
in addition to key physical infrastructure implementation necessary to produce desired impacts).
A menu of potential targets, as well as a sample of suggested 'priority targets" for the City of



- 17 -
Malang, are discussed in Annex 4. Local governments and participating PDAMs attaining priority
targets will be encouraged to expand/accelerate their programs, while poor performance would
result in decreased funding until targets are met. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with GOI on the inclusion of priority targets in each APIP and the use of these targets as
performance indicators and as evaluation and management tools.
4.8          Ultimately, the perceptions of civil society regarding the extent to which their
individual and collective needs or demands for infrastructure and urban services are being met
must be the measure of program effectiveness. However, the mechanisms for measuring public
satisfaction or unmet demands are currently crude at best. Subsectoral technical memoranda for
water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and traffic management, as well as KIP/MIIP programs call
for obtaining direct public input to subproject design, but contain no provision for feedback on the
resulting services. Options for expanded surveys and other mechanisms for obtaining inputs from
civil society will be discussed with GOI and Provincial officials, as well as with local governments,
during the project launch workshops and subsequent project supervision.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.9          This project is designed to provide programmatic assistance to reduce the backlog
of urban infrastructure investment needs in cities and towns which were not addressed under the
EJBUDP loan program, and to enable those which were in the EJBUDP to update and extend
their medium-term (PJM) program. The project will support (a) a three year program of high
priority infrastructure expenditures and subproject investments in the participating local
governments and their water enterprises, including all the seven cities/kotamadyas and 29
regencies/kabupatens in East Java Province serving a total of up to 102 urban areas' (Annex 3
lists the eligible urban areas in each kabupaten and the seven incorporated cities.); each local
government's PJM defines subproject investments in roads, water supply, drainage and flood
control, human waste management, solid waste management, and KIP/MIP as well as provide
technical assistance needed to support the implementation of the proposed program, (b)
complementary local institutional development action plans to improve urban management,
increase the institutional capacity of the implementing agencies, and financial action plans to
improve local financial management and revenue generation to the local governments, and (c)
GOI and provincial initiatives to prepare the policy framework and identify the strategic
investment program of works for the proposed East Java Strategic Regional Development
Program (EJUDP-3) addressing the economic development potential of cities and towns in East
Java (See Table 4.1 for project overview).
At the request of GOI, the proposed loan would primarily support investments programmed in 54 "priority" urban areas
(including all cities and regency capitals). Other PJM proposals in the 48 non-priority towns would be fmanced entirely
by domestic funds.

(a)   Infrastructure Works (Sub-Proiects)
4.10        The preparation and appraisal of the program proposals and identified sub-projects
in each local jurisdiction have been completed in accordance with a series of agreed Technical
Memoranda covering the design and appraisal criteria applicable to sub-projects in each
subsector. These Technical Memoranda were updated (minimally) from similar documents used
during EJBUDP preparation and appraisal (see Annex 16 for summary of criteria), with the
exception of the Human Waste/Sanitation component which the mid-term review found to have
been ineffective in EJBUDP. Annex 5 provides a summary of the redesigned sanitation
component for the proposed project.
4.11        Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The project provides for a program of
road improvement, and road rehabilitation and maintenance totaling more than 900km, including
resurfacing as needed, drainage, curb, and sidewalks. Traffic management programs will be
initiated in a number of major towns in the program. Routine and periodic maintenance needs
have been identified with the help of consultants, and DGBM/Binkot following accepted
standards in the road administration. Costs have been based on standard material volume and unit
rates from previous contracts. Road improvements have been prepared to a preliminary design
stage, in some cases, detailed designs are available, in accordance with road function and traffic
volume. Outstanding final design and procurement will be undertaken within the project.
4.12        Water Supply. Local water enterprises (PDAMs) have been required to prepare
corporate operating plans (or mini-LIDAPs) to improve efficiency and begin to change the 'bost-
plus" culture that has prevailed in management of water services. By negotiations, 19 of the 36
PDAMs in East Java had qualified for inclusion in the proposed project by completing drafts of
such documents and associated investment proposals; others may be included in the programmatic
element of the project. The appraised water supply investments consist of increasing service
connection and reticulation coverage in 32 urban areas in the province, while in at least seven of
these towns increased water source and treatment quantities will be addressed. In all some
102,000 new consumers will be connected to the piped and water system in the 32 towns. A total
of more than 1300km of secondary and tertiary piping will be installed in the cities covered
providing a more reliable service and better quality water. A program will be undertaken in all the
cities to address and reduce water losses. Many cities suffer from poor maintenance of an old
service systems installed during Dutch rule before World War II. The proposed project will
rehabilitate these systems, replacing significant length of pipe where necessary to provide more
reliable service to the consumers. Storage reservoirs will be provided in 20 towns to improve
system capacity and provide better system water pressure. Detailed design and tender package
preparation has already been completed by the majority of the PDAMs. Outstanding detailed
design and contract package preparation will be completed during project implementation.
4.13        Solid Waste Management. The solid waste management component will address
at least 44 towns and will provide increased collection coverage and develop a number of new
solid waste disposal sites (TPAs). Procurement of equipment such as bulldozers, dump trucks,
container, and special container transports, arm roll trucks, compactor trucks and hand carts are
included in the programs for each town. Two pilot facilities for waste composting will also be



- 20 -
developed. Solid waste disposal sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites, and will be
developed together with sludge disposal plants (IAPT) to handle septic tank effluent in a number
of locations. Disposal treatment facilities will be installed at each site to treat leachate and runoff
from the solid waste materials as needed.
4.14          Human Waste Disposal/Sanitation. The component has been redesigned from
EJBUDP (see Annex 5) and is intended to improve urban environmental conditions within all
seven cities and 29 kabupatens throughout East Java in some combination of: (i) adequate
wastewater and sludge treatment facilities (off-site small bore sewerage/waste water treatment
plants in seven cities servicing 140,000 people); (ii) approximately 75 organized neighborhood
communities (kelurahan) participating in the identification, planning, management, and financing
of appropriate infrastructure investments and subsequent maintenance (sewerage/drainage, septic
tanks, and 3,980 MCKs and 23 community toilets for off-site sanitation;2 (iii) institutionalized
mechanisms for financing household/level flush toilet connections; (iv) adequate, targeted,
community-based, sanitation education in support of (ii) and (iii) above; (v) improved public and
private sector capacities at local levels (a) to construct and maintain core sanitation infrastructure
at the aggregate kabupaten/kotamadya level (including 13 sludge removal trucks and four sludge
disposal plants, (b) to provide managerial, technical and financial assistance to kelurahan in
support of localized community responsibilities, and (c) to develop and provide appropriate
sanitation education; and (vi) local regulatory reform. Detailed designs of physical infrastructure
components will need to be completed during implementation, as discussed in Annex 5.
4.15          Drainage/Flood  Control.    This  component  includes  rehabilitation  and
improvement of primary and secondary drainage canals, normalization of river banks and deferred
and incremental O&M. Final design will incorporate flood control systems, retention basins
where appropriate, and will review usefulness of hydraulic flood control gates in low lying areas.
4.16          KIP/MIIP. The project will contribute to improving conditions in poorer quality
kampungs by 1998. A total of more than 200 kampungs (encompassing approximately 2700 ha)
will be upgraded through provision of footpaths, drainage, sanitation improvement, water supply,
road construction and community participation. Market area improvements (MIIP) will also be
carried out in a number of centers under the detail of the project. Design for both KIP and MIIP
facilities will be implemented within the project. For descriptive and financing purposes, the
sanitation element of this component is discussed in para. 4.14 above and Annex 5.
4.17          Urban Renewal.  The City of Malang has included proposed subprojects to
improve approximately 10 ha. of riverbank floodplain, and to undertake development of a 10 ha.
sites and services project, together with a 5 ha. resettlement housing site preparation, in part to
prepare for anticipated land acquisition/resettlement requirements for major road improvement
which have been identified but deferred to EJUDP-3 or later. Approximately 6,000 persons
2   Kelurahan will be eligible to participate by meeting either or both of two criteria: (i) they produce significant
environmental degradation in other areas of the kabupaten/kotamadya as a result of inadequate sanitation infrastructure
and/or (ii) the kelurahan is "poor" according to the criteria established for inclusion in the broader KIP/MIIP component
(see para. 4.16).



- 21 -
(1,200 families) will be affected, but only a small fraction displaced, by the land readjustment and
KIP-type infrastructure improvements along the riverbank areas. The proposed sites and services
project, as well as the resettlement housing site, will be developed on land now owned by the City
of Malang. A discussion draft of the proposed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the City of
Malang proposals has been submitted for Bank review and comments will be discussed during
negotiations. This draft RAP will be revised in accordance with Resettlement Guidelines being
prepared for issuance by the Governor of East Java (see para. 5.30). All work on these renewal
schemes are scheduled for the second and third program years, allowing time for RAP refinement
and mutual agreement prior to implementation of these subprojects.
4.18        Detailed Engineering Design (DED) and Construction Supervision. For each
subproject in each local jurisdiction, estimates have been reviewed and agreed to establish the
portion of necessary DED and supervision to be performed by local government staff and the
requirements for supplementing this in-house capacity with consultant services.  Overall,
approximately one-half of the DED and supervision of project implementation will be performed
by loral government staff, the balance by local consultants. The cost associated with this
engineering and supervision effort are included in the component cost estimates (see Annex 6 for
itemization of these estimates). It is anticipated that the DED and supervision consultants would
be managed by the provincial Department of Public Works, in similar fashion to the successful
arrangements for such support under EJBUDP. These consultants would also assist in assuring
the appropriate incorporation UKLJUPL recommendations from the environmental review
process into the subproject designs and construction specifications, and support monitoring of
implementation of the UKL/UPL actions.
(b)   Institutional Capacity Development
4.19        The proposed project will also provide technical assistance, advisory support and
training to local governments and participating PDAMs to strengthen institutional capacities for
urban management and sustainable services delivery. Advisory teams will be provided to support
both the Provincial Program Management Office (PPMO) in BAPPEDA I and the Provincial
Technical Coordination Unit (PTCU) in the Public Works Department, as well as direct technical
assistance and training to local governments and participating PDAMs from teams based in each
of the five sub-regions of the province which will focus on the implementation of revenue and
institutional action plan components of the PJMs (RIAPs and LIDAPs). Continued operation and
refinement of the program management systems installed in all local governments under EJBUDP
is another key feature of the component of the project. These systems include:
the Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management System (POMMS)
the Project Financial Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS)
the water enterprise financial performance model (modified FINPRO)
and the conduct of annual financial and technical audits of project implementation activities.
Additional details of this component are discussed in Section V on Implementation Arrangements
and the overall technical assistance plan for the project is summarized in Annex 6.

(c)   Preiaration of Strategic DeveloDment Program
4.20        As summarized in Section III previously, East Java Province intends to prepare a
revised development policy framework and regional investment plan to enable the realization of
economic development potential throughout the province, consistent with the Second GOI 25-
year Development Strategy.  The drafting of a spatial management strategy or 'Strategic
Structure Plan" with appropriate policy and management tools will be essential to this effort. An
investment program may then be defined for Bank support in the form of a proposed EJUDP-3
project, for subsequent implementation during the REPELITA VII (1999-2004). GOI has
expressed its intention domestically finance the preparation of EJUDP-3 and to seek grant funding
for at least a portion of the preparation expenses.
D. PROJECT COSTS
4.21        Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 4.2, with fiurther details given in
Annex 7. The total project cost for the three year period 1996/97 to 1998/99 is estimated at Rp.
552.0 billion, equivalent to US$244.2 million. Base costs, in October 1995 prices, total Rp. 474.4
billion (US$209.9 million), the balance of the project cost representing contingencies. (Physical
contingencies average 7.6 percent of investment base costs. Price contingencies reflect current
Bank estimates of domestic and foreign inflation at 6.0 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.) The
program for Kotamadya Malang accounts for Rp. 107.3 billion (US$47.5 million) or 19.5 percent
of the overall project cost. The non-Kotanadya Malang project cost balance of Rp. 444.7 billion
(US$196.7 million) includes an amount of Rp. 133.1 billion (US$58.9 million) - about 26 percent
of estimate financing requirements excluding current O&M - for allocation on a programmatic
basis to supplementary investment subprojects which are likely to be proposed by a number of
local governments and water enterprises primarily for implementation during the third project
year. These additional subproject proposals would be summarized in project memoranda and
presented for subproject approval by the province, as discussed in para. 5.4.
4.22        Operations and Maintenance Expenditure.  Estimated O&M  expenditure
accounts for Rp. 200.2 billion (US$88.4 million) or 24.7 percent of the estimated total program
expenditures, comprising current level O&M of Rp. 140.6 billion (US$62.2 million) which are
included for monitoring total expenditures but not included in defined 'project costs" and
incremental O&M of Rp. 59.3 billion (US$26.2 million). The incremental O&M includes Rp.
44.0 billion (US$19.5 million) relating to existing infrastructure, representing a 31.3 percent
increase over the current level. This significant increase reflects the need to remedy present
deficiencies in services quality and address backlogs in physical infrastructure maintenance in the
water supply, urban roads, drainage and solid waste sectors which have been identified with
specialist assistance under the performance-orientated maintenance management system
(POMMS) initiative which was developed under earlier Bank urban projects and introduced into
East Java local governments and water enterprises under the EJBUDP institutional strengthening
program.

E. FINANCING PLAN
4.23        The Project financing plan is summarized in Table 4.3, with further detail given in
Annex 7. The proposed Bank Loan of US$142.7 million will provide 39.9 percent of the total
estimated financing requirement of US$357.3 million (which includes interest and commitment
fees during construction of an estimated US$14.7 million). This includes an amount of US$30.0
million reserved for the programmatic subprojects of the project. GOI agencies will finance an
estimated US$214.1 million, made up of US$132.5 million from local government normal revenue
sources (locally derived revenues and normal grant entitlements), US$56.5 million from water
enterprise internal funds, US$11.2 million from the provincial government, and US$13.9 million
from the central government domestic budget. Community financial contributions, primarily in
the sanitation subsector, will provide an estimated US$0.5 million. However, as requested by
GOI, no loan financing of KIP/IMIIP subprojects is proposed, although these subprojects are
included in the project cost. Subprojects in the non-priority towns are included in the total
financing requirement for PJM implementation as "other urban investment".
4.24        Onlending. An estimated US$67.6 million (47 percent) of the total Bank Loan
will be onlent by the central government to local governments (US$31.9 million) and water
enterprises (US$35.7 million) under subsidiary loan agreements (SLA).  The sub-loans,
denominated and repayable in Rupiah, will carry a fixed interest rate of 11.75 percent (the current
rate fixed by MOF for all borrowings by local government and their enterprises); and a
commitment fee nominally of 0.75 percent, which will be reduced to the same concessionairy level
as applies from time to time to the Bank Loan (currently 0.25 percent). The loan periods will be
consistent with the average economic life of the investments being financed, subject to a
maximum of 20 years. Grace periods will be allowed equal to the procurement/commissioning
periods for the investments, subject to a maximum of five years. Local governments will in all
cases be required to pay interest during the grace periods. The foreign exchange and interest rate
variation risks will be bome by GOI. For water enterprises, deferment of payment of interest
during the grace period will be allowed in cases where the financial capacity analysis shows that
an enterprise cannot afford such interest payment; deferred interest will be compounded and
added to the loan principal. The Ministry of Fir.ance has established a minimum sub-loan size of
Rp. 250 million. Agreements on revised standard SLA documents for local governments and
participating water enterprises were reached during the Loan negotiations.
4.25        Central Government Budgetary Contributions. The central government will
budget an estimated Rp. 46.7 billion (US$20.7 million) for the total investment and incremental
maintenance on infrastructure which is classified as its own responsibility; an estimated Rp. 32.3
billion (US$14.3 million) of this amount will be financed by the Bank. It will further budget an
estimated total Rp. 145.9 billion (US$64.6 million) as non-repayable (grant) contributions for the
finance of Project responsibilities of lower level government institutions. This amount can be
divided into three elements. The first element, estimated at Rp. 26.6 billion (US$11.8 million)
represents investments, contract engineering and technical assistance contracts planned to be
implemented directly by the central government agencies under central sectoral budget allocations
(DIP); of this amount the Bank would finance an estimated Rp. 18.3 billion (US$8.1 million).
The second element, estimated at Rp. 36.7 billion (US$16.2 million) represents special grants,

supplementary special investment grants to the provincial and local governments for infrastructure
components which these governments will themselves plan and implement, with counterpart
financing from their own normal revenues. All these supplementary special grants will be financed
by the Bank and transferred to lower level agencies by funds channeling letters (known as
SPABP). However, GOI has expressed a preference for concentrating Bank finance of these
supplementary special grants on investments in 54 'ttrategic towns", while other urban
investments will be financed from the domestic budget, subject to affordability to be annually
determined by BAPPENAS and East Java Province during the national consultation
(RAKORNAS).

4.26        Finance of Urgent First Year Implementation Preparation.   Contract
engineering services and selected other technical assistance to a total of US$900,000 needs to be
committed urgently in order to allow a prompt start to be made on implementing this project in
1996/97, as outlined in Annex 6. It has been agreed that this will be financed from the provision
for future project preparation assistance which is included in the Surabaya Urban Development
Project (Ln. 3726-IND) subject to GOI submission of proposed terms of reference (TOR) and
procurement documents acceptable to the Bank.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
5.1         The proposed project design is based on substantial further decentralization of
implementation management responsibilities to East Java Province, as compared to the EJBUDP
approach. While the MPW Directorate General of Human Settlements will retain the overall
project oversight role, as the designated central GOI "executing agency", East Java Province will
have the primary implementation responsibility for the proposed project. This will be the first
project by the Bank for which a GOI provincial government assumes the implementation
leadership role. The following paragraphs summarize these arrangements.
5.2         Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM). The Province of
East Java has been designated by GOI as the principal implementing agency for the proposed
project. For central GOI operational and technical coordination and oversight, the Directorate
General for Human Settlements (Cipta Karya) of MPW has been assigned the role of executing
agency, with the inter-ministerial coordination team for urban development (TKPP) chaired by
BAPPENAS providing policy guidance and sectoral oversight. As such local leadership
arrangements have not been previously attempted, except in the metropolitan cities, all parties
involved have agreed to prepare a "Provincial Program Implementation Memorandum (PPIM)"
which will document the respective roles, responsibilities and procedures for project
implementation, in the form of a memorandum of understanding to be signed by the Chairman of
TKPP, the Director General of Cipta Karya and the Governor of East Java. Annex 11 (a) displays
a draft outline for the PPIM memorandum. Agreements on a draft of the PPIM and procedures
for revision or updating during the annual review process were reached during negotiations.
The final PPIM, acceptable to the Bank, signed by all relevant authorities will be a condition of
Loan effectiveness.
5.3         Annual Program Implementation Plan (APIP). Annual Program
Implementation Plan (APIPs) will be drawn up between East Java Province, the local
governrnnts participating in the project and their PDAMs to confirm the essential understandings
and commitments based upon the medium-term expenditure programs (PJMs), financing plans,
Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs), Local Institutional Development Action Plans
(LIDAPs), and sound criteria for land acquisition and resettlement. These will be expressed as
priority targets and performance indicators for each implementing unit (See Annex 4). Through



- 27 -
the APIPs, the local governments and their PDAMs would commit themselves to comprehensive
sectoral investment programs (including O&M budgets), specific revenue targets, and measures to
strengthen the institutional capabilities for urban management. The investment and sector plans
will be amnended/updated annually, and a draft presented during the GOlI/Bank Annual Review
meetings by October of each year to reflect changing conditions during project implementation, as
provided under the IUDP approach. The local governments (except the City of Malang) will also
prepare subprojects for financing in the third year of the project and present these as additions to
their PJMs. All subproject proposals should include an environmental assessment, a management
and monitoring plan and, if necessary, a resettlement plan prepared in accordance with the
Resettlement Guidelines. An outline of the APIP is presented in Annex 1 (b). A draft of the
model APIP, between the provincial government of East Java and participating local
governments and PDAMs was reviewed at negotiations. Submission of the first APIP,
acceptable to the Bank, will be a condition of Loan disbursement for subproject civil works and
goods for each participating local government and PDAM
5.4         Subproject Approval.  The subproject definition, budgeting and supervision
arrangements for the implementation of the Project will be summarized for provincial review and
approval in a set of annual 'Project Memoranda" prepared by each participating local government
and PDAM. These Project Memoranda (drafts for first year program reviewed at appraisal)
provide detailed budget proposals for every subproject, covering all concerned institutions at
every government level (including the water enterprises), showing each contract package,
necessary O&M  provisions, etc., with the proposed financing sources.  The draft project
memoranda will form the inputs into the annual budget preparation cycle which commences with
the local and provincial level consultation meetings known as 'RAKORBANG" through which
the necessary funding allocations will be secured. Each subproject memorandum will require the
certification of the provincial government that it conforms with the relevant local government
appraised program (PJM). Newly identified subprojects for financing under the programmatic
provisions of the Loan or changes in subproject proposals must be notified to the provincial
government which will conduct a program reappraisal according to the agreed Project criteria,
and report approved changes to the Bank. Supporting documentation, including environmental
impact screening results and RAP documents, where needed, must be attached to each subproject
memorandum. For those subprojects involving resettlement, the RAP must be submitted for Bank
approval prior to the start of subproject implementation.
B. LOCAL IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
5.5         During project preparation, each local government was requested to identify
subprojects, O&M activities and other project actions which could be implemented by the private
sector. Each PJM now contains provisions for private sector participation, generally limited to
contracted O&M for solid waste and sanitation, in program implementation. This feature of the
preparation process has had the intended effects of increasing local government awareness of
potential private sector roles in urban service provision and initiating a vigorous dialogue at the
provincial and local levels regarding the policy framework for private sector infrastructure
provision to be addressed in preparing EJUDP3. This introduces some variation in local
implementation arrangements.   The MHA  regulations authorizing  somewhat different



- 28 -
organization and staffing arrangements in local governments based on their population, total area
and type (city or regency) also introduces some variation in local arrangements; however, each
PJM contains an implementation plan specific to that local governments, in all cases utilizing the
existing agencies' structure. In general, these arrangement may be summarized as follows:
(a)   Operations and Maintenance. A technical team for a Performance-Oriented
Maintenance Management System (POMMS) has already been established in each
loeal government to provide technical support (planning, programming, budgeting,
controlling, evaluating and reporting) to strengthen the O&M program for roads,
water supply, drainage and solid waste. The project provides for continuing
consulting support to the POMMS technical team to help identify the needs for
additional O&M staff, additional equipment and training;
(b)   Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The Roads and Bridges section of the
Municipal Public Works Agency (DPUK) is responsible for the construction,
maintenance and supervision of local roads and bridges. Provincial and national
roads are the responsibility of the provincial and national governments
respectively. A separate section will be established in the DPU to implement the
traffic management program in Malang. Consulting support is being provided
under the project to design in detail, evaluate and implement individual schemes in
the traffic management program;
(c)   Water Supply. The PDAMs will be responsible for construction, operations and
maintenance the water supply assets generated by the project.  Corporate
operations plans to improve efficiency and coverages of sewerage are also required
of each PDAM. Special attention will be given to control unaccounted for water.
PDAMs are being required to reduce leakage, and maximize utilization of their
current system, before proposing to increase treatment capacity further.
Consultant support for implementation of PDAM corporate plans and physical
improvements is provided in the project design;
(d)   Drainage and Flood Control. At the municipal level, the drainage sub-section of
each DPUK has specific responsibility for storm drainage and flood control within
the municipal area.  Designated major waterways are the responsibility of
provincial or central Pengairan offices, but all local drainage works must be
executed by DPUK. O&M performance will be strengthened through POMMS
and consulting support;
(e)   Human Waste Disposal. Construction of 'pilot" sewerage schemes in Malang
and other towns will be carried out with a staff member from the provincial
Environmental Sanitation Division (Sub-Dinas TPL, Dinas PU Cipta Karya) as
project Manager on behalf of central DGCK (funding agency). For the longer
term, consideration will be given to proposals to establish separate sewerage
enterprises or the addition of sewerage responsibilities to the PDAM charter. The
on-site sanitation program in all cities will be implemented by the local government



- 29 -
with the community using municipal staff (BANGDES) as project mangers.
Sludge collection and disposal services will be provided as much as possible by
private operators under the supervision of the Cleansing Department (Dinas
Kebersihan) in each local government (see Annex 5);
(f)   Solid Waste Management. Dinas Kebersihan in all the municipalities will be
responsible for all solid waste management activities (Note. In those Kabupatens
where the cleansing function is a section of DPUK, the local governments will be
encouraged to establish separate Dinas Kebersihan units.);
(g)   Infrastructure for Low-income Communities and KIP. DPUK in each local
government also will be responsible for implementing KIP and other proposed
poverty components. Consultant services, where needed, providing technical
assistance on the financial, economic, institutional and environmental aspects, will
be located in the Dinas; and
(h)   MIIP. Where available, the market agency in each city (Dinas Pengelola Pasar)
will be responsible for implementing the MIIEP component of the project. In all
other cases, implementation will fall directly on the local Dinas PUK.
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
5.6         The proposed project will be implemented over a period of three years,
commencing with the start of GOI FY1996/97, and will be completed during FY1998/99,
although the proposed loan documents will provide a brief additional period for completion of any
delayed work and disbursement up to September 30, 1999. The program of works has been
designed to commence implementation immediately upon loan effectiveness. Design for the first
year of all components is virtually completed and the design for the second and third years will be
completed quickly for timely implementation.
5.7         Standard tender and contract documents for the various types of packages will be
prepared prior to Loan effectiveness and discussed with all local implementing agencies during
project launch workshops, so that implementation can commence during the GOI fiscal year
beginning April 1, 1996. The PJM for Malang has been prepared as a five-year program of which
the proposed loan will finance the initial three years of implementation, while other local programs
have all based preparation initially on a two-year implementation period which has now been
expanded to the full three years with an allowance for subprojects yet to be identified (primarily
for implementation in the third program year).
5.8         Because numerous subprojects will be expected to start immediately after the loan
is approved, appropriate technical assistance consultant supervision contracts will need to be put
in place quickly. Terms of Reference for these high priority technical assistance packages have
already been prepared, and tendering for these services will be commenced immediately. The
implementation schedule and annual program cycle are graphically summarized in Annex 9.



- 30 -
D. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING
5.9         Provincial Government Responsibilities. The East Java province will play a key
role in the overall coordination and monitoring of the project, including the management of
technical assistance. Based on experience in the ongoing EJBUDP, the somewhat complex
institutional arrangements at the provincial level under that project will be simplified by having a
single functional organization, the Provincial Project Management Organization (PPMO), in the
provincial planning agency (BAPPEDA I) for the overall management of the project, including
programming, coordination and reporting. A key responsibility of the PPMO will be to issue
guidelines for the preparation of APIPs, to ensure that they are prepared on time, and to finalize
the APIPs in coordination with the Kanwil/Dinas PU. PPMO will also develop and issue standard
operating procedures for program implementation. The updated functions and organization of the
PPMO were defined by a decree of the provincial Governor in September 1995 and further
operational details will be provided at negotiations. The PPMO will have strong leadership,
through a full-time Unit manager (Kepala PPMO) and an adequate budget. Technical assistance
under the project will provide advisory support to the PPMO. Annex 10 displays the revised
organization structure of the PPMO within the provincial BAPPEDA, as established by a
Governor's Decree in September 1995 to improve PPMO capacities as compared to that for
EJBUDP implementation.
5.10        Technical coordination will be carried out by Dinas PU Cipta Karya, East Java and
Dinas PU Bina Marga, East Java in their respective areas of responsibility; however, the Kanwil
PU will coordinate centrally funded sectoral programs. The Secretary to Governor (Sekwilda I)
will be responsible for overall coordination of implementation. The PPMO will work closely with
Dinas PU Cipta Karya, Bina Marga, the Sekwilda I, and the Kanwil PU, and these technical
agencies will designate staff to function as a Program Technical Coordination Unit (PTCU) as
shown in Annex 10.
5.11        Local Government Responsibilities. Local governments participating in the
project will have primary responsibility for project implementation and monitoring of all project-
related activities in their jurisdiction. A Coordination Team (Tim Koordinasi) will be maintained
from EJBUDP or established in each participating local government, with the Bupati/Walikota as
the chair and the heads of all departments involved as members. Programming and planning
functions will be under the overall charge of the local planning agency (BAPPEDA II), in the
section for physical infrastructure (Bidang Prasarana Fisik). A local project coordinator, typically
in the Sekwilda II office, will be appointed for day-to-day activities, and will be provided with an
adequate budget; the appointment of a project coordinator will be confirmed in the APIP. Line
agencies (both local and deconcentrated units of central agencies, as appropriate) will be
responsible for implementing their designated subproject components. Consistent with Indonesian
government practice, each implementing agency will appoint subproject managers (PIMPROs)
with an appropriate supervision budgets.
5.12        The Secretary to the Bupati/Walikota (Sekwilda II) will have overall responsibility
for coordinating and reporting on all project-related activities (whether handled by the local
government agencies or by the deconcentrated units of GOI central agencies.) The Development



- 31 -
Assistant to the Secretary (Assisten Pembangunan) will appoint the local project coordinator, and
provide him with an adequate budget. The project coordinator will compile and distribute
periodic consolidated progress reports, covering all sectors, with information on both physical and
financial progress, based on data provided by the subproject managers. The Finance Section of
the Secretary's Department will maintain up-to-day accounting information on the project
utilizing the Project Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) installed in all local
governments under EJBUDP.  Issuance of a local government instruction letter (SK
Walikota/Bupati) clearly establishing the above roles and functions in the appropriate local
units will be included in the APIP actions for each local government.
5.13        Central Government Responsibilities. DGCK in MPW, as the central executing
agency, will be responsible for the overall technical supervision and management of the project on
behalf of GOI. DGCK will delegate responsibility for the day-to-day management and monitoring
of this project to the East Java Province through the establishment of the agreed standard
operating procedures; the Kanwil PU, which is the regional office of the central MPW in the
province, will work closely with the provincial agencies on behalf of DGCK. The TKPP, which
has already been established under BAPPENAS leadership, will be responsible for policy guidance
and coordination, and in this role will actively participate in the preparation process for the East
Java Strategic Regional Development Program (EJUDP 3).
5.14        The Directorate General for Budget in the Ministry of Finance will be responsible
for managing the project's special account. Lead responsibility for the conclusion of the
Subsidiary Lending Agreements (SLAs) will be assumed by the Directorate General for Financial
Ii-stitutions in the Ministry of Finance. At Loan negotiations, agreement was reached on revised
standard SLAs documents for local government, and participating water enterprises. Approval
by the Bank of the first SLA for each participating local government and/or PDAM with
borrowing included in their agreedfinancing plans will be a condition of loan disbursement for
civil works or goods in that localjurisdiction.
E. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
5.15        Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Large
civil works contracts costing US$3 million or more and goods contracts costing US$200,000 or
more would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using the
Bank's standard bidding documents. A general procurement notice would be issued in advance to
encourage participation of eligible parties. However, with the exceptions of approximately eight
sewerage and water supply subprojects involving treatment plant equipment and large pipe
procurement, essentially all procurement anticipated for project implementation in each of the
seven subsectors described in the preceding Section IV will be relatively small civil works
contracts under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures agreed between GOI and the
Bank. Smaller civil works contracts, valued at less than US$3 million up to an aggregate amount
of US$106.7 million, and goods contracts valued less than US$200,000 up to an aggregate
amount of US$27.5 million would be procured by the designated subproject implementing agency
under national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, Although within



- 32 -
these totals goods and civil works contracts for less than US$50,000 each up to an aggregate
total of US$1.0 million in each category, may be procured through national shopping and
simplified procurement procedures similar to national shopping, respectively.  Domestic
preference may be provided during bid evaluation at a rate of 15% (of the CIF price or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower) for local goods manufacturers participating in the
ICB procurement of goods. The invitation to prequalify or bid for each contract estimated to cost
$10,000,000 equivalent or more shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable
to large contracts under paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines, although no such contracts have been
identified for this project.
5.16        As more fully described in Annex 6, project implementation will be supported by
two types of consultants' services: (i) detailed engineering design and construction supervision
(see para. 4.18) to assist local implementing agencies (totaling US$8.7 million), and (ii) advisory
and program management technical assistance and training for institutional capacity building (see
para. 4.19) in all facets of program implementation (totalling US$10.3 million). Consulting
services under the Bank loan would be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated
August 1981 and resulting consultants' contracts would utilize the Bank's Standard Form of
Contract for Consultant Services of June 1995, to be executed by the responsible agency for each
contract as designated in Annex 6.
5.17        Procurement Review. Contracts for (a) Civil works valued at more than US$1
million, (b) goods valued at or more than US$200,000, and (c) consultants' services by individual
consultants valued at more than US$50,000, and by consulting firms valued at or more than
US$100,000, would be subject to prior review by the Bank. The first contract for civil works and
goods for each local implementing unit would also be subject to prior review by the Bank, to
assure use of standard procedures and contract formats. The balance of contracts for goods and
civil works, including those reimbursed under statement of expenditures (SOE), would be subject
to selective post-review by the Bank. Contractors for civil works exceeding US$1 million in
value would be pre-qualified in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Terms of
reference for all consultants' services, including detailed engineering design and supervision,
studies and other technical assistance, as well as all sole source selections, regardless of the value
of the contract, would also be subject to prior Bank review. Prior review by the Bank is expected
to cover approximately 30% of the total value of contracts financed by the project. This relatively
low review coverage is justified by the generally good record of these local implementing agencies
during EJBUDP, and will be compensated for by (a) use of standardized bidding documents; (b)
prior review of each different type of contract (road works, drainage) since there are numerous
contracts of similar nature, and (c) systematic post-review by Bank staff during supervision.
5.18        Procurement Design. Where technically feasible and administratively practical,
sub-projects have been combined to form larger contracts for tendering. Procurement of physical
components has been kept separate for each agency (central and local governments, PDAMs) to
avoid administrative delays and complex payment procedures. Similarly, procurement has been
kept separate for each sector (roads, drainage, etc.) as each contract would be administered by a
different agency. However, consultants' services have been combined wherever feasible (e.g.,



- 33 -
support packages for studies, institutional strengthening, etc.).  Table 5.1 summarizes the
procurement arrangements; details of procurement process design will be available in the project
files as appeared in the subproject memoranda.

5.19        Disbursements. IBRD loan disbursements will be made at the following rates for
the various main expenditure categories as detailed in Table 5.2 below: (a) civil works and goods
under the SLAs - 90% of costs; (b) other civil works - 70% of costs; (c) other goods - 100% of
foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost), and 65% of other items
procured locally; (d) consultants' services - 100% for consultants contracted by East Java
Province and participating local governments and PDAMs, and 8O0%/ for consultants contracted by
central GOI agencies. The estimated Bank disbursement by Bank fiscal year are given in Table
5.3.
5.20        In order to facilitate disbursements, GOI would establish a Special Account with
an amount up to US$14.0 million in Bank Indonesia. This account should be maintained by the
Director General of Budget in the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be used for
all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment of the Special Account will be made on
a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special Account balance has been used, whichever
comes first. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Director Generalfor Budget
will authorize all payments to contractors from the Special Account to be made through the
KPKN Treasury offices at the sub-provincial level (with the exception of any technical assistance
contracts procured by central GOI agencies).
5.21        Disbursements from the Loan for the following types of contracts require full
documentation: (a) civil works contracts valued at more than US$1 million; (b) goods contracts
valued at or more than US$200,000; and (c) consultants' services contracts with individual
consultants valued at more than US$50,000 and consulting firm contracts valued at or more than
US$100,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE)
for which relevant documents would be retained by the MOF Directorate General for Budget
Administration (DG TUA) and the implementing agencies and made available to the Bank for
review upon request.
5.22        The proposed disbursement period of three-and-one-half years is somewhat less
than the disbursement profile to date of IUMDP projects in Indonesia. However, as this project
has been prepared taking into account the start-up problems encountered in earlier projects, and
because of the steps taken to expedite disbursements, it is considered achievable. The project
completion date is September 30, 1999, and the loan closing date is March 31, 2000. The
estimated schedule of quarterly disbursements in shown in Annex 11.
F. PROJECT ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
5.23        Prime responsibility for the maintenance of consolidated accounts of expenditures
and financing sources for all project components at every government level and concerned
institution (including the water enterprises) will be delegated to the provincial and local
governments, which will employ for this purpose an improved version of the Program Financial
Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) used in the EJBUDP. Development of the

improved PFAMS will be addressed at the start of the Project under a component of the urgent
technical assistance program to be financed from the Surabaya Urban Development Project (Loan
3726-IND) (see para. 4.26). For each local government program (including that of its water
enterprise) the Project accounting will be the responsibility of the structural finance agency within
the local government secretariate (Bagian Keuangan). Responsibility for maintaining the
consolidated Project account and the production of consolidated financial reports will be
undertaken by the structural finance bureau within the provincial government secretariat.
5.24        Assurances were given by GOI at negotiations that the consolidated project
accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, as well as the overall accounts of the
participating PDAMs, will be audited annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank and that the audited accounts would be submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the end of eachfiscal year, commencing GOI FY96/9 7. Assurances were also given
by GOI during negotiations that the East Java Provincial Inspectorate (Ir Wil Prop) will carry
out annual technical audits during project implementation by October 31 of each year.
Technical assistance will be provided to enhance the capabilities of the Provincial Inspectorate
under the project, and staff of the MPW Inspectorate General will assist as appropriate for MPW-
financed subprojects; the technical audit will also review attainment status of the selected 'priority
targets" as described in each APIP.
G. PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION
5.25        Quarterly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by PPMO
with assistance from DGCK on the basis of inputs from the various central, provincial, kabupaten,
kotamadya implementing agencies. The reports will focus on the targets and performance
indicators established in the PPIP and APIP for each local government (see Annex 4) and will
include an overall program summary, covering progress on:
(a)   physical progress of each component
(b)   institutional development (LIDAP) and revenue improvement (RIAP) actions
(c)   consulting services
(d)   compliance with loan covenants
(e)   administration and finance, including project costs commitment and disbursement
schedule, and
(f)    a list of action to be taken by the various parties.
5.26        The progress report's substance, including indicators and the format will be
discussed at the workshop for the project launch, scheduled for May/June 1996.
5.27        Quarterly progress reports will be submitted within 30 days from the end of each
quarter, starting with the quarter ending in September 1996. On completion of the EJUDP 2
program, the DGCK together with PPMO and the participating kabupatens and kotamadyas will
prepare an Implementation Completion Report within six months after the loan closing date for
review by GOI and the Bank.



- 37 -
5.28        The project will require approximately 30 staff weeks of Bank supervision during
the first year of the project, and 20-25 staff weeks for the following years of the project.
Supervision missions will include engineering, institutional, financial, environmental and
resettlement expertise. Typically, two Bank supervision missions per year are planned to conduct
the annual review (October) and to check GOI fiscal year program status (March/April). These
proposed arrangements and schedulesfor project launch workshops, as well asfor project
supervision and annual reviews (by October 31 of each year) were confirmed with GOI at
negotiations (see Annex 12).
H. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
5.29        Expenditure programs for the municipalities and PDAMs include O&M budgets in
every subsector in accordance with IUIDP guidelines. MHA Ministerial Decree No. 5 of 1990
promulgated Performance-oriented Operations and Maintenance Management Systems (POMMS)
and revised local budgeting procedures to encourage O&M. Current O&M expenditures and
incremental O&M expenditures (to reach necessary levels and expand coverage) are clearly
separated. Adequate budgeting for current and incremental O&M is an important objective of
EJUDP2 and detailed O&M expenditure plans have been included in the PJM for each local
government and participating PDAM to continue current O&M and incrementally strengthen
O&M to meet levels estimated by POMMS as needed to adequately operate and maintain the
existing systems and proposed infrastructure. Domestic budget sources will fully fund O&M to
ensure sustainability of the increased O&M level under the project. Advisory and training
assistance would be provided under the project to continue improvements in maintenance
practices. During negotiations agreement was reached that GOI will monitor the operation and
maintenance (O&M) expenditures of the local governments and participating PDAMsfor each
year as well as the proposed O&M budgetfor the followingyear and discuss them with the Bank
as a part of the annual program review.
1. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION
5.30        East Java Province has agreed to serve as the 'pilot" area for another critically
important subject in the current Bank-GOI program dialogue: resolving the differences and gaps
between GOI Presidential Decree No. 55/1993 and Bank Operational Directive 4.30, both dealing
with land acquisition and resettlement practices. The preparation process for the proposed
project has included efforts both to avoid or minimize land and resettlement needed for the
subprojects and to develop a 'hnodel" provincial policy framework to provide operational
guidance to local governments on land acquisition, resettlement and compensation needed for
project implementation. The appraised PJMs propose very limited land acquisition and no
resettlement other than the urban renewal proposals by the City of Malang (see para. 4.17). A
Governor's Decree issuing Resettlement Guidelines and implementation instructions form the
overall  framework  for  resettlement  under  the  project.    A   local  government
(kotamadya/kabupaten) decree for preparation of subproject Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)
in accordance with the Guidelines will be issuedfor each sub-project involving resettlement, and
included in the APIP as a condition of disbursement. During negotiations, a draft Governor's
decree was reviewed and agreed upon. On April 16, 1996 the decree was issued..

J. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
5.31        Impacts. The proposed project has been classified as environmental category "B"
under the Bank's procedures, as the negative impacts are expected to be minor. The project will
likely produce an overall net positive environmental impact. Works under the urban roads
subcomponent should relieve congestion, resulting in reductions in air and noise pollution. The
water supply component will improve the availability of clean drinking water. Under the solid
waste management subcomponent, solid waste dumping and accumulation will be reduced and
sites will be developed as sanitary landfill sites; treatment facilities will minimize leachate and
runoff as needed. The sanitation component will improve the urban environment with adequate
wastewater and sludge treatment facilities resulting in reduced health risks from contamninated
water. Improvements of drainage canals will help control flooding and lessen the potential for
unsanitary pools of water where mosquitoes might breed.
5.32        Environmental Procedures. The environmental procedures for this project were
designed to avoid the implementation issues that were identified in the mid-term review of
EJBUDP (see Annex 13 for details). Briefly, that review showed that considerable effort had
been expended in meeting GOI requirements for production of environmental documents, but
measured by the extent of implementation in the field, the process fell short of its objectives.
Using the new GOI regulations for environmental assessment (AMDAL) promulgated in 1993
and 1994 to the project's advantage, a modified procedure was developed during preparation of
the proposed project.
5.33        Prior to negotiations, the following measures had been taken: (a) the
standardization of a process to screen PJMs, designed and overseen by provincial staff and
conducted by local government personnel to identify environmental issues and ensure that each
subproject receives the appropriate level of environmental analysis; (b) the establishment of
guidelines for the preparation of environmental management plans (UKL) and monitoring plans
(UPL), in the form of model UKL/UPL available on diskette and provided to all local
governments along with appropriate training; and (c) review of UKL/UPL for PJMs conducted by
Dinas PU, BAPPEDA-I and provincial environmental officers.
5.34        The UKL/UPL for PJMs were used as the basis for subproject screening and to
identify environmental management training incorporated into the institutional capacity
development component of the project. Although there has been a substantial improvement in
capacity to prepare and review UKL/UPL reports, the following three observations are relevant:
(a)   UKL/UPL technical guidelines for infrastructure projects currently under
preparation by GOI's Ministry of Public Works are urgently needed;
(b)   Further training in UKL/UPL preparation and review needs to be provided to
provincial and local government staff, and
(c)   There has not been a formal assignment of responsibility for UKL/UPL preparation
to local government staff.



- 39 -
Annex 13 includes an outline of an environmental management training program to be carried out
as a priority element of the technical assistance program.
5.35        UKL/UPL Preparation and Review. UKL/UPL for subprojects are to be
prepared and reviewed as part of subproject approval (Project Memoranda), with particular
attention paid to whether the management and monitoring measures are included in subproject
design and tender documents. During project implementation, UKL/UPL review will be the
responsibility of technical agencies in the provincial government, coordinated by PTCU. The
review should include screening of any proposed project sites not already screened when the
PJMs were originally prepared, especially for final solid waste disposal sites (TPAs) to ascertain
that they are not located in protected or sensitive areas and are generally suitable for the intended
purpose. Approval of the UKL/UPL by PTCU would be a prerequisite for subproject approval.
However, the Bank will also review UKL/UPL during the first year of the project and provide
comments to PPMO. This step will be phased out as results show it unnecessary except in the
case of TPAs. Because of demonstrated problems in implementing TPA subprojects in EJBUDP,
PPMO will submit copies of designs, operating plans and UKL/UPLs to the Bank's resident
mission throughout the life of the project. The PPMO will not approve these subprojects until the
Bank has given its concurrence. The standard operating procedures for the project to be issued
by PPMO will require that no subprojects be implemented until the required UKL/UPL (or in a
few cases RKL/RPL) have been approved by PPMO.
K. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
5.36        GOI's commitment to decentralize the planning and provision of urban
infrastructure and services reflects the intention to make the development process more
responsive to the needs of civil society in Indonesia. The current IUDP guidelines for local
government and the subsectoral technical memoranda describing subproject preparation and
implementation methodologies call for local governments to obtain inputs from targeted
beneficiaries in a proactive process. For the past 20 years, the KIP programs have effectively
mobilized community inputs to design and implementation (Op. Cit. of OED Report 14747) and,
reflecting that the IUDP process was conceived as "citywide KIP" by many key GOI officials, the
local governments have been encouraged to follow participatory approaches to formulating their
PJM proposals.
5.37        Specifically, the KIP/MIIP subprojects must be based on community surveys and
interviews, with public involvement in implementation as well as operations and maintenances of
resulting facilities strongly encouraged. Water supply and sanitation subprojects are required to
be justified in part on the basis of "real demand surveys" which include willingness to pay
responses from the community. In both the solid waste and traffic management subsectors inputs
from potential beneficiaries are strongly encouraged. Local governments' response to these
guidelines and requirements has generally been quite positive and most PJM proposals can be
presented as results of a participatory process of consultation with the representatives of various
urban communities of interest and potential beneficiaries. However, the Bank and GOI continue
to discuss improved procedures to broaden the scope of participatory inputs and generally



- 40 -
improve public information and feedback mechanisms employed by local governments. The terms
of reference for program implementation advisory support specify the strengthening of such public
access to decision-making as one of the focal points of advisory services.
L. Standard Operating Procedures
5.38        East Java PPMO staff and consultants have compiled a draft of the Standard
Operating Procedures (SOP) manual for the proposed project covering all of the implementation
aspects noted in the preceeding sections, primarily based on updating (as needed) the operational
manuals from EJBUDP and recently issued IUDP and REPELITA VI guidance from central GOI,
as well as incorporating the reporting and documentation requirements of the Bank. The draft
SOP manual was reviewed during project negotiations and found to be generally adequate and
comprehensive, but with some further clarification needed to assure local governments could
directly use the manual. It was agreed that the PPMO would complete preparation and publication
of the SOP manual in time for distribution and discussion with local officials during the project
launch workshops (tentatively scheduled for May/June 1996).

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
6.1         Structure of Local Government Revenues. Local government normal annual
revenues consist essentially of a) locally-derived taxes, fees, service charges and miscellaneous
revenues (PADs); (b) the local share (approximately 85%) of the national land and buildings tax
(PBB) collected in the locality; c) a central government routine grant (the SDO), almost the whole
of which is provided to pay the remuneration costs of permanently established staff (which have
the status of state civil servants); and d) central government development grants (Inpres grants),
the bulk of which are accounted for by a general-use development expenditure grant and a block
grant for roads improvement. Excluding the SDO, the ratio of locally-derived revenues to the
Inpres grants has in recent years been in the order of 30/70 in typical East Java kabupatens, and
about 45/55 in most of the kotamadyas. Only Kotamadya Malang and Kabupaten Sidoarjo
(which includes substantial suburbs of Surabaya) had substantially higher locally-derived revenues
proportions, in both cases around 65/35. The special investment expenditure grants (known as
SPABP-RK, an acronym for the funds channeling mechanism) which the Bank will be financing
under the Project are required to be counterparted from the normal local revenues and central
grant entitlements, so that, inter alia they will stimulate local governments to allocate more of
these discretionary-use revenues to their urban infrastructure sector responsibilities, after meeting
O&M requirements for existing infrastructure. The counterpart financing requirement imposed
the primary constraint on total program size in each local government.
6.2         Local Revenues Improvement. Local governments' administration of their own
local revenue sources has suffered from the familiar problems of incomplete registration of
potential tax and license fee assets, under-assessment and under-reporting of amounts properly
payable, under-collection of due amounts, and a reluctance to make timely adjustments to tariffs
to maintain their levels in real terms. Under the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project all
local governments prepared and implemented a first round of Revenue Improvement Action Plans
(RIAPs). The great majority of local governments have achieved, and in many cases substantially
exceeded their RIAP targets (although many of these were admittedly conservative). Many
achieved impressive average real terms growths in the revenues under their own administration
over the RIAP periods, the average being 8 percent annually. Nevertheless, there is believed to be
considerable scope for further improvement particularly in tariffs and charges for cost recovery of
solid waste and sanitation services. This is reflected in the second round of RIAPs which have
been prepared in support of the current Project, which embody targets representing an overall
average real terms growth in the revenues under the local governments' own administration of
some 10 percent annually over the period 1995/96 to 1998/99.  Annex 14 presents past
performance and future targeted growth in each revenue sources category per local government,
as appraised and agreed in RIAP documents for each local government. The following Table 6.1
displays the summary totals for local revenue realization during EJBUDP implementation and
agreed RIAP target totals for the proposed project period.

6.3         Local Government Borrowing.  Twenty-two of the 35 participating local
governments borrowed generally small amounts under the East Java-Bali Urban Development
Project. In general, GOI policy regarding the current Project is that local governments should
make greater use of their borrowing capacities, which are enhanced as a result of past and future
targeted local revenues improvements under the RIAPs, by taking appropriate amounts of the
Bank finance in the form of subloans rather than grants. However, resistance to the principle of
borrowing, especially to finance investments which do not directly generate revenues through
service charges, is common by the local governments and their legislative council members
(DPRD) who must approve all borrowings. The proposed project financing plan recognizes the
need to introduce incentives for local borrowing including a minimum level of special grant
financing, even where capacity to borrow is substantial. Borrowing capacity has been estimated
for each local government by making long term projections of amounts potentially available for
servicing debt. Local revenues were projected from the RIAP targets, and deductions made for
current and incremental O&M, existing debt service and other routine expenditure obligations
together with allowances for priority future development expenditure in non-urban sectors which
would have to be financed therefrom. Two-thirds of the resultant net amount was assumed as a
safe limit for debt service obligations (implying a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.5).
The resultant borrowing capacity estimates vary from small to very substantial. Subject to
sufficient capacity after taking into account any proposed borrowing outside the Project sectors
(there are a number of proposals to borrow domestically for revenue generating projects such as
markets and transport terminals), all local governments were requested by MOF and PPMO to
commit themselves to borrowing in proportion to their limited capacities to reduce special grant
finance and to initiate the concept of borrowing as a source of funding for their local responsibility
investment programs. Confirmation of the participating local government and PDAMs
borrowing commitments and that such proposed borrowings meet the agreedfinancial criteria of
the Bank and GOIMinistry of Finance, was obtained at Loan negotiations.

B. WATER ENTERPRISES (PDAMs)
6.4         PDAM Financial Condition. The majority of the 19 PDAMs currently included
in the Project3 are in a relatively weak financial condition. Only in three cases (Kotamadyas
Madium and Malang, and Kabupaten Sidoarjo) do water tariff revenues cover operational costs
and depreciation, and in half the PDAMs revenues are currently insufficient to support O&M
expenditure needs as identified by the POMMS. These problems arise mainly from a combination
of a) inherited sub-optimally designed and located systems serving extended areas with low
connections demand and/or coverage causing high unit operating costs; b) often high
staff7connections ratios and administration costs; and c) infrequent tariff adjustments.
6.5         Water Tariffs. Five of the total 19 PDAMs which will participate in the proposed
Project were also included in the East Java-Bali Urban Development Project. All have now raised
tariffs to levels at or above those planned under the EJBUDP. All 19 PDAMs included in the
proposed Project have made tariff increases in 1995 or plan increases early in 1996; the increases
range between 32-60 percent, and action programs to improve efficiency of PDAM operations
have been drafted for each PDAM, either as a 'borporate plan" or draft LIDAP. Further
substantial real terms tariff increases will be made at not more than two-yearly intervals so as to
approach, or reach and maintain, full coverage of O&M costs and depreciation charges. Annex
15 summarizes the current tariff status and estimated further necessary tariff increases over the
Project period which are linked to improved service efficiency in each PDAM. As in EJBUDP,
the adequacy of tariff levels in each participating PDAM will be annually reviewed by PPMO with
assistance from DGCK as needed, and realistic forecasts prepared detailing required tariff
adjustments. Results of the process would be an important component of the annual review of the
project. Assurances were obtained during Loan negotiations that tariff adjustments necessary to
meet the agreedfinancial viability criteria (as under EJBUDP) will be completed on or before
October 31, 1996, and again January 1, 1999.
6.6         Provincial Government O&M Financing Contributions. The financial capacity
analyses suggest that nine of the total 20 participating PDAMs will have difficulty in financing
adequate levels of O&M (incorporating the POMMS recommendations) in the near future until
the tariff increase plans have been fully implemented. The provincial government has limited tariff
increases to 40% in each of two steps (1996 and 1998) during the project period, but in order to
compensate PDAMs for the imposed public service obligation, the province has agreed to provide
for the interim O&M financing shortfalls through contributions of operating capital from the
provincial budget, estimated at a total of Rp. 7.5 billion (US$3.3 million) during the three-year
program. Such payments must be regarded as transitional only, with financial performance
criteria agreed in the APIP for each PDAM to be achieved as a condition for obtaining the
following year contribution and an established target date for financial viability. As noted in Table
6.2 below, all PDAMs are projected to eliminate the need for the operating grants by 1998.
6.7         Water Supply Investment Finance.  PDAM  investment programs will be
financed by SLA borrowing to the extent feasible on the basis of PDAM financial capacity
3More PDAMs may participate under the programmatic component of the project.

projections. Summaries of these projections are provided in Annex 15. The balance of the
needed investments for which borrowing is not feasible will be financed through Ministry of
Public Works sectoral DIP allocations from the central government budget, partly-funded by the
Bank. These subprojects are generally to complete system development or rehabilitate systems
which were prematurally converted to enterprise status by GOI. Table 6.2 displays a summary

of the proposed loan and grant totals for all PDAMs. Economic justification and/or borrowing
feasibility remains to be established for a number of the subproject proposals. The requisite
economic analyses and revised PDAM financial capacity projections will be prepared and
forwarded for Bank approval before any Bank Loan funds can be disbursed for the relevant
PDAM programs. DGCK is also assisting PDAMs in East Java to identify and prepare additional
water supply investments to meet REPELITA VI targets. The programmatic element of the
proposed project will provide financing for these additional schemes which meet the agreed
feasibility criteria.
6.8           PDAM  Institutional Development Plans. Each participating PDAM  is required
to produce an Institutional Development Action Plan (LIDAP) or corporate plan setting out the
actions to be taken to enable it to improve current operational performance, reduce administrative
costs where these are high, and develop its capacity to cope with the progressive expansions of its
operations, often very substantial, which will arise as its investment program is implemented.
PPMO review of PDAM APIPs will confirm that each PDAM has prepared such a LIDAP or
corporate plan, or expects to have done so before the planned date of SLA or grant effectiveness.



- 45 -
Provincial approval for a PDAM's program will be conditional on the prior appraisal of each
PDAM LIDAP or corporate plan, and confirmation that no payment of PDAM revenue to the
local government will be made during the project period.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFCATION AND RISKS
A. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
7.1         Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy and Sector Strategy. As discussed
earlier in Sections II and IV, the EJBUDP represented a significant turning point in the Bank's
CAS in general, and its urban sector strategy in particular. Establishing the operational feasibility
of working with a large number of local governments, while utilizing the provincial government as
an intermediary program manager, has given new practical scope to several of the themes
emphasized in the CAS, including the need to improve public services and productivity, to
enhance local government responsibility and capacity, and to strengthen environment
management. The proposed project design continues and broadens the EJBUDP decentralization
successes and reflects the current CAS emphasis through provision of resources for urban
infrastructure investments, supporting both sectoral and integrated implementation approaches as
appropriate, strengthening local government institutions for urban management, promoting
decentralization of responsibility for project planning and implementation, and incorporating
environmental considerations in urban development. The project also incorporates the pilot
development of a provincial framework for land acquisition and resettlement guidelines which
addresses an identified problem area in project implementation.
7.2         Analysis of Alternatives. Consideration of alternatives, including location of
facilities, technology to be employed, and prioritization of identified subprojects within a local
government jurisdiction, are all required by the sub-sectoral Technical Memoranda issued by GOI
for preparation of IUIDP proposals by local governments (see Annex 16 for summary of sub-
sectoral criteria.) In accordance with these agreed procedures, alternatives were identified and
analyzed with varying techniques depending on the sub-sector and the size of the proposed
investment (e.g. through standard cost-benefits analysis for large subprojects in water supply,
urban roads and drainage subsectors as well as for new solid waste disposal sites; least-cost
alternative analysis for subprojects in solid waste collection, human waste/sanitation, kampung
improvement programs and market infrastructure improvement programs; and simple
prioritization of extensions to service coverage from existing systems have been based on
population served, poverty conditions, and related criteria for smaller subprojects).  While
government involvement in urban infrastructure development is broadly justified because of the
strong environmental, health and social externalities present in the provision of basic urban
infrastructure services, identification of opportunities for participation by the private sector as
well as local community in project design and implementation was specifically included in each
local government PJM and encouraged wherever appropriate. More detailed discussions are
provided in the following section, "Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis".



- 46 -
7.3          Fiscal Analysis and Cost Recovery. The financial situation of local governments
as well as PDAMs has been examined and action plans for revenue improvement have been
prepared.  The project design limits the total project investment to that which the local
governments can afford to counterpart with their own-source revenues and INPRES grant
entitlements after meeting operations and maintenance (O&M) requirements. PDAM financial
projections are summarized for each participating PDAM in Annex 15, including forecasts of
internal cash generation by each PDAMs. In accordance with GOI policies, the project at the
same time enhances and encourages use of local government and PDAM borrowing capacities, as
they have improved during the implementation of EJBUDP and the further improvements
scheduled in the RIAPs for the proposed project (see Table 6.1). In the roads subsector, indirect
and direct cost recovery has been established, under previous Bank projects and sector work, to
be functioning reasonably well. Direct cost recovery in other subsectors remains problematic.
See Section VI for further discussion.
7.4          Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.  Since the proposed project
provides investments in seven sub-sectors of urban infrastructure services in all seven cities and 29
districts covering a total of more than 102 urban areas, it was necessary to develop a structured
approach to economic analysis. Subprojects are classified according to investment costs, i.e.,
small (less than Rp 500 million in constant 1994 prices), medium (between Rp 500 million and Rp
2 billion) and large (over Rp 2 billion). Small subprojects must comply with the agreed planning
and design criteria (Annex 16) and their economic viability is presumed based on evaluation of
similar subprojects implemented under previous operations and the demonstrated affordability of
the technical standards adopted. Medium size subprojects are subject to a simplified economic
analysis, utilizing thresholds to select investment options, a sampling of which will be checked
during Bank supervision and annual program reviews (e.g. traffic counts on existing roads
proposed for upgrading, drainage serving densely populated areas, etc.). Large subprojects must
go through a more rigorous economic feasibility analysis with all assumptions and methodology
subject to Bank review on a case-by-case basis.
7.5         Water Supply. The current water supply systems suffer many problems. Piped
water connection ratios are generally low. Due to poor maintenance and deterioration of older
systems, almost all distribution and connection pipes are leaking, causing water contamination and
large water losses -- unaccounted-for-water of many systems is over 40%. Reservoir capacity is
also inadequate. To address these problems, the water supply component of the proposed project
will continue the system rehabilitation efforts begun under EJBUDP and provide some 120,000
new connections. The program will improve water quality and reliability by installing new
secondary and tertiary piping systems and replacing old piping systems, as needed. Water loss
reduction programns will be undertaken in all the towns to progressively reduce the rate of
unaccounted-for-water losses from their current averages of 35-40% to about 25%. Storage
reservoirs will be constructed to increase system capacity so that new source development will
generally be deferred, per DGCK guidance.
7.6          The main benefits are increased availability of clean, piped water at reduced costs.
Demand surveys of current and potential users of the water supply systems were conducted in all
service areas proposed for substantial investment under the proposed project. In light of current



- 47 -
water shortages in many service areas, and the poor quality and high cost of alternative sources of
water, the demand surveys conducted for each PDAM demonstrate that the proposed tariff
increases (32% to 60%) would not compromise affordability. Net present values (NPV) and
financial internal rate of returns (FIRR) are calculated for medium and large water subprojects.
FIRR is used as a lower bound estimate of economic rate of return and a detailed description of
the methodology is presented in Annex 16. A summary of these results for each of the initial 20
participating PDAMs is presented in Annex 15. A 12% rate of return is used as the minimum
feasible rate, in part keyed to the proposed 11.75% on-lending rate for subsidiary loan agreements
under the project. The FIRRs of selected water supply subprojects typically fall between 13% to
18%. Several subprojects reviewed at appraisal proved to be non-economic and were either
eliminated from the project or modified substantially.
7.7         Urban Roads. Urban road transport is frustrated by the lack of an integrated
major road network. Some 7,000 km of roads in East Java, most of which are district roads, are
in a state of serious deterioration due to heavy traffic, poor maintenance and inadequate drainage
systems. Traffic is congested on major urban roads and in business centers, particularly during
peak hours, as a result of inadequate traffic management and insufficient junction capacity. The
urban road component of the proposed project will provide a program of widening of major roads
and bridges, rehabilitation and maintenance of mostly district roads, including improvement of
drainage, curb and sidewalks. Traffic management programs will also be initiated in a number of
towns. Routine and periodic maintenance needs have been identified, and the road agencies will
have maintenance budgets increases and undertake improved road maintenance.
7.8         The draft report of the recent Roads Sector Study clearly documents the high
priority and significant rates of return for investments in urban areas in improved accessibility,
savings in vehicle operating costs and in road construction and maintenance expenditures, as well
as increased land and other property values. Economic analysis, including calculation of NPV and
EIRR, of all road subprojects followed the 'Urban Road Planning and Programming Manual",
which was issued by the Ministry of Public Works and prepared with the technical assistance of
two Bank projects, the Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Loan 2817-IND) and the Urban
Sector Loan (Loan 2816-IND) (see Annex 16). The selected subprojects all passed the test of
economic analysis that requires the minimum rate of return of 12%.
7.9         Solid Waste Management. Currently less than half of the solid waste generated
in East Java's urban areas is being collected. Collection and disposal equipment capacities fall
short of fast growing demand. Much of the existing equipment is non-operational at any point in
time due to inappropriate operation and lack of maintenance. Access roads to waste disposal sites
are also inadequate. The solid waste management component will increase collection coverage to
nearly 80% and additional waste transfer depots will be constructed; capacities of existing waste
disposal sites (TPAs) will also be expanded and new sites developed. Collection and disposal site
equipment will be purchased, and programs to improve operation and maintenance of equipment
and TPAs will be implemented. In addition, appropriate access roads to TPAs will be
constructed.



- 48 -
7.10        The benefits of the solid waste management component arise from cleaner air and
water as a result of reduced burning and dumping of solid waste into rivers and drains, and
improved public health by reduction of disease-bearing pests, as well as from more efficient
collection and treatment. As the benefits are mainly health and environment related, they are
difficult to quantify. The planning was based on real demand and willingness to pay, while
priority is placed on communities with densities over 200 persons per hectare. The design was
based on least cost alternatives. The cost recovery will gradually improve under the project in
accordance with the agreed Revenue Improvement Action Plan (RIAP) which specifically
addresses the solid waste tariff issue in each jurisdiction.
7.11        Human Waste/Sanitation. Sludge treatment facilities and collection equipment
are inadequate and wastewater treatment facilities simply do not exist in East Java's urban areas.
Desludging volume from septic tanks is less than 20% of the estimated volume produced. Public
awareness of the health benefits of sludge and wastewater treatment is also lacking. The
wastewater/sanitation component (see Annex 5 for summary) will provide wastewater and sludge
treatment facilities and transportation equipment in Malang and six other cities. It will also install
or rehabilitate sanitation facilities with community participation and household loan programs.
There will also be a community-based sanitation education program.
7.12        The wastewater treatment facilities will serve an estimated 210,000 people. The
benefits are improved health and avoided ground water contamination. These benefits are not
easily quantified, and therefore, no NPV and EIRR has been calculated. The planning and design
were based on population density, ground water table level, and least cost alternatives.
Desludging has been operated as a private sector business since 1986 in a few localities and its
further development will be supported by the project through the construction of sludge treatment
facilities and strengthened regulation of sludge dumping.
7.13        Drainage/Flood Control. Low lying areas in the Province are subject to flooding
due to poor maintenance of old systems, insufficient capacity, and inappropriate designs of
irrigation channels functioning as drainage canals. The proposed project will provide programs to
improve O&M, rehabilitate drainage canals, and normalize river banks.
7.14        The benefits are reduced flood-caused damage, reduced traffic disruption,
increased land values, and improved health, especially of poor people residing in low lying and
flood prone areas. The benefits are not easily quantifiable and no NPV and EIRR has been
calculated. However, the cost has been verified to be less than that of relocating residents and a
benefit-cost (B/C) ratio has been calculated by dividing the expected increases in land values,
which are used as proxy for economic benefits, by investments and O&M costs of the proposed
schemes. The estimated B/C ratios are all greater than 1.8. The minimum increases in land values
required for the investments to be economically justified are around 3% to 6%. The expected
increase in land values as a result of the investments are around 5% to 10%.
7.15        KIP/MIIP. The KIP component, at about 3% of the total project cost, will
provide basic infrastructure services including public toilets, solid waste collection, foot path,
water supply, and drainage and cover some 200 kampungs (2,700 hectares).  Market



- 49 -
infrastructure improvements, including improvements to superstructures, will also be provided
under the project for some 80 market areas. As several recent project audits and reviews by OED
show, KIP has immediate and very positive impacts on the living conditions (i.e., access to motor
roads, water facilities, drainage, garbage collection, sanitation, lighting, education and health
facilities) of kanpung residents using low cost technologies. It is further shown that the areas
surrounding the KIP sites also benefit from KIPs as the physical and economic impacts of KIPs
ripple to neighboring communities. Moreover, the KIP scheme has been replicated through out
Indonesia, without the Bank financing. (OED Report no. 14747-IND documents these findings;
see previous reference in para. 2.4.) MIIP investments are also very much needed and are more
than covered from municipal fees on the vendors, who participate in deciding the improvements.
Formal economic analysis was not carried out for KIP and MIIP because of the difficulty in
quantifying benefits, but improvements are subject to least cost analysis according to agreed
standards.
7.16         Quantitative Sensitivity Analysis. Quantitative sensitivity analysis was carried
out as an integral part of the quantitative economic analysis for the subprojects in water supply,
urban roads and drainage subsectors.  Typical scenarios include demand reductions, cost
increases, and project implementation delays. The extent of the increases or decreases assumed
for the sensitivity analysis was based on the implementation experiences of similar type of urban
infrastructure investment projects. Special attention was given to designs for those subprojects
whose rates of return were close to the cut-off rate of 12%. Final project design and selection
took into account the results of the sensitivity analysis. For nearly all subprojects, the benefits
remained robust within normal sensitivity parameters. Summary results for water supply are
included on the subproject tables in Annex 15, while other results are available in project files.
7.17         Analysis of Institutional Capacity. The Local Institutional Development Action
Plans (LIDAPs) prepared for each local government and PDAM document the current
institutional capacities and propose specific action needed to assure project implementation
capacity and establish the foundations for sustainable capacities to deliver urban services. Section
V of this report summarizes the basic institutional roles, capacities and requirements. EJBUDP
has established that most local governments have the necessary capacities to successfully
implement the proposed project.
7.18         Poverty Analysis. As previously noted in Section III, urban poverty in East Java
is a serious problem, both in terms of total numbers of urban poor and the magnitude of the
'poverty gap"between the poor and basic measures of adequate income. The project design has,
in accordance with GOI guidelines for IUIDP programming, given priority to facilities and
services improvements for poor neighborhoods in each project locality. Most local governments
in East Java clearly recognize that it is the poor who do not have access to clean and affordable
water, waste disposal facilities, and other basic services, and who usually reside in low-lying areas
or along drains and river banks that are often affected by frequent flooding. This project is
expected to alleviate such impacts as many components are especially targeted at improving the
quality of life and the environment in the such areas. However, no explicit poverty alleviation
component, per se, is proposed.



- 50 -
7.19        The water supply component would increase the poor's access to clean water
while reducing the costs. An installment payment plan would be provided for piped water house
connections who would otherwise not be able to afford them. Water bills would be less than 5%
of the expenditures of low-income households. The drainage/flood control component would
reduce the frequency and duration of floods in the poor, low-lying areas. It would reduce poverty
damage and improve health conditions caused by stagnant polluted water in the neighborhoods,
and also reduce access disruptions. The human and solid waste disposal/treatment components
would reduce morbidity and improve health conditions of the poor. The road and traffic
management program, which would improve conditions for non-motorized vehicles and
pedestrians, would also benefit the poor. The KIP/MIIP component, which is targeted to densely
populated poor neighborhoods, would substantially improve the living conditions of the very poor
by providing basic infrastructure services at very low costs.
7.20        Environmental Improvements. Environmental management and mitigation
measures have been built into the design and cost of subprojects, and institutional arrangements
have been made for monitoring impacts on the environment, taking into account the
implementation experiences of previous subprojects implemented under EJBUDP (para 5.29-5.33
and Annex 13). The project will have a positive impact on the environment through water supply,
urban road improvement, solid and human waste disposal, drainage and flood control and
kampung improvement program. For instance, the water supply subprojects will provide clean
water and reduce ground water depletion. The urban road maintenance and upgrading and side
drains improvement will reduce air pollution and fuel consumption per kilometer through
improved road capacities, surfaces and traffic management. Improvement of solid and human
waste disposal will reduce soil and water contamination. Drainage and flood control will reduce
flooding and flood-related problems (frequent flooding brings water highly contaminated by solid
and human waste into direct contact with households and causes severe health hazards). KIP will,
to a varying extent, incorporate all of these improvements.
7.21        Economic Performance Indicators.   The monitoring of the economic
performance of the project will essentially be included in the system of monitoring and
performance indicators described for the whole program in Annex 4. Particularly as the key data
for benefit calculation is included in the routine project monitoring system, it will be relatively
simple to estimate the economic benefit/performance of subprojects or larger aggregations as
required.

B. RISKS
7.22        The proposed project design acknowledges that substantial risks are involved for
both the physical implementation of infrastructure improvements and the intended institutional
development of provincial and local governments. For the physical development supported by the
project, the most significant risks include inappropriate investment choices by local governments,
inadequate inspection and/or financial controls resulting in poor quality or incomplete works, and
failure to implement proposed works due to budget shortages, land acquisition problems, or other
obstacles.
7.23        There is also a serious risk involving the pace of required institutional
development, for decentralized systems of management, finance, manpower, and related
processes, as it is difficult to predict and may not be adequate for full and timely achievement of
all project activities in all local governments and these PDAMs. The ability of the East Java
provincial government to further strengthen its capacities to perform its assigned program
management and intermediation functions is also a substantial general risk factor for the
effectiveness of the whole program. This is reflected through many specific risks associated with
project implementation: limited institutional capacity to manage implementation, delays in
counterpart funds for the project due to budget constraints, inability of local governments to meet
their revenue targets, and delays caused by protracted procurement procedures for works,
material/equipment and consultants. Communication and coordination of project implementation
is made more difficult by the large size of the Province and number of involved local agencies.
7.24        In response to such risks, the project will focus on building decentralized
implementation capacity. The physical implementation of the project will be greatly assisted by
improved transparency and accountability provided by the PPIM and APIPs clarifying the roles
and responsibility for each implementing unit. Project managers would be trained and consultants
would be appointed to help with design, implementation and supervision of the various
components of the project, and program management support will be provided to the key
provincial units, as well as to the local governments by support teams in each Assistant
Governor's sub-regional office. The financing plans have been endorsed by the agencies that will
provide the domestic funding. Standard bidding documents and procedures have been discussed
with the local agencies and to the extent possible subprojects have been packaged together for
tendering, so as to attract larger contractors who normally deliver better quality works with less
technical supervision. The Bank has planned sufficient supervision resources, especially in the
early years, for early detection and solution of problems.

EAST JAVA-BALI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF
MID-TERM REVIEW SUMMARY REPORT
1.    The Bank mission to conduct supervision and mid-term review of the East Java-Bali
Urban Development Project (EJBUDP) visited Indonesia from January 29 through February 16,
1994. The mission produced seperate supervision and mid-term review reports. The supervision
Aide Memoire with immediate action recommendations has been circulated seperately. The mid-
term review summary report focused on the major new features or innovations incorporated in
the program design for EJBUDP and the overall performance of the program to date as a "pilot"
of the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Program (IUIDP) approach to urban services
provision by local governments.
2.    SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES of the project to date include the local and provincial
governments strong support for the decentralization of infrastructure programming and
implementation processes, which are at the heart of the IUIDP concept. The new procedures for
local governments to have direct access to Bank Special Account funds (the channeling via
SPABP-RK) in support of their approved medium- term investment programs (PJMs) has been
particularly popular with local officials, as the mechanism provides Bank financing of the local
development budget (APBD) for the first time in Indonesia. The Revenue Improvement Action
Plans (RIAPs) for each local government have generally been shown to be conservative estimates
of potential revenue mobilization from local sources, and many local jurisdictions are now
pursuing much more agressive revenue collection policies. It appears that similar positive results
have generally been achieved for the Local Institutional Development Action Plans (LIDAPs)
in most local governments, but the systematic documentation of the LIDAP results has not yet
been compiled by GOI. Many of the successful features of the EJBUDP design have already
been replicated in subsequent urban projects of the Bank and other donors, particularly ADB.
3.    SIGNIFICANT ISSUES/PROBLEMS remain with some of the project elements,
including the technical assistance, the sub-loan mechanism, and reporting systems, most notably.
The technical assistance to support the process at provincial and local levels was delayed in
almost all cases by at least 18 months from the mobilization schedule agreed at project
negotiation, which has impaired progress and capacity-building efforts of the project in many
important areas. The project on-lending arrangements (Subsidiary Loans Agreements with
Prefinancing - SLAP) were designed by MoF, who encountered difficulty in initiating the sub-
loans; subsequent operations have already modified the prefinancing and disbursement
arrangements of this mechanism, while retaining the the basic policy elements agreed (e.g.
interest rates, terms, etc.). The Program Financial Accounting and Management System
(PFAMS) and the Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management System (POMMS), which
were intended to improve local capacities to manage and report on the progress of program
(i)

implementation, were seriously delayed in mobilizing the needed technical assistance, but are
now approaching full installation and operation. However, these delays have made complete
reporting on project implementation nearly impossible to date. The mission noted substantial
improvements in available project documentation as compared to previous supervision missions.
4.    In reviewing the "pilot" role of the project for the IUIDP approach. the mission noted
at least six areas requiring further development of the process for use in the longer-term. As
GOI begins the Sixth National 5-Year Development Plan (Repelita VI), it is critical that the
urban sectoral program structure be clearly specified for all sub-sectors, including appropriate
standards, service/performance criteria, grant/loan support, and O/M targets. Attention is still
needed in IUIDP institutionalization, with particular regard to building process management
capacities and understanding at the local and provincial levels, which remain very uneven to
date, as well as improved coordination of central government activities and policies affecting
local services provision. Central-local financial relationships must also recieve additional
attention to appropriately balance local service provision responsibilities with the resources
necessary, within a clear and consistent program framework of central support to local efforts.
The planning basis for IUIDP is also in need of basic strengthening with the definition of spatial
nlanning/land management guidance in the future preparation of investment programs which
accurately reflects the economic development potential and environmentally sustainable intensity
of future growth in each urban area. The mission also noted that revision in local budgeting
practices, particularly in the capital budgeting function, were essential to achieving IUIDP
objectives of improved local decision-making and service delivery. Lastly, the definition of an
appropriate framework for private sector participation remains a high priority for the entire
urban infrastructure sector in Indonesia, as discussed on several previous occaisions with GOI.
5.    The mission endorsed the immediate initiation of preparation activities for the next Bank
lending operations in East Java and Bali to sustain the momentum achieved by local governments
which participated in the current program. as well as to initiate full implementation of the third
batch of local investment programs which includes the major city of Malang in East Java.
However, the new operations should address the policy framework improvements noted above.
as well as explicitly addressing environmental management issues for urban areas, which have
not recieved adequate attention in previous Bank-GOI urban programs to date.

SECOND EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Implementation Monitoring and Performance Indicators
A.   Background and Approach
The Bank and GOI have mutually undertaken the development of project
implementation monitoring systems and attempted to define infrastructure performance
evaluation methodologies within the framework of several previous urban and water
supply projects, including four previous operations in East Java. These efforts began in
1985-86 with initial attempts to develop a "Performance-Oriented Maintenance
Management System" (POMMS) which would operate from an inventory of local
infrastructure and periodic conditions surveys to prioritize maintenance expenditure needs,
with the City of Surabaya being one of the pilot cases. In the water supply sector, a
parallel effort was mounted through the establishment of a water supply "Program
Monitoring and Development Unit" (PMDU) to monitor the implementation of two
successive province-wide projects and evaluate the progress of PDAMs toward financial
and institutional sustainability. The East Java-Bali Urban Development Project (EJBUDP)
initiated in 1991 combined the previous efforts and expanded the scope of these systems,
by adding water supply to the POIMS, as well as financial and institutional development
action plans (RIAPs and LIDAPs) for all local governments in the province. EJBUDP
also developed and installed a comprehensive computerized "Project Financial Accounting
and Monitoring System" (PFAMS) in all local governments. The proposed project will
continue to rely on these systems and assist provincial and local officials to improve them.
During the implementation of EJBUDP the Bank also sponsored research into
defining appropriate performance measurement techniques for infrastructure and urban
services delivery. The results of this research' suggest that infrastructure service should
be measured in terms of five types of parameters:
1.    Quantity
2.    Quality
3     Coverage
4     Reliability
5.    Sustainability

ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 6
For all parameters emphasis must be placed on measuring levels of services delivered to
users, rather than intermediate measures of implementation or "supply" of infrastructure.
Recent Bank guidance documents on formulating project monitoring and
evaluation systems establish five stages of the project implementation cycle to be
considered:
1.   inputs
2.    process steps
3.    outputs
4.    results/outcomes
5.    impacts
Defining project performance expectations or targets in terms of the above stages of
project implementation must be done in the context of (i) existing conditions and levels of
service currently provided, (ii) current service deficits measured against effective demands
or demonstrable needs for services, and (iii) established medium-term standards or goals
for service provision (e.g. REPELITA or even PJP goals).
The following figure graphically combines these factors to form a matrix which
will be discussed with each local implementing agency in establishing their annual
performance targets and operating their monitoring and evaluation systems. The
"context" data and standards are described in the PJM document for each local
government and subsector technical memoranda (although some sub-sector measures of
needs/demands need further work and will be redefined for the proposed EJUDP3 concept
of realizing economic potential).
The project design further refines the successful EJBUDP model of decentralized
project implementation and "bottom-up" approach to selection of investment and action
priorities, which implies that monitoring of implementation progress and impact must be
focused at the local government level. However, in accordance with both GOI and Bank
requirements, project progress reporting must support a procedure to evaluate the
performance of the project in aggregate toward achieving development objectives for the
province, including all 36 local governments and 7 subsectors. Given the wide variation in
current conditions, local capacities and priorities, the project design has been structured to
support a two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process to include: (a) the continued
operation and strengthening of comprehensive program management systems in each
locality and participating PDAM as used in EJBUTDP and familiar to local officials
(generally measuring implementation performance in terms of actual input and output
quantities and process milestones versus agreed implementation/action plans), and (b) the
selection of a few key measures or "priority targets" within each local program (PJM) to

be used as indicators of outcomes or impacts of highest importance in the local context
toward attaining project development objectives.  As in EJBUDP, the provincial
compilation of all local project data will allow aggregation of project results and provide
an overview of total achievements of the project. However, such aggregations can be
misleading or give an inaccurate picture of actual outcomes or impacts of most importance
in particular urban areas. It is proposed that the attainment of the selected "priority
targets" for each locality and PDAM be used as the primary indicator of project
performance, as an adjunct to the basic monitoring systems in place.
In the proposed two-tiered monitoring and evaluation process, the established
monitoring systems correlates to the "implementation monitoring" portion of the attached
matrix, while the proposed selection of "priority targets" should include selected
measures of development objectives attainment focused on expected outcomes and
impacts, preferably toward the reliability and sustainability side (bottom-right) of the
matrix. This two-tiered system is further described in the following paragraphs.
B.    Implementation Monitoring
The systems and procedures installed in East Java provincial offices and the
participating local governments under EJBUDP and utilized in the preparation of the
proposed project enable the detailed monitoring and measurement of progress to be a
relatively straight-forward task.  A Performance-Oriented Maintenance Management
System (POMMS), now installed in all local governments, establishes current baseline
status of infrastructure systems and delivery of services, as well as O&M expenditure
requirements. The medium-term program (PJM) documents for each local government
present subproject investments in terms of overcoming specific infrastructure/service
deficits in each urban area. Each local jurisdiction has prepared local government action
plans to improve own-source revenue (RIAP), O&M implementation (POMMS), and
institutional capacities (LIDAP). Progress toward each of the stated intermediate project
objectives at local government level can thus be measured by:
(i)    monitoring the attainment of improvements in infrastructure/service
coverage, quantity, quality and reliability versus the PJM targeted levels
(Note:  The targeted levels vary greatly among localities as current
baselines, needs, and financial capacities to respond are quite different in
each area; project targets and progress will always be presented in context
of needs and baseline conditions in the standard reporting formats).
(ii)   monitoring the implementation of action plans for institutional development
(LIDAP) together with realization of programmed (PJM) expenditure
levels for O&M and physical quantities of maintenance performed versus

ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 6
POMMS targets, as well as monitoring the realization of local government
and PDAM revenue enhancement action plans (in terms of the percentage
of potential revenue realized); and
(iii)   monitoring the preparation of all needed components for each local
government in designing the REPELITA VII strategic development
program, per the agreed work plan for this comprehensive effort (mainly
against agreed time schedule of preparation steps, to be defined with a
PHRD grant for initial design and development of preparation process).
A Project Financial Accounting and Monitoring System (PFAMS) has been installed in
each local government during EJBUDP which together with the established monitoring
procedures will produce complete information for quarterly progress reporting and to
support the regular review of the program by GOI and Bank supervision missions.
C.    Selection of Priority Targets
Utilizing the local "priority targets" as indicators to measure the overall progress
of the project toward its development objectives, requires that during the provincial
approval of the Annual Project Implementation Plan (APIP) for each local jurisdiction (see
para. 5.3 and Annex 8), mutual agreement be reached on the 5-7 priority targets which
best summarize or capture the project impacts/outcomes desired in each locality. In all
local governments and participating PDAMs, the total revenue targets and agreed
operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditure levels will be among those targets
selected, but other targets will vary widely with the priorities of the local PJM and local
conditions (e.g. targets may include institutional capacity outcomes, O&M performance
results for drainage, or key process steps such as site selection for solid waste, in addition
to key physical infrastructure implementation necessary to produce desired impacts). A
menu of potential targets is suggested by sub-sector in the following Table 1, and a sample
of suggested "priority targets" for the City of Malang are displayed below (final
quantified target to be established in APIP). During the annual review, local governments
and participating PDAMs meeting priority targets will be encouraged to expand/accelerate
their programs, while poor performance would result in decreased funding until targets are
met.
D.    Project Performance Indicators and Rating
The proposed project would utilize the attainment of the local priority targets as
the primary performance indicator of attainment of project objectives. The priority targets
would be classified as either "implementation progress" or "development objectives"
targets when established each year. Reporting would be done on a simple attained or not

attained basis (pass/fail) and the project performance would be classified for both
measures on the basis of the percentage of annual priority targets attained, as follows:
Highly Satisfactory: 80% or more attained
Satisfactory: 60%-80%
Unsatisfactory: 30%-60%
Highly Unsatisfactory: less than 30% attained
Confirmation of reported results in attaining the priority targets will be included in the
scope of the Technical Audits. Further details of this approach will be discussed with the
provincial and local officials involved during project launch workshops, and assessed
during the initial Annual Review in October 1996.

EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT-2
HUMAN WASTE/SANITATION COMPONENT
This component will improve urban environmental conditions within seven cities
and 29 kabupatens throughout Eastern Java by appropriate combination of:
*  Adequate kabupatenlkotamadya-level wastewater and septic tank sludge
treatment facilities;
*  Neighborhood community (kelurahan) infrastructure;
*  Mechanisms for sustainable financing  of household-level flush toilet
connections;
*  Adequate, targeted, community-based, sanitation education;
*  Improved public and private sector capacities at DAT7 III levels; and
*  DAH7I/JI-level regulatory reform.
Thus, implementation will focus on benefits to, and the active involvement of, public and
private sector entities at 4 levels of aggregation: (i) provincial; (ii) kabupaten/kotamadya;
(iii) kelurahans within kabuipaienlkotamadya; and (iv) individual households.
A. Background
Infection and Morbidity Above Regional Average
In recent years, GOI investment in sanitation has lagged far behind investments in
related urban water supply. Although the infant mortality rate had declined during the
1980s, by 1988 it still remained among the highest in Southeast Asia at 60-70 infant
deaths per 1,000 live births. Even more alarming are the health statistics which show that
the incidence of diarrhea diseases and helminth infections in children has not declined at all
in recent years. Thus, water and sanitation facilities, combined with hygiene education,
remain essential for the prevention of infection and reduction of currently high levels of
morbidity.
Foundation for Improvement Established
Sludge Treatment. The need for adequate sludge treatment and disposal has been
identified as a significant environmental concern throughout East Java. That concern is
evidenced by the fact that 14 local governments included IPLTs and 13 have included
sludge collection trucks in their proposed programs. It will be necessary, however, to
prepare specific communities prior to commencement of operations; especially with



- 72 -
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 7
respect to their responsibility for emptying septic tanks periodically and paying for that
service.
Community/Household Level Sanitation. With respect to community-level
sanitation sub-components, EJUDP-2 will benefit particularly from lessons learned from
the pilot (UNDP-financed) Community Water & Sanitation Project (CWSP)l
implemented, in support of EJBUDP, during the period 1989-1994. In particular, tested
methodologies and instructional materials are now available with respect to: (i)
appropriate technologies and standards; (ii) community organization and financing; (iii)
approaches to both kabupateni/kotamadya and kelurahan-level orientation and training;
and (iv) sanitation education and social marketing.  Thus, the relatively successful
experience of CWSP will be "scaled-up" (with appropriate modifications) in EJUDP-2.
Regulatory Reforms Identified. As part of the CWSP, a total of 74 separate
laws were identified at DA TI I/l-levels in East Java which directly affected community-
based water and sanitation activities and options and specific recommendations for reform
have been proffered. Although none of those recommendations have been implemented to
date, they provide a policy foundation for action under the terms of the proposed project.
B. Project Components: Summary Description
This component of the proposed EJUDP-2 consists of 6 sub-components: (i)
wastewater treatment; (ii) kelurahan-level infrastructure; (iii) household sanitation finance;
(iv) sanitation education; (v) capacity-building at Dati 14I levels; and (vi) Dati II-level
regulatory reform. Each of these sub-components is briefly described below.
Wastewater and Sludge Treatment
Malang. The major works proposed for Malang include 6 small packaged
wastewater treatment plants to provide secondary treatment of effluent into the Brantas
river. Designs have been completed for the treatment plants, and associated small bore
collection systems.
Other sanitation components are a sludge treatment facility with truck; a city-wide
sanitation management study; private toilets; and public toilets (MCK). It has been
proposed that the sludge treatment plant should be installed at the solid waste disposal site
at Supit Urang. Although the plant has been designed, the site currently lacks water and
electricity. Therefore, costs have been included for the connection of these facilities in the
total package estimate.
I      LTNDP Project INS/88/005 was financed by UNDP and The Govermnent of the Netherlands in parallel with,
and in direct support of, the World Bank-financed East Java-Bali Urban Development Project. Joint Executing
Agencies were the Regional Water & Sanitation Group for East Asia & Pacific (RWSGEAP) of the UNDP/World
Bank Water & Sanitation Program and the Ministries of Public Works, Home Affairs, and Health of The Govemment
of Indonesia. It should, however, be noted that communities within only three kabupaten were included in CWSP
(i.e., Sidoarjo in East Java and Badung and Denpasar in Bali).

ANNEX S
Page 3 of 7
Other Kabupatens/Kotamadyas.  The Project intends to provide adequate
wastewater treatment facilities to serve 140 thousand people in 6 cities outside of Malang
and Surabaya. These facilities will consist of off-site small bore sewerage/waste water
treatment plants. Proposed locations include Sidoarjo, Tuban, Lamongan, Pasuruan,
Bojonegoro, and Gresik kabupatens. In addition, 13 local governments will receive
sludge treatment facilities and trucks; 27 will build new MCKs and 5 will refurbish existing
MCKs.
Kelurahan-Level Infrastructure
The project will include a kelurahan sanitation infrastructure sub-component
which will stress community ownership and responsibility. The Project will contribute to
improving sanitation conditions approximate 100 kelurahan by installing or rehabilitating
sanitation facilities; the specific design of which will be based on consultation with the
affected households and community leaders. More specifically, kelurahan will have the
opportunity to participate in the identification, planning, management, and financing of
appropriate infrastructure investments and subsequent maintenance of sewerage/drainage
systems, septic tanks, MCKs, and community toilets within their own communities.
Almost 11,000 septic tanks will be built in 14 kabupatens/kotamadyas and 2,300 will be
refurbished in 7 others.
The community participation approach outlined above was the essence of the
CWSP. That experience has shown to be successful with regards to:
o     Needs identification for water and sanitation facilities;
o     Technology selection;
*     Community contribution to the construction of facilities; and
*     Knowledge related to appropriate technologies and low-cost O&M.
Kelurahan will be eligible to participate in the proposed Project by meeting either
or both of two criteria: (i) they produce significant environmental degradation in other
areas of the KabupatenlKotamadya as a result of inadequate sanitation infrastructure
and/or (ii) the kelurahan is "poor" according to the criteria established for inclusion in the
broader KIP/MIP Component of the proposed EJUDP-2.2
The "community resilience body" (LKMD), and the Family Welfare Movement
(PKK) will both have active responsibilities for promoting community water and sanitation
program  at this level.  Most important of these responsibilities will be proposing
appropriate financial mechanisms and corresponding institutional arrangements within the
commnunity.
2     Agreement with GOI will be sought that kelurahan eligible for the sanitation sub-component of the
KIPvMIP project component will be permitted to use Inpress Desa Tertinggal (IDT) funds in whole or part for the
fnancing of Kelurahan sanitation infrastructure available under the terms of the Project.

ANNEX S
Page 4 of 7
The project planning and implementation process at the community level will
include:
*  Preparation of a Sanitation Action Plan in the context of EJUDP-2 or other
acceptable kabupaten/kotamadya development plan;
*  Establishment of community organizational arrangements;
*  Detailed planning and design of investments with mutual cooperation among
community leaders and other public and private sector technical support staff;
and
*  Identification of financing arrangements.
Household Sanitation Finance
The need for proper toilets throughout urban and semi-urban Eastern Java is not
known, but it can be assumed that a substantial number of homes will need to improve
existing, or provide new, facilities if 100% connection to sewers is to be realized.
However, in principle, GOI should not incur expenses at the household level for capital
improvements (i.e., toilets and connections). Thus, a sustainable low-cost sanitation
program needs to have access to finance for low-income communities. It is also desirable
that it be operated on the basis of full cost recovery of capital, operation and maintenance.
So, it is desirable to establish a local level for low-revolving fund.
Therefore, the primary objective here is to institutionalize mechanisms for
financing household-level pour-flush toilets and connecting them to septic tanks and, on a
limited basis, to community sewers. For that purpose, the Project will support extension
of the "Revolving Fund Scheme" established by CWSP on a pilot basis in six communities
in Sidoarjo Kabupaten, East Java. During implementation of the CWSP, seed capital for
the revolving fund was initially drawn from GOI's budget.3 Households which received
private latrine facilities were required to repay in monthly installments according to agreed
terms; typically interest of I % per month over five years. Moneys repaid into the Fund
became available for further lending to other community households. Under the terms of
the proposed EJUDP-2, LKMDs will be responsible for monitoring repayments and
resolving and problems or disputes.
Using essentially that methodology,4 the CWSP stimulated the construction of 135
latrines in Sidoarjo kabupaten, East Java. Of those, 208 households were on schedule
with repayments as of September 1993, 43 were deferred for "good reason" and 25 were
3      During the trial period, initial "seed" capital was provided by Central Govermment. However, the system
is quite flexible in that it could be financed from a variety of sources. Thus, other sources of fmnance could be
identified for capitalization purposes. The most appropriate type of govermment funding would be from the local
government budget, since the local "house of representatives" (DPRD TK II) could approve it.
4      Manuals which provided guidelines for implementing the Revolving Fund were prepared for, and
used in, the pilot communities. Thesc manuals are still available for use during implementation of EJUDP-2 and
should require, at most, only minor refinement.

in default.5  In aggregate, the number of persons in both East Java and Bali who had
defaulted was less than ten percent of the total number of loans.6
Sanitation Education and Social Marketing
This component is directed toward increasing community awareness of, and desire
for, clean water and sanitation (although this specific project component focuses on
sanitation  services, the education  campaign will need  to  combine attention to  the
relationship  between  it and  water use).   Thus, the project will provide targeted,
community-based, sanitation education in support of sewerage/drainage systems in 7
cities, 2,000 MCKs, and a projected 13,000 household-level flush toilet connections to
septic tanks or sewers.
If the construction of such facilities is to have the desired effect, it will need to be
complemented by an effective community-based sanitation education program.
Community involvement is particularly important for effective utilization of sanitation
facilities because hygiene practices are so intimiately involved with both personal and
community behavior and preferences.
Past Experiences and Lessons Learned. Many useful lessons from experience
with community-based adult health education programs in Indonesia7 suggest that the
most effective methods are distribution of posters and door-to-door (or "cadre")
campaigns." However, for the cadre-based, door-to-door method to work, at least three
things are necessary: (i) household attitude surveys; (ii) materials based on those surveys;
and (iii) training of field workers.9
Pre-Existing Materials. A large inventory of materials prepared, under the
auspices of CWSP, to specifically address (water and) sanitation issues in East Java or
Bali are available. These include: TV spots (8), dramas (3), and "Dialogues (6);" radio
spots (20), local dramas (12), and features (6). In addition, 2700 posters (4 types), 300
leaflets, and one survey guidelines manual was produced. Finally, 'flip charts" on water
5      Financial records were very well kept in all demonstration villages.
6      In those instances where repayments were not in schedule, confidence that full payment will be made over
time remains high among village fund managers. Peer pressure plays a significant part in this. The highest default
occurred in Badung (25 households), but that was caused partly by erroneous infonnation passed by a contractoes
worinan that the latrines were free (despite agreements being signed).
7      Particular success in Indonesia has been achieved with respect to community-based education programs
regarding family planning and oral dehydration therapy.
An evaluation of CWSP's pilot demonstration of a conmmunity-based water and sanitation education
program in 12 demonstration villages of East Java and Bali concluded that the best result were achieved by door-to-
door campaigns and posters (both 98-100%); followed by radio (50-80%) and Television (50-72%).
9      For example, in support of CWSP, Lembaga Bina Swadaya, a national NGO, prepared survey materials and
manuals during July - December 1991. In addition. Bina Swadaya (another Indonesian NGO) carried-out test surveys
and prepared drafts of additional manuals. That was followed by training for 58 local counterpart team members, 225
GOI officials involved in IUMDP East Java and Bali, and 120 cadres. Finally, during the period from August 1992 to
October 1993, these same two NGOs conducted actual field trials.

and sanitation technology, community participation, health and sanitation, and revolving
fund schemes were developed for education purposes within the communities.
Capacity-Building at DA TI I/II Levels
Over the years, large numbers of DATI I/H officials in East Java have received
training to enhance technical, managerial, and financial skills across a broad range of
specialties. CWSP alone provided 225 GOI officials involved in EJBUDP with training
related to community-based water and sanitation infrastructure and services.
Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that further improvement is needed to:
*  Construct   and   maintain   core   infrastructure   at   the   aggregate
Kabupaten/Kotamadya level (e.g., operator training to ensure operational
efficiency of wastewater and sludge treatment plants);
*  Plan, program, and budget sanitation investments;
*  Provide managerial, technical, and financial assistance support to kelurahan;
and
*  Provide appropriate sanitation education.
A complete set of manuals, guidelines and other materials in support of training for
officials and NGO staff at Provincial, kotamadya/kabupaten, and kelurahan levels has
been prepared'0 and is available for use in EJUDP-2.
The Project will provide a "real world' context for capacity-building by
emphasizing the preparation of mutually consistent Sanitation Action Plans (SAPs) at
provincial, kotamadya/kabupaten, and kelurahan levels. SAP preparation supported by
the Project will emphasize a bottom-up approach which encourages and accommodates
community proposals (including contributory financing) for inclusion in DA7T II-level
medium term plans (Program Jangka Menengah - PJM). CWSP has successfully
developed and tested SAPs in Sijoardo Kabupaten, 2 other kabupaten in Bali, and has
assisted JLTDP to prepare SAPs in 45 Kelurahans in DKI Jakarta. Thus, the preparation
of SAPs has demonstrated that the process does increase community participation for
effective implementation of water and sanitation investments."I
10     The various manuals produced include the following: (i) Monitoring and Evaluation Design and Operating
Manual, (ii) Revolving Fund Design and Operating Manual, (iii) Private Sector Participation Guidelines, (iv)
Training Manual for SAP Preparation, (v) Social Marketing Survey Manual, (vi) Social Marketing Campaign
Manual, (vii) Market Survey Materials, (viii) Campaign Training Materials, (ix) Adult Training Manual, (x)
Standard Formats and Summary Fornats for SAP, (xi) SAP Preparation Manual, (xii) SAP Technology Selecton
Manual, (xiii) Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines, (xiv) Community Participation Guidelines, (xv) Cadre
Development Manual, (xvi) Cadre flandbook, and (xvii) Community Development Manual.  In addition,
approximnately 50 local government officials in Sidoarjo (East Java), Badung and Denpasar (Bali) were trained in
Sanitation Action Planning, Social Survey and Carnpaign Techniques, Adult Learning Methods, Community
Participation Techniques, and Revolving Fund Scheme.
I I    Nevertheless, additional work will need to be undertaken to test the replicability of low-cost
technologies (e.g., pour flush twin leaching pit latrine) promoted by CWSP. Various types of waste technologies
(conventional sewerage, combined sewerage, small bore sewerage, public toilets, individual/shared toilets), and their
appropriate application relative to environmental conditions (e.g., slope, soil, ground water), service levels (water
supply, drainage, existing facilities), and social conditions (population density, land use, land ownership) also need to
be further investigated. On-site sanitation technologies need to be made more simple.

ANNEX 5
Page 7 of 7
Finally, the Project will support GOI's on-going effort to clarify the respective roles
and responsibilities of various government entities at different levels with respect to
sanitation provision, maintenance, and improvement. Successful completion of that task is
needed if significant benefits are to result from training provided by the Project.
DATIIIII-Level Regulatory Reform
A comprehensive review of existing regulations affecting financial mechanisms
(cost recovery, credit assistance and revolving funds) and other aspects of community
water and sanitation development was undertaken under the terms of the CWSP. Several
ambiguities concerning the legal responsibilities of DATl IIl1-level officials were
discovered to be ambiguous. Therefore, specific recommendations were presented for
regulatory reforn; with a particular focus on kapupaten Sidoarjo in East Java. A total of
74 separate laws were identified at DA TI i/I-levels in East Java which directly affected
community-based water and sanitation activities and options.'2 Recommendations for
regulatory reform included:
*  Amendment (or replacement) of Act. No. 11/1974 as the main basis for
maintaining clean water and sanitation at the community level within urban
environments; and
*  Application of Government Regulation No. 6/1988 concerning the improved
coordination of vertical institutions with overlapping responsibilities within
kapupatens in East Java. 13
In addition, a recommendation was submitted to the Directorate of Environmental
Sanitation (September 1992) that Presidential Decree No. 29/1984 should be amended to
facilitate the establishment of more effective revolving funds for community water and
sanitation. In any event, none of these recommendations have been implemented.
12     See Airlangga University (Surabaya) "Report on Legal Issues (East Java)," mimeo (September 1992) and
Udayana University (Bali) "Report on Legal Issues (East Java),' mimeo (September 1992), (Jakarta. CWSP files,
RWSGEAP). In addition to the 74 local regulations identified in East Java, 48 other water/sanitation-related
ordinances were identified in Bali. Specific recommendations based on these reports were submitted to the relevant
governments through formal letters from the Director of Environmental Sanitation on September 12, 1992 and April
27, 1993.
13     For Bali, it was recommended that local govermnents should be empowered to issue and cancel permits for
discharge of wastes and to enable civil service investigators to enforce violations against those not having permits or
contravening the terms of those pernits.

SECOND EAST JAVA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Environmental Management
1.    The mid-term review of EJBUDP had shown that a massive effort had been expended in
preparing various environmental reports required under the GOI environmental assessment
regulations then in force. However, there were serious shortcomings in the extent to which that
effort was translated into environmental management actions -- modifications of sites or designs,
and implementation of mitigation or monitoring measures. Preparation of environmental
documents and review in Jakarta, both with limited interaction between Dati II staff and either the
consultants or the reviewers, plus an environmental assessment training program that was
implemented too late in the project and did not adequately address the needs of provincial and
local officials were the primary reasons for this situation. The environmental management
procedures for EJUDP2 were designed to avoid similar problems.
GOI Regulations for Environmental Assessment Methodology
2.    As a Category B project, EJUDP2 did not require a full environmental assessment (EA)
under OD 4.01, since the subprojects likely to be financed would not have significant adverse
environmental impacts and would be generally well suited to application of standard operating
procedures and mitigation measures for environmental protection. It was agreed at identification
that environmental assessment would proceed according to the GOI Environmental Impact
Assessment (AMDAL) regulations promulgated in Government Regulation Number 51 of 1993
(PP5 1), which is, with minor exceptions, consistent with the requirements of the Bank. PP5 1 was
amplified in 1994 in a series of decrees (KEPMEN) of the Minister of State for Environment.
Two of these are pertinent, since they provided the basis of the assessment methodology
KEPMEN 11 defines the types of activities for which environmental assessments (ANDALs) must
be prepared. KEPMEN 12 provides general guidelines for environmental management plans
(UTKL) and monitoring plans (UPL) necessary for activities which might affect the environment
but which do not require ANDALs. According to KEPMEN 12, sectoral ministries and
departments would develop more detailed UKL/UPL guidelines specifically for the sectors for
which they are responsible.
3.    KEPMEN 11 and 12 were promulgated prior to completion of the EJBUDP Batch 3
PJM's, but MPW has yet to issue sectoral UKL/UPL guidelines. To assist Dati II in
implementing the new procedures, BAPPEDA and PPMO and PPMU advisors developed a
screening matrix based on KEPMEN 11 and 12. For each IUDP sector, the matrix relates pre-
construction, construction, and operating activities that might affect the environment to standard
management and monitoring measures.

Actions Taken
4.    As the initial step in the assessment process, all Dati II were required to fill out the matrix
for their draft PJM's and submit it to BAPPEDA -I for review. BAPPEDA reviewed the draft
PJM's and screening matrices and invited all Dati II to discuss their draft matrices in separate
meetings in Surabaya. In addition, eight PJMs were found to include subprojects that could affect
protected areas and hence might require ANDALs. During the discussions with those Dati II, the
proposals were examined in detail and, in a number of cases modified by relocating proposed
facilities away from protected areas. It was finally ascertained that UKL/UPL would be sufficient
for all subprojects in the PJM's. The Dati II were directed to use the final, agreed matrices as the
blueprints for their UKL/UPL.
5.    Appraisal of the environmental management aspects of the project will be carried out on
the basis of the UKL/UPLs for the PJMs. During implementation, more detailed UKL/UPL will
be prepared for each subproject and reviewed by the Provincial Government. Approval of each
subproject will be contingent on completion of a satisfactory UKLIUPL.
6.    UKL/UPL for the PJM's were received from all Dati II. With the exception of
Kotamadya Malang, which has preparation consultants under contract, they were prepared
primarily by Dati II staff. They were reviewed by the provincial BAPPEDA and Dinas PU,
assisted by a consultant the Bank engaged specifically for this purpose. The consultant's report
was submitted to the appraisal mission, and mission members also examined a selected number of
UKL/UPL. The review shows that Dati II capacity to produce environmental management
reports has advanced substantially since preparation of this project began, primarily as a result of
the training administered by BAPPEDA. The results of the individual evaluations have been
reported back to the Dati II concerned.
Arrangements for Subproject UKL/UPL Preparation. Review and Implementation
7.    Arrangements for UKL/UPL preparation need to be specified so that Dati II staff are
clearly aware of their responsibilities and can commit sufficient resources to the work. The final
engineering design consultant and the Project Management Office of BAPPEDA-I, using the
UKL/UPL for PJM's, will assist by preparing standard clauses for environmental management and
monitoring measures to be incorporated in all tender documents and contracts.
8.    Arrangements for review of UKL/UPL are needed to ensure that the adequacy of
environmental safeguards is considered in subproject appraisal and that the management and
monitoring measures are included in subproject design and implementation. The review will be
the responsibility of structural units in provincial government. It would be coordinated by
BAPPEDA, Seksi SLH. BLH would participate in all reviews, and the cognizant technical dinas
would be involved according to the sector of the subproject. The review should include screening
of any proposed project sites not already screened when the PJM's were originally prepared,
especially for solid waste disposal sites (TPA's, for which field visits are a necessary part of the
review), to ascertain that they are not located in protected or sensitive areas and are generally
suitable for the intended purpose. Approval of the UKLfUPL by Dati I would be a prerequisite for
subproject approval, except in the case of TPA's. Because of demonstrated problems in



- 101 -
Annex 13
Page 3 of 4
implementing environmental mitigation and monitoring for subprojects in EJBUDP (e. g. see
section on solid waste management below), BAPPEDA will submit copies of subproject designs,
operating plans and UKL/UPL to the Bank (RSI) for all 1 st year subprojects requiring
environmental review, and will not approve these subprojects until the Bank has given its
concurrence. During the first year of implementation, RSI staff or consultants will review
UKL/UPL for all sectors but will phase out this practice as soon as the quality of the UKL/UPL
work in each sector is found to be satisfactory. It would be made clear by SK from the
Governor's office, as has been done in Bali Province, that no subprojects are to be implemented
until the required UKL/UPL (or in a few cases RKL/RPL) have been approved by BAPPEDA.
9.    Arrangements for UKL/UPL implementation depend heavily on training of PIMPROs (see
section on training below), incorporation of management and monitoring measures as fully as
possible into tender documents and construction contracts, and required reporting from Dati II to
Dati I. Final engineering design consultants and BAPPEDA-I and II will ensure that the
documents include these items as general conditions of contract or sub-project specific
requirements, as appropriate. Standard operating procedures being developed by BAPPEDA-I
for this project will specify Dati-IH reporting requirements for UKL/UPL implementation so that it
is explicitly addressed by all PIMPROs, overseen by the Provincial Government, and included in
quarterly progress reports.
Training in Environmental Management
10.   Training is necessary to overcome the weaknesses in institutional capacity evidenced by
the review of UKL/UPL for this project and the experience with implementation of environmental
management and monitoring recommendations in EJBUDP. Three stages of training will be
completed before any subprojects are approved for implementation:
11.   Dati I personnel will require training in UKL/UPL regulations and preparation procedures,
as well as in the environmental issues relevant for infrastructure projects, so that they can provide
an expeditious and informed review of UKL/UPL documents and advise Dati II personnel as
needed. Two days of training will be needed.
12.   Dati II personnel need training in relevant environmental issues, environmental regulation,
UKL/UPL preparation, incorporation of environmental management and monitoring requirements
in tender documents and contracts, and methods for supervising UKL/UPL implementation. This
training will be conducted in the kabupaten or kotamadya offices so that all involved staff can be
trained. Two days of training will be needed at each Dati II. The training will include presentation
of actual case studies for each type of infrastructure project in the context of East Java.
13.   Dati I and II personnel will participate in a one-day workshop after the above training is
completed, to review the training, share views on how UKL/UPL can best be prepared and
implemented, and agree on working arrangements for preparation, review, implementation,
monitoring and reporting.
14.   The training program will be developed by Indonesian consultants qualified in UKL/UPL
and AMDAL procedures, in consultation with Dati I staff from BAPPEDA Seksi LH and BLH to

Annex 13
Page 4 of 4
ensure that the program meets the real training needs. The UPL and BAPPEDA training
materials already used in East Java will serve as the starting point for program development, as
these have proven to be effective. Assuming 20 staff days for program development, and a
training team of two consultants for all three stages, the level of effort to prepare and conduct the
training is 170 staff days. Assuming consulting fees of US$250/day plus US$60 per diem plus
travel costs, the estimated cost of the program will be US$60,000. These costs are eligible to be
financed under the urgent priority technical assistance component of the Surabaya Urban
Development Project (Ln. 3726-IND).
Solid Waste Management
15.   At the time of appraisal, Kotamadya Malang-had not been able to rectify the operations at
its Supit Urang TPA due to equipment failures. The Project Preparation Report (PPR) for
Malang includes a subproject to obtain new equipment, design and develop new sanitary landfill
cells at the site, clean up the improperly disposed solid waste in the present cell, widen the access
road, and formulate an operating procedure. The possible social impacts of access road widening
must be addressed further during Project Memorandum preparation.
16.   Kabupaten Malang has identified three potential TPA projects: expansion and provision
of leachate treatment at the controlled landfill that serves Batu and development of new TPAs at
Lawang (5 ha) and Kecamatan Kepanjen (2 ha). These sites have yet to be screened in order to
determine what environmental studies may be needed in addition to UKL/UPL. Preparations for
EJUDP3 will include a comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan prepared jointly by
Kabupaten and Kotamadya Malang to determine whether the proposed number, locations and
capacities of TPAs are sensible.

B. ECONOMIC APPRAISAL CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGY
Water Supply
1.   In principle, net present value (NPV) and economic rate of return (ERR) have to be
estimated for each water supply subproject. In order to cope with the large number of
(relatively small) subprojects and to take into account the limited appraisal capability of
provincial govermments, Bank staff proposed the application of a simplified methodology.
2.    Economic benefits of water supply projects are equal to the consumers' willingness to
pay for water plus external health benefits, i.e. prevention of infections caused by others
(outside of someone's won household). The external health benefits, since they are intangible,
formally don't enter the economic analysis. If substantiated, however, can be used to justify
projects with a negative NPV or an ERR below the cut-off rate of 12 percent (this procedure
can be applied in very special cases only, as an exception). In large cities with weli
functioning water supply systems there are usually enough information to obtain a reasonably
good estimate of the consumers' demand function. The water demand function, in turn, can
be used to estimate willingness to pay.
3.    Lack of data and expertise and the proliferation of intermittent water supply systems
generally made the application of this "traditional" method impossible in East Java and Bali.
The proposed simplified methodology divides piped water consumption into two parts: the
first part replaces the previous source (e.g. wells, rivers, vendors) of water use, while the
second part is a net increase in water consumption. Benefit of the first part is equal to the
cost savings (actual payments plus own labor) of consumers who on no more need to use
other sources of water supply (this is the so-called alternative cost valuation method).
Benefits of the second part, i.e., of incremental water use, is still has to be estimated using the
concept of willingness to pay and that way depends on how accurately the demand function
was estimated. However, the share of total benefits due to incremental water use is usually
small and the informnation collected in order to estimate the benefit of the first part can be used
to estimate one point on the demand curve. The full demand function is estimated by
providing the coordinates of a fictitious low price - high quantity point on the demand curve
and assuming a linear relationship between price and water demand (the method is not very
sensitive to the assumption regarding the shape of the water demand curve and to small
perturbations in the coordinates of the low price - high quantity point).

ANNEX 16(b)
Page 2 of 3
4.    Two simple, user friendly programs were developed along these lines to assist the
project preparation teams and the provincial appraisal teams with economic analysis. The
programs compare subproject costs and benefits and calculate NPV and ERR estimates (the
programs use a discount rate of 10 percent for NPV calculation). A more detailed description
of the programs (one for small projects and one for large ones) with the mathematical
formulas can be found in the project files.
5.    A further simplification in the proposed methodology is given by the possibility of
estimating a lower bound for the ERR. There are two ways to arrive at such an estimate.
One is the so-called cross-city comparison method. If (i) the average incremental cost (AIC)
of a subproject in city A is less then or equal to the AIC of a subproject in city B (or,
altematively, the water tariff of a functioning system in city B); (ii) the water
demand/consumption surveys indicate that the sources and quantity of non-piped (altemative)
water use of those households who don't have access to piped water are similar in the two
towns; (iii) household incomes are also similar and (iv) the planned average water
consumption per household incomes are also similar the same as the planned (or existing)
water consumption in city B, then the ERR of subproject A is at least as high as subproject B
(or at least 10 percent if system B already exists).
6.    The other method relies on the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) to obtain a
lower bound estimate for the ERR. In case of a proposed expansion/rehabilitation of an
already existing system, if (i) there is no real water price increase forecasted; (ii) changes in
water consumption are fully explained by projected changes in the (real) income and
composition of connected customers, then the FIRR can be used as a proxy for the lower
bound of ERR.
Drainage
7.    The overwhelming majority of drainage subprojects are very small, i.e. cost less than
Rp 500 million (about $0.2 million). Case by case economic analysis (i.e. calculation of ERR
and NPV) is required only for the larger ones which typically cost Rp 500 - 2000 million. The
benefits of these drainage subprojects are estimated either (i) on the basis of avoided flood
damage or (ii) land value increases and road maintenance cost reductions. Since estimation of
the cost of flood damages require teams usually prefer the second, less time consuming
approach. The advantage of this approach is obvious: land value increase, if land markets
function properly, is an indicator which can reflect the present value of the future benefit
stream accruing to the owners of the land in the project area. The projected increases in land
values are based on comparison of land values in the project area to land values in similar, but
less frequently flooded neighborhoods. Information on land values for the subprojects was

ANNEX 16(b)
Page 3 of 3
collected during interviews with kelurahan (sub-district) staff handling land transactions and
with informal real estate brokers. Reductions in road maintenance costs were estimated on
the basis of local experience.
Urban Roads
8.    The Urban Road Directorate of the Ministry of Public Works issued an "Urban Road
Planning and Programming Manual" to guide the preparation of all IUMDP projects.
Preparation of the manual was partly financed from the technical assistance components of the
Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Loan No. 281 7-IND) and the Urban Sector Loan
(Loan No. 2816-IND). Economic analysis of all road subprojects are based on the application
of this manual. Using information obtained from site specific traffic and road condition
surveys, the manual is easy to use for estimating the benefits of urban road rehabilitation,
betterment, widening and new urban road projects. Two kinds of benefits are estimated:
vehicle operation cost savings and time benefits, which, if compared to the costs, make it
possible to calculate ERR or NPV of the subprojects. Further simplification is allowed for
subprojects with a cost below Rp 2 billion (about $0.9 million). For each class of road and
type of road improvement, the manual also calculates the minimum traffic level which makes
the improvement economically viable (detailed description of the methodology and
assumptions used in the manual is available in the project files). A proposed road
improvement is considered acceptable if the average daily traffic on the road is higher than the
cut-off level determined that way.
Other Subsectors
9.    A high portion the benefits of human and solid waste management and market
infrastructure improvement subprojects are intangible and accrue to the local community as a
whole and not only to the direct recipients of these services. Therefore, there is no
requirement to carry out a formal comparison of costs and benefits, however, for subprojects
with a cost of more than Rp 500 million, it should be demonstrated that the proposal is the
least cost solution which achieves the desired environmental impact. Kampung improvement
subprojects deliver a standard package of infrastructure services which was proven to be
economically viable in several Bank financed projects before. Since the economic analysis of
that kind of investment is very costly and the concentration of expenditure is low, the
economic viability of proposed kampung improvements, as long as they follow the agreed
