PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 1068-TUN)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report of the Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project, for which a Loan 1068-TUN to the Republic of Tunisia was approved an
December 19, 1974 in the sum of US$12.2 million. The Loan was closed on June
30, 1983, and the unused balance of US$560,611 was cancelled as from that date.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the Bank staff based
on the Appraisal Report, Loan Documents, supervision reports, other relevant
documents contained in the Bank files and a Completion Report prepared by
OMIVAN (March 1983) and on several working papers specially prepared by
OMVVM. In June 1983, a Bank mission to the field discussed the major issues
of the project with the executing agencies and collected additional data.
The PCR was submitted to OED on February 22, 1984. The Project was
not selected for audit by OED and the PCR was sent to the Borrower on June 21,
1984 for comments. Comments received from OMVVM are attached as Annex.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 1068-TUN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The project was the Bank's first irrigation project in Tunisia.  It
was aimed essentially at the rehabilitation of the existing irrigation
infrastructure in the Medjerda and Nebhana areas. Its objectives are in line
with those of the 1973-76 National Development Plan, and were as a whole
successfully met:
(a) use the existing irrigation infrastructure more fully and efficiently;
(b) raise incomes of small farmers by intensifying and diversifying the
cropping patterns;
(c) increase farmers' security of land tenure and access to adequate
agricultural credit;
(d) provide needed public services together with assistance to project
authorities; and
(e) improve housing conditions for farmers within the lowest income
bracket in the Medjerda.
2.       For the Medjerda subproject, the rehabilitation works and part of the
program to construct farm houtses program was carried out directly by OMVVM in
a satisfactory manner which demonstrated its capability to execute further new
development and maintenance works. Of the on-farm components using credit
channelled through the National Bank of Tunisia (BNT), only the purchase of
dairy cattle was fully successful. BNT's lengthy administrative procedures,
its requirements, and the levels of down payment led the other lines of
investment (stables, tree plantations) to fall short of appraisal targets
(para. 3.03). The strengthening of the Office for the Development of the
Lower Medjerda Valley (OMVVM) extension services was physically completed, but
their impact on the use of irrigation water was low. However, increased
assurances of water availability and better water management led farmers to
take bigger financial risks and to produce higher-value crops. Yields have
generally improved and the shift to higher-value crops has been faster than
anticipated at appraisal (para. 4.05).
3.       For the Nebhana subproject, rehabilitation works for irrigation,
drainage and the road network was satisfactorily carried out by the Office for
the Development of Nebhana (OMIVAN) and appraisal targets were often
exceeded. The credit component was again less successful (storage basins,
land levelling) for the same reasons as for the Medjerda subproject.
Construction and equipment of the service cooperative storage facilities



- iv -
was 40 completed and the construction of the grading, processing and
marketing station was postponed several times by lack of management capacity
of the Central Cooperative of Nebhana (CCN) and eventually had to be
cancelled.  The extension service set up under the project was a success in
encouraging farmers to adopt improved cultural practices. However, the impact
was less than it could have been because of the insufficient supply of
irrigation water. This issue is being addressed by the follow-up project
(Loan 2157-TUN), which improves the harnessing, the distribution and the
management of the available water resources.
4.       The economic reevaluation shows an economic rate of return (32%)
higher than estimated at appraisal (28X). This is mainly due to higher value
of production, better use of the already existing land and infrastructure
which resulted from higher security in water supply (para. 5.06).
5.       Other points which may be of special interest are:
-    programming, monitoring and evaluation were inadequate (para. 4.15);
-    extension staff made significant achievements in promoting improved
farming techniques, especially for the production of selected
vegetables (para. 4.15); and
-    farm income is estimated to have increased about 12% at project
completion and is expected to increase further by around 19% at full
development (para. 4.19).
6.       A lesson to be learned is:  when farmers are assured of a reliable
water supply they are likely to use irrigation structures better and be
willing to take bigger risks with higher valued crops (para. 7.04).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 1068-TUN)
I. BACKGROUND
1.01     In 1971 the Government of Tunisia requested Bank assistance in
increasing the returns to investments in public irrigation infrastructure
in the three zones of highest priority for rehabilitation, Medjerda,
Central Tunisia and Nebhana. The present project covers two of these
zones, Medjerda and Nebhana, and it was prepared by the FAO/Bank
Cooperative Program in cooperation with the Tunisian GovernmenIt. On
December 19, 1974, the Bank approved a loan of US$12.2 million which was
the Bank's first irrigation operation in Tunisia.
1.02     The Medjerda and Nebhana projects are the two oldest public
irrigation investments in Tunisia. The French and US Governments
financed feasibility studies for both in the 1950s. Construction of
major works was completed in Medjerda in 1960, and in Nebhana in 1970.
1.03     In Medjerda, the irrigation and drainage methods needed
improvement, and existing facilities were badly maintained; there was a
lack of security of farm titles and considerable fragmentation of
holdings. In Nebhana, the basic layout of the irrigation network was not
adequate and could not satisfy the requirements of the farming systems,
which led to underutilization of the irrigation networks. The Fourth
Development Plan (1972-1976) aimed at increasing agricultural production
and focused on the rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure;
encouragement of investment by the private sector; facilitating the
access to credit by small farmers; and increasing the security of land
tenure. The project objectives closely followed these general goals by
(a) closing the gap between potential and actual use of irrigation
investments; (b) raising incomes of small farmers; (c) increasing tenure
security; (d) increasing the accessibility and volume of credit available
to small farmers; (e) strengthening agricultural development
institutions; and (f) providing needed public services (electricity,
water supply) and improved housing for low-income farmers in Medjerda.
1.04     The project was estimated to cost a total of US$23.8 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$12.2 million (51%). The Medjerda
su-bproject was expected to cost US$17.2 million and the Nebhana
subproject the remaining US$6.6 million. The Bank was to finance the
foreign exchange component and Government the balance.



-2-
1.05     OMVVM and OMIVAN had overall responsibility for project
execution in the two subproject zones. OMVVM utilized the services of
the Tunisian Company for Electricy and Gas (STEG) and the National
Company for the Exploitation and Distribution of Drinkable Water (SONEDE)
to execute power and water supply components. Credit was provided by BNT
through the existing channels.
1.06     Implementation of both subprojects was expected to take seven
years and full agricultural development (1987) was expected to be six
years after irrigation rehabilitation had been finished. The Completion
Date was scheduled for December 31, 1981 and Closing Date June 30, 1982.
The Closing Date was extended by six months to December 31, 1982 (our
telex of April 12, 1982) and expenditures committed before that date were
honored until July 28, 1983 when the loan account was closed. The
extension given was requested by the Government to permit the compleFion
of irrigation and drainage related structures which had been delayed due
to unfavorable climatic conditions and the use of the balance of the
credit component.
II. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Chronology
2.01     The project was appraised in November/December 1973 on the basis
of the preparation report mentioned in para. 1.01.
2.02     After appraisal, major issues were raised relating to (a) land
tenure and agrarian reform, (b) agricultural ciedit, (c) organization and
manpower, and (d) availability of water. The existing legislation on
land reform was satisfactory, but it was not enforced. The lack of clear
definition of land ownership and Droperty boundaries discouraged
exploitation and access to credit was difficult. Proper water management
and proper distribution bv adequate networks was not possible.
2.03     The agricultural credit issue was related (a) to "proof of
ownership" as a condition to be awarded credit (a matter to be resolved
in the context of Agrarian Reform), and (b) to conditions for medium- and
long-term credit on which no coTIsensus had been obtained at that time.
The two executing agencies, OMVVM and OMIVAN, at that time needed a
better deEinition of their internal organization and of their relations
with other departments of the Ministry of Agriculture.  The availability
of water was an issue in Nebhana where competition with tourist and
industrial activities could endanger the satisfaction of the irrigation
needs.
2.04     Negotiations were held on November 4-13, 1974, and agreement was
reached on the above issues. The basis of understanding reached for
agricultural credit is particularly worth mentioning, since it was a
constant problem during project implementation. It was agreed that the
Government would review agricultural credit policies on the basis of
which an agreement with BNT (under conditions acceptable to the Bank)
would be entered into before February 1, 1976 for providing credit to



-3-
farmers under the project. Without this the Bank would not disburse
funds of the credit component of the project. Board presentation took
place on December 19, 1974, the Loan Agreement was signed on December 31,
1974 and became effective on September 18, 1975, 4.5 months after the
initially foreseen date. The delay was because of difficulties
experienced in recruiting a senior advisor for OMIVAN.
Targets and Goals
2.05     The project was to greatly reduce the disparity in income and
4        standards of living between smal]l farmers on one hand, and large farmers
in Mcdjerda and the urban population, on the other. It was planned that
as a result of thc project, about 1,800 farmers in Medjerda would have a
net incone rise of 142% and about 2,000 farmers in Nebhana would have an
increase in net farimi incomte of 153% compared with the situation without
the project. The demand for hired labor was expected to double at full
developmtnt, while self-employment at farm families was projected to
increase by ahbouL 36% in Mccdjerda and 53% in Nebihana. Additional
full-timle ciiployinirt for abouLt 3,000 persons was expected to result from
Lhe project.  Agricultuiral prodtiction would be increased through

2.07     The main elements were:
(a) repairs to the hydro-mechanical equipment of the main pipeline
serving the whole area of 5,000 ha;
(b) rehabilitation of 50 km of farm roads, provision of 800 water
meters, installation of water distribution PVC pipes,
construjction of 98 km of drains and establishment of
windbreaks.  These works to be executed on about 2,000 ha where
land reform consolidation was expected to be completed;
(c)  provision of equipment for operation and maintenance of the
irrigation system;
(d) on-farm development and short-term seasonal credit to be
finaniced through credit provided by BNT;

of a Lruit and vegetable grading and packing station at Sahline
and provisiun of vehicles for these facilities (to be financed
through BNT credit);
(C)  strunglli:ning of OMIVAN through provision of specialists and

credit component, *t was decided on February 26, 1982 that the balance of
the funds allocated for credit could be used to finance the execution of
works anid purchase of equipment for other parts of thie Projec'.

Project Agreement; (b) the same for the OMIVAN Project Agreenment; and (c)
tthe recrui tLmr:nt by OMIVAN of a senior advisor to assist its director to
coordillteL tle project activities.  OMIVAN was neither able to fulfill
the thircd requliremlent in time for the initial target date mentioned nor
for the two exLensionis (July 1, 1975, and September 1, 1975). The Loan

Procurement
3.06     Civil works for the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage
networks, and of roads, construction of buildings and of facilities for rural
electrification and domestic water supply (D 3.0 million) were tendered based
on local competitive bidding (LCB) (D 0.6 million), or carried out by force
account by OMVVM and OMIVAN (D 2.4 million). Except for special hydraulic
equipment required to rehabilitate the Medjerda irrigation system which was
ordered from NEYPPIC (France), the only manufacturer of this equipment, all
other equipment and vehicles were tendered subject to international
competitive bidding (ICB) (D 1.6 million). Contracts for livestock were
awarded after receiving at least three quotations from suppliers. Proposals
were requested from suitable consulting firms and/or individuals to carry out
engineering studies and to provide technical assistance in the field of
extension, management, cooperatives and marketing.
Costs
3.07     The appraisal report estimated the project cost at US$23.83 million,
equivalent to D 10,359 million, the exchange rate being D 0.44 to US$1. This
cost included local taxes and contingencies. Physical contingencies were 157,
for civil works, 10  for studies and technical assistance, and 5X for
equipment. Price contingencies assumed at appraisal are shown in the
following table which also contains the actual figures:

3.08     The above-mentioned statistics indicate that:
(a)  actual inflation rates for the foreign exchange components were much
higher than estimated in the SAR during the first part of the
implementation period, but dropped dramatically in 1981/82 and are
expected to level toward the original estimate in the coming years;
(b)  as for local coefficients of inflation the table also shows a
generalized tendency for rates higher than estimated at appraisal;
(c)  in terms of total project cost, this inflationary trend did not have
an important impact due to the nature of the project -- several small
rehabilitation actions -- not rigid in its size and scope; and
(d)  by subproject, whereas the Medjerda subproject shows a cost increase
(D 695,000) particularly in the OMVVM component, the Nebhana
subproject shows a decrease (D 939,000) in particular due to the
reduction in the credit component. The Medjerda increase is partly
because of the allocation of additional funds to OMVVM which could
not be used for credit before the Closing Date (para. 2.11). The
Nebhana decrease results mainly from the failure of cooperatives to
use the available credit funds and to the fact that the Sahline
station was not constructed.
Disbursements
3.09     The loan was to be disbursed over seven years to cover the full
foreign exchange costs and finance according to the following categories:
I:     39% of total expenditures for the construction of civil works;
II:     100% of foreign expenditures or 77% of total expenditures for
the purchase of equipment, vehicles and livestock;
III:     100% of foreign expenditures for services of consultants,
payment of studies and fellowships;
IV:     38% of total expenditures of medium- and long-term and seasonal
credit.

disbursements.  In global terms and by category, final disbursements are as

3.11     Until the end of 1976 disbursements were not far from the estimates.
However, in 1976/77 the pace of implementation did not follow the appraisal
schedule. Delays in starting construction of works and in launching the
credit component (para. 4.28) led to a short-fall of around US$3.0 million
which was almost constant from then on, until 1982. However, the actual pace
of disbursement is not far from the estimates as it is clearly indicated by
Chart II.  This shows that the schedule of execution was satisfactory after
acquiring the necessary momentum. Disbursement procedure No. I
(reimbursemenit) was extensively used. Government contributions to project
costs were allocated to OMV'VM and OMIVAN through the respect!ve annual budgets
and to BNT for credit purposes. The following table compares appraisal
estimaLe with actual Government financial participation.

IV. PROJECT IMPACT
4.0L     The way in wbich the project has been instrumental in attaining the
objectives set forth in para. 1.03 is examined by subproject. Tables 3 and 4
compare appraisal estimates with actual achievements. Details are contained
in the following paragraphs.

4.02     LandUse.  Mainly because of factors unrelated to the project,
irrigated crops increased rapidly before and during the early years of project
implementation. The area under vegetables had increased from 1,390 ha in 1972
to 3,3z45 ha in 1975 (project year l) covering between 80 and 90% of the
irrigated area. After a peak in 1978, the area of vegetables under open-field
cor-ditions decreased as a result of water shortages caused by drought, and
leveled off at about 2,000 ha in 1982.



- 14 -
4.03     Restrictions imposed on water use in late summer (July 1-September
30), agricultural extension efforts and improved market incentives caused a
shift away from summer vegetables to higher valued winter- and spring-grown
vegetables. Furthermore, some 670 ha of irrigation extensions built without
authorization were no longer allowed to receive water from the network. As a
result, the total area under vegetables decreased by 30%.

4.04     Another unforeseen factor was the rapid expansion of covered
vegetable production. As a result of a highly effective collaboration between
research and extension supported by Belgian bilateral assistance, good
internal marketing prospects, readily available credit in kind, slow but
successful land consolidation, improved irrigation distribution, and favorable
attractive profit levels, covered vegetable production increased from 2 ha in
1976 to 383 ha in 1982.

4.05     Agricultural Production.  Compared with updated pre-project
estimates, vegetable production increased by 12,500 tons, or about 26%.
However, total quantity produced in year 8 is slightly less than the
without-project estimate. More significantly the net value increased by 44%
over the without-project estimate due to the significant change from
within-season to high-priced out-of-season and covered vegetables.  Of the
individual crops, out-of-season potatoes, tomatoes and peppers expanded most
in area and value. In year 8, fruit crop production had increased by 2,000
tons or 25%, over the estimated without-project, while it is expected to
increase by a further 3,800 tons or 44% at full production in year 15.
4.06     Extension.  An effective extension unit was established in OMIVAN
with assistance from a bilateral Belgian aid team (1974-1981). While
initially the structure consisted of field extension agents supported by
subject matter specialists at the central level, the latter were reassigned to
field posts when OMIVAN's responsibility was extended to cover areas served by
shallow wells. As from 1981, the extension program is initiated and executed
by the regional services with a coordination role at the central level. Upon
completion of the bilateral project, budgetary support for extension work was
reduced.

4.07     Field demonstrations, farmer meetings and the use of audiovisual
means were used to promote improved cultural practices in open and protected
vegetable production. In particular, farmers were responsive to the
introduction of methods to economize water use in uncovered vegetable products
grown outside the greenhouses. However, demonstrations of drip irrigation in
greenhouses have not yet resulted in a wide adoption of this practice. The
various factors which play a role in this respect are the relatively low cost
of water, restricted credit availability to farmers who have not yet received
land titles, and the prevailing water distribution system whereby irrigation
is not constantly available. No new demonstrations on fruit crops were
established after 1977, because of the change in emphasis away from fruit
trees.
4.08     Land Reform.  Land consolidation and the establishment of upper and
lower limits to the holdings of the 3,800 farmers in the project area was to
be carried out on 1,975 ha of the project and 2,710 ha of the expansion area.
The sectors of Akouda, Moknine and Teboulba were excluded from the public
irrigation done in 1979 because of urbanization. At project completion, lard
consolidation had been executed on 86% of the area, and 61% had actually been
redistributed. Progress was slower than had been anticipated, partly because
of the reluctance of farmers to give up land which has been inherited from
their forefathers and partly because of shortage of trained staff for
surveying.
4.09     Farm Income.  In year 8, average farm income for the predominant farm
size of 1 ha irrigated vegetable area is estimated to have increased by 44%
from D 2,073 (US$4,156) without-project to D 2,990 (US$5,980) with the
project. The before-project income is estimated at D 1,509 (US$3,018).



- 17 -
4.10     Marketing.  Although the appraisal objectixes to establish a
processing center and five collection centers were not achieved, the two
cooperative collecting and input distribution centers established with project
assistance stimulated farmers in the areas to increase vegetable output (para.
4.04).
Medje rda
4.11     Water_Use.  The rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage
networks has led to an increase in water use in the lower valley and in
particular in the zone directly affected by the project (about 25% in a normal
year); this in spite of the progressive urban expansion into the project
area. However, that increase in water consumption is still below the SAR
estimates. The normal current use, about 38 million m3, is 40% of the SAR
estimate for maximum optimal use. However, the volutne of water sold by OMVUM
to farmers is not a full measure of the project impact. In fact, the vagaries
of the climate during the last four years with poorly distributed rainfall and
floods and exceptional heat have not favored the full use of the available
water. However, a large step has been made by providing assulrance of water
delivery, decreasing losses and improved water control.  This gave farmers an
incentive to take bigger risks in agricultural practices and to produce crops
of higher value.
4.12     Land Use.  Total cropped area increased by 11% from about 18,000 ha
before project to 20,000 ha at project completion. Of this, productive
orchards, vegetables, forage and cereals covered 24%, 35%, 27%, and 14%,
respectively. The largest increase (35%) took place in the area under fruit
crops, followed by forage crops (25%), <nd vegetables (6%). Cereals, mainly
rainfed, decreased by 17%. Changes within the ranige of vegetables reflected
mainly market trends; the most significanit change being a decrease in
cultivation of artichokes and an increase in potato productioni. A modest
start was made in off-season protected vegetable production (9 ha in 1982),
but for this purpose East and North East coastal areas (Nebliana, Cap Bon) have
a climatic advantage.  The area under irrigation is estimiated to have
increased by about 2,100 ha from 59% of the cropped area in 1975 to 63% in
1982, or from 53% to 64% of the physical area. During drought years,
meanwhile, more of the normally rainfed crops receive supplemental irrigation.

4.13     Production.  At project completion, production with project increased
by 7% for meat and milk, 35% for fruit, and 50S f or vegetables, respectively,
as compared with without-project estimates (Table 5). Net value of production
increased by 33.5% with the project and is expected to increase by 70% of the
without-project estimate at full production (year 16). The additional
increase after year 8 is due to the maturing of orchards planted under the
project.
4.14     Extension and Agricultural Services.  For part of the project area,
from 1973-1979, OMVVM received the assistance of a bilateral team from Belgium
to strengthen extension services.  At project completion, 39 extension agents
were assigned to the four subdivisions covering the project area supported by
15 subject matter specialists who cover OMVVM's total area of responsibility.
The density of extension workers (1 per 50 farmers) has not yet reached the
appraisal's objective of (I per 40 farmers but is approaching the level
recommended under the second project (Loan 2157-TUN), i.e., I per 47 farmers.

4.15     Extension staff have to carry out a variety of duties, including
evaluating credit applications and supervising input distribution.
Significant achievements were obtained in promoting several improved
techniques, especially for the production of selected vegetables. However,
although a considerable effort is made to demonstrate improved farming
techniques, these are frequently limited to techniques and insufficiently
integrated in the farming system as a whole. Moreover, programming,
monitoring and evaluation are inadequate. Improvements were proposed under
the second project (Loan 2157-TUN), with emphasis on improving irrigation
techniques -
4.16     Extension staff participated in a variety of training activities.  At
appraisal, recruitment of two extension specialists was envisaged. No
expatriate staff was recruited, but OMVVM did appoint two qualified
agronomists as chief of its two agricultural departments. While the Belgian
technical assistance was effective in the sectors covered by their project,
extension work in animal husbandry could have been strengthened in the project
area through recruitment of a specialist.
4.L7     Marketing and input distribution facilities proved to be inadequate
and were to be improved under the second project. Early during project
execution, the Bank agreed to the use of Loan proceeds for the purchase of 33
tractors and farm mact:inery to strengthen OMVVM's six machinery renting
stations and thereby complementing machinery provided under Kuwait Furd
financing for the sector of the Lower Medjerda Valley rehabilitated also
through Kuwait Fund financing. These farm machinery stations are to be
further strengthened under the second project.
4.L8     A significant complementary activity was the applied research on
vegetable production carried out with Belgian bilateral assistance through the
"Station d'Appui de Manouba" (SAM)).  SAM's activities were largely
concentrated on tomatoes, artichokes and peppers. The rapid increase in
yields and production of tomatoes and peppers in the project area can be
largely attributed to concentrated efforts of research, extension and their
interaction with the farmers. Provision of healthy plant material, an
essential prerequisite for high yields, was also promoted by OMVVM.

farm size or about 50% of all farmers), farm income is estimated to have
increased from D 3,085 to D 3,659 at project completion, and is expected to
increase further to D 4,852 at full development.
4.20     Land Reform.  The application of land reform legislation in this
sub-project has two basic aims:
(a)    to increase the proportion of land under irrigation in the
command area: and
(b)    to implement cost recovery.
4.21     Before project implementation, one reason for the low irrigation
water use was that larger farms within the irrigation command area would
irrigate only a small part of their land, which for the most part would be
cropped under rainfed conditions. Moreover, there was some degree of
absenteeism due to land being held merely as a hedge against inflation, while
about 15% of the command area was in need of land consolidation to permit
rational irrigation to be carried out. Existing legislation on limitation of
land ownership, land consolidation, and the legal obligation to irrigate at
least two-thirds of the equipped irrigable land, was to be enforced under the
project.
4.22     Existing legislation provides for cost recovery from all farmers
having over 2 ha who benefit from public irrigation investments through cash
contributions or contributions in the form of land. Before project
implementation, no contribution had been collected.  Water charges to cover
operation and maintenance are payable in advance. Under the project, the
Government made commitments to collect the investment contributions, and to
adjust water charges periodically.
4.23     According to Annex A of the relevant supplemental letter to the Loan
Agreement, land reform action was to be completed in 1977 for the settlers and
unequipped private land, and in 1979 for the private farmeis on equipped land.
4.24     Under the project, final title documents have been issued to 52% of
the settlers, covering a total of 4,400 ha or 58% of the settlers' land. Work
was completed in 1I of the 17 irrigation sectors.  In two of the remaining
sectors, parcel demarcation and cadast-iaL mapping have not been completed.
Land consolidation was carried out f-,r about 10,000 ha oE the 14,000 ha of
privately-owned land, while on some 1,500 ha, where individual holdings
exceeded 50 ha, the excess was either sold or eliminated by formal subdivision
amonig co-o-ners.  However, on about 600 ha, the average farm size remained
between 50 and 60 ha, even after ownership had been divided.
4.25     The ministerial order to enforce cost recovery payments was issued in
1977. Installment payments for land issued to settlers were started in 1978.
Since then, some 53,000 dinars were collected, or 122 of fees due, by 201
farmers who received written contribution orders, out of a total of 1,200
settler farms in the equipped part of the project area.

4.26     While collection of water charges by OMVVM personnel has not caused
serious problems, collection of the land improvement fee has beer resisced by
private farmers.  OMV!M would prefer that the collection be entrusred to the
Ministry of Finance instead of OMVVM, in order not to affect its relations
with the farmers. As regards the fine of D 5/ha for non-compliance with the
requirement to irrigate two-thirds of the equipped farm area, until recently,
no penalties were collected. The Government attempted mainly to convince
farmers through persuasion.
Credit to Farmers
4.27     The Loan included Drovision for on-lending the equivalent of US$2.12
million to BNT in addition to an expected amount of US$3.52 million equivalent
to be provided by the Government to BNT for medium-, long-term and seasonal
credit in the Medjerda and Nebhana sections of the project area.  Including
contingencies, the total amount initially estimated for credit for on-farm
development to be provided through BNT was US$6.06 million equivalent, of
which about 50% was to be for short-term credit. In addition, the Loan
included financing of 900 selected heifers through OMVVM at an estimated cost
of US$l.531 million equivalent (including price contingencies), of which 77%,
or US$l.179 million equivalent, would be provided from the Loan.
4.28     Terms and conditions for on-lending to BNT for the project and for
sub-loans to farmers were to be included in subsidiary agreement between the
Government and BNT, based on a study on agricultural credit policy which was
to be presented to the Council of Ministers by October 31, 1975 (supplemental
letter to the Loan Agreement dated December 31, 1974) and to be made available
to the Bank by December i, 1975 (Loan Ag7eement, Section 3.04). Loan proceeds
for the purchase of heifers were part of the Government's grant to OMVVM in
accordance with Section 301(c)(iii) of the Loan Agreement, and therefore
would not be required to be repaid by O'W1VM.  Following submission to the Bank
of an unofficial draft of the study in November 1975 and repeated contacts by
Bank staff with the Government on this issue, the latter signed subsidiary
agreement with BNT on November 18, 1976, which included the on-lending terms
to farmers and marketing cooperatives in the project area and specifies BNT's
commission and risk assumption.  BNT was to charge the Government a commission
of 3% per annum on the credit part, but no commission would be paid on the
subsidy component of the sub-loans to farmers. BNT would assume 10% of
default risk during the first two years, and 25% in subsequent years.
Following the establishment of this agreement and prior to effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement for the Second Credit Project (Loan 2157-TUN), the
Government gradually adjusted credit conditions of the Special Agriculture
Development Fund (FOSDA) through a series of decrees to approach more closely
the terms and conditions of tne Irrigation Rehabilitation Project and the
Second Agricultural Credit Project, which became effective on July 31, 1977.
4.29     The major difference between the terms for credit under the project
and available lines of credit outside the project concerns short-term credit.
Both OMvVM and OMIVAN had been distributing credit in kind, without interest,
handling charges and initially required only a 10% down payment. Annual
allocations 'or short-term credit were made by the Treasury since 1971.
Credit recovery increased from 10% in the OMVVM area in the first year to over



- 23 -
60% in later years, and by 1981 had reached 72% for the period 1971-81.
Defaults are submitted to court for legal action after three years. However,
the proposed change from payment in kind to credit for purchase of cash inputs
-and from the development agencies to BNT, was considered potentially detrimental
to the use of adequate levels of inputs by farmers. The development agencies,
moreover, consider credit in kind a useful means for entering into a dialogue
and providing technical advice to farmers. Therefore, BNT subsequently (October
1977) agreed that 30% of the sub-loans for short-term credit would be provided
by the development agencies in kind, and 7C% by BNT in cash. As regards medium-
and long-term loans, a major difference between the condition of FOSDA and BNT
were the more stringent collateral requi_emients of BNT, even though they were
not specified in the subsidiary agreemeat. Part of the difference was resolved
by BNT's willingness to accept the land possession certificate instead of the
official land title as satisfying requirements for borrowing eligibility.
Medjerda Sub-project
4.30     As a result of the institutional problems, project lending through BNT
was far below appraisal estimates in 1975-77. In 1977, BNT lending for orchard
establishment started in the OMVVM area, followed in 1978 and 1979 by sub-loans
for farm houses, stables and short-term sub-loans for inputs. Credit
disbursements in the sub-project area are given in Table 5.

Disbursements for heifers by OMVVM exceeded appraisal estimates considerably.
A total of 2,070 heifers was procured, more than double the number estimated
at appraisal. Demand for heifers showed peaks after the two milk producer
price increases in 1977 and 1982. Channeling of funds through OMVVM greatly
facilitated lending operations for livestock development.
Nebhana Sub-project
4.31     Credit allocations for the Nebhana sub-project included financing for
orchard establishment, sprinkler equipment, silting and storage basins,
equipment for and construction of marketing facilities, and short-term credit
for inputs.
4.32     The Government subsequently decided, and the Bank agreed, to
eliminate the credit components for orchards and for sprinkler equipment.
These funds were allocated to other credit components and not cancelled from
the Loan.
4.33     As regards short-term credit, the OMIVAN project management did not
consider it useful to have this BNT credit at 6% interest with 30% of costs
being financed by the sub-borrowers in addition to, or instead of, the credit
in kind made available by the Government through OMIVAN. In a letter of July
iS, 1977, to the Ministry of Planning, the project management proposed a
reallocation of short-term credit to the storage basins, collecting units and.
precessing center.
4.34     The project envisaged the construction and equipping of five
marketing support centers by regional cooperatives financed by medium-term
credit channeled through BNT. Only two cooperatives made use of this credit
and were able to establish the planned facilities. A major obstacle to the
execution of this component is the weak Einancial and organizational basis of
the coonera' ives- The subsidiary agreement with BNT requires 20%
self-financing, which, for most of these newly created cooperatives, was too
large a proportion. ONIVAN decided to provide a loan to the cooperatives for
this purpose from its own funds.  In several instances, staff of the
cooperatives was hesitant to commit the cooperative to a relatively large
debt.  Einally, some o[ the cooperatives had difficulty obtaining full title
to the iand necded for the buildings, which was required by BNT before the
sub-loan could be granted.
4-35     Overail credit disbursements amounted to 17% of appraisal estimates,
larg-cy because no disbursements were made for short-term credit, or for
inv-estment in spriniklers and orchards.  Disbursements for storage basins,
,e.anw^hiLe, amounted to 74% of appraisal estimates.  Only two of the planned
fiv.- nimarketing support centers were constructed, and construction of the
processing plant for the central Nebhana cooperative was delayed and
subsequently included in the financing for the second Nebhana project. Credit
disbursements for marketing support to cooperatives therefore amounted to only
31% of appraisal estimates. Credit disbursements for the Nebhana sub-project
are shown in Table 5.

VU ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01     The economic reevaluation of the project is made on the same basis
and following the same criteria of the SAR so that results might be
comparable. Actual data obtained from OMVs' sources have been used both for
costs and benefits and adjusted to 1982 levels which year has been taken as
base for the calculation.
5.02     Medjerda capital costs exclude rural roads, housing, water and
electricity supply and studies, but include those credit components with clear
impact on measured benefits, such as livestock, tree plantations and stables.
Operating costs are incremental and related to part of the Low Medjerda valley
directly affected by the project.
5.03     Nebhana capital costs for those items with an impact beyond the
project area (equipment, strengthening of OMIVAN) were allocated on a prorata
basis, studies were excluded and medium- and long-term credit activities
included at its total cost. Operating costs are those only directly connected
with the project activities. Since benefits resulted also from the bilateral
aid, the costs of Belgian technical assistance were added.
5.03     Benefits.  Pre-project area and production data were updated on the
basis of reports and studies made during project execution. For the Nebhana
sub-project, production estimates for 1982 (year 8) of open vegetables
without-project are based on an estimated increase of 15% in value of
production since the beginning of the project. Greenhouse vegetable
production without-project is estimated at 50% of the with-project level.
Only newly established orchards under the project (388 ha) were included in
calculationi of incremental fruit production in year 15.
5.04     With the exception of fruit crops, incremental without-project
production in the Medjerda sub-project is estimated to have reached a maximum
of 20% in year 8. Without-project fruit crop production is estimated to have
had a further expansion of 15% until full production.
5.05     In the Nebhana sub-project, most farmers were affected by the water
economy measures imposed in 1978, causing a decrease in culti-vation of
in-season vegetables. In the Medjerda area both settler and other farmers
responded to OLMVV!Vs dairy cattle distribution program, and responded to
market conditions favorable for orchard expansion.  Farm incomes were
therefore estimated on the basis of project-wide production and cost averages,
rather than on the basis of recommended cropping patterns.
5.06     Tables 6 and 7 indicate for each subproject and for the project as a
whole the costs and benefits. The rates of return are 32% for Medjerda, 33%
for Nebhana and 32% for the project. These figures compare to 30%, 24% and
28% estimated at appraisal. The e2conomic rate of return as calculated now is
bigher than that computed in the SAR, despite a lower than anticipated use of
irrigation water, for a number of reasons. First, is the unforeseen parallel
development in Nebhana of a high-value off-season greenhouse vegetable
production market using the project irrigation facilities. This has been to a



- 26 -
large extent due to the more than expected growth of tourism in the area,
which has provided an excellent and ready market to this high-quality,
high-value (and high-cast) product. While all the relevant costs of this
activity have been included as input costs, and certainly the land reform and
the assured water availability due to the project have had a positive effect
on this greenhouse development, the proportion of this activity which should
be attributed as being due to the project remains a matter of uncertainty
because substantial development would certainly have occurred without the
project. For the purpose of this completion report, it has been postulated
that only 50% of these developments are directly due to the project. The
valuation of the vegetable production, especially off-season greenhouse
output, also poses some difficulty since prices are currently some three to
four times higher than appraisal estimates in real terms, and estimates of
long-term trends are most difficult. While the methodology used for this
valuation, consistent with that used in the appraisal of the follow-up project
(Loan 2157--TUN), aims to dampen what is expected to be short-term price
response to a strong market stimulus, the impact on the re-estimated rate of
return is considerable. Secondly, the project benefitted from prior unknown
investments in agricultural research, the results of which were disseminated
in the project area under the parallel extension project supported by Belgian
technical assistance. Finally, the maintenance expenditures in the project,
especially in case of Medjerda, have been below what was considered reasonable
at appraisal. It is difficult to be precise about the extent to which this
low level of initial maintenance is likely to lead to higher expenditures in
later years. In Medjerda an additional factor that has increased the expected
rate of return was the unexpected introduction by farmers of high value cash
crops (fruits, vegetables) in place of lower value field crops.

The first conclusion is that the number of experts and time of service were
much less than initially planned. Difficulties in recruitment, unexpected
bilateral assistance and changes in the approach for dealing with land reform
on a national level are the major reasons for this. The performance of
consultants was satisfactory in general. The major consulting contract (68
man-months), covering the preparation of the Nebhana II Project (Loan
2157-TUN) initially raised minor problems of not responding to the
objectives. At a later stage the consultant submitted complementary work,
which was considered acceptable.
6.02     Contractors for works and _uppliers.  Works were executed by local
firms which are of small size but well fitted to the type of construction
required by the project. Their performance was hampered by poor management
capability, lack of qualified technical staff and insufficient equipment. An
additional problem was the periodic shortage of some construction materials,
in particular cement. However, these adverse aspects did not seriously affect
the project implementation schedule and quality of works.
6.03     In general, with some exceptions like asbestos cement pipes, supplies
are made by local representatives of foreign firms. Although quality is good,
inadequate management usually led to irregular availability of stocks, delays
in delivery, and inefficient after-sale service. The penalty measures
contained in the tend.r documents and the careful choice of the supplier were
not enough to make tp for this problem and pressure from the authorities
(Ministries) was sometimes required.
6.04     Borrower.  After some delays in the initial phase of the Project,
implementation took on momentum and both offices, OMVVM and OMIVAN, improved
their performance substantially. This can partially be justified by the fact
that they were dealing with a Bank project for the first time. Execution of a
large volume of force account works (see para. 3.06) showed the capabilities
of the offices. However, their limited resources in equipment and staff
retarded the pace of execution. Considerable delays occurred in the
rationalization of the terms and conditions under the Project with these
applied credit lines outtside the Project.
6.05     The less successful results of the credit component, only 64%
executed in comparison with the SAR estimate, were mainly due to the legal
constraints which restricted the provision of credit (inter alia arrears,
ownership titles, lack of financial capacity to provide the down payment) and
the low managerial and financial capacity of the cooperatives.
6.06     Bank.  After 165 man-weeks spent prior to Board presentation, the
Bank sent 14 supervisioni missions (2 per year) corresponding to a total of 44
man-weeks. Ten of these missions had the participation of an irrigation
engineer, seven of an agronomist and six of an economist.  Bank missions
always concluded either by leaving in the field an aide-menioire or by sending
to Government an action letter after returning to headquarters. This has
permnitted the Borrower and in particular the execution agencies to identify
the issues and take the necessary measures for their correction or follow up.
However, it is probable that a closer monitoring of the financial aspects of

project implementation, in particular a realistic planning of the use of the-'
credit and of the unallocated Loan funds, could have improved the rate of
disbursement at an earlier stage. Project concept, estimates and targets were
in general adequate. In three areas, however - credit, land reform and water
availability in Nebhana - the Bank was too optimistic in its expectations.
Difficulties encountered (lack of farmers' participation, adverse climatic
conditions) result from aspects hard to control (social, legal, natural) but
the experience acquired was certainly valuable to the design of the follow-up
project now under implementation.
VII.  SPECIAL ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01     The two major issues of the projece are related to (a) credit, and
(b) water availability in Nebhana.
7.02     Credit in Medjerda suffered from BNT's lengthy administrative
procedures and collateral requirements, the level of down payment required
from sub-borrowers and lack of enthusiasm of farmers. In Nebhana it was
mainly because of the lack of credit worthiness of the cooperatives which had
insufficient technical, financial and human resources, in particular in the
case of the proposed Sahline processing plant. This suggests that the Bank
should have been more realistic in estimating project credit requirements and
in evaluating its users.  The channelling of credit through OMVVM for the
purchase of heifers was a physical success but an analysis of repayment rates
is required to determine performance on loan administration. The cost of
OMVVM's intervention required to organize this component is not clear but it
appears to have been a costly credit operation. As a whole the impact of the
improved extension services both in OMVVM and OMIVAN and proper annual
planning of credit needs will certainly lead to a better performance during
the second project. The fact that the cooperatives are no longer involved in
the investment of the Sahline processing plant should also eliminate the
potential problem of their creditworthiness.
7.03     The project did not address thic issue of water resource availability
in Nebhana and before completion it became evident that the potential water
resources could not be fully mobilized because of physical constraints
(seepage losses, difficult pumping systenms, water conveyance capacity). The
ongo'ng project is expected to solve this problem, but water shortages
experienced in recent years could have been reduced if more detailed studies
had been made during preparation of the first project.
7.04     The project also shows th.at the impact of the availability of a
reliable SysLem of water supply goes far b.yond what could have beenl expected
di;rectly from the improvement Df some physical structures.  Farmers use those
structures better and are willing to take bigger risks with higher value
crops. This was in particular the case in the OMVVM area. However, need has
been identified and action taken for necessarv improvements in the efficient
use of available water, by better maniagement and of improved technology.
