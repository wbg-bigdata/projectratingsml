PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
(CREDIT 11.25-IN
PREFACE
1.        On March 31, 1981, IDA approved, at the request of the Government
of India (GOI), a credit (Cr. 1125-IN) of SDR 321.5 million (US$400 million
equivalent) to assist in the financing of the Hazira Fertilizer Froject in
the state of Gujarat. The project, originally sponsored by the Indian
Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO), is owned and operated by
Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd. (KRIBIICO), a cooperative society
established in April 1980. The IDA credit covers approximately 44X of the
project capital costs.
2.        The project was appraised by an IDA ,ission which visited India
in October/November 1979. Re-appraiPal was carried out in November 1980
following delays in the Project's in;-tiation. Board approval was granted
on March 31, 1981. The Development Credit Agreement was signed on October
28, 1981 and became effective on January 21, 1982.
3.        Work on the project started on March 31, 1981.  The plant was
commissioned in November 1985 and commercial operations started in March
1986. After the start of commercial operations, IND staff visited India in
September 1986 for the preparation of the Project Completion Report (PCR)
and had discussions with KRIBHCO, in June 1987 IND staff received comments
on an earlier draft of the report from the GOI, through its Department of
Economic Affairs. This report is based on the draft PCR prepared by
KRIBHCO, the findings of the mission,comments received and the project
files and related documents.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMIPTION EEPOFI
INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER P' ,jCT
(CREDIT 1125-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project forms part of GOI's overall plan to use gas from the
Bombay High and North and South Bassein offshore oil and gas fields. The
project also meets the government's agricultural policy objective of
developing the fertilizer sector to help increase agricultural o'itput
(para 2.03).
2.        Originally, the project was sponsored by IFFCOe  It is now owned
and operated by KRIBHCO. The latter is a cooperative society established
in April 1980 with shareholders including GOI (66%), IFFCO (28%) and
several local cooperative societies (6%) (para 3.05).
3.        The project was designed to produce 2,700 tons per day (tpd) of
ammonia and 4,400 tpd of urea. It consists of two gas-based ammonia units
with a capacity of 1,350 tpd each and four urea units of 1,100 tpd each, as
well as all the necessary auxiliary and off-site facilities, including
three steam generation plants of 275 tons per hour each; two power units of
15 Mr ach; ammonia storage for 20,000 tons; product handling and storage
facilities for 90,000 tons,-workshops, warehousing, gas terminal and water
treatment plants. A total of 1,320 people are currently employed by the
project. This includes 297 executives/officers and 1,023 others (paras
2.04, 3.02, 3.05).
4.        KRIBHCO followed acceptable procurement procedures for
construction, equipment, erection and civil works using international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. There were
delays in the scheduled deliveries of both locally manufactured and
imported equipment, but the 21-month delay in the supply of gas for firing
the reformer offset all the other delays (paras 3.07-3.09).
5.        Total project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$1,276.9
million. At project completion the actual cost was US$836.2 million,
representing a 35% underrun due to (a) generally lower international prices
for capital equipment, (b) exchange rate movements, (c) successful use of
ICB for local procurement, and (d) savings in the financing charges and
higher production during the trial period than originally envisaged (paras
3.10-3.11).
6.        Between November 1986 and August 1986, 439,694 tons of ammonia
and 713,850 tons of urea were produced. The average capacity utilization
during this period was around 65%, a normal situation in the first year of
operation. The highest rate of capacity utilization achieved on a single
day per stream (up to October 31, 1986) was 106% for the ammonia units and
130% for urea. The plant is now performing satisfactorily and should have
no problems achieving a sustained 95% rate of capacity utiLization (para
4e03).



- v -
7.        The financial rate of return (FRR) for the project is now 14.3%
compared to the appraisal estimate of 9.1%. The increase in the FRR is
mainly due to the lower capital costs of tkh project. A 15 reduction in
the present retention price will reduce the FRR to about 11% (para 5,04).
The economic rate of return (ERR) is now estimated at 15.7%, only slightly
lower ttan the appraisal estimate of 16.6%. The average annual foreign
exchange saving from the project is estimated to be about US$220 million in
constant 1986 dollars, 8% higher than the appraisal estimate. In addition,
the project has resulted in substantial technology transfer to India
(para 5.03).
8.        Since the initiation of the project, KRIBHCO has had 5 Managing
Directors. A new Managing Director assumed his duties in November 1986.
At appraisal, the agreement was that IFFCO w.uld handle the marketing
arrangements for KRIBHCO's urea. However, it was later decided, with IDA's
conditional approval, that logistically KRIBHCO would be better placed to
market its own urea. The necessary organizational arrangements have
generally been slow and are still incomplete (paras 3.04 and 4.04).
9.        KRIBHCO succeeded in overcoming problems encountered during
project implementation. Significant savings in project costs were achieved
and the plant is operating at satisfactory levels since commissioning.
KRIBHCO's performance both during project implementation and operation is
commendable (para 3.04).
10.       From the initial stages all through the implementation period of
the project, IDA played a significant role in helping KRIBHCO to arrange
project financing, continuously improve project management, organization
and procedures, notably in procurement, and constantly monitor the project
to identify weak points. Apart from minor infrastructural facilities, the
project has been successfully implemented meeting its main objectives of
converting a natural resource to a strategic, hitherto imported commodity,
ensuring its economical and timely supply to farmers, and improving the
region's economic structure (para 7.01).
11.       Overall, the project was successful.  At the time of its
appraisal, however, IDA had not yet developed a broader approach to
sectoral lending and to that extent the project did not deal with sectoral
issues. In retrospect, such an approach would have been desirable
(para 8.05).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1125-IN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agriculture employs over 67% of India's total work force and
accounts for about 40% of the country's GDP. The Government of India's
(GOI) agricultural policy aims to ensure increased production. Due to the
limited scope of expanding the area under cultivation, more intensive use
of land with continually updated inputs and the improvement of farming
practices are of paramount importance in India's agricultural development.
The objective of further expanding fertilizer use, which has grown at a
compound annual rate of 10% since the early 1970s, reaching 8.7 million
tons of nutrient in 1985/86, is an integral part of GOI's agricultural
development strategy. Five consecutive development plans have given
priority to the development of an efficient fertilizer industry to ensure a
sustained supply of fertilizers to consumers and to expedite the
achievement of agricultural self-sufficiency.
1.02      In 1985/86 India had a total production of 5.7 million tons per
year of nutrient (tyn), of which 4.3 million tyn was in the form of
nitrogen, making it the fourth largest producer after the Soviet Union, the
United States and China.  In spite of its large production, India's supply
gap in 1985/86 amounted to 32% of its fertilizer requirements, or some 2.7
million tyn, requiring foreign exchange of some US$650 million (on FOB
basis). The outflow of foreign exchange on account of fertilizer imports
over the years has had a considerable negative impact on India's balance of
payments. GOI has therefore given priority to the installation of
additional production facilities while increasing the level of capacity
utilization at existing plants to increase overall domestic production.
The Bank Group has so far participated in the financing of thirteen
fertilizer projects in India, making a total contribution of about US$1.4
billion towards the substantial capital and infrastructural investment
requirements associated with these projects.
1.03      Annex 1 shows the pattern of India's production and consumption
of fertilizer since 1952/53. Consumption of all fertilizers in India
increased at an annual growth rate of 14% from 294,000 tyn in 1960/61 to
8.7 million tyn in 1985/86. Nitrogenous fertilizers constitute two-thirds
of total fertilizer used. Consumption of the latter increased at a rate of
about 15% per annum (p.a.) from 212,000 tyn in 1960/61 to 5.8 million tyn
in 1985/86. The growth of fertilizer consumption is expected to continue
due to (i) GOI's policy to increase agricultural output; and (ii) the wide
disparities in fertilizer use among states, providing opportunities for
broadening the fertilizer demand base.1/ Furthermore, consumption of
1/   The three States of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana account for over
40% of the total fertilizer consumption in India.



-2-
fertilizer per hectare of arable land in India (42 kg/ha in 1985/86) is
still significantly less than in other developing countries (e.g., China,
123 kg/ha and Mexico, 67 kg/ha). GOI has projected fertilizer consumption
to increase at an average of about 7% p.a. or from 8.7 million tyn in
1985/86 to 16.6 million tyn by 1994/95. This projected growth, however,
appears to be optimistic; a growth rate of about 4% p.a. may be more
realistic.
1.04      Throughout its rapid growth, India's domestic fertilizer industry
encountered problems which included low capacity utilization, poor
technology, managerial and administrative inefficiencies, high capital
costs, relatively long project implementation periods, disruption of
feedstock and utilities supplies, distribution and transport bottlenecks
and a restrictive regulatory framework. Government policies implemented to
generate the industry's rapid growth protected it from competitive
incencives for cost minimization -4d efficiency gains. As a result, the
sector is not internationally competitive. Average domestic production
costs exceed the landed cost cf imports, and inadequate investment in
distribution facilities has led to bottlenecks which in turn reduce
capacity utilization in existing production facilities.
1.05      From time to time GOI has taken steps to effect changes in the
fertilizer sector, However, the broader sectoral issues of subsidy,
production efficiency, pricing, public enterprise management and
distribution need further actions. There is a need to reform the present
pricing policy to bring producer and user prices closer to corresponding
economic values. Relaxation of regulatory controls on investment, exit and
distribution is also needed to increase the sector's efficiency, achieve
growth at reasonable cost and reduce the central Government's budgetary
subsidy for fertilizer which stood at US$1.6 billion in 1985/86. These
reforms will, however, necessarily be gradual taking into account sectoral
links in the rest of the economy and the rationalization of existing
facilities and capability, mainly in the public sector.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Identification, Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Credit
Effectiveness
2.01      Following a request by GOI for IDA financing of the Hazira
Fertilizer Project to be located at Hazira, about 15 km west of Surat City
in the State of Gujarat, an IDA mission visited India in October/November
1979. The appraisal mission was joined by the representatives of the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (Japan) (OECF), Overseas Development
Administration (U.K.) (ODA) and Industrial Development Bank of India
(IDBI), the prospective co-lenders to the project. Because of the delays
in the initiation of the project due to delays in the appointment of
engineering firms, the project was re-appraised in November 1980 by another
IDA mission.



- 3 -
2.02      On March 31, 1981 IDA approved a credit of SDR 321.5 million
equivalent (US$400 million) to be made directly to the Government. The
onlending terms were for (a) GOI to relend IDA funds to KRIBHCO at an
interest rate of 11,75% p.a. with a repayment over 15 years including 5
years of grace, and (b) GOI to bear the foreign exchange risk. The
Dev2lopment Credit Agreement was signed on October 28, 1981 and became
effective on January 21, 1982.
B.   Project Description and Objectives
2.03      The project is part of GOI's overall plan to make economic use of
the off-shore natural gas deposits discovered in 1974. A major aim of the
project was to produce urea and ammonia by converting a domestic natural
resource. This contributes towards GOI's goal of increasing agricultural
productivity and output towards the eventual attainment of agricultural
self-sufficiency.
2.04      The project. based on steam reforming of non-associated natural
gas, was designed for 1.45 million tons per year (tpy) of urea for sale
principally to farmers in Northern and Western India, and a marginal
surplus of 17,820 tpy of ammonia. The complex comprises two single-train
ammonia units each with a capacity of 1,350 tpd of ammonia, four urea units
each of 1,100 tpd capacity. In addition, there are the related utilities
and offsite facilities including three steam generation plants of 275 tons
per hour each; two power units of 15 Mw each; ammonia storage for 20,000
tons; urea bagging facilities and silos for 90,000 tons of bulk storage; a
township with 960 housing units; and a water treatment plant.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The project has been completed successfully.  Reserves of natural
gas are being used to produce fertilizer which is in turn supplied to
farmers, enhancing GOI's objective of increasing productivity towards the
intended goal of self-sufficiency in agriculture. The facilities were
mechanically completed in November 1985, 51 months from the pro4ect zero
date of April 1, 1981; the total installed cost was 35% lower than
estimated. Overall delay in project completion was 3 months. The plant
reached commercial production within 4 months of mechanical completion.
B.   Project Scope
3.02      There was one significant modification in the project scope with
IDA's approval. This involved a changeover from coal-fired boilers to
gas-fired boilers as it became evident that sufficient gas would be
available to enable KRIBHCO to replace coal with gas in firing the
boilers. Although the project was conceived on the basis of South Bassein
gas, it is operating on associated gas from the Bombay High field. These
modifications had no significant impact on the efficiency or safety of the
plant.



-4-
C,   Project Management and Execution
3.03      At the time of implementation, the project owner, KRIBHCO, had
only been recently formed. IFFCO and GOI agreed that the former would
assume responsibility for project preparation and for ensuring that KRIBHCO
is suitably staffed and organized for the project implementation period.
Accordingly, IFFCO transferred to KRWBHCO about 50 professional staff
constituting the major part of the project team that worked on the Phulpur,
Kalol, and Kandla orojects.  T.,e selected team thus had considerable
experience in project implementation and operation. The Executive Director
and Project Manager of KRIBHCO worked in those capacities on the Kalol and
Phulpur projects where they performed well.
3.04      KRIBHCO however experienced a high turnover of top-level
management due to ill health, retirement and incompatibility problems. In
the six years since its inception, KRIBHCO has had five Managing
Directors. A ner Managing Director has recently been confirmed and assumed
his duties in November 1986.  Management problems were also experienced on
the marketing side. In 1983, KRIBHCO decided to market its own urea thus
changing the original arrangement whereby IFFCO would be responsible for
marketing KRIBHCO's urea in addition to its own urea (para 4.04). However,
IDA requested further strengthening of marketing arrangements by the
appointment of a Marketing Director and Transport Advisor. These positions
are still vacant. A General Manager (Marketing) was appointed in 1984 and
most of the middle-level positions at Head Office and many of the field
positions have been filled. Several IDA missions urged KRIBHCO and GOI to
recruit and expedite the appointment of personnel to fill these vacant
positions as these are crucial to KRIBHCO's successful operation. Although
KRIBHCO responded to IDA's recommendations, progress on this issue,
particularly top level appointments, has been generally slow partly due to
the slow, cumbersome and inefficient government employment procedures that
have to be followed.
D. Manpower Development and Training
3.05      KRIBHCG's organizational chart is shown in Annex 3-1.  At
appraisal, the project was expected to employ about 5,000 persons during
construction and 1,400 persons permanently at full operation. Having
employed up to 3,800 people at the peak of construction activity,
the project now has a staff complement of 1,320 comprising 297
executives/officers and 1,023 others. Most of the senior managers and
other key operations personnel were assigned by IFFCO, while trainees were
recruited by KRIBHCO. The trainees were recruited mostly from the project
execution areas of IFFCO's operating plants. This ensured that skilled
operators and maintenance technicians with at least 12 months' training
were made available for the project. By June 1982, KRIBHCO had developed a
good training and tecruitment plan for its operating staff, with training
for semi-skilled and unskilled staff provided at the project site before
project completion. A Graduate Engineer/Commercial Trainee program was
established in 1984. This program prepares candidates for junior engineer
and middle-level management positions.



E.   Performance of Engineering Contractors
3.06      Project execution was supervised by KRIBHCO's Director of
Operations who was responsible for the project budget and implementation
schedule. He was assisted by Consultants specializing in ammonia, urea and
power unit installations, and project engineers -ho were responsible for
day-to-day coordination of implementation. Cne engineering firm from the
United States and another from Italy took the responsibilities of providing
licenses, basic engineering, erection, pre-operatton and start-up
supervision for the ammonia and urea units, respectively. Three Indian
engineering companies undertook the execution of detailed engineering of
the ammonia and urea units and ancillary facilities, under the supervision
of the respective process licensors. KRIBHCO was satisfied with the
services provided by the contractors. Quick remedial action was taken
whenever problems occurred during implementation.
F.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.07      KRIBRCO observed acceptable contracting and procurement
procedures in implementing the project. International competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures were used in accordance with IDA guidelines for procuring
foreign equipment and materials with IDA credit. Among foreign suppliers,
the largest share of contracts financed by IDA (16%) was won by Japan, with
Italy and the United States in second place (101 each) (Annex 3-2).
Locally supplied equipment and services amounted to 54% of the total share
of contracts financed by IDA.
3.08      During appraisal, it was estimated that 40% of the IDA credit
would be used to finance imported equipment, 481 for local equipment
procured by ICB and the rest for foreign and local engineering and
other services. The actual results are close to the estimates at 54%
local through ICB and 46% foreign. Although the performance of the
suppliers was in general satisfactory, there were delays in deliveries by
both foreign and local suppliers. However, KRIBHCO took measures to
shorten delays by air freighting some of the equipment and organizing local
manufacturers to complete final welds at site. No problems were fa~ed in
obtaining suppliers' cooperation and assistance in carrying out the
required repairs/modifications related to the problems encountered during
commissioning and initial operation.
G.   Project Implementation Schedule
3.09      The mechanical completion and commissioning dates of the units

The entire project was mechanically completed in September 1985, 3 months
behind the appraisal schedule.  The delay was mainly due to the delay in
the availability of gas. Other factors included delays In the (i) delivery
of equipment, (ii) completion of engineering work by the prime contractors,
(iii) placement of orders resulting from the delay in approvals by
statutory authorities, and (iv) certification of import lists. The project
management team successfully overlapped the testing and commissioning with
the final stages of the construction activities to reduce delays. Minor
infrastructural facilities are still under implementation and IDA is still
committing expenditure under the credit (para 3.11).

Total actual project cost was US$836.2 million, 35% lower than thet
appraisal estimate of US$1,276.9 million. The decrease in capital cost was
mainly due to (i) use of ICB for local procurement; (ii) lower
international prices for capital equipment due to 8 rplus market
conditions; (iii) exchange rate movements resulting in lower local dollar
costs; and (iv) savings in the financing charges and higher production
during the trial run period than originally envisags4.
3.11       IDA credit has financed about 441 of the project's total
financing needs. The cofinancing arrangements under the project were
successful. Of the total IDA credit of SDR 321.5 million (US$400 million),
the actual utilization as of June 30, 1987 was US$314.0 million. (The
amended credit amount as of June 30, 1987 was US$392.1 million due to
SDR/US$ rate fluctuation.)  Credit worth US$0.86 million was cancelled due
to disagreement between IDA and KRIBHCO over procurement procedures. The
cumulative disbursement pattern for the IDA credit as estimated at the time
ofhappraisal and the actual pattern is given in Annex 3-3 and is summarized
below:

KRIBHCO hopes it will have utilized the remaining balAnce (SDR 23e9 million
or about US$31 million) by June 30, 1988, the new closing date of the
credit. The remaining credit will be used mainly for lnfrastructural
facilities which are not directly related to production, like the
development of an alternate source of water supply. Approximately US$17
million has been earmarked to these facilities. However, it is possible
that KRIBHCO may be unable to use the entire balance of credit,
necessitating cancellation of unused credit of about US$4 million.
IV.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A.   Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned earlier (para 3.09) the supply of gas to the project
delayed the plant start-up. Initially, the gas was expected to be supplied
in January 1984 when pre-commissioning was to start. However, low pressure
gas for the boilers was made available only in August 1984 and high
pressure gas for feedstock was available in September 1985 for Phase 1, and
in November 1985 for Phase 2. After the cutting in of feedstock, ammonia
production was realized on November 14, 1985 for Phase 1 and November 30,
1985 for Phase 2. The first urea was realized on November 26, 1985. By
mid-December 1985, all four urea streams were running.
4.02      The production levels and rates of capacity utilization achieved
during 1985-86 are given in Annex 4. The overall capacity utilization
during the commissioning period averaged 52Z. Between March and August of
1986, the average capacity utilization increased to 65% as forecast at
appraisal. The plants have since achieved 100% utilization rates. The
highest rate of capacity utilization achieved on a single day per stream
has been 106% for the ammonia units and 130% for urea.
B.   Build-up of Production
4.03      It is estimated that the plants will produce 773,000 tons of
ammonia and 1.2 million tons of urea in the year 1986/87. This corresponds



- 9 -
to 87% and 82% capacity utilization respectively. Thereafter, the plants
are capable of mairtaining a sustained 95% capacity utilization.

C.   Marketing
4.04      At inception of the project, it was envisaged that IFFCO would
assume all marketing responsibilities for urea on behalf of KRIBHCO. By
1985 however, KRIBHCO decided to market its own urea. This decision was
made because it was felt that for logistic reasons, KRIBHCO would be better
placed to market its own urea thaa IFFCO, since the latter would also be
marketing large volumes of its own urea and other products. IDA agreed to
this arrangemeat but required that KRIBHCO take steps to strengthen their
marketing organization and prepare a well defined marketing plan before
assuming full responsibility for the marketing of urea. KRIBHCO undertook
to appoint a Marketing Director and a Transport Advisor. A General Manager
(Marketing) has been appointed, and most of the middle-level positions at
Head Office have been filled. The positions of Marketing Director and
Transport Advisor are still vacant however, as are some of the field
positions. Progress in this regard has been slow (para 3.04). This aspect
needs further strengthening as it is critical to KRIBHCO's operations.2/
4.05      KRIBHCO expects to market a major portion of its urea in the
States of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. In this regard, more
sale points are being established, and regional offices strengthened to
give momentum to the marketing effort. However, KRIBHCO, like other
cooperative manufacturers, are constrained by regulations specifying
marketing channels for individual producers, specified distribution areas
and fixed retail margins. The utilization of a multi-channel approach by
cooperatives to fertilizer distribution, as is the case for both private
and public sector plants, is necessary to enhance competition, while the
establishment of nodal points and bulk handling facilities is necessary to
enhance distribution efficiency.
2/   Subsequent to the preparation of the completion report, KRIBHCO has
taken steps to strengthen the marketing organization in the field as
well as at Headquarters with regard to marketing staff.

V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Pricing Policy
5.01      Ex-factory and farmgate prices of fertilizers are set by the
Government. Prices to the farmer are uniform throughout India, but the
ex-factory prices are set on a plant-by-plant Jasis using a "retention
price formula" and are administered by the Fertilizer Industry Coordination
Committee (FICC). The retention price formula is given in Annex 5-1 and
retention prices for the Hazira project are given in Annex 5-2. The
retention price formula, introduced in 1977, ensures the general financial
viability of producers by allowing an individual unit, when operating
efficiently at 80% capacity and at certain agreed input consumption norms,
a 24% pre-tax rate of return. The formula does not encourage inter-plant
competition and is not linked with economic efficiency and therefore
disregards the opportunity cost of importing fertilizer. The formula fails
to discourage investmenL in high-cost new plants which would have
guaranteed profitability as long as they achieve 80% capacity utilization
irrespective of their economic viability. Furthermore, the retention price
formula, as it now operates, provides exit signals only for financial
inefficiency and not for economic or technological inefficiency.
5.02      GOI's review of the retention price system now underway is part
of a broader program instituted in recognition of the need for reforms,
The reform program should be designed to stimulate internal competition and
efficiency, induce long-term international competitiveness and help reduce
the fertilizer subsidy. This program should include pricing reforms,
rehabilitation, closure of some plants, management and organizational
changes, and regulatory reforms on new investment and distribution. IDA's
present dialogue with GOI is focusing on these issues.
B.   Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
5.03      The assumptions used in  the calculation of the FRR and ERR are
given in Annex 5-3, The financial rate of return has been calculated using
prices adjusted to July 1986 constant dollars. The operating costs and
revenues are given in Annex 5-4. The FRR for the project is now estimated
at 14.3%, compared to the appraisal estimate of 9.1%. The difference is
due mainly to lower capital costs for the project (para 3.10). The FRR is
based on the present retention price formula which may be changed.
504      One of the policy options for fertilizer pricing being considered
is the adjustment of the retention prices for capacity utilization norm,
debt-equity ratio and return on net worth, starting in March 1987. In
addition, an import parity price linked ceiling may be put on the maximum
retention price. After 1990/91, a single uniform price equal to tariff
adjusted import parity price for all plants is being considered. If this
were implemented, the FRR for Hazira project would drop to about 11% for
urea price of US$140/ton FOB.

C.   Financial Results
5.05      Income statements, balance sheets, and funds flow statements for
the project are presented in Annexes 5-5, 5-6 and 5-7. KRIBHCO is in comr-
pliance with IDA's financial covenants. Increases in production costs due
to inflation tend to increase the retention price. The formula provides
the company a large cash flow during the initial years of operations, a8 is
illustrated by the pattern of current assets on the schedule of selected
financial data for Hazira presented below.

VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A.   Economic Rate of Return
6.01      For economic analysis, tradeable items have been priced on the
basis of projected international prices allowing for transportation and
handling charges. Prices for non-tradeable items have been assumed to be
the same as domestic financial prices adjusted to reflect the economic
prices of their internationally traded components. The economic price of
non-associated natural gas has been calculated on the basis of its calo-
rific value equivalent of fuel oil. Economic prices of urea were based on
projected international prices of urea. The price of urea is expected to
rise from the 1986 level of US$102/ton to US$116/ton in 1988, US$182/ton
in 1990 and US$167/ton in 1995--all in constant 1985 dollars,



- 12 -
6.02      Project costs and benefit streams for ERR are shown in Aanex
6-1,  The ERR is estimated at 15.7%, slightly lower than the appraisal
estimate of 16.6%. The difference is due mainly to lower urea prices than
projected at appraisal, which more than offset the gain from lower energy
and capital costs.
B.   Foreign Exchange Savings
6.03      The net foreign exchange savings over 15 years, after deduction
of principal and interest payments on the foreign loans and deducting
foreign exchange components of operating costs in constant 1986 dollars,
are estimated at around US$220 million p.a., and in 1996/97, the cumulative
savings amount to US$3,740 million, about 8% more than the appraisal esti-
mate, Most of the materials including feedstock, fuel and services used in
the project are obtained locally. Annex 6-2 shows the foreign exchange
savings over a 15 year period.
C.   Technology Transfer
6.04      The project was implemented with a substantial involvement of
Indian firms. About 54% of the equipment for the project was supplied by
local manufacturers, thus creating significant backward linkages with the
industrial sector. Using know-how and basic design obtained from process
licensors, the detailed engineering and civil contracts were executed by
local firms. The engineering firms and project staff absorbed the technol-
ogy thus transferred and now possess significant capabilities in carrying
out similar projects.
D.   Environmental Aspects
6.05      The project facilities were designed to conform with environmen-
tal regulations and norms agreed to at appraisal. The urea plants contain
a hydrolyser section where urea is decomposed and recycled. A separate
treatment section was set up for urea upset conditions. Effluents from the
water treatment plant, cooling towers and other waste streams are treated
and neutralized in treatment ponds prior to discharge. This conforms with
State and local water pollution standards. A water scrubbing system to
dedust urea from air leaving the prill tower was installed in conformance
with World realth Authority and United States air pollution standards.
VII. IDA ROLE
7.01      IDA's major objectives in this and other projects until recently
in this subsector in India have been to support GOI's strategy for increas-
ing domestic production of fertilizers. Emphasis was therefore placed on
improving project organization and efficiency, selection of projects,
expanding production facilities and improving capacity utilization. More
recently however, IDA has recognized that achievement of project objectives
alone is not enough to ensure an economically efficient fertilizer sector--
policy changes are also needed. As a result, IDA's focus has recently



- 13 -
moved to include policy dialogue or. broader sectoral issues. The objective
is to improve efficiency of the sector through reform of pricing policies,
relaxation of regulatory environment, improvements in rationalization/
restructuring or closure of existing inefficient plants. Although the
project was successful in meeting its objectives, IDA should have adopted a
broader sectoral approach and considered pricing issues, economic
efficiency of the sector, multichannel approach to marketing and the
restrictive regulatory framework at the early stages of project appraisal.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Apart from the 3-month delay in project completion, the project
was successful in: (i) keeping the Project costs under control; (ii)
achieving a short commissioning and start-up period; (lii) achieving the
design figures of individual units in guarantee test runs; and (iv)
obtaining a satisfactory level of operating performance for the period
since start up. Once the initial delays in the supply of equipment and
natural gas were overcome, the responsible team implemented the Project
efficiently.
8.02      The delays due to unavailability of gas emphasize that important
consideration should be given to the availability of downstream supply.
The Project however was completed successfully due to the appropriate
training and experience of KRIBHCO's project team which executed the work
with enthusiasm and dedication. The project team made use of expatriate
expertise to enhance their own operation and ensure an effective transfer
of technology. KRIBHCO's performance has been commendable.
8.03      The shortcomings in marketing procedures highlight the need for
firm action by IDA in putting in place the requisite organizational
arrangements. Furthermore, such arrangements should be in place at the
early stages of project implementation.
8.04      The financial performance of the project is slightly above the
appraisal estimates due to substantially lower project capital costs as a
result of lower prices for equipment, exchange rate movements and use of
ICB. The low financial rate of return compared to the economic rate of
return is due to retention price formula under which the urea ex-factory
price decreases over time. The project however makes a significant
contribution to India's economy given its economic rate of return of
15.62. The project contributes to the development of the Gujarat State and
converts economically a natural resource into a such needed fertilizer and
saves India foreign exchange.
8.05      Overall, the project has met its main objectives.  The project
illustrates that capable, experienced and dedicated project management and
the involvement of an operating company with experienced staff during the
initial stages of operation, can have a significant impact on the success
of project implementation. The issue of management emphasizes the need for
timely action throughout all stages of a project's implementation. Policy

and subsectoral issues should be given an important place in developing a
fruitful dialogue with GO! on the further development of this subsector.

Retention Price Formula
1.        The urea retention price for the Hazira Fertilizer Project is
calculated according to the formula provided by the Marathe Committee in
1977. The calculations are made for pricing periods of 3 years as follows:
(a) Share capital used in urea production. In each successive
pricing period, share capital is equal to that prevailing at
the beginning of the period.
(b) + Retained earnings
(c) - Capital employed outside the business, and accumulated
surplus cash.
(d) - ;Capital employed in the business. A lower limit has been
set for this capital employed and it cannot decrease below
share capital.
(e) x 24X return on capital employed.
(f) + Variable and fixed production costs at 80% capacity
utilization related to urea production, with depreciation as
provided in the company balance sheet.
(g)    Ex-factory revenue to producer.
(h) - Production volume of urea derived from entire 80% ammonia
utilization.
()     Urea Retention Price allowed.

INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT (CRe 1125-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Assumptions for Economic and Financial
Rate of Return Calculations
1.       The economic price of natural gas is assumed to be equal to its
fuel oil equivalent value based on calorific value. The fuel oil price is
projected based on the projection of crude oil prices as well as the
estimate of fuel oil crude oil price ratio of 0.78.
2.        For shadow pricing, local components of capital cost and other
inputs and services are adjusted by using standard conversion factor of 0.8
for India.
3.        Local operating cost items, utilities and fixed costs are con-
verted to July 1986 constant dollars, and assumed to remain constant in US$
terms.
4.        It is assumed that ammonia and bulk urea prices will retain
1:1.14 relation at international market. For bagging, US$15 is added to
bulk urea prices.
5.        The economic working capital requirements of the Hazira
Fertilizer Project are based on the raw materials and work in process
inventories only. Finished products inventory has been omitted, since in
the case of import substitution, the inventory of products produced by the
Hazira project would substitute for that of imported products and thus does
not increase the country's total inventory. Accounts receivable and pay-
able have also been omitted as tIey do not represent costs incurred by the
economy, but are considered instruments of 'transfer of obligation." These
are the major reasons why the economic working capital requirements
(US$15.8 million) are less than financial ones (US$36.6 million in 1986
prices).
6.        Economic prices of urea were based on the projected international
prices of urea. In summary, the FOB price of urea (bagged, Europe) is
projected to change from the 1985/86 cost of US$102/ton to US$182/ton in
1990/91 and US$167/ton in 1995/96. The price proj "tion reflects future
global demand and supply balance of urea as well as the projected energy
situation. Added to the FOB price are sea freight and insurance to India
(US$30/ton), port handling and losses (US$12/ton) and inland transportation
cost (US$28/ton) to the projected market for the Rasira project's output.
The economic price of urea is thus calculated at US$252/ton for 1990/91 and
US$237/ton for 1995/96.

7.        Based on an assumed 330 operating days per year, production is
assumed to achieve 80% capacity utilization in 1986/87 and a conservative
utilization rate of 90% is assumed thereafter.

loan
Actual loan amount has bcon i,.dicated as disbtirsed
US 1? 346.5 million as against the appraisal estimate
of US $ 400/- million. It 11as also b2en indicated
that the amended loan amount is US $ 392,1 million,
,nho rzevised loan amount of US $ 392.1 million has
been) .;oiked out based on the rate of 1 SDR = US $ 1.22.
It apj;ears that t:his rate was prevailing in September
1986 and which has been adopted for consideration
of the loan amount in US $. on the basis of actual
disbursement of loan by World Bank it has been found
that the average rate comes to 1 SDR = US $ 1.08.
In view of this the loan amount indicated in US $
as 392.1 million is very high and considering the
average SR-US $ parity during the execution of the
Project the loan amount should be around US $ 347/-
million instead of US $ 392.1 million as indicated.
On this basis the atual utilisation shown as US $
346,5 million also appears to be high and unutilised
amount will also undergo a change.
2, Page iv para C and page 6 para 3.10 regarding Project
Cost and Financing :
The appraisal Project Cost Estimate of US $ 1276.9
million has been compared with the actual Cost
Estimate of US $ 836.2 million and has been indicated
that the cost estimate has been lcwer by 35%. This
statement is not correct due t'o the following reasons:

a) Comparison has been done in US $t whiclh was
worked out based on tiu uxchange rate t,xv.tling
at the tine of re *sbility Report viz 1  tl q  a i;s.8/-
However, based on the actual ex.chanje rat;es pre-
vailing during the project execution viz, from
1980 to 19t6, the average exchange rate has been
around 1 US $ = P4 10*76. The wide vari"ti.on in
the Capital Cost Estimate is mainly on account
of kxchawLje rate flucL.ations uuriraj tha 2:'oject
period. In case com>,ln,;ison of the equival.nt
amiaunt in rupees is made, the reduction in cap-
it.!l Cost Estimate will be from zs lt,),215/- ::iilAion
to is 9*ooo/- million resulting in a savnig of
only 12%, and noL 35%. indicdited in the draft PCR.
b) Even the saving in terms of rupees indicated above
as 12% does not correctly reflect the position,f since
in the %ppraisal Re:ortp working ca.,iital was provided
as ib 1284/- million -ehich includes other s6hort term
debts also while in the actual Cost Estimates the
Working Capital margin of Rs 403/- million has been
indicated. In case, comparison of the Cost Estimate
is made without taking into account the Working
Capital, the reduction in the cost Estimatte ccaies
to only 4%. A more meaningful comparison would be
to consider the working capital margin bLcth in the
Appraisal Coat Estimate as well as in the actual cost
Estimate to avoid Sny distortions as inciicated above.
c   mhe total financing of the Project has not been
indicated anywhere and it is sug.jested that the over.
all financing of the Project may be in6icated titJh
the amount being invested by Goverrnent of Innia and
IFTCO and other Cooperative Societies, IDBI and other
financial institutions.
5he financing pattern may be indicated in iRu?eesas
well as in US e and an average rate of US $ may
be cdnsidered.
