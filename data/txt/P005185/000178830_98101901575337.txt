APPRAISAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPMENT BANK OF IRAN
SummaLry
1.        The Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI)
has been associated with the World Bank Group ever since its creation
in 1959. It has obtained three IBRD loans totaling US$40.2 million
and is now seeking its fourth. US$7 million remained uncommitted
from existirng IBRD loans on March 31, 1968.
2.        IIDBI's business grew slowly in its first 5 years, mainly
as a result of the economic recession in Iran. Since then, IMDBI's
operations have surged forward reflecting favorable economic conditions
in the country and IMDBIts own quest for business. In the conduct
of its operations IMDBI has been helped by corporate resources totaling
Rls. 5.9 billion (about US$79 million) including share capital of
Rls. 720 million, a quasi-equity type Government Advance of Rls. 600
million, foreign exchange loans of US$43.7 million, Government loans
of Rls. 1,250 million and by Government funds managed by IMDBI of
nearly Rls. 2.5 billion (US$ 33 million). Through February 1968 IM)DBI
had made commitments for 224 loans for Rls. 7.9 billion (US$105 million)
and equity investments of Rls. 1,355 million (US$18 million).
3.        IMDBI has developed very good relations with the authorities
and most of Iran's private industry. Aside from contributing an
important share to private industrial investment, often in industries
new to Iran, IMDBI has performed an important function in attracting
landlords, merchants and young Iranians into manufacturing. IMDBI
has also promoted projects of its own in areas which it had assessecd
for their attractive prospects. This activity, at times involving
foreign investors, has represented an increasing share of IMDBI's
operations. IMDBI is a leader in equity investments in Iran and has
done much to get the Tehran Stock Exchange launched and to spread
modern practices.
4.        Tha cost of IMDBI's resources has risen in the past few
years, but with expanding operations, IMDBI has remained profitable;
in 1966/67 profits after tax on share capital (at year end) were
16.9 percent and preliminary data for 1967/68, the year when a
Rls. 240 miIlion share increase was effected, put this percentage at;
15.L0 INDBI's portfolio which is well diversified is generally goocd,
though it has some shortcomings arising from the irregular payment
habits in the country.
5.        IMDBI has become a compact organization under effective
and competent management, It has a good staff which is however just
about enough to meet present responsibilities except for project
supervision where considerable strengthening is needed, IM4DBI would
also have to be watchful in the future against a dilution of its
energies by having its top management drawn overly into promotions
and into managerial functions in client companies.



- ii -
6.        IMDBI has good prospects over the next few years to carry,
out a substantially larger business than in the past because of the
outlook for favorable economic conditions and because of I}fBI's out-
going attituade to mobilizing business. IMDBI forecasts a business
volume of about Rlso 7.8 billion during the two-year period ending
March 1970. To carry out operations of this order, IMDBI needs an
additional Rls. 5.9 billion including Rls. 3 billion (US$40 million)
in foreign exchange. IMDBI's forecast depends in large measure on
the realization of a few large projects which IMDBI is promoting.
There may be some slippage in these projects, but over the period of
about two years, IMDEI's projections do not seem unreasonable. To
carry out operations on the estimated scale, IMDBI has already been
advised that it would obtain the needed additional rials from the
Iranian Government. With the endorsement of the Iranian Government,
IMDBI looks, as in the past, to the IERD for meeting a major part of
its foreign exchange needs.
7.        Considering its good performance and business prospects, IMEBI
qualifies for further IBRD support.  It would be prudent, however, to
make another IBRD loan which would not materially go beyond IMDBI' s
estimate of its needs for about one year. On this basis, IMDBI wouLld
be a suitable creditworthy borrower for an IBRD loan of US$25 million.
Allowing for some delays in the promotions IMDBI is now considering,
a loan of t'his size would be sufficient to meet IMDBI's needs for
more than one year and could even be stretched to two.
8.        A fresh IBRD loan should carry the normal features of recent
loans to development finance companies. IMJBIts present debt limita-
tion agreed with the IBRD should be reformulated to allow IMDBI to incur
long-term debt up to 4e5 times a borrowing base consisting of IMDBI's
net worth and only those parts of the Government Advance falling duie
after any IBRD loans to IM4DBI are repaid, The maturities on the
Government Advance falling due earlier should be included in debt.
Instead of the present "free" lending limit of US$750,000, the Bank's
prior approval of projects should be required only for those
requiring US$1 million or more from the proposed loan.
9.        IMDBI proposes to raise its limit on aggregate commitments
in the form of equity investments'with its own funds to about 130
percent of its presently estimated net worth, because its operations
are expected to press against IMLEIts present limit of Rls. 930 million
during 1968/69. The Bank has advised that at this time the limit
should not be raised beyond net worth but has indicated its willingness
to IMDBI to review the matter, wqhen II4DBI's operations approach that
limit, in the light of several relevant factors including the progress
made in arrangements for another Rls. 240 million share increase which
IMDBI proposes to effect within the coming two years,
10.       The Bank's end-use inspections of IMDBI should be more fre-
quent, possibly twice a year.



APPRAISAL OF
THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPMENT BANK OF IRAN
1.        The Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMff)BI) is
seeking its fourth Bank loan. If granted, it would follow on a total of
US$40.2 milliona so far lent. The third loan was made on July 26, 1966, for
US$25 million and about US$7 million of it remained uncommitted on March
31, 1968.
I. IMDBI'S ENVIRONMENT, ROLE AND BUSINESS
Interaction between the Environment and IMDBI
2.        IMDBI, which is described in some detail in Annex A, is eight years
old.  The problems often encountered by a new institution in finding its
bearings, and the recession of the Iranian economy in the early sixties made
for a slow development of IMDBI's business during its first five years.
During the subsequent 3 years, i.e. thie period March 1965 - February 1968
the total of IDMBI's commitments (including those from Managed Funds)
increased by about 70% over the total of the preceding five years as the
following table illustrates (in Rls. million equivalent):
Foreign       Rial     Total      Equity
Exchange Loans    Loans    Loans    Investments    Total
Oct. 1959 -
March 1965        558         2,699    3,257        173       3,430
March 1965 -
February 1968;  2,321         2,276    4,597      1,274        5,871
2,879         4,975    7,854      1,447        9,301
3.        A leading factor for the sharp rise in IMDBI's business in recent
years has been Iran's economic boom stimulated by rapidly increasing oil
revenues, liberal credit policies and political stability.  The upturn has
occurred with considerable price stability, helped by substantial foreign
exchange revenues and three good harvests in a row. GDP increased by nearly
10% in 1966/67 1/ with investment accounting for about 18% of GDP.  Per capita
income was some!what below US$250.  A further rise of 10% in GDP is expected
to have been achieved in 1967/68. Private investment rose in the last 3-4
years by roughly 14% per year, with the increase more marked in indust:ry
which absorbed about Rls.15 billion in 1966/67 and may possibly approach
Rls.20 billion for 1967/68. Industry, as further discussed in Annex B, has
made great strides since the recovery and has now reached a stage of devel-
opment at which the output of some capital goods and sophisticated consumer
goods are playing an increasing role.
1/ The Iranian year starts on March 21. The current year (1968/69) is
equivalent to the year 1347 in the Iranian calendar.



- 2 -
4.        Taking advantage of this favorable setting, IMDBI has displayed a very
outgoing attitude towards new business. This has principally taken the form of
help to clients in shaping proposals to bankable standards, and of promotion of
projects, which is discussed further in paragraphs 10 - 13. IMDBI continues
to encourage merchants and importers to enter into manufacturing. (About h4%
of IMDBI's 129 clients, through March 1967, has such a background.) Growing
investment opportunities and the absence of a developed capital market have
enabled IMDBI to increase its operations, markedly those involving promotions
and equity investments.
5.        IMDEI has made persistent efforts to introduce more up-to-date
concepts in Iran's industrial environment. For instance, in getting the
Tehran Stock Exchange organized 1/, by obtaining expert advice on steps
leading to the Exchange's formation and by an active role in drafting the
relevant legislation. IMDBI has advised the Government on preparing the
recently enacted tax law; by requiring its larger clients to undergo an
independent audit, it has als6 helped in spreading modern accounting standards.
The latter effort 2/, though facing entrenched antidisclosure traditions, is
supported by the Central Bank.
Relations with Government and Business Community
6.        There are good reasons for IMDBI to maintain harmonious relations
with the Government. Above all, IMDBI continues to depend on the Government
for an important share of its resources. IMDBI has to take note of the
formulation andi implementation of the Government's tariff, tax and lic:ensing
policies. IMDBI has also played a role in advising the Government on general
industrial policy questions and in taking up specific project issues of its
clients. IMDBI has, on the whole, succeeded in maintaining smooth relations
with the Government. In this it has been helpedly the fact of its Chairman
being also the President of the Senate, by the presence of a Government
observer on its Board, and by the fact that several IDMBI officers had prev-
iously worked for the Central Bank and the Plan Organization. IMDBI is
respected in official circles for its practical knowledge of industrial
problems and is often consulted by Governmenit agencies, most recently during
the formulation of Iran's Fourth Development Plan. The other industrial fin-
ancing institutions, almost all of which are public sector institutions,
regard IMDBI as a leader; IMDBI s relations with them are congenial.
1/ IMDBI's owa shares were the first registered on Tehran's new stocb:
exchange which opened for trading in November 1967.
2/  In trying to improve industry's accounting, IMDBI is not purely altruistic
considering the difficulties it often has in obtaining financial data
from its clients and the virtual immobility of its present equity
holdings. On its own IMDBI is giving an example by having its accounts
examined by independent auditors.



7.        Iran's entrepreneurial class engaged in industry is not yet large,
mainly consisting of former traders and landlords. More recently another
element has been added, consisting of Iranians in the 30-45 year age group,
mostly trained abroad.  D DBI does, and wishes to appeal to all and has
succeeded especially among the latter group. As in the case of development
finance companies in other countries, IMDBI has frequently been the first
point of contact in Iran for foreign investors, a feature leading at times
to joint operations.
Operations
8.        The significant features in IMDBI's operations in the past few years,
including the use of Managed Funds, are the large expansion and the sizeable
foreign exchange component of its business, the growing proportion taken up
by projects promoted by IMDBI 1/ and substantial equity investments. These
operations are detailed in Table A-8 and highlighted below (in Rls. million):
Of which              Of which               Of which
Promotions   Commit-   Foreign    Disburse-    Equity

1964/65      1.,127         -        1,088        234     1,002          46
1965/66      2,438        20.1       1,707       545      1,097         252
1966/67      2,213        28.9       2,279      1,254     1,457         193
1967/68      .,362        52.7       1,885       522      1,927         288
(first 11
months)
9.        In the three years ending March 20, 1967, IMDBI has contributed
about three times as much to private industrial investment as the country's
other industrial financing institutions taken together.   (They are reviewed
in Annex C). For the five-and-a-half year Third Plan, which ended on March
20, 1968, IMDBI's contribution to private industrial investment has been
estimated in the range between 12-14, of the Plan total.  Also, as industry
in Iran is becoming more complex, IMDBI has been taking on more capital-
intensive and larger projects with a high import component than in the past;
as a result, iLndividual transactions involving over Rls.75 million (US$ 1
million equivalent) accounted for nearly 70% of total commitments in
1965/66 and 1966/67, and the use of foreign exchange resources has increased
rapidly.
10.       Promotions.  IMDBI considers the promotion of new projects as one
of its major contributions to Iran's industry and has devoted considerable
effort to it, practically ever since the present Managing Director took office In
December 1963.. IMDBI has promoted projects for a combination of reasons. Under
favorable economic conditions, the number of opportunities for large and complex
investmeents developed faster than the number of private entrepreneurs willing
1/ See also paragraph 39 of Annex A.



and able to take advantage of them 1/.   By taking up some of these opportunities
itself, IMDBI increased its operations thus justifying continued Government
contributions to its resources and broadening its chances for further earnings;
furthermore, securities in promoted projects were created which, though owned
initially by IMDBI and its partners, could eventually be traded on the stock
market.
11.       Among the seven promoted projects approved through the end of 1966/67,
the emphasis was on traditional industries including three new sugar plants and
a cement plan project. More recently, the focus of projects which IYDBI is
promoting has been on more sophisticated manufacturing activities appearing in
Iran for the first time which involve foreign partners or management arrange-
ments, e.g. in Qazvin Glass, Ahwaz Machine Tools and Ahwaz rolling mill. WIDBI
has been aggressive, but has selected the promoted projects only after con-
siderable examination for their prospects and often spent from two tc three
years on preparatory study and arrangements. The eleven promoted prcjects
approved by January 20, 1968, and listed in Table A-10 2/cover cement, sugar,
steel, glass, machine tools, shipping and diesel engines. Only the three
sugar mills are producing at present. It is as yet too soon to assess whether
all the promoted projects will do well when they are operating though there is
no evidence so far that IIDBI's judgment has not been sound.   There is a questio
whether all promoted projects would be viable without substantial protection
from imports, as for instance the sugar plants, or others which may riot, at
first, have appropriate economies of scale. In any event, INDBI has shouldered
a substantial responsibility for the promoted projects. They have laid a heavy
claim on the (energies and time of IMDBI's top management; furthermore, if these
projects do not turn out as expected IMDBI will suffer substantial losses.
12.       INDBI prefers to hold sizeable blocks of shares (from 30 to 75%) and
to hold control, together with other institutional investors, in these projects
until the time the projects are well established 3/.   DMBI contributes to the
management of promoted projects through representation on their boards, an
activity entailing considerable work and responsibility for the IMDBI nominee.
Except temporarily in the shipping company, IIDBI has not, as a matter of policy-
provided a managing director. In fact, a great deal of effort, during the
roughly two years needed on average to put a promoted project together, is
devoted to the search for a suitable manager.
13.       Work on a number of promoted projects began about two years ago, and
processing periods of about that length account for the high percentage of
promotion approvals in 1967/68.  As indicated in paragraph 8, IMDBI's work on
promotions did not affect, however, processing and approvals of clients'
projects whic:h amounted to Rls.4.7 billion in the past full three years shown.
1/ Some entrepreneurs of this type., however, do exist in Iran; they are found
in recently opened enterpriseis assembling automobiles and in a variety of
engineering industries.
2/ At the end of 1966/67, commitment with IMDBI's own funds to promoted
projects amounted to nearly 12% of IMDBI's total commitment of this type;
this percentage will on IMDBI's business forecast rise to roughly 20% by
the end of 1969/70
3/ See also paragraph 39 of Annex A.



14.       Managed Funds.  The scale of operations shown in paragraph 8 could
not have been accomplished without the help of the Governmant Funds managed
by IMDBI. These consist of Rls.1,300 million of a loan portfolio transferred
from two Goveznment banks, Rls.250 million of Plan Organization Funds for
lending, and a Rls.900 million Equity Fund for equity investments.   IMDBI
treats the Managed Funds with the same care as its own. Management fees do
not constitutet a major source of IMDBI's income (roughly 10% of 1966/67 gross
income).  However, the availability of the Funds has given IMDBI the opport-
unity to operate on the scale it has. The Funds have also enabled IMDBI to
make in eight cases larger commitments than the limits it has set itself on
commitments with its own funds 1/. Of total loans and equity investments
outstanding on June 21, 1967, 29% and 47% respectively were contributed by
Managed Funds. Equity investments made with the Equity Fund are in the name
and at the risk of the Plan Organization, but IMDBI controls them. The
Managed Funds are further discussed in Annex D.
15.       Location.  All of fvDBIIs promoted projects are at a distance from
the capital; they have thus served the Government's developmental aim of
dispersing industry throughout the country and of reducing the concentration
of IMDBI's own portfolio around Tehran. Nevertheless, IMDBI's activities,
like most of Iran's industry, continue to cluster around Tehran, where most of
the country's power and other facilities are located. (See Table A-7). Most
of Iran's more forward-looking entrepreneurs are resident in Tehran, among
them those who have sponsored industries new to Iran, such as metal processing,
chemicals, transport equipment, appliances, etc. with which IMDBI is principally
associated. (The same type of IMDBI client has also attracted foreign
investors who are now participating in about 25% of IMDBI's client enterprises).
Financial Evaluation
16.       IMDBI's financial results are described in paragraphs 4.-46 of Annex
A and detailed in Tables A-l1 and A-12.   INDBI's assets grew by 33% in 1966/67;
this growth is due to the more than doubling of outstanding foreign exchange
loans, accentuating the trend recorded in the last appraisal report (DB-30a).
The ratio of all long-term debt to net worth was 3.8 on March 20, 1967. At the
same date, current liabilities exceeded current assets by Rls.294 million.
However, IMDBI had enough cash balances derived from the Managed Funds which
IMDBI can use to meet its obligations. IMDBI's auditors hold the same view on
these two points.  IMDBI's current position at the end of 1966/67 cannot thus
be considered unsatisfactory.
17.       IMDBI's industrial portfolio as shown in Table A-6 is diversified.
1/ Total commitments to a single enterprise not to exceed 15% of net worth
and the Government advance;  total equity investment in a single enter-
prise not to exceed 10% of net worth;   and total commitments of IMDBI
to invest (at cost) in clients' share capital not to exceed Rls.930
million, the equivalent on March 20, 1966 of net worth and one-half of
the Government advance.



- 6 -
The largest sector (metal products) accounts for about 13%, followed by trans-
port equipment (12%) and sugar (10%). On June 20, 1967, this portfolio amounted
to over Rls.3. 3 billion. Within this total, IMDBI's equity portfolio of
Rls.345 million is still unseasoned since practically none of the enterprises
has been producing for an appreciable length of time 1/. Only two of the 12
ordinary share investments have paid dividends. One investment seems to be a
white elephant (the warehouse) and another, doubtful (the Pak Dairy), together
accounting for about 6% of IMDBI's equity portfolio.  INDBI's loan portfolio,
though it also has shortcomings, appears generally good. Reflecting the often
irregular repayrment habits of its clients, there are, however, 21 enterprises
with arrears overthree months totaling Rls.123 million on outstanding loans
amounts of Rls.299 million, i.e. nearLy 10O% of IMDBI's own portfolio, including
outstanding loans of Rls.133 million on which only interest is delinquent.
The delinquents include a variety of industries with some concentration in
various food-processing lines.  Roughly one-half of all the outstanding loans
in arrears beyond three months were contracted by borrowers whom IMDBI considers
as able to pay. The others are in various degrees of difficulties including
two loans (Rls.7 million) on which IMDBI has started litigation for recovery.
It also has talcen over the management of three enterprises (leather, sausage
and fruit juice) accounting for loans of Rls.59 million; one of them with a
loan of Rls.21 million may have problems in ever becoming viable, but IMDBI's
position appears well secured.
18.       Gross income rose by 34.4% in 1965/66 and by 22.5% in 1966/67.  The
lesser increase in the later year was due largely to lower agency fee collec-
tions which were particularly high in 1965/66. Furthermore, net profits were
affected because the average spread on borrowed funds declined by 0.8% to
4.4% in 1966/67 due to the increased use of more expensive foreign exchange
loans. Still, IMDBI was making an attractive 14.3% (after tax) on net worth.
The table belowi, which includes also preliminary data for 1967/68 based on
IMDBIs 11 month performance, gives income and expenses as percentages of
average total assets (exclusive of Managed Funds). It shows the depressing
effect of the increased use of costly borrowings on IMDBI's profits before
tax, despite the lowering of the relative weight of administrative expenses:
1964/65    1965/66    1966/67    1967/68(prel)

investments                   7.0        7.3        7.5       8.0

provisions                    5.2        5.2        4.4        4.2
1/ Eight enterprises accounting for :Rls. 105 million of IMDBI's holdings
are still under construction and there is no evidence at this time
indicating values lower than the purchase price.

19.       At the end of 1966/67, reserves, including provisions for losses
amounted to Ri.s.213 million, equalling 6.7% of IMDBI's own portfolio.  Though
6% (Rls.21 million) of IMDBI's equity and 10% (Rls.299 million) of its loan
portfolio were not free of trouble at about that time, reserves of the
indicated size, together with the soumd security backing taken by IMD:BI 1/,
appeared to be sufficiant. It follows that the book value of Rls.l,223 of
INDBI's share, at the end of 1966/67,, did not overstate the worth of the
comparn 2/e
1/ 1.5 to two times the value of the commitment to an enterprise plus
personal guarantees from the sponsors.
2/ After IMDBI had completed a 50% share capital increase in February
1968, INDBI's shares were being traded at Rls.l,050 on Tehran's
new stock exchange.

II.  IMDBI - ORGANIZATION AND PRACTICES
20.       Board. The Board has developed over the years into a cohesive
group.  Being a member has become a matter of prestige in Iran. The foreign
directors have helped resolve project issues involving investors from their
respective countries.
21.       Management and Staff.  Mr. Kheradjou, the Managing Director, has
been the most important influence in IMDBI's recent evolution. IMDBI is a
compact organization which he guides firmly.  Mr. Kheradjou has given J'DBI
strong impetus in its quest for business. In managing IMDBI, he is assisted
by his deputy, Dr. Amini, who has considerable experience in running manu-
facturing companies and by the Assistant Managing Director, Dr. Mahdavi, who
is especially responsible for IMDBI's work on promotions and for market,
analysis. The management group, as presently constituted, is very capable
and works harmoniously together.
22.       The organization draws also considerable strength from the personal
capabilities and drive of the managers of the Economics, Project and End-Use
Departments respectively. Morale of the staff, which has until recently been
working in cramped conditions 1/, is high.
23.       Appraisals   IMDBI's appraisals are thorough, but at times needing
more appreciation of technological developments in the outside world. There
is also a tendency, in a number of instances, to rely on government protection.
The presentation of market forecasts or the actual market research in regard
to new or more complex industrial products is mostly made by three over-
burdened IMDBI staff members rather than by the clients themselves.  Most of
the projects, i.e. about 80%, are processed within five months.
24.       ]?roject Supervision.  Although the Loans Supervision Department
has been able to perform with some degree of effectiveness, it has for some
time been seriously short of staff. This is an important weakness in v-iew
of the irregular habits of some clients in meeting their obligations to
IMDBI, and becautse of the need to overcome the frequent reluctance of enter-
prises to furnish information requeste(d by IMDBI. To help offset the Loan
Supervision Department's staff shortage, IMDBI has recently recruited three
additional employees. Even so, IMDBI's project supervision will need more
time to become effective through a more intensive assessment of delinquent
clients and a more intensive use of legal sanctions.
25.       Generally, IMDBI is an efficient outfit due to the capable people
at the top and middle levels of staff, and the prevailing esprit de corps.
But it has not mluch excess reserve in manpower to take on significant and
time-consuming eLdditional involvements, especially if they should concern
managing the affairs of client companies.
1/ IMDBI moved in September 1967 to its own modern building.

III. THIE OUTLOOK
The Setting
26.       Iran's oil revenues are likely to amount to about US$810 million
in 1967/68 following their unexpected rise resulting from last June's Middle
East crisis.  Iran has strong indications that oil revenues, the main financial
source for development activities, will also grow in the future. Irants Fourth
Five-Year Plan (March 1968 - March 1973) has recently been promulgated. Its
targets provide for gross investment in industry in the five-year period of
Rls.207 billion of which about Rls.120 billion in the private secttir. This
would imply an annual rate of private investment of Rls.24 billion as against
the estimated annual rate of nearly Rls.20 billion in the current year. I1vIDBI
estimates that during the coming five years it will at least retain, and
possibly very slightly better, its Third-Plan share of investments in private
industry.
27.       In view of Tran's good prospects for continued high foreign exchange
earnings, the stimulating effect for private industry from the likely large
public sector investments, the good response of many Iranian entrepreneurs to
opportunities, and because of on the whole reasonable economic and credit
management by the Government, the targets for private investment appear
practicable. The foregoing factors have already considerable momentum. If
continued, and with political stability at home, industry should operate
under favorable conditions during the next Plan.  However, chances for a
slow-down in the economy cannot be ruled out, especially if there were events
in the region which might curtail Iranian oil shipments. Moreover, in the
seventies the pinch in obtaining a sufficient number of good managers may
become more severe. On balance, however, the outlook is favorable for the
next few years.
Business Forecast and Resources Needed
28.       The table on page 10 shows INDBI1s estimates of approvals and
commitments (incLuding Managed Funds) for 1968/69 and the following year,
including their impact on IMDBIIs resource position. The estimates are
compared with preliminary figures for 1967/68s* The time-table for
nearly all of the promotion projects approved in 1967/63 j (which are
also expected to need substantial amounts of foreign exchange) call for their
commitment in 1968/69, a year, as further detailed in Annex E which is expected
to result in a substantial increase of new approvals.
j Promotions accounted in rial terms for nearly 116% of total approvals
in 1967/68.

-1.1-
The effect of the slippage of commitments of projects approved in 1967/68, and
sizeable new approvals in 1968/69, is expected to result in a hump in overall
and in foreign Exchange commitments in the latter fiscal year. Taking into
account the economic and general business outlook and IMDBIts aggressive attituda
towards mobilizing business, IMDBI has good prospects to carry out a substan-
tially larger business volume than in the recent past. However, IMDBI's
forecasts depend in an important measure on the realization of a few large
projects which IMDBI is promoting; a delay in these projects would affect the
business volume forecast up to March 1970. But over the two-year period, the
projections do not seem unreasonable and are therefore used in this appraisal.
29.       To make commitments of about Rls.7.8 billion in the two-year period
ending March 20, 1970, IMDBI needs, as the foregoing table shows, in addition
to likely available resources nearly another Rls.5.9 billion, including about
Us$4o million (Els.3 million) in foreign exchange. IDBI has requested the
Plan Organizaticn to make during the Fourth Five-Year Plan additional rial
loans for a total of Rls.6.5 billion to meet IMDBI's resource shortfall vis-a-
vis estimated financing needs for projects' local currency costs. The Plan
Organization has not yet made a final clecision on this request, both as to
amounts and the phasing of such loans, but has advised IMDBI that it would
meet IMDBI's uncovered needs for rials during the next Plan.
30.       Rials are nowadays convertible into foreign exchange and IMDBIE
could thus meet its foreign currency needs by such conversions, though at the
expense of its rial resources, At present, IMDBIts prospects are uncertain
regarding substantial rial contributions in addition to those already expected
from the Government or, because of the rudimentary capital market, from other
sources in the country. Iran, as in the past, expects a resource gap in
carrying out its Fourth Plan and the Government is therefore seeking foreign
credits to bridge it. Currently the Government steers the bulk of credits
from bilateral sources to projects in infrastructure and in public sector
industry. In view of this, and of its existing connections, IMDBI, withl the
Governmentts endorsement, therefore approached again the IBRD for meeting a
major part of its foreign exchange needs during the two years ending March 20,
1970.
Future Financial Results
31.       Projected cash flow, balance, sheets and income statements are set
forth in Annexes F, G, and H g/ IMDBI's spread'on borrowed funds is slowly
declining from 4.5 percent in'1966/67 to an expected 3.1 percent in 1969/70
v/ They also include projections for 1967/68, given to the appraisal mission
last year. The preliminary actual' results, referred to in the main hody
of the report and in Annex A are slightly better than those projected
earlier for 1967/68.



- 12 -
because of a fractional increase in the cost of Plan Organization funds and
the increase in the use of higher cost foreign exchange resources. (See
Annex H 1/).  In view, however, of increased leverage, and the declining per-
centage of administrative expenses (as a proportion of average total as<ets),
IMDBI s return from operations (pre-tax and before provisions) remains at
an attractive level.

Although profit in relation to equity fell, in 1967/68, due to an increase in
share capital, a new tax law 2/ helped increase actual profits over that of
the previous year.  Because of the new law, which increased withhoLding pro-
visions, and in order to make its shares more attractive when traded in the
future, IMDBI proposes to raise its dividends from 8% to 10%, giving share-
holders actual receipts of approximately 8%o versus 712%. This increase will
result in a payout ratio of 49% in 1967/68 and of h5% in 1969/70. Thus reserves
including provisions 3/ would nearly double to Rls.421 million on March 20,
1970, and would amount to 5.5% of IDBI's industrial portfolio of Rls.7 689
million projected for that date. In all the circumstances, this appears
adequate.  The total equity cushion would amount to 1i.8% of the industrial
portfolio, even without taking into aceount the proposal to raise share capital
by Rls.240 million within the next two years.
32.       IMDBI has recently increased its share capital by a rights issue of
one for two. INDBI thus obtained Rls.240 million and raised its capitaL to
Rls.720 million.  With this share increase and the forecast business, IMIDBI's
capital structure projected for March 20 in the indicated years is as follows
(in rials million):
1/ This takes into account the present IERD standard interest rate of 6-i%
per annum and its commitment charge, of 3A4 of 13%.
2/ Under the new tax law IMDBI has an effective tax rate of 13.0 percent in
1967/68 versus 17.7 percent in 1966/67. The position improves further
thereafter.
3/ IMDBI is making provisions for bad debts at around 3% of its loan portfolio
and increasing its provision for share losses, which was first created in
1966/67, by Rls.h-6 million each year. These provisions do not represent
estimates of losses arising from particular risks or set-asides for
specific purposes0

On this basis, ibhe 1971 ratio of total long-term debt (including the Government
Advance) to net worth would be nearly 8.3:1. The present debt limitation under
Loan 459-IRN permits IMDBI to borrow long-term four times an "equity" base con-
sisting of the sum of net worth, excluding flMDBI's provisions for specific
purposes, and the outstanding Government Advance (which is, therefore, not
counted as debt). Within this limit, :EMDBI could conduct its projected business
practically until March 20, 1970, when the ratio would reach 4.09:1. Con-
sidering this twqo-year leeway, IMDBI's present borrowing limit need not be
relaxed at this time. Consideration needs, however, to be given to the fact
that the Govermnent Advance is becoming due for repayment while IBRD loans to
IMDBI are still outstanding. Prudent security for the IBRD requires that only
those portions of the Government Advance which mature after IBRD loans are
repaid should be considered as "equity"'; the amounts maturing earlier should
be included in "debt". Furthernore, to the extent that IMDBI's provisions do
not represent estimates of losses arising from particular risks or set-asides
for specific purposes, they should also form part of "equity". Wdith these
adjustments in the definition of "debt" and of "equity", and keeping in mind
that INDBI1s present debt limitation should in essence be maintained, an appro-
priate debt:equity ratio would be 4.5!:1 1/. This ratio would allow IMDBI to
borrow only fractionally more, i.e. Rls.182 million, than the total of Rls.6.1
billion which I]'DBI would be able to borrow under its present debt limitation.
The borrowing albility of IMDBI would, however, be considerably enhanced when,
as it proposes to do, it raises its share capital again by Rls.240 million
within the next two years.
U/ This takes into account that IMDBI loans with IBRD funds have maxiaum
terms of 11 years; IMDBIVs terms in turn determine the life of the IBRD
loan to INIBI.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
33.       IMDBI has now reached a stage in its development in which private
industry in Iran would be the poorer without it. The caliber of its manage-
ment and professional staff work compares favorably with those of other
experienced development finance companies assisted by the World Bank Group.
IMDBI has established harmonious relations with the authorities, which look
for the institution's advice, and has attracted domestic and foreign entre-
preneurs into industrial investments in Iran, often taking the lead itself
by promotional activities. Being a leader in equity investments, it has helped
fill the gap arising from the lack of, a developed capital market. Its efforts
to spread modern business practices and to improve the institutional environ-
ment have had beneficial influence on Iran's expanding industry.
34.       IMDBI's principal weakness in the past few years has been project
supervision due to an acute staff shortage in the department concerned. Better
project supervision might mitigate the effects of lax payment habits of some
IMDBI clients which are showing up in arrears in IMDBI's portfolio. However,
the portfolio is generally of good quality. Staff additions recently made,
should help overcome some of IMDBI's shortcomings in project supervision work,
and also help to improve appraisals.  Looking to the future, IDDBI would have
to protect itself against having its principal officers drawn overly into
major promotional tasks and into the management of clients, especially of
promoted companies. INDBI would also have to analyse more closely the market
for its client's products keeping in mind more the long-range economics and
competitiveness of new industrial installations, and relying less on govern-
mental protection.
35.       IMDBI will remain active in promoting new projects, but the present
high percentage of IMDBI's business representing such activity will probably
not rise over the next few years. This expectation is based on the grcwing
private entrepreneurship in Iran and the increasing difficulties in finding
qualified managers in the country (until such time as the industrial structure
produces more of them) who are not already connected by family ties with
enterprises. Altogether, IMDBI is likely to have considerable weight in
Iran's future industrial development due to both expected favorable economic
circumstances and its own outgoing attitude towards mobilizing business.
Recommendations
36.       In view of its good operational record and its favorable business
prospects, IMDBI continues to qualify for IBRD support. However, it would be
prudent for the Bank to lend only the amount required for a year or so. IMDBI"
estimate for 1968/69 is somewhat below US$25 million. However, this sum is
heavily dependent on the timely realization of a few large projects and could
indeed be stretched over two years because IMDBI could draw on its rial
resources which are convertible, and should seek foreign exchange from other
sources. In the circumstances, a loan of US$25 million would be appropriate.



- 15 -
37.       The terms of a fresh loan to IMDBI should be generally those
applied to recent loans to development finance companies. The terms should
differ from the existing arrangements with IMDBI in the following principal
respect. The Jimitation on IMDBI borrowings contained in the agreement for
Loan 459-IRN should be reformulated to allow IMDBI to incur long-term debt
up to 4.5 times a borrowing base consisting of IMDBI's net worth and only
those parts of the Government Advance falling due after any IBRD loans to
IMDBI are repaid. The maturities on tshe Government Advance falling due
earlier should be included in debt. This reformulation would allow IMDBI to
borrow only fractionally more than the amounts allowed under the existing debt
limitation arrangement with IBRD.
38.       INDB:r's "free limit" on lending with IERD funds is at present
US$750,ooo. IrnL recognition of T1IDBIPs continuing satisfactory perforxmance
an increase in IMDBI's present limit to Us$1 million is recommended. This
would still require an estimated 8 projects involving around US$15 milLion
to come to the Bank for prior approval, about the same number as have been
presented to the Bank in the past 2 years.
39.       If its business forecast is realized, IMDBI will in its next fiscal
year reach its ceiling of Rls.930 million on aggregate commitments in the form
of equity investments with its own funds.   IDBI has indicated that it would
like to raise this limit to Rls.1.3 billion, i.e. a figure about 30% higher
than it net worth estimated for March 1968.  The Bank has advised IMDBI that
at this time the limit should not exceed net worth but has indicated its
willingness to IMDBI to review the matter, when IMDBI's operations approach
that limit, in the light of (a) the need for financial prudence, (b) the
progress made in sales from its share portfolio, in attracting other partners
into projects calling for share investments by it and in making arrangements
for the proposed share capital increase of Rls.240 million, and (c) other
relevant factors,
40.       The Bank's end-use inspections of IMDBI should be more frequent,
possibly twice a year.

DESCRIPTION OF TBE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPKENT BANK OF IRAN
I.  T03 COMPANY
1.        The Industrial and 1Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI)
was established in October 1959 following two years of preparation by
the Iranian Authorities and two foreign sponsors, Chase International]
and Lazard Freres. The IBRD acted, by invitation, as an advisor to
the parties during that period.
2.        Purpose and Powers.  The primary objective of INDBI is the
stimulation of private industrial development within Iran. Its
Memorandum of Association states that it is "to develop, encourage and
stimulate private industrial, productive, mining and transportation
enterprises in Iran" and to encourage, spmsor and facilitate the part-
icipation of domestic and foreign private capital in such enterprises.
Emphasis is also given in the Memorandum of Association to the pro-
motion and development of the capital market.
3. IMDBI may make long and medium term loans, invest in equity capital,
sponsor and underwrite new issues of securities and guarantee loans and
commitments of other investors. It may make its funds available for
reinvestment through sales from its own portfolio. It is designed to
offer advice and guidance to Iranian industry on technical, financial,
managerial andi administrative matters.  IIDBI may not, however, engage
in purely comnercial banking activities.
Resources
4.        Share Capital and Reserves.  IMBI's original share capital
was Rls 400 million. It was increased to Rls 480 million (us$6.3 million)
by a 20% stock dividend in October 1965. The paid-in share capital,],egal and
general reserves and undistributed profits at June 20, 1967, totaled Rls.611
million. Another share increase, referred to in paragraph 16 has just been
completed   increasing net worth to Rls.855 million at February 20, 1'368.
5.        Government Advance. At the time of DIDBI's formation, the
Government advanced Rls 600 million (US$7.9 million) to IiYDBI for 30
years with a grace period of 15 years, interest free, subordinated to
all debt and ranking pari pas'-1 with the share capital in liquidation.
6.        First Plan Organization Loan of Rls.750 million signed on
January 12, 196h, is received in a series of payments, each for the term
of 15 years including five years grace. Under the disbursement terms,
IMDBI has to date received Rls.550 million and the balance may be drawn,
as required, during 1967/68 but will, in any event, be paid to IMDBI in
early 1968/69. IMDBI lends the funds at its prevailing interest rate,
retains 312% and pays the balanceto the Plan Organization,



ANNEX A
Page 2
7.        Second Plan Or anization Loan of Rls.500 million, signed January 4,
1966, is aTsofor a tem of 15 years including 5 years grace. IMDBI may draw
up to Rls.217 million, as required, during 1967/68; the balance of Rls.500
million is to be paid into IMDBI during 1968/69. The amount received from
the Plan Organization shall be repaid in 10 equal annual amounts after 5 years
grace. The funds are to be relent at IMOBIts prevailing rate with IINDBI
retaining 3% of outstanding loans and paying the balance to the Plan Organization.
Both the first and the second Plan Organization loans are subordinated to any
loan guaranteed by the Government.
8.        The AI-D Loan - Of US.t5.2 milLion, made November 19, 1959, by the
predecessor U.S. Development Loan Fund was in 1962 tied to U.S. procurement.
In October 1966,. after US$3.5 milLion had been committed, the balance was
cancelled as utJlization proved difficult.
9.        IBRD Loans - The first Bank loan, signed November 23, 1959, is
for US$5.2 millUion. The second Bank loan, signed July 12, 1965, is for
US$10 million. Both loans have been fuLly committed. The third Bank
loan, signed July 26, 1966, is for US$25 million and of this $9.0 remained
uncommitted at September 30, 1967.
10.       Managed Loans - 1.4hen INDBI was established, the Government
transferred to it under an Agency Agreement Rls 1,400 million (US$18.5
million) portfolio of loans to private industry made by the Industrial
Credit Bank (of the Plan Organization) and by Bank Melli of Iran. INCI
receives a fee of 3% on loans outstanding and not in default over 3 months.
It is obligatory upon INIDBI to relend repayments -pro rata vith their own
funds. Repayments to Government shall be over a 7-year period commencing
June, 1968, and made out of principal collections from sub-borrowT.ers.
IMDBI carries no risk in the administration of this portfolio and subse-
quent reinvestment of repayments.
11.       Under a second Agency Agreement signed January 3, 1966, the
Plan Organizetion has put at the disposal of DIDBI a sum of Rls 250
million (US$3.3 million) for lending to industries. The fund had been paid
in tvwo installments Rls 150 million and Rls 100 million by the end of
1966/67.  The fumds are to be repaid after 10 years, as the principals of
loans are repaicd by the borrouers to IMvBI.  LuDBI receives a fee of 3%
per annum on the outstanding loans out of interest collections. Also in
this case it carries no risk on the use of these funds.
12.       The Equity Fund of Rls 900 million uas established on
June 19, 1964. IMDBI,in this case, administers the investment of Plan
Organization resources in the equity capital of private industry. INDEI
receives the funds for each investment on approval by the Plan Organization.
IMIBI holds Fwnd shares in the name of the Government, but exercises all
rights and duties as if a shareholder.



ANNEX A
Page 3
13.       IMDBI receives a fee of lu; of total investments made, payable
from dividenLds received and/or capital gains reali-ed. So far no fees haer
been received as the portfolio has yet to earn dividends and no sales have
been made. IMiDBI is expected to sell Fund holdings to private investors
as opportunities arise and return proceeds to the Plan Organi ation.. From
ISDBI's standpoint, the Fund has a particular advantage in being a ready
source of equity capital for the projects it sponsors.
14.       Total resources, Own and Vianaged, are summarized in Table A-1.
Managed Funds are not debts of IIMDBI.
15.       Borroling LimitationO  Under the third IBRD Loan Agreement, signed
on July 26, 1966, IMDBI's borrowing is limited to four times the net
v7orth plus the outstanding amount of the Government Advance. Under this
arrangement, the debt/equity ratio iwas 1.4 to 1 as of the end of fiscal
1966/67.
Organization
16.       0wne4prs .  'oihen I1\DBI was formed, its capital was divided into
Class A shares6" of the total and available to Iranians only, and 40h
Class B shares allotted to foreign financial institutions and corporations.
Both classes of shares have the same rights. Toiards the end of 1965 with
the consent of the foreign shareholders, these proportions ivere changed,
noiw IMDBI's capital consists of 384,000 Class-A shares, or 80% of the total,
and 96,000 Class B shares detailed in Table A-2. There are over 2,000
registered Iranian o-ners of Class A shares, making IiMDBI by far the most
w.dely held company in Iran. At the General Assembly in June, 1966, a 50%
increase in the capital to Rls 720 million was authorized and IMDBI has
implemented this resolution by means of a righte issue of one share for
every two held which operation was completed in January 1968_ - It is
INDBI's policy that foreign shareholders continue to holi 20% of the
increased capital.
17.       Board of Directors.  AU potTers and responsibilities are vested
in IMDBI's 15-member Board (Table A-3).  The Chairman is Mr. Sherif Emami,
former Prime Minister and present President of the Senate. Including the
Chairman, eleven Board members rep'resent "All shareholders and four the "B"
shareholders. Board meetings are convened three to four times a year. The-
Iranian directors meet informally about once a month for briefing by manage-
ment and to reviewr progress reports.
18.       During the time that the Government Advance is outstandingp the
Government is entitled to appoint an Observer, who may attend, without vote,
meetings of the Board and Executive Committee. The present Government
Observer is Dr. Mohammed Yeganeh, a Deputy Minister in the 11Iinistry of Economy.
19.       Executive Committee.  The E.:ecutive Committee consists of three
Iranian directors, including the Board Chairman and the Mianaging Director,
and two Class "B" directors who, residing abroad, have given general proxies
to the Managing Director and another member of the Board r-hen not them-
selves attending meetings.



ANNEX A
Page 4
20.       The Executive Committee's main function is to review and approve
all loans and in it, by Board authority, repose full powers for this
purpose. The Committee meets about twice a month and, when considering
loan applications, always seeks the cabled concurrence of the two non-
resident directors. It operates in the same manner   for equity investments.
21.       Management.  Mr. A. Gasem Kheradjou, a former officer of the
IBRD/IFC, became Managing Director in December 1963. Dr. Reza Amin,
an engineer, who was on IMDBI's staff in 1959-60 (later serving as
IMDBI's Technical Advisor while managing the Esfahan Cement Company)
became Deputy Managing Director in September, 1964. Dr. Fereydoun lvlahdavi,
who as an economist also heads the Economics Department, is Assistant;
Managing Director.
22.       Staff.  After a series of internal reorganizations ending in
1965, there are now six departments (Chart A-4). Projects Department,
which is responsible for both technical and financial appraisal, is
managed by Mr. Shoraka. The Loans Supervision Department, headed by
Mr. Iraj Hedayat, takes over responsibility from the time a loan or in-
vestment is signed. A Technical Advisor, Mr. Arefpour, and a Financial
Advisor, iMlr. R.Shahviri, have no departmental responsibility, although the
latter is principally engaged in loan supervision functions.
23.       The Economics Department, under Dr. Mahdavi, has as its prin-
cipal responsibilities market and economic studies in connection with
loan appraisals, and, more importantly, the staff work on promotions of
industrial projects. The other three departments are Treasury and Accounts,
Administration and Public Relations, Secretariat, and Legal. Since 106h,
I1IDBI's staff has been entirely Iranian. Total staff, excluding custodial
personnel, number 60, including 7 financial analysts, 7 engineers, 5
economists and 4 lawyers.
Procedures
24.       Project Appraisal   All incoming requests for financing are
screened by a Loans Committee consisting of management and department heads.
Only when an inquiry is accepted for appraisal is it considered a formal
application. The Projects Department thereupon assigns a team consisting
of a technical and financial man, while the Economics Department separately
assigns an economist.
25.       Both Departments maintain close liaison and the economic and
technical reviews, prepared separately, are submitted to the Loans Com-
mittee before the financial appriisal is written. Thus, the financiail
analyst builds his appraisal on economic, marketing and technical data
awhich are knowm and subscribed to by senior management. Before ultimate
submission to the Executive Committee, the final appraisal is reviewed
by the Loans Committee.  At this point around lO4' of the projects pro-
posed have been rejected in recent years as compared to about 45% in
IMDBI1s earlier years.  The Managing Director heads the Loan Committee
and makes the presentation to the Executive Committee, which passes on
all investment recommendations on the Board's behalf.



ANNEX A
Page 5
26.       Project Supervision. Like the Projects Department, the Loans
Supervision Department, established in December, 1965, is functioning on
a team basis. Each project is assigned to a category calling variably
from one to four plant visits per year by members of the Department.
Projects newLy in production or having operating difficulties receive
the greatest attention. Another responsibility is to feed back actuial
project costs and results to be compared with the original forecasts of
the Projects Department.
27.       Reiporting. In addition to the quarterly reports required by
IBRD, AID and the Plan Organization, IlMDBI issues regular quarterly
reports to its directors and shareholders. Management receives regular
reports of the financial and cash positions, defaults, projects under
review, etc.  In addition, IMDBI publishes a quarterly economic bulletin
which is fairly widely distributed in business, financial and Government
circles.
II. OPERATIONS
Lending Operations and Policies
28.       Size of Commitments. IMDBI's Board, in May 1965, adopted certain
investment guidelines. Among these was that IMDBI would not commit to
any single eziterprise an amount of its own funds in excess of 15% of its
paid-up capital, free reserves and the outstanding Government advance.
As of Februar-y 19, 1968, this would limit the commitment in any single enter-
prise to Rls 250 million (US$3.3 million). The minimum loan size is
Rls 5 million but, in fact, loans below Rls 10 million are granted only
in exceptional circumstances. By numbers, 41% of loans fall below Rls 15
million; by amount 4t3% are large loans of above Rls 75 million (Table A-5).
29.       Characteristics of Loans.  In the past IMDBI made a few wlorking
capital loans, but will now only lend for this purpose in connection with
loans for new or expansion projects. (Table A-5). The life of loans ranges
from 2 to 11 years, the weighted average being 6-1/2 years (Table A-5).
30.       Divrersification.  IMDBI's portfolio contains loans and in-
vestments over a diversified group of industries (Table A-6) with some
concentration on the newer industries in Iran, such as trucks and huses,
metal products, a variety of food processing plants and chemicals.
Industry is concentrated around Tehran and 71% of IMDBI's commitments
have been in that area, with another 13%0 around Isfahan, Iran's second
largest city (Table A-7}
31.       Interest Rates. Since 1963, IMDBI charges the same rate on all
loans, wihether from its own or managed funds, i.e., 7% plus a 1% service
charge per arnum. Commitment fee on undisbursed portions of loans has been
increased effective March 20, 1968, from 2% to 3/4% per annum from the
date of signature of the loan contract.



ANNEX A
Page--b
32.       Exchange, Risk and Security. IilDBI passes on to its borrowers
the exc-hange risks in respect of its foreign currency lcans. In all Is'mDBI
loans but three (where bank or parent comparny guarantees were obtained),
INDBI has insisted on a mortgage over the borrower's fixed assets, and also
obtains guarantees from the directors and major shareholders.
33.       Lendin Qperat ons. I1MBI had apDroved a total of 238 loams to
Rls.9.2 billion (US$122 mPillion) through to February 20, 1968, the current
Iranian half-year end. IDMBIss business volume dropped sharply during
the recession in the early sixties but since then, IMDBI's level of
operations have mounted rapidly, as shown below and detailed in Table A-8.

34.ArrearsPrincipal maturities and inte est receivable in arrears} over
thr-eemonThs at June 21, 1967, aggregate Rls. 165 million.l/ The principal
outstanding of loans in arrears amounts to Rls. 299 million, 9.9 of loan
portfolio. The principal outstanding of loans on which interest only is
in default equals 4.4% of portfolio leaving 5.S3 in relation to loans
where princ:ipal and interest, or principal only, is outstanding. Legal
action has been instituted in two cases involving loans of Rls. 4.2 million
and Ris. 2.5 million. Management has been assumed by Ii4DBI in three
perennial cases of default, loans outstanding amounting to Rls. 59 million.
Of these the break-even point has been crossed in two, but in the third
involving a loan of Rls. 21 million, prospects of profitable operation appear
bleak. Loans involving legal suits and where IMDBI is responsible for
management amounts to 2.8% of portfolio.
Loans from IBIR) Funds
35.       Of the US. 31 million the Bank had credited under their three
loans, US$26.5 million had: been disbursed as of Mrarch 31, 1768.
Commitment of Bank funds is illustrated in the following table (amounts
in US"P million):

Managed Loans
36.       As ofr June 20, 1967, of the 83 Government Loans totaling Rls. 1,400
million that were transferred to IMDBI in 1959, 58 totaling Rls. 613 million
had been fully repaid, 17 partly repaid to Rls. 301 million and 1 of His. 93
million had been returned to the Government as uncollectable. Of this port-
folio, 10 loans are in default over three months amounting to Rls. 183 million
but IMDBI carr:ies no risk.
Equity Investment Operations and Portfolio
37.       The guidelines regarding equity investment were adopted by IIDBI's
Board in M4ay 1965 and amended in September 1966: INDBI will not commit to any
single enterprise as equity an amount of its own funds in excess of 10% of its
paid up capita]L and free reserves 1/ equal to Rls. 106 million as of February 19,
1968, or make total equity investments with its own funds in excess of Rls. 930
million which correspond on March 21, 1966, to IMDBI's net worth (including
loss provision) and half the' Government Advance.
38.       As of February 19, 1968, IN)BI had made equity commitments in 21 pro-
jects amounting, to Rls. 722 million, of which Rls. 480 million had been paid in.
Table A-9 provides details of investments at June 20, 1967.   INDBI also received
approval from the Plan Organization to make 16 investments out of the Equity
Fund amounting to Rls. 633 million, of which Rls. 428 million has been paid.
Promotional Policy and Activities
39.       INDB]: is very active in promoting, sponsoring and organizing projects
through the various stages until they are producing. With a view to eventual
sale of its holdings to a wide group of buyers, IMDBI's policy is to maintain
controlling interest jointlylwith other institutional investors until the
project is solidly established. No significant sale has as yet been made. IMDBI
makes particuL-,r efforts in bringing in other institutional investors into the
promoted projec:ts' share capital. Commercial banks, pension funds and charitable
endowments have recently joined with IMDBI in a proposed paper project. IFC is
considering joint financing with INDBI in three projects: two actively, a
rolling mill, and diesel engines; the third, a viscose rayon plant, may take
longer.
Including sLch part of provisions which do not represent estimates of losses
arising from particular risks or set-asides for specific purposes.

40.       Two Loans to promoted projects were approved by the Executive Com-
mittee in 1965/66 for Rls 490 million equal to 20.1 percent of total approvals,
three in 1966/67 for Rls 638' million equal to 28.9 percent of total approvals,
and four duringr the first five months of the current financial year for Rls
1,385 million being 74.1 percent of total approvals. Particulars of approved
promoted projects through June 1967 are set out in Statement A-10.
Underwriting
41.       INDBI has not entered into-any underwriting or guarantee operations
thus far.
Other Activities
42.       Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange has recently been inaugurated.
Mr. Kheradjou is the Board Chairman and as an interim measure, Dr. Mahdavi,
IMDBI's Assistant Managing Director, is acting as Secretary until a permanent
incumbent is appointed. At this first stage only banks will be allowed to act
as authorized brokers and 13 banks have been so appointed. Under the new tax
laws, 15 percent of net orofits are exempt from tax upon registration with the
stock exchange, and IMDBI has had its shares registered with the exchange in
January 1968.
43.       Association of Accountants.  IMDBI, NIOC and several Iranian and
foreign auditors are making efforts to set up an Association of Accountants
in Iran which will have a professional code and serve to spread modern account-
ing standards throughout Iranian industry. This body will require registration
of all qualified accountants and eventually hold examinations. The Government
appears favorably disposed.
III. FINANCIAL RESULTS

ANNEX A
Page 10
During the year ended March 20, 1967, interest and charges on loans outstand-
ing amounted to Rls 270 million or 81% of gross income, 84% (Rls 273 million)
for the eleven monts to February 19, 1968. Fees earned from managed funds
amounted to Rls 26 million or 10%, falling to Rls 23 inillion or 7% during the
subsequent eleven months. Income from share investments of Rls 12 mil:Lion
contributed 4.59, which increased to 5.7% (Ris 18 million) in the following
eleven-month period.  The balance, during both the year to March 20, 1967 and
the next eleven months, was principally interest on temporary investments.
IMDBI earns betlween 521% and 6% on its short-term investments, consisting of
Bank deposits and Treasury bills; while previously both types were tax-free,
this applies, since March 21, 1967, only to the latter.   IMDBI has converted,
to the extent practical, the available cash balances into Treasury bil].s.
46.       Administrative expenses equalled 2.1% of average outstanding loan
and investment portfolio during 1966/67 compared with 2.3% the preceding year,
further falling to 1.6% in the eleven months to February 19, 1968.   Including
managed funds, administrative expenses in 1966/67 were 1.3% of average total
assets, 1.0% in the next eleven months.
Dividends, Reserves and Audit
47.       In addition to reserves and undistributed profits of Rls 107 million
at the end of 1966/67, there were provisions of Rls 101 million against losses
on loans and Rls 5 million against investment losses.   At February 19, 1968,
these were increased to Rls 13L million and Rls 9 million respectively. IMDBI
makes monthly appropriations to' the loss reserve amounting, during the year,
to 10% of gross income net of income from its short-term investments and manaaed
funds, because these two operations do not involve an IMDBI risk. At the end
of 1966/67 the loss reserve equalled 3.5% of outstanding portfolio, 3.2% at
February 19, 1968.
48.       Dividends have been increasecd annually starting with about 4% for the
17-month period ended March 20, 1961 and amounting to 8% in 1965/66 and 1966/67
each.  In both these years, less than half of net earnings were distributed as
dividends.
49.       As in earlier years, IMDBI's auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, certified
the 1966/67 balance sheet and income statement without qualification.

Some Observations on Industry in Iran
1.    EBccept for, the oil irdustry in the South, which is not covered here,
factory-type industry started in Iran in the early thirties when tlhe Government
took the lead in setting up a number of sugar and textile factories. Later
on, merchants took up the example mainly in textiles around Isfahan. World
War II interrupted industrial development. The post-war drive towards in-
dustrialization started during the second Seven-Year Plan in the mid fifties
when a massive Government-sponsored loan program, financed by the revaluation
profit made by Bank Melli Iran as a result of the devaluation of the rial,
led to the establishment of a series of new plJants by private entrepreneurs.
Not all of these plants were viable as was shown during the economic recession
which plagued Iran in the early sixties and which also held back industrial
investment.
2.     Investors confidence was revived about 4 years ago as a result of
growing political stability in the country, more forthcoming credit policies
of the Central Bank, and a general economic upturn stimulated also by rising
oil revenues. As a result of the industrial investments made in the fifties,
and in recent years, industry's importance in the national economy has been
boosted. In 1959/60, manufacturing arid mining accounted for somewhat over
9 percent of GNP, rising to nearly 12 percent in 1965/66. In the last 3-4
years, industrial, growth amounted to about 10 to 12 percent per annum compared
to the grcrth in GNP of 8 to 10 percent 1/.
3.     The Government itself is engaged in industry in areas which private
investment is unable to fill either due to the very large size of investment
required, or because the risk element acts as a disincentive to private in-
vestors, or because the economic importance of a project is such that Government
wishes to maintain control. While hitherto mainly operating textile, food
processing and mining enterprises, the public sector, largely financed by
East European credits, is now entering heavy industry, among them is a $290
million steel mill near Isfahan, a $15 million heavy engineering plant in
Tabriz, a $25 million petrochemical plant in Abadan, a $38 million machine-
tool plant in Arak. Also planned is a $53 million aluminium reduction plant
in association with Reynolds of America and the Pakistan Government.
4.     The private sector is actively encouraged.  Among the relevant measures
are exemptions from duties on capital goods import, protection against com-
petitive imports either through tariffs, or banning imports altogetherp Tax
exemptions are available for new ventures ranging between 5 percent and 100
percent of taxable income during the initial 5 years depending on natsre and
location of the enterprise; for instance with a view to dispersing industry
a new enterprise established over 120 hm. from Tehran, or 50 km. outside Isfahan
is completely exempt.

5.     Siince about a year or: two, with a wide variety of uncomplicated
consumer industries built up, industrial development has become more complex
and capital intensive, including new synthetic fiber, motor assembly and
chemical plants. IMDBI's investments in petrochemicals and metal processing
is a reflection of this trend. Foreign private investment has played a sub-
stantial part in recent industrial development. The law governing foreign
investments of guarantees, repatriation of profits and capital with few re-
strictions and fair compensation in the event of nationalization. With very
few exceptions, foreign companies have entered into partnership with Iranian
interests (including INDBI) to set up joint ventures. Under Government
policy, foreign financial control ismnot permitted, but managerial control
by foreign concerns has been accepted, Otherwise foreign investors are
entitled to the! same treatment as Iranian enterprises. Foreign companies
are particularly welcome in agricultural processing and export industries,
and those involving a transfer of technical know-how to Iran. Foreign invest-
ment has risen rapidly in recent year, namely from Rls.280 million in 1964-65
to Rls.808 million in 1965/66 and to Rls.938 million in 1966/67.
6.     Inhibiting factors to industrial growth are the preference for family
ownership with the often encountered aversion to antipathy outside equity
capital; smaller enterprises are often burdened with debt to non-institutional
sources, such as lenders in the bazarsi  and accounting procedures are frequently
poor. Although the Government sponsored programs which provide training in
various skills, industrial expansion has resulted in increasing and partly un-
fulfilled demands for trained workmen and particularly qualified management
personnel0 This aspect is likely to be the principal bottieneck in the future.

INDUSTRIAL FINA3NCING INSTITUTIONS
1.     Industrial Credit Bank (ICB)
A subsidiary of the Plan Organization set up originally as a
channel for medium size loans between Rls 0.5 million and Rls 5 million
but, more recently, ICB has been giving larger loans for larger industrial
projects in both the public and private sectors. ICB loans carry interest
at 7 1/2% per annum and are made for around five years. In 1966/67,
loans approved amounted to Rls 264 million against 268 million in the
previous year. ICB also makes equity investments, working capital loans
and guarantees.
2.     Industrial Guarantee Fund (IGF)
Established with AID funds, although supplemented by the Plan
Organization, this institution lencds for 5 year terms at 10%, or
guarantees small loans made by the private or Government banks. In
1966/67 Rls 546 million was approved compared with Rls 438 million in
1965/66. IC*;F was taken over in 1967 by the Bank Omran, which belongs
to the Pahlacvi Foundation administering the Shah's properties, trusts
and funds.
3.     Iranian Investment Corporation
Launched in 1966 by the memd)er companies of the Iranian Oil
Consortium with a sterling capital of Rls 420 million, its objective
is to stimulate medium size enterprises through equity assistance.  It
has initiated one project' essentially agricultural, and has a few others
under study.
NIOC Pension Fund
This mammoth fund disposes over large amounts and invests mainly
in areas of interest to the oil industry and in building loans for its
employees. The investment policy is dictated by the NIOC Board of
Directors with due regard to the Fumd's fiduciary nature. IMDBI has
associated the Fund in the equity capital of a sugar project and is
negotiating,with the Fund to become a source of rial funds to IfDBI
itself.. Certain tax issues have to be clarified before the Fund can
become more active as a financial institution for industry.
5.     Commercial Banks
Controlling 70% of Iran's commercial banking assets, the
Government owned Bank Melli dominates the scene. It undertakes some
medium term lending aimed primarily at permanent working capital.
Recently this Bank joined IMDBI with participation in the share capital
of a newly initiated shipping venture.

There are 21 Iranian banks ranging from medium to small size
engaged in commercial banking. Finance is also available through the
bazaar at inberest rates of 9% to 18%. Established industries generally
prefer to deal with the institutional banking sector.

INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPMMENT BANK OF IRAN
Managed Fund2
1.        IMDBI's resources stemming from the Managed Funds are detailed in
paragraphs 10-13 of Annex A. These funds have only been placed under
IMDBI's stewardship, but do not constitute IMDBI's debts and therefore do
not involve a risk for the institution. The relevant agreements between
the Government of Iran and flIDBI contain no provisions by which the Govern-
ment could premature amounts disbursed or transferred to IMDBI as IManaged
Funds. IMEBI has to, and does, pay the same care and attention to these
funds as if they would be their own. IMDBI's own assets of Rls. 3.2 bil-
lion 1/ were greatly augmented by those resulting from M41anaged Fund opera-
tions totaling Rls. 1.9 billion. Without the Managed Funds availabilities,
I4DBI would not have achieved its record in the size and number of loans
and share participations and its promotions.
2.        The Managed Funds and IMDBI's own funds are (with only one excep-
tion so far) always used together in IMDB'its lending operations.  'l4DBI's
concept, in considering a lending operation, is only the amount of the total
commitment, irrespective whether from IMDBI's or the Managed Funds. This
attitude is clearly visible at all levels; in the Loan Supervision Depart-
ment, for example, all statistics., loan by loan and aggregate presentations,
are kept in a combined form; and one loan agreement irrespective of the
source is executed.
3.        However, in order to help IMDBI to ascertain its own risk, a break-
down between own and Managed Funds is being used in INDBI's book-keeping.
On signing a loan the contribution to it from each source is determined.
This is done in the proportion of committed but undisbursed Managed Funds
to the remaining liquid assets held by IMDBI at that time. (In the past,
allocations to Managed Funds varied from 10 to 60 percent of individual com-
mitments. On June 20, 1967, about 21 percent of IMDBI's total outstanding
loans came from Managed Funds.) From the time of commitment, operations are
separately recorded as to each source of funds. Cash however is co-mingled
in a single bank account for convenience. At March 20 and June 20, 1967,
IMDBI did not have any cash of its own and was on those dates borrowing from
the Managed Funds. The balance on the bank account is howsever liable to
rapid fluctuations depending upon'receipts from the Plan Organization and
repayments by sub-borrowers.  IM4DBI's monthly reporting to Bank lielli and
Industrial Credit Bank in relation to the portfolio transferred in 1959 con-
tains a note of their daily average cash balance on which they collect 1-1/2
percent per annum from IMDBI. IMDBI's auditors, Cooper & Lybrand, who have
studied the position find IMDBI to be in order and conforming to agreements
with the Government.  The Government entities concerned, i.e., Bank NMelli
and the Industrial Credit Bank, are also aware of this position.
Y At March 20, 1967. This includes Rls.154 million of Managed Funds
as explained in paragraph 3 of this Annex.

Pave 2
4.        During 1966/67 the Xanaged Funds contributed 30 percent of total
rial disbuisements, against 25 percent in 1965/66.  Of IMDBI 1966/67
gross income,,10 percent was earned through fees derived from the use of
Managed Funds. Profitability calculations are immediately complicated by
the difficulty of allocating administrative expenses, but, adopting a
straight proportion of assets belonging to the Managed Funds to D4DBI's
own assets, the Managed Funds' contribution would be Rls. 4.6 million in
1796/67, corresponding to 3.9 percent of IDMBI's profits before provisions
and tax. A supplementary incoae 1to fBlDI is the return on short-term
inlvestments, Treasury Bills and b nk deposits, derived from the Managed
Funds" cash and from all service fees on operations with both own and
Manaced Funds.

Assumptions Underlying Business Forecasts:  (Including Managed Funds)
1967/68 to 1970/71
Approvals
The estimated 1967/68 approval figures of Rls.2,713 million consists
of clientst projects and direct IMDBI promotions. Of the latter, a total of
Rls.1,245 million was approved (the more important were a steel rolling mill,
a paper mill and a stationary diesel engine unit) during the first eleven
months. Of total 1967/68 clients' projects estimated at Rls.1,468 million,
Rls.l,117 million were approved by February 20; tho balance of Rls0351 million
relates to busines, which will almost certainly be approved in the last month
of 1967/68.
Estimated approvals of Rls.3,610 million in 1968/69 include Rls.1,840
million of INDBIE's promotion projects, namely automotive diesel (the largest)
engines, sewing machines,.ssafety glass, compressors, electric bulbs and cheese;
the remaining R:Ls.1,770 million is forecast for clients' projects based on
past IMDBI performance and an allowance for growth of 10-15 percent. Estimated
1969/70 approvals amount to Rls.3,700 million with a provision for clients'
projects of Rls.1,850 million.  IMDBI promotions of Rls.1,850 million include
projects for viscose fibre, tires, and soda ash which are already under pre-
liminary processing. Rls.3t700 million has been assumed for approvals for
1970/71 wi-th promotions of Rls.1,600 million and clients' projects of Rls.2,100
m-iono The table below shows the position (in rials million):

Commitments and Disbursements
For each IMDBI promotion, the amount and year of the related
commitment has been separately estimated. The several promoted projects
(with one exception of Rls.50 million) approved in 1967/68 are not expected
to be committed in the same year and overall IM4DBI commitments amounting to
Rls.21164 million relate to clientst projects, except for the aforement:ioned
Rls,50 million. In 1968/69, in addition to the normal commitment of clLents'
projects (equal to 80 percent of clients' project approvals in the same year
and 20 percent in the next year), the promoted projects approved in 1967/68
and certain promoted projects approved in 1968/69, are expected to be committed,

which results in a sharp rise in IMDBI's total commitment level to Rls4j,315
million. This extraordinarily high level is expected to decline to Rls.3,500
million in 1969/70 and in 1970/71, a similar pattern is expected to be
repeated. DIsbursements are estimated at 70% of commitments in a given year,
the balance being disbursed in the following years. Superimposed are the
disbursements for promotions based on best estimates.

ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STATENENTS:
(EXCLUDING MANAGED FUNDS)
1967/68 to 1970/71
Profit and Loss Accounts
Income. Interest including service fees of 1% has been calculated at 8% per
annum.  Agency fees have been computed at 3% on average Managed Funds portfolio
after repayment. Earnings from short-term deposits have been assumed at 6% per
annum, obtainable tax free on Treasury notes.  Dividends reflect INDBI1s present
earning expectations.
Financial Expenses* Interest on foreign currency loans has been taken at 6-1%
per annum except for loans actually obtained at lower rates. Commitment fee
on foreign curregncy loans hag been assumed at 3/A% based on the Bankts normal
terms. Interest on rial loans obtained by ND@BI has been assumed at 31% on
actual and at 4% on expected loans.
Administrative Expenses. These allow for a 15% increase in 1968/69 over the
previous year(ue to staff increases), and thereafter annual increases of 10%.
Taxation.  The March 1967 Act provides for a basic company tax of 10%;  in
addition, retained earnings are taxed on the general income tax schedule. There
are certain exemptions such as a 10% tax rebate for companies with shareholders
exceeding 'LOO in number, and a 15% rebate of taxable income if the Company's
sharesare quoted on the Stock: Exchange, On the foregoing basis (and since its
shares are now listed) IMDBI will pa  tax at 14.3% on its 1967/68 income,
13.6% and 13.1% in 1968/69 and 1969/70 respectively.
Dividends. IMDBI expects to pay 10% on the increased share capital of Rls.720
million.
Balance Sheets
Loans. An average 8-year term with 2 years' grace is assumed for new loans.
Provisions. The provision for losses on loans has been computed at 3% of
loan portfolio outstanding at year end. In addition, a provision for invest-
merit losses has been set up to which between Rls.4 and 6 million are added each
year. As in the past no write-offs have been assumed.
Reserves. Fifteen percent of net profit available, after loss provisions, is
appropriated to legal reserves. The balance remaining, after dividend appro-
priations, is placed in general reserve leaving a small sum unappropriated
although this is likely to disappear from 1969/70.
