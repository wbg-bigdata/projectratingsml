NIGERIA
OIL PALM PROJECTS
Technical Aspects of Establishment and Production
A. Planting Material and Research
Planting Material
1.        A comprehensive breeding and selection programe was laid down at
the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) from 1959 to 1966 and
the results of this programme are being appraised in the Institute's Plant
Breeding division. In the course of this work the list of palms being used
for the production of tenera planting material is being continuously revised.
2.        Bunch production is largely determined by environmental factors and
is one of the least heritable of the yield components. Though some improvement
in the bunch yields may be expected, the main improvements will be in bunch
and fruit quality, i.e. in the outturn of palm oil and palm kernels per bunch.
NIFOR material is characterized by high fruit to bunch ratios, fairly high
mesocarp to fruit, high kernel to fruit, and low to fairly low shell to fruit.
Analysis of the material from which the progenies to be distributed would be
bred indicates that bunches from adult palms would give mean mill extraction
rates of 22% palm oil and 5% kernels (see Supplement 13).
3.        Examination of fruit in the field, and particularly in the small-
holders' plots of the Palm Grove Rehabilitation Scheme in East Central State,
has shown that pollinations done in the early 1960's were satisfactorily
executed. Seed production at NIFOR is now being reorganized in a Plant
Production division under experienced management and there is no reason to
believe that seed produced in the coming years would not be equally satis-
factory.
4.        Vascular Wilt disease has been widely regarded as the most menacing
of all oil palm diseases. In Nigeria it has been almost entirely confined
to one large planting, Ajagbodudu Estate, near Sapele, where the 40-year-old
stand of palms has been reduced by the disease to 37 per acre (91 per ha).
It was also identified on very old palms at Calabar Oil Palm Estate where
the incidence was only 1.6%. 1* 1n 1960 the pathogen was isolated
from a few nine-year-old palms at the NIFOR substation, Abak,2 and from one
palm in the dense surrounding groves, but there has been no further develop-
ment of the disease reported from this area. There have been numerous oil
palm plots planted in the main dense wild grove areas of Nigeria since the
1930s and the disease has not been reported from them. Ajagbodudu Estate
itself was developed in a forested area where palms were relatively sparse.
There is thus no evidence that palms planted in the main dense grove areas
*    Figures apply to the references in Appendix 1.



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 2
are at greater risk than those planted in areas where wild palms are sparser.
There is evidence from Ajagbodudu Estate, however, that replantings in Wilt-
infected estates are likely to show a high incidence of the disease, though
this can be reduced by adequate potassium manuring. It has also been shown
that an incidence up to 20% has little effect on overall adult yields owing
to the positive response of the unaffected adjoining palms.
5.        In spite of the low incidence of Vascular Wilt in Nigeria it is
obviously prudent to screen all progenies for Wilt tolerance. No progenies
are immune to Wilt; some are more tolerant of the presence of the fungus
than others. There is some evidence that seedlin s tolerant to inoculation
with the disease would be tolerant in the field3' though more evidence
of this is required. Methods of testing seedlings for tolerance were
developed by PAMOL Ltd. and have been used by the Institut de Recherches
pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO) and NIFOR. These methods have certain
limitations and a more refined method, capable of assessing tolerance at
different levels of inoculum, has recently been developed at Manchester
University.5
6.        In cooperation with PAMOL, NIFOR carried out a programme of progeny
Wilt-tolerance testing in the early 1960s but the programme was in abeyance
for some years. Results indicated that over 70% of progenies had a
good or intermediate tolerance.6
7.        The plant pathologist at NIFOR has recently been to Manchester
University to study the new methods, and the program of progeny testing was
restarted during 1973 in cooperation with Ajagbodudu Estate. It is intended
to use both methods of tolerance assessment. 102 parents have already been
tested in various crosses by the PAMOL method, 200 parents will be tested
during 1974 and the remainder should be cleared by 1975. Thereafter new
parents would be tested and assessed in various crosses before being brought
into use. There is thus no case for importing any planting material on
grounds of its Wilt tolerance. Indeed it has been pointed out that the
causal fungus produces new forms readily in soil, and that forms from
different areas may show marked differences of virulence; selection for
tolerance to local strains is therefore important.
8.        The quantity of germinated seed required each year is shown in
Appendix 5. At peak requirement in 1977 NIFOR would need to produce 3.5
million seeds for the projects. With its present programme of mother palm
selection the Institute should have no difficulty in providing this seed.
Other Research
9.        Nutritional research at NIFOR would be of particular importance to
the projects. Assistance can be given through leaf analysis, soil analysis
and fertilizer experiments.
10.       A laboratory specially designed for routine leaf and soil analysis
has recently been constructed at NIFOR with a capacity of 8-10,000 leaf
samples and 1,000 to 1,500 soil samples per annum.  If the laboratory staff



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 3
at NIFOR can be built up sufficiently to gear the laboratory to its capacity
it would be able to deal with all the leaf analysis likely to be required by
the projects. It is important for the projects that this should be achieved
over the next five years.
11.       On the soils side the laboratory can assist in locating with
greater precision the areas to include or exclude from planting. The broad
soil classification of the IRHO for oil palms7 is not adapted to detailed
use within the Acid Sands soils and the work on soil moisture in relation to
soil series initiated at NIFORd may, if pursued, be valuable in determining
which smallholders plots are suitable for acceptance in the schemes and the
location of future nucleus estates. The estates would provide uniform areas
where NIFOR can establish further fertilizer experiments which would provide
more refined information on rates and frequencies of fertilizer application.
B. Climate and Soils of the Projects Areas
12.       A broad study of the climatic conditions of that part of Southern
Nigeria in which the projects lie was recently made by J. Olivin of IRHO,
and the following analysis is based largely on data assembled by him. It
has been shown that the main influence on the bunch yield of the oil palm
in West Africa is the severity of the dry season two years previously9
and that the general level of yield for any soil class is correlated with
measures of water deficit.7
Rairfall and Water Deficit
13.       The rainfall of Southern Nigeria is shown on map 10562 R attached
to this Supplement and it will be noted that all the projects lie in areas
having a mean annual rainfall of 2,000 mm (80 in) or more. While this rainfall
is usually considered ample for the oil palm, a feature of the rainfall pattern
in Southern Nigeria is a marked dry season from November to March, and measure-
ments of water deficit have shown that the latter do not vary directly with the
annual rainfall.
14.       The water deficits shown in Appendix 2 have been calculated by
a standard IRHO formula which assumes a soil water reserve of 200 mm and
an evapotranspiration of 150 mm in months with less than 10 days rain and
120 mm in months with 10 rainy days or more. To a large extent the soil
classification used with these water deficit estimates (see para 21) is
a means of correcting for varying water availabilities. It will be
noted from Appendix 2 that water deficits vary considerably from year to
year, and this is reflected in the marked variation in annual bunch yields
characteristic of planted areas in Nigeria.
15.       Map 10561 R attached to this Supplement shows the isodeficit lines
estimated from the water deficits of the stations marked. These water deficits
related to the period 1950 to 1962 and yield figures from NIFOR and elsewhere



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 4
which have been taken into consideration relate to a corresponding period.
The Bank's Preparation Mission recommended that in order to obtain satis-
factory yields all projects should lie in areas with a water deficit of less
than 350 mm. Examination of yield figures available to the mission support
this decision, though it must be realized that where soils have a low water
supplying capability, water deficits should be considerably below 350 mm for
reasonable yields to be obtained. It will be seen from the map that the
project area in East Central State lies largely in an area with a mean water
deficit between 250 and 300 mm; in Mid-Western State the Mosogar nucleus
estates and smallholders areas have deficits between 280 and 300 mm while
the Nsukwa estate area has a water deficit of 350 mm with smallholders areas
between 290 and 350 mm; in Western State both the nucleus estates and small-
holders areas lie in a zone having a mean water deficit of about 320 mm.
Temperature
16.       Mean temperatures (see Appendix 3) in the project areas lie between
26°C and 27°C with mean maxima over 30°C and mean minima over 210C. There is
a fall in temperature in the middle of the rains which reduces mean maxima
to 27 - 280C in two months of the year but has little effect on mean minima.
There are some cold nights during occasional short periods of harmattan winds
in December or January, but in general the prevailing temperatures have no
inhibiting effects on the growth of the oil palm and mean temperatures are
very close to 28C which is considered to be the optimum for seedling growthl0.
Sunshine
17.       Sunshine records within or near to the project areas are scanty
but such as exist indicate that the mean annual sunshine lies between 1,700
and 1,800 hrs (see Appendix 4). Although this is usually regarded as ample,
it has been shown that between November and April there is no positive
correlation between sunshine hours and total sun and sky radiation, the
latter being reduced during the dry season when the atmosphere is dust-
filled.11 It is difficult therefore to set a sunshine-hours criterion
for Nigeria conditions; all that can be said is that the overcast conditions
in the middle of the rainy season and possibly also the hazy conditions
during part of the dry season may have a small adverse effect on production,
but that as the major factor affecting yield is the magnitude of the water
deficit, sunshine effects, at the satisfactory overall levels which obtain,
are likely to be very small.
Soils
18.       All the project areas lie on the Acid Sands soils, derived from
unconsolidated coarse sandstones interbedded with layers of clay, which
cover a very large part of southern Nigeria from west of Okitipupa to
Calabar. These are deep, sandy latosols which have been classified into
the red Benin fasc and the yellow Calabar fasc soils. Typically, the
dominant colour becomes clearer and brighter down the profile and the clay
content increasesl2.



SUPPLEENT 1
Page 5
19.       In the Western State and part of the Mid-Western State the Benin
fasc soils have been subdivided into soil series (following Vine13), but
elsewhere soil surveys have not yet attained this detail. The soil series
classification is based largely on the quantity of clay plus silt in the
6-18in and 18-30in layers. The better series (e.g. Alagba series) have
higher clay contents and are loamy sands overlying sandy clay loams and
sandy clays. The poorer, more sandy series (e.g. Ahiara series) are sands
or loamy sands to a considerable depth and have a low water supplying power
which will accentuate the adverse effect of a prolonged dry season. These
latter soils are characteristically found on long or steep slopes towards
rivers and so, in the absence of detailed soil series mapping, topography
is an important consideration in deciding on the suitability of specific
areas.
20.       Although usually more leached and containing lower quantities of
exchangeable cations, the yellow Calabar fasc soils are not always less
suitable than the Benin fasc soils since their deficiencies of potassium
and magnesium can be made good by fertilizers; however, within the Calabar
fasc region certain excessively sandy soils may be encountered from which
only very low yields may be expected.
21.       Yield expectations for different soil classes at different levels
of water deficit have been estimated by IRHO for West Africa as follows7:

Class  um    400        350       300       250       200      100       Nil

IIa            10       11        12.5      14       16        20        25
[Ib             8        9.5      11        13       16        20        25
III              6         7.5      9        11        13       16        22
An assessment of adult yield levels on various soils at the NIFOR Main
station, Ajagbodudu Estate and plots in East Central State has enabled a
judgement to be made of the soil classes and yield attainable in the pro-
ject areas (see Supplement 13).
22.       Western State.  The nucleus estate area of Iyansan has been soil
surveyed and a detailed report prepared by Dr. Ashaye and Mr. Jaiyeola.14
In all, over 31,000 acres were surveyed and 81% of the area was found to be
level or gently undulating land with soils of the Alabga and Okpanam series.
Of the remaining 19%, 1% lies on the more sandy Kulfo series and 18% on other
Benin series and river alluvium on the slopes and bottoms of small rivers
and streams. The Northwest corner of the surveyed area would provide an area



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 6
of 4,000 hectares of good soils which can be classed as Class IIa soils or
slightly higher. Smallholdings in the surrounding area would be on similar
soils.
23.       The Iyansan area is in a region of low population; consequently
farming is carried out with long fallow periods of around eight years and
much of the ground carries a heavy regrowth of secondary forest with only
11% under food crop cultivation in 1972.
24.       In contrast to Iyansan the western areas for nucleus estates and
smallholder plantings are in a region of higher population with medium to
fairly dense palm groves and more frequent food crop cultivation. Never-
theless these areas are also on good Benin fasc soils including areas of
Alagba and Okpanam series with occasional patches of the more sandy Kulfo
series south of Okitipupa. Though likely to be initially less fertile
than the soils at lyansan, the western soils may be classed as Class IIa,
excluding Kulfo, and with correct manuring should yield well.  The areas
south of Okitipupa are likely to have a mean annual deficit of less than
320 mm.
25.       Mid-Western State.  At appraisal the soil survey was not yet complete
in the Mosogar nucleus estate area and had not started in the Nsukwa nucleus
estate area.  Comments on the soils are therefore only tentative.  Soil survey
facilities have only recently been established in the Mid-Western State and
a schematic-reconnaissanice survey carried out by FAO, though useful as a
general guide to Mid-West soils, is not adequate for detailed appraisal.
26.       The Mid-West State contains areas of both Benin fasc and Calabar
fasc soils and Aiagbodudu estate lies on both fascs. The proposed nucleus
estates of Mosogar and Nsukwa lie on Benin fasc, however, and it is recom-
mended that the smallholders plantings south or east of Mosogar estate
be confined to Benin fasc soils since the Calabar fasc soils near to the
Ethiope river contain some areas of excessively sandy soils.
27.       With regard to the soil. surveys undertaken in the Mosogar and
Nsukwa areas, specific information was requested in a letter to the Chief
Agricultural Officer.  Subsequent information received confirms basically
the tentative conclusions reached during appraisal.
28.       The soils of Mosogar have been described by the soil surveyor as
clayey sand to 12 inches, with reddish-brown sandy clay below.* This suggests
a good Benin fasc soil, but observations made in the field showed that
there were a few areas where there was no appreciable increase of clay down
the profile to 48 incies.  In the FAO map the area lies in the sandier phase
of the Berin fase.  There is a good deal of untapped old rubber in the Mosogar
area, some farming, and thie remainder is heavy regrowth or secondary forest.
*    The terminology is that used by Vine and differs from the terminology
used in the FAO survey and in East Central State.



SUPPLEMElNT 1
Page 7
29.       The Nsukwa area has an estimated water deficit of 350 mm.  The area
is flat or gently undulating and on Benin fasc soil. In the FAO map it lies
in an area on the border of the sandier and intermediate phases.
30.       Though neither of the proposed nucleus estate areas appear to
contain any steep or long slopes towards rivers, the adjoining areas for
smallholders planting contain such slopes with their concomitant very sandy
soils. Experience at NIFOR has demonstrated that such areas are appreciably
lower yielding and they should be avoided in selecting smallholders for the
project.
31.       East-Central State.  The area originally selected for the small-
holders project comprises that part of the State lying south of the Umuaiia-
Owerri road and west of a line running south from Umuahia to, and then along,
the State boundary. Schematic-reconnaissance surveys were carried out by the
Soil Survey Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture before the civil war and a
soil map, of about the same detail as that of the FAO map in the Mid-Western
State, is available. A Soil Survey Unit has been established at the Federal
Agricultural Research and Training Station at Umudike. Some analyses of
soils in the area have been done, but no published or collected data are
available. However, analyses done by Tinker of oil palm plots in the north,
north-centre and south of the area have been publishedl2.
32.       About 80% of the area lies on Benin fasc soils, the remainder,
south of a line running east-west about three miles north-of Aba, being on
Calabar fasc soils. In the extreme south, in Ukwa division, these latter
soils contain appreciable areas of deep sands with very low clay content.
Analysis of the soil of the NIFOR Akwete plot is probably typical of these
areas and as the yield of this plot was never raised above 2 tons ffb per
acre even with potassium and magnesium dressings it is considered advisable
to exclude from the project all of Ukwa division except its Northwest pro-
jection. This would leave only a small area of Calabar fasc soils between
three miles north of Aba and the Ngwa-Ukwa border and a smaller area at the
south of Oguta division.
33.       The Benin fasc soils in the area are typically sandy loams over-
lying sandy clay loams or sandy clay from 18 inches. Some areas of sandier
soils are to be found in the west of the area and on long slopes to the Imo
river. The whole area, except for parts of the south of Oguta division, is
heavily populated and the soils are degraded by frequent farming in the wild
palm groves. Experiments in the area have shown that only very low yields
are obtained without manuring, but that if potassium is applied yields of
over 10 tons ffb per ha can be obtained even from old unselected palms.
There is also evidence that applications of nitrogen would further increase
yields. Soils may be considered as Class IIb with some IIa where farming
has not been so continuous.

34.       In selecting smallholders for the project it is important to exclude
any withholdings on slopes towards rivers and on any other areas of exces-
sively sandy soils.
C. Proposed Cultivation Techniques
35.       For satisfactory establishment and early bearing under the climatic
conditions of Nigeria it is of primary importance to plant large robust
nursery seedlings in the field as early as possible in the year, usually
April.15'16 Such plants are well able to weather their first dry season in
the field and grow rapidly in their second year and may be brought into
bearing when 3 to 3 1/2 years old. A useful demonstration of the importance
of early planting is established annually at NIFOR.
36.       To ootain suitable plants it is necessary to establish main
nurseries 10-12 months before transplanting, i.e. about May. Nursery seed-
lings planted later would be more liable to Blast disease. Shading is only
required if there is an insufficiency of water during the short-dry season
(usually August) or during the main dry season. It has been shown that there
is a negative correlation between August-September rainfall and Blast inci-
dence and that irrigation during the dry period in these months at least
halves Blast casualties.17'18 For this and other reasons it is necessary to
establish adequate irrigation systems for large-scale nurseries.
37.       In order to ensure that sufficient culling of abnormal or poorly
developed seedlings is done at an early stage it is recommended that nurser-
ies be planted with prenursery seedlings established by planting germinated
seed four months previously. The sequence of planting is shown, with appro-
priate overlaps, in the chart attached to this Supplement.
38.       The second most critical factor affecting early and adult yield is
correct manuring, and this particularly applies to areas degraded by con-
tinuous farming. Experiments have showni that in such areas failure to
apply potassium fertilizers would reduce yields by 50%.
39.       The third most important factor is the control of vegetation
through circle weeding, eradication of harmful weeds in the interrow and
control of Pueraria growth.
40.       Unless these cultural requirements are fully met, the yields en-
visaged in the projects will not be attained, and they are therefore dealt
with in greater detail below.
Germination
41.       It is intended that all planting material should be supplied by
NIFOR as germinated seed. This seed would be required during December and



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 9
January each year and the germinators would need to be geared to the pro-
duction of germinated seed in that period. NIFOR possesses a large water-
heated germinator and two electrically-operated germinators. The latter are
not being operated at present but can easily be brought back into operation
during the years of peak requirement. As the supply of germinated seed is
required each year within such a short petiod, NIFOR should be asked to
confirm that they would provide the germination space for the projects'
planting program (Appendix 5).
Prenurseries
42.       Prenurseries are recommended for the projects for the reasons
already given. Seedlings have been successfully raised in Nigeria in beds,
raised trays and small polybags. For large-scale nursery work the small
bag, 6 inches x 8-9 inches lay flat, of 250 gauge polythene and filled with
good top soil, has handling advantages.
43.       Germinated seed is planted in December-January.  The general
instructions for planting, protection from disease and manuring in NIFOR
Advisory sheets No. 2 and No. 4, which apply equally to bag or bed pre-
nurseries, should be closely followed. Shade is not necessary, provided
daily watering is carried out, with twice daily watering in periods of
harmattan. Culling is likely to be up to 20%.
Main Nurseries
44.       The use of polybags has now become general in Nigeria though exper-
ience of the operation of large-scale polybag nurseries is limited. Very
considerable experience of such operations has been gained in several other
countries, e.g. Malaysia, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, and it is on the basis
of botlh this and Nigerian experience that the following recommendations are
made.
45.       Large polybags of 500 gauge black polythene, 16 inches x 20 inches
lay flat with drainage holes perforated on the lower half of the bag, have
been found suitable2 . As watering is all-important both for satisfactory
growth and for Blast disease control all nursery sites should be provided
with sprinkler irrigation systems capable of supplying about 1/3 inches water
per day2l. These systems must be operable at all times.
46.       Polybags should be spaced at 3 ft triangular from the start.  It is
possible to reduce early water consumption by closer spacing during the first
4-5 months, but proper spacing from the time of establishing the nursery has
certain advantages, viz. (1) tile work of moving the bags to wider spacing is
eliminated, (2) all plants can be individually inspected without difficulty,
(3) closer spacing causes etiolation and reduced growth in terms of weight
per plant,21 and (4) spraying against Cercospora Leaf Spot can be thoroughly
carried out. Irrigated nursery designs give approximately 120,000 plants
per 10 ha (25 acres) of nursery, sufficient for about 650 ha (1,600 acres) of
field planting.22



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 10
47.       Standard NIFOR recommendations (Advisory Sheet No. 5) should be
followed for nursery manuring, i.e. 0.5 oz per plant in May, 1.5 oz in July
and 2 oz in October and in January/February of a mixture of 1 part sulphate
of ammonia, 1 part superphosphate (18% P205), 1 part muriate of potash and
2 parts magnesium sulphate.
48.       At the time of transplanting a rigorous culling standard should
be adopted; all abnormal plants, i.e. those which are unusually erect or
squat, with leaflets fused, narrow, short, abnormally close together or wide
apart or inserted at an acute angle, should be eliminated. Losses of up to
20% have been allowed for, and seed and seedling supply has been estimated
for the projects as follows:
(1) 100 germinated seeds to give a minimum of
(2) 75 transplanted prenursery seedlings and
(3) 64 transplanted nursery seedlings per acre (including an
allowance for supplying).
Land Preparation
(1) Nucleus Estates
49.       The vegetative cover of the nucleus estate areas varies considerably.
Some areas are in secondary forest, old rubber or strong old fallow regrowth,
while other areas have recently been cultivated and carry only light regrowth.
The number of grove palms varies from 0 to about 150 per ha. Costs of
establishment have been estimated separately for secondary forest, rubber
or strong regrowth and for farms, fallows and palms; project costs for field
establishment have been derived using a weighted average factor (see costing
tables in appraisal reports).
50.       It is recommended that when the area for the estate has been
surveyed and demarcated the roads for the planting area be cleared and con-
structed first in order to facilitate establishment operations. Underbrush-
ing and felling by axe and chain saw should be complete by early December to
allow for drying out so that a good burn is obtained early in the year; all
other preparatory operations should be completed by the end of March or early
April. Pueraria should be sown at the rate of 6.5 kg per ha after the rains
have set in and following seed treatment with sulphuric acid or by the water-
soaking and heat treatment method recently developed at NIFOR.23 Planting
too far in advance of the rain or in high concentrations of ash leads to
poor establishment or even failure.24
51.       The recent infestation of many areas in Nigeria, and particularly
those which have been under food crop cultivation, with Eupatorium odoratum
has presented a serious weed problem. This plant, which grows exceedingly
rapidly and competes with young palms for water, nutrients and light, must
be eradicated and kept out of all plantings.25 It has been shown that the



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 11
weed can be killed by 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T, but eradication must be followed
by Pueraria establishment and regular patrolling to prevent reinfestation.26
Recently, eradication by spraying with a solution of 1.5 oz Trioxone (2,4,5-T)
to 1 gallon of water has been successfully carried out on a field scale on an
estate in Western State on heavily infested fallows before clearing operations
started. This costed only N 7.50 per ha and assisted the clearing operations.
(2) Smallholdings
52.       Consideration has been given to allow smallholders in the projects
to intercrop with food crops and to retain up to 20 grove palms per acre
until year 4. For the following reasons neither practice is recommended.
53.       Although experiments have shown that, on forest soils and if very
carefully controlled, food cropping can be practiced for a limited period
without reducing yields, on already cultivated or poorer soils yields can
be affected.27 Smallholders tend to plant food crops far too near the young
palms and under these circumstances they compete for water, nutrients and
sometimes for light. Moreover, with such planting, the smallholder fre-
quently lops off functional green leaves of the growing palms, thus checking
their development and reducing their early yield.
54.       Experiments on leaving in old palms, whether in groves or planted
areas, have given conflicting results;28 though sometimes higher bunch yield
have been obtained over periods of 8 to 12 years when a proportion of the
old stand has been retained for a few years, the growth and yield of the
young palms have always been retarded by this practice. Moreover the much
higher oil content of the fruit from the young palms makes it desirable to
bring these into bearing and to their adult yield in the shortest possible time.
55.       However, there are practical considerations which also lead to the
recommendation to clear all old wild grove palms before planting. It is
often difficult to persuade smallholders to fell bearing old palms when
the young palms begin to fruit, and, when eventually felled, these palms
may damage the young stand.  Moreover proper preparation of the land for
planting, and particularly the establishment of a good leguminous cover,
is impeded by the presence of old palms.
56.       Though some smallholders' plantings would be in areas of secondary
forest, the majority would be in areas of palm groves, fallows and culti-
vation. The main problem in these cases would be the eradication of
Eupatorium and its replacement with a good planted cover of Pueraria.
57.       It has been agreed that areas with more than 30% Eupatorium
cover would not be acceptable for planting palms. However, there is no
reason why farmers should not bring such areas into a condition where they
would become acceptable, and it is suggested that this could most easily and
profitably be done by digging out the Eupatorium and preventing reestablishment
through food-cropping for a full season with early maize followed by yams



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 12
or cassava.  A Pueraria cover could be sown after the crops had been harvested;
however, such work would be undertaken by the farmer on his own and would not
form part of work done under the projects.
58.       Applicants with areas having less than 30% Eupatorium would be
required to eradicate the weed by digging before qualifying for a clearing
grant. The manday allowance for underbrushing and clearing on smallholders'
lots includes provision for Eupatorium eradication. The Agricultural Assistants
in charge of groups of smallholders would need to be particularly vigilant not
only in seeing that the weed is eradicated during land preparation but also
in persuading smallholders to prevent reinfestation by regular patrolling and
pulling up of stray plants.
59.       In order to ensure a good Pueraria cover on smallholdings a higher
seed rate is recommended than for estates, viz 11 kg per ha has been budgeted
for instead of 6.5 kg per ha, so that a second sowing can be carried out if
necessary.
Planting in the Field
60.       As mentioned in paragraph 35, early planting is essential.  If there
has already been appreciable rain, planting can start in late March, and with
large programs to complete it should never start later than mid-April. Even
well-transplanted field-nursery plants are able to withstand two rainless
weeks; polybag plants are better able to do so and grow all the faster through
being already firmly planted when the rains set in.
61.       Polybag plants must be previously watered in the nursery and when
planting a good contact with the surrounding soil must be established through
consolidation and ensuring that earth is well packed into the gaps between
the sides of the hole and the ball of soil around the plant's roots. Deep
planting must be particularly avoided; the base of the seedling should be
just above the level of the ground. A collar of 1/2 inch wire netting, 18 -
inches high with a circumference of 30 inches, must be carefully fixed around
the seedling and pegged down on the day of planting as a protection against
rodents. Failure to do this has often led to loss of large parts of a new
planting. These collars must be retained around the plants for around 18-24
mouths.
Castration
62.       The removal of inflorescences by hand or, very carefully, with a
narrow-bladed chisel may be done on the nucleus estates from about 18 months
from planting until six months before the palms are to be brought into bear-
ing. This will enhance vegetative growth and increase initial bunch yields.



SUPPLEMENT 1
Page 13
Field Maintenance
63.       With young palms circle weeding should be undertaken to an inital
radius of 3 ft and thereafter, as the palm grows, to one foot beyond the tips
of the leaves. While the palms are still young it is of particular impor-
tance to prevent the Pueraria cover from climbing over the lower leaves which
touch the ground. When the palm has developed a trunk and the leaves are
well off the ground a circle of 5-6 ft radius should be maintained. Circle-
weeding is at an initial rate of ten times a year and this is gradually reduced
to four times by year 5. Slashing rounds are necessary for the control of
the interrow cover; these must also be frequent in the early years but can be
reduced to twice a year when the palms are fully developed.
64.       Eupatorium must be kept out of the estates and smallholdings by
regular patrolling. A continuous patrol of 5-10 men has been found very
effective over the 1,000 hectares of the NIFOR Main Station which lies in an
area infested by the weed. It was noticed that on some other estates in
Nigeria control methods used have not succeeded in keeping out the weed
altogether. However, on one young planting where a system of contracting out
the maintenance work has been adopted, control is very satisfactory. Each
contractor is responsible for 16 ha (40 acres) and in the initial stages is
required to ring-weed and slash every month.* Such a system could be adapted
to the age of the plantings with contractors gradually taking on larger areas
as the frequency of ring-weeding and slashing is reduced. Contractors could
be responsible for patrolling their areas for Eupatorium or the estate could
have a small centrally-organized patrol.
Manuring
65.       The rates of application recommended for the different project areas
are shown below. In young plantings the fertilizers should be broadcast over
the whole surface of the weeded circle. With older palms, from about 4 years,
fertilizer should be spread in a broad band between the edge of the weeding
circle and the extremities of the leaves. With adult palms where the leaves
have reached their full length, fertilizer may be broadcast over the whole
width of the interrow. Annual applications should be made at the beginning of
the rains in April or May, but not when the rains have fully set in.
* Contractors have been paid N 60 per month; if they employ 1 assistant
and work 25 days they will each earn N 1.20/manday, and the slashing
plus ring-weeding will be carried out at the rate of 3.1 mandays/ha/month.

fasc soils at Ajagbodudu Estate. Such dressings would also be needed
for smallholders on these soils in Mid-Western and East Central States,
but the proportion of holdings on these soils is expected to be small.
/4   Sulphate of ammonia is recommended for the full non-bearing period
for all areas and for continuance for two bearing years in East Central
State.
/5   And onwards.
Supplying
66.       Supplying at points where, through pest attacks or other reasons,
plants have not established themselves satisfactorily may be done up to the
end of June in the planting year. Apart from this, supplying is only worth-
while in year 1, when it should amount to not more than 1% of the stand.
Harvesting and Pruning
67.       Harvesting in the early years should be carried out using chisels
with blades 65 to 75mm wide in accordance with instructions in NIFOR Advisory
Sheet No. 15. Chisel harvesting should be carried on as long as possible, as
with this method no green leaves need be cut. Later, harvesting should be
by the pole-knife method. If necessary a short-handled axe may be used
before the pole-knife method is brought into operation, but a cutlass should
not be used as this implement tends to cause wounding with consequent



SUPPLLMENT 1
Page 15
Rhynchophorus weevil attack. Similarly, pruning leaves too near to the
trunk of the palm may cause wounds which will give access to weevils.
68.       Over-pruning, as well as under-pruning, is often seen in Nigeria
both on estates and smallholdings. Pruning should follow NIFOR Advisory
Sheet No. 14, i.e. pruning of young palms should be confined to leaves badly
infected with Cercospora, while areas in bearing should have one pruning
round per year, usually in the dry season, in which all dead leaves should
be cut off and creepers and ferns removed from the crown. io green leaves
should be cut.
Disease Control
69.       Cercospora Leaf Spot.  This disease is usually carried over from the
nursery into the field and may persist for 2-3 years. As well as the pruning
mentioned above, the plants should be sprayed with Dithane 45 according to the
instructions in NIFOR Advisory Sheet Nio. 2.
70.       Ganoderma Trunk Rot.  In Nigeria Ganoderma is present in all grove
areas and is a disease of senescence. In planted areas the disease is not
often encountered until palms reach about 40 years of age, and comparatively
few cases have been encountered in planted palms at all. The fear has been
expressed that with more general planting and replanting the disease mlight
become more aggressive at a younger age as hias occured in HMalaysia.  NIFOR
experience is that on the Abak Substation in a grove area in South-East
State there have not yet been any cases with palms up to the age of 24 years,
except for some seedlings planted near to infected old palms, but at the
Main Station near Benin there were a few cases in a 25-year-old planting
and five cases have been reported in a 14-year-old replanted area. It is
not considered that the disease is yet sufficiently dangerous to palms in
their normal productive span to justify the great expense of digging out and
disposing of all the old palms, whether in groves or estates. however,
where individual old palms are found to be infected with the fungus they
should be destumped, cut up and destroyed by burning.29
71.       Dry Basal Rot.  Outbreaks of Dry Basal Rot, caused by Ceratocystis
paradoxa, have occured from time to time on estates in the slid-West, and
there have been minor outbreaks at NIFOR Main Station in recent years.
Though its effects can be locally devastating, there is usually a high
recovery rate when palms pass the susceptible stage. Typically the disease
has attacked palms that have recently come into bearing and which are
growing on sandy soils or in areas of high water deficit. There have been
distinct progeny differences of susceptibility. It is not thought that the
disease is likely to be of importance in the areas chosen for the projects,
but NIFOR is engaged in testing progenies for tolerance to the disease.

OIL PALM PROJECTS
Farming Systems in the Project Area
A. Land Tenure
1.        The system of land tenure is not uniform, but generally land owner-
ship is vested in the various communities with any grants or transactions
being under the direct control of the head of the community in consultation
with the elders. Land is allocated by the community to its constituent fam-
ilies, or, sometimes, to individuals on a more or less permanent basis, accord-
ing to their needs and capabilities. Fragmentation of holdings does not yet
appear to be a serious problem. 1/ Granting of land by a community to one of
its native families confers virtually permanent right of occupation, so long
as it is used, but normally with restrictions on rights of disposal, particularly
to non-natives; land is traditionally granted to outsiders only for the growing
of annual crops, but in practice this rule is not invariably enforced. With
increasing pressure from population 2/ there is a growing market in land, which
despite traditional constraints is frequently purchased, pledged and leased
and a growing tendency towards individual ownership is apparent. Nevertheless,
even within the traditional system, the rights of the planter of a permanent
crop to maintain and harvest it are usually well recognized. In the more densely
settled areas near the towns, where land may have been occupied by a family for
several generations, the family is increasingly accepted as possessing virtually,
'freehold' title. Although title is generally unrecorded, family and individual
rights are usually well known and accepted within the community. In general,
therefore, the land tenure system provides adequate security of tenure for the
planting of tree crops. Tenancy on land belonging to absentee owners of an
individual or family inheritance is fairly common, with the tenant paying either
an agreed rent in cash or kind or a share of the crop. Although some of these
absentee landowners would probably be interested in planting oil palm under
the scheme, it is proposed for reasons both of equity and ease of supervision
to restrict participation in project grant/credit to genuine operating farmers.
1/   In the Mid-Western State according to a Government survey of 1969, in
Western Urhobo Districts, 67% of holdings had all their annual crops
concentrated in one parcel; similarly for the state, 55% of rubber and
79% of cocoa holdings were in a single parcel.
2/   This is especially true in East Central State, and partly also in the
Mid-Western State. It is not yet so apparent in the Western State.



SUPPLEMENT 2

B. Cropping Patterns
Western State
2.        No detailed studies are available of existing cropping patterns
specifically in the project area; however some indication of cropping patterns
in the southern rain forest zone of the Western State is given in a recent
survey report. 1/ A table showing land allocation to different enterprises
on various types and size of farm is given in the table on page 3.
3.        With an average cultivated area in each family holding of only one
hectare, 2/ the vast majority of farms are fully engaged in the production of
food crops, mainly maize, yam and cassava. On small arable farms (2 ha and
under) over half the cultivated area is usually under cassava, with up to a
third planted to maize (often interplanted with cassava) and most of the rest
under yam. Yam or cassava intercropped with maize is generally the first crop
planted on freshly prepared land. In the second year crop mixtures such as
maize/cassava, cassava/melon, maize/melon, or yam/maize are commonly found.
The third year crop, if grown, is predominantly cassava.
4.        On a larger farm, however, after harvesting arable crops, land may
then be planted with a tree crop such as cocoa, kola or oil palm. Owing to
the investment of cash and land required for planting tree crops, it tends
to be the larger farmers or absentee landowners who are most interested in
establishing or expanding a plantation of oil palm.
5.        So far only a relatively small proportion of farmers in the oil palm
belt of the Western State have planted oil palm. A survey carried out by the
State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1972 estimated that
some 35,000 farmers had planted,3/ of which 21,000 were in Ibadan Province and
9,000 in Ondo Province (in which the project area is situated).  The average
size of plantation was small, only 0.6 ha, 4/ and in every case was shown as
mixed stand, i.e. interplanted with food crops or another tree crop. However,
a surprisingly large percentage of the total area devoted to oil palm
was found on small farms with a total size in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 hectare.
But in the project area very few of such plantings were observed on smaller
farms during appraisal.

4/   About the same as for cocoa and kola.

6.        It should be possible for some farmers, at least those farming on
communally-owned land, to extend their acreage to allow them to plant; others
may be prepared to reduce their acreage under arable crops, or else, more like-
ly, to shorten their fallow periods. While there is bound to be some degree
of displacement of food crop production in the area by the project, in view
of the relatively small percentage of total useable land to be planted by
smallholders, and the relatively long fallow periods, it is not thought that
this will be serious. Additionally, the demonstrated benefits of fertilizing
and weeding young oil palms may well encourage the development of these
practices on food crops as well. In the long run it will be necessary for
farmers to increase their food crop yields in any case.

7.        Farming is generally carried out on a shifting cultivation basis
with a typical bush-fallow cycle of about 7 years. Cultivation of food crops
normally takes place over two or three seasons - mainly maize, yam and cas-
sava, but also plantain and cocoyam - and is followed by a fallow period of
four or five seasons. According to a Government survey in 1969, 1/ the
average family holding in Urhobo West had about one ha under annual crops,
with 46% of holdings having less than one ha.

8.        However only a small proportion of the total cropped land is under
annual crops. About 75% of the farmers in Urhobo (and probably a comparable
proportion in the unsurveyed Agbor area) owned rubber plots, which accounted
for no less than 88% of the total currently cropped area, with an average
planting of 2.8 ha. However, as a result of low prices for rubber many
farmers have ceased tapping and plots have been abandoned. Other tree crops
found are kola and coconut.
9.        Oil palm has been planted by a number of growers in the Sapele-
Oghareki area, some of whom have quite substantial acreage and supply their
fruit bunches to the Ajagbodudu Estate mill. In the Sapele area as a whole
smallholders have some experience with oil palm as a planted crop. South of
Agbor, on the other hand, farming patterns have tended more to food crops
and - formerly at least - to rubber; while due to a combination of low yields
and poor farmgate prices offered by dealers rubber is no longer so profitable,
there is a thriving trade in cassava and yam to the markets of Agbor and Warri,
and to achieve the desired response in this area, may therefore necessitate a
higher intensity of extension effort.
East Central State
10.       With an average farm size of less than one hectare (see Section C),
most farms in the area are necessarily engaged in moderately intensive food
crop production. Fallow periods are shorter than in the Western and Mid-
Western States, typically around 3 years, ranging up to 5 years or more in
the less densely populated parts and reportedly down to continuous cultivation
in other parts (e.g. in Mbaise Division of Owerri) where there is increasing
use of fertilizers on food crops.
11.       Yam, maize, cassava and cocoyam are planted by the majority of
farmers, with yam occupying the largest acreage, usually interplanted with
maize or cocoyam. After yam and maize, cassava occupies the next largest
acreage, and is mostly grown in pure stand. Probably a fairly high propor-
tion of farmers supplement their incomes by tapping or harvesting the wild
oil palms, which are found concentrated in the vicinity of the compounds.
Wild palms are not normally felled, but may be intercropped with food crops
when their density is not too high.
12.       As compared with other States, a relatively large number of small-
holders have successfully established small oil palm plantations using imported
material and fertilizers. The East Central State Government in July 1972 launched
an assisted Oil Palm Reclamation Program, which by the end of its first season
had assisted 3,765 farmers to reclaim over 16,000 ha of oil palm, mostly planted
shortly before the civil war which caused considerable damage. Probably up to
1,500 of these plantations are situated in the project area, covering some
4,000 ha or more. The average size of the individual plantations is about
4 ha, but a number of the larger ones are run as family or village community
enterprises. It is likely that community plantations will provide a suitable
form of participation in the project, provided individual family holdings can
be clearly identified.

(.. less than 0.5 percent)
The survey indicated that, over the State as a whole, some 45% of farms included
a tree crop, at least during the first two years of the survey, though in the
third year the proportion apparently fell to only 24%. This change, and the
apparent sharp reduction in farm size in 1970/71, is not explained in the
survey report.
14.       The farm survey carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1972
does not provide data on distribution of farm sizes, but gives an average
cultivated area of 0.93 ha. It shows that farmers growing cassava (in the
project area, virtually all) planted an average of 0.55 ha to this crop.
Similar figures for maize were 0.61 ha (probably less in the project area)
and yam 0.26 ha.
15.       Another detailed report by the Ministry shows a much higher average
size for small arable farms in the southern rain forest zone of 2.4 hectares,
but it is not clear whether this was based on actual survey or-taken as a model
for farm management studies.

16.       However, whether the actual figure for average farm size in the
project area is nearer 1 or 2 hectares, a minimum planting under the project
of 1 hectare of oil palm is likely to attract farmers who have larger areas
or who are more progressive.
Mid-Western State
17.       Average size of total area under cultivation, both arable and tree
crops, is estimated at 3 to 4 ha, probably nearer 4 ha in the Sapele area and
3 ha in the Agbor area. Average farm family size in Urhobo Division is around
6 to 7 persons (Ika Division not surveyed but probably about the same); aver-
age time spent per year on agricultural work was recorded as 8 months for
adults (State average 7.3) and 1.6 months for juveniles (6-15 years).
18.       Families devote an average of about 1 ha to arable crops.  Size

East Central State
20.       Official data on farm sizes in the East Central State is sketchy,
and the State Government is still in process of carrying out its farm survey.
Cropping is more intensive than in other parts of the Southern Nigerian oil
palm belt and farm sizes are generally smaller; but it is difficult to re-
concile figures for the State given in the Federal Rural Economic Survey for
1970/71 which show an average cultivated area per farm family of only 0.28 ha
(and 0.18 ha per farmer) with estimates by local officials 1/ that most farmers
in the area would plant at least 1 ha to food crops. It is certainly hard to
believe that, as shown in the Rural Economic Survey report, over 80% of the
4 million farms in East Central State are less than 0.1 hectares. 2/
21.       On the other hand, with a population density of the order of 400
per sq kilometer, of whom probably in the region of 80% belong to farming
households and with only a similar percentage of the total land area at most will
be suitable for cultivation, only 0.25 ha per person of useable land can be
available. With an average household size of around 6 and an average cropping
intensity allowing for fallow periods of 0.5, this implies an average farm
size per family of not more than 0.75 ha. With a higher than average level
of labor input this area is sufficient to supply a family with its normal
food requirements. (The preliminary results of the pilot stage of the
State Rural Economic Survey carried out in Oguta Division, part of which
is in the project area, show an average holding size of about 0.4 ha.)
22.       Certainly the above sort of average calculation must conceal con-
siderable local variations within the project area. However, it does suggest,
that in the most densely populated areas, a minimum planting of one hectare of
oil palm under the project is likely to attract farmers with larger than
average size farms, or those who already have some alternative forms of
employment to provide for their family subsistence. During appraisal the
Cooperative Division of the Ministry of Trade and Industries indicated that
community land could be more readily released to cooperatives for development
by their members, than to individuals.
1/   e.g.  In "A Preliminary Study of the Farming Systems in Owerri, Aba and
Umuahia Areas of the East Central State". Ministry of Agriculture,
Enugu, November 1973.
2/   Food farms in East Central State tend to be dispersed and fragmented
and it seems possible that the Rural Economic Survey failed to identify
all the plots pertaining to the households surveyed.

24.       Insufficient data exist to permit a regional differentiation of
purchased input factors, yields or farm-gate prices. Instead an amalgam of
available data from all three States (Western, Mid-Western and East Central
States) is used to reflect typical sets of parameters applying to smallholder
farmers in the oil palm belt as at 1973. The budgets cannot therefore be
expected to provide precise data for any particular area or future time.
Where other data were not available, derivations of yields and input factors
relied heavily on a study prepared by Western State Ministry of Agriculture,
"Production, Production Requirements, Costs and Returns of Crops: Southern
Rain Forest Zone, Western State of Nigeria." (Ibadan, March 1972).
25.       Labor and land were, however, costed differently for the three
States. Labor was costed at the full estimated current smallholder wage rate
of 70 kobo per manday in Western and Mid-Western States, and 65 kobo in East
Central State. For land an imputed rental cost was calculated for each State
to reflect differential land values, so far as they could be estimated, and
(for arable crops) differing intensities of cropping (i.e. longer or shorter
fallow periods). On the same principle, gross margins for each crop are
shown per hectare of total land employed (cultivated plus fallow) to reflect
the more intensive use of land under a permanent tree crop. (See Appendix 1 -
Calculation of Land Use Rents). For tree crops (oil palm, rubber and kola)
the budgets reflect an annual return in maturity and do not include a deduction
for amortization of original costs of establishment.
26.       For comparison a farm budget for mature planted oil palm is shown
on a similar basis, using input-output factors assumed for the project but
assuming the project grant/credit receipts and repayments have been completed.
Since the costing includes imputed costs for land and annual capital it is
not directly comparable with the project smallholder farm budget on a cash-flow
basis shown in the appraisal reports.
27.       Other detailed notes:
(a) Labor costs - valued at estimated current rates, i.e. not
shadow-priced. Shadow-pricing would raise the returns to
management but leave the returns to management and labor
unchanged.
(b) Fertilizer-costed at N 2.00 per 50 kg bag in each State,
assuming a subsidy of 50%; in East Central State the rate
of subsidy is presently 70% but is assumed to be reduced
to 50% by the time the project is established.
(c) Assumed yield rates, labor requirements and farmgate prices
are shown in Table 1.

Results of Farm Budgets
28.       Under both existing and improved management yam is the most profit-
able single crop, and yam/maize the most profitable crop combination, due to
the relatively high prices reported for yam, which outweigh the higher yields
obtainable in cassava. With improved management yam/maize gives a gross mar-
gin per hectare comparable with or higher than planted oil palm, even after
allowing for fallow land employed. However the high labor requirement for
yam results in a return per manday of only about N 1.50 compared with N 5.00 -
6.00 derived for planted oil palm, which shows the highest return on a manday
basis.
29.       Comparing tree crops, kola appears to yield a higher return on a
yield of 2,000 kg/ha than planted oil palm, but again because of its higher
labor requirements shows a lower return per manday. Owing to the low price
currently being paid in Nigeria, rubber is very much less profitable than oil
palm; based on expected world prices it ought, however, to be comparable.
While the harvesting of wild oil palm provides the highest return per manday
of all the enterprises under existing management (N 1.00 - 1.50) it is about
four times higher on planted palms once they reach full bearing.
Farm Incomes
30.       Official data on smallholder farm incomes is sketchy.  However the
comparative farm budgets and a preliminary study carried out in the East
Central project area 1/ suggest that typical arable smallholdings of about
1 ha in the oil palm belt may earn a gross return of between N 150 and
N 300 2/ from arable crops, of which some N 100 - 200 might be the value of
food for household consumption. This income may be augmented by perhaps
another N 50 where farmers plant a cash crop or harvest wild palm or rubber.
It is therefore clear that a planting of 1 ha oil palm with an annual return
to management and labor of about N 175 in the Western State, N 168 in the
Mid-Western State, and N 150 in East Central State 3/ in maturity would
represent a very considerable addition to the income of an average or medium-
scale smallholding.

2/   Per capita around N 40.
3/   This is based on the farm budget in Table 17 of this Supplement, which
differs from the farm budget in the appraisal reports, where no
deduction is made for imputed land rent and capital costs (see para 26).

E. Farm Family Labor Availability
31.       A typical farming family of about seven persons would probably
comprise around 2-1/2 man-units in terms of labor capacity. At periods of
peak labor demand the family might be expected to work on the farm up to 20
days in a month, giving a peak month labor supply of around 50 man-days. A
typical holding of one ha of food crops under normal management is estimated
to require about 200 mandays labor in the year, with a peak monthly labor
demand over March-April-May of about 30 mandays, leaving a potential spare
labor capacity of 20 mandays even in a peak month.
32.       The period of peak labor demand for mature oil palm tends to over-
lap with that for food crops, as a result both of peak monthly yields (nor-
mally occurring about May) and of rapid weed growth after onset of the rains.
It is estimated that labor requirements for harvesting and maintenance over
the months April-May-June would normally be about 5 mandays per ha per month
on a holding in full bearing. Given that a hectare of food crops would still
allow a monthly labor availability of not less than 20 mandays at this time,
it suggests that after establishment, a farm family could maintain a planting
of oil palm of up to four ha without normally having to hire additional labor
during the peak labor months.
33.       Annual labor requirements for oil palm are naturally higher and
also more concentrated during the early years. In the year of planting,
operations estimated to require over 50 mandays per ha 1/ must be accom-
plished over the three months February-March-April, with a peak monthly
demand approaching 20 mandays. Consequently an average family would nor-
mally have to hire additional labor during this period for a planting in
excess of 1 ha. Over the remaining immature years a family could be expected
to maintain at least 2 ha of palms, as well as its food crops, without hire
labor.
1/ Stacking, burning, clearing rows, lining, weeding avenues, planting
cover, holing and refilling, planting, fixing wire-collars, amount
to an estimated 52 mandays/ha.

Calculation of Land Use Rents in Farm Budgets
1.        Estimates of annual rental value of arable land:
Western State:         N 3.50 per ac  =  N 8.75 per ha (Ministry of Agriculture,
Ibadan)
Mid-Western State:    N 6.50 per ac  - N 16.25 per ha (mission estimate)
East Central State:   N 10.00 per ac =  N 25.00 per ha (mission estimate)
2.        Estimates of typical bush-fallow rotation periods (based on infor-
mation from State Ministries of Agriculture, farmers and other local sources):
Western State:         8 years (range 7 to 10 includes cultivation plus fallow)
Mid-Western State:    7 years (range 6 to 8 includes cultivation plus fallow)
East Central State:   6 years (range 3 to 8 includes cultivation plus fallow)
3.        It is estimated that the cultivation period within the cycle is
typically 3 years with a fallow of 5 years in Western State, 4 years in Mid-
Western State and 3 years in East Central State. The data available do not
permit a regional differentiation of yield estimates; but since the assumed
yields obtainable depend upon the above fallow periods, it is only reasonable
to charge against the operations the opportunity-cost (taking reported annual
rents as a proxy) of land thereby kept idle.
4.        For a 12-month crop 1/ rent on land use is therefore estimated as
follows:
Western State:         8/3 x 8.75  -  23.33 (N per ha)
Mid-West State:        7/3 x 16.25 -  37.92 (N per ha)
East Central State:   6/3 x 25.00 -  50.00 (N per ha)
1/   While all the main arable crops, particularly maize, may be harvested
in less than 12 months from land preparation, they all occupy one full
growing season, and, apart from a late crop of maize in some areas,
effectively occupy the land for virtually a full year. Therefore while
not strictly accurate, a full year's rent on land use is charged against
each crop.

5.        The return to management and labor, after deducting cash expenses
and the costs of annual capital and land employed (calculated as above),
represents the net value per ha of the enterprise to the farmer and his
family, assuming they provide all the labor.
6.        For comparison with oil palm, a value of the gross margin per ha
of total land employed is also shown, calculated by multiplying the basic
gross margin estimate by a factor denoting the intensity of cropping in the
bush-fallow cycle, viz:
Western State:            37.5%
Mid-Western State:        42.9%
East Central State:       50.0%

Federal Institutions -
1.        Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.  Agricultural
development in Nigeria is the responsibility of thirteen separate governments -
the Federal government and twelve State governments. The Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (FMANR) is responsible for overall coordi-
nating of agricultural development. It funds the State ministries of agri-
culture allocating 30% of available funds on a one-twelfth basis and 70% on
the basis of population. 2/ Besides these allocations, FMANR provides special
grants for approved development schemes.
2.        The Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA) is one of the depart-
ments under FMANR, and it works through three divisions: (i) land and water
resources division; (ii) planning division; and (iii) crop production division.
The proposed Monitoring and Evaluation Unit would report to the Director of
FDA through the planning division.
3.        The Universities of Ibadan, Ife, Nigeria - Nsukwa and Ahmadu Bello
have well established faculties of agriculture, and student enrollment for
degree courses is currently running at around the 1,200 level. In recent
years about half of the agricultural graduates have not gone into public
sector agricultural employment - many tending to remain in the urban areas.
Though shortages may occur from time to time, it would seem that only limited
expansion of university level agricultural education will be needed to meet
future requirements. 3/ However, if the right type of agricultural officer
material is to be forthcoming, the standards applied at initial student selec-
tion may need to be raised and also career opportunities for graduates should
be made more progressive and financially competitive with other occupations.
4.        For successful project implementation it is essential to have suf-
ficient well trained middle level technicians to execute programs at "grass
roots" farm level. The main sources of supply of Assistant Agricultural Super-
intendents (diploma) and Agricultural Assistants (certificate) are the Schools
of Agriculture at Moor Plantation, Ibadan, Akure, Umudike and Obubra. At
this juncture the Western, Mid-Western, and East Central States do not appear
to be experiencing any major shortfall in these categories of field staff.
1/ State Institutions involved in the projects are described the
appraisal reports.
2/ On Independence day 1974, FMG announced that allocation of funds to the
States would be 50% on the basis of population and 50% on the basis of
equality.
3/ IBRD/UNESCO Education Sector Mission.



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 2
Howevet, a large number of extensive development programs are scheduled for
the agricultural sector during the next few years. Given this situation,
it is essential that detailed and continuous assessments are made well in
advance so as to ensure that the supply and quality of middle level field
staff meets the requirements of on-going and planned programs.
5.        In addition to receiving a basic training at universities and
Schools of Agriculture, field staff would also receive training through
special in-service courses designed to meet the specific need of the projects
they are concerned with.
6.        Nigerian Agricultural Bank.  Federal Government's most important
step towards the development of agricultural credit has been the creation of
the Nigerian Agricultural Bank (NAB), which is the first Federal institution
organized solely to provide finance for agriculture. NAB was registered
under the Companies Act in November 1972; and it was officially inaugurated
in early 1973. The head office of NAB is in Kaduna, the capital of the North
Central State. The main objects of the NAB are set out in its Memorandum
of Association as follows:
"(a) To grant loans for agricultural production (including
horticulture, poultry farming, pig breeding, fisheries,
forestry and timber production, animal husbandry and any
other type of farming) and for purposes of storage,
distribution and marketing connected with such production
to any state, group of states, or any state institution
for on-lending to any state, or group of farmers, or body
corporate, subject to the state, or group of states, or
state institutions guaranteeing repayment of the loan.
(b) To grant direct loans to individual farmers, cooperative
societies or other bodies (corporate or unincorporate) in
appropriate cases, provided that the bank is satisfied
that the schemes for which the loans are requested are
viable and there is adequate security to cover such loans.
(c) To charge interest on loans to meet the full costs of
management including debt servicing, allowing adequate
sums to be set aside for general and bad debts reserves
before paying any dividend..."
7.        The Federal Government requested UNDP to assist in financing a
project to organize and manage NAB during its first three years. The Bank
is the executing agency for this project, and Berenschot-Bosboom NV, Tilburg,
the Netherlands, are the consultants. The consultants are required to:
(a) assist the Board of Directors in formulating policy;
(b) with the approval of the Board of Directors, advise and
assist State Governments and institutions on formulating
credit policies and programs and organize and administer
such policies;



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 3
(c) plan and implement an effective loan appraisal and evaluation
system based on farm plans, and an effective data collection
system;
(d) arrange for identification and preparation of agricultural
development projects;
(e) arrange for the supervision of loans and to evaluate the.
economic results of said loans; and
(f) set up a suitable accounting system, manage the bank, train
Nigerian staff for takeover of the bank, collect relevant
data, etc.
8.        NAB has a Board of Directors appointed by the Federal Government.
The senior executive is the General Manager who has under him the following
departments:
(a) Projects and Consultancy;
(b) Operations; and
(c) Administration and Finance.
9.        During NAB's first year, the management concentrated on recruiting
senior Nigerian staff and formulating NAB's operations, policies and proce-
dures. Lending operations are now getting underway and up to September 1974
NAB's Board had approved loans up to N 20 million (US$30 million) and had
under consideration applications totalling N 24 million (US$36 million).
10.       The Federal Government has made available to NAB up to September
1974 N 12 million (US$18 million) of which N 1 million in the form of equity
and N 11 million with form of loans and had committed itself to provide
additional funds to NAB totalling N 14 million (US$21 million) of which
N 1 million would be in the form of equity and N 13 million in the form of
loan. The long-term plans and policies for NAB are still the subject of
review. The decisions to be taken include: the pace and scale of future
expansion; the extent to which NAB will work through State credit institu-
tions and the extent to which it will involve itself directly in lending
to large numbers of small farmers; and the arrangements for providing it
with further Federal finance.
11.       Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR).  Financed since
April 1972 by the Federal Government and prior to that by the Federal Govern-
ment, State Governments and the Marketing Boards, NIFOR aims at the develop-
ment of improved high yielding planting material, effective methods of crop
husbandry and plant protection, and also the development of efficient extrac-
tion and quality control in large and small-scale processing. There are six
research divisions; namely, Agronomy, Plant Breeding, Physiology, Pathology,



SUPPLEMENT 3
Page 4
Statistics, and Chemistry (Soils, Nutrition and Processing). The institute
maintains a 1,735 ha main station, twenty miles north of Benin City and also
operates a sub-station at Abak in South East State.
12.       Seed production at NIFOR is now being reorganized in a Plant
Production Division under experienced management. At peak requirement in
1977 NIFOR will be able to supply the seed requirements of the projects
(see Supplement 1, Appendix 5). The Institute is also in a position to
assist the projects in the spheres of leaf and soil analysis.
13.       In addition to providing the planting material and other technical
services, the technical training of project field staff would be carried out
at NIFOR (see Supplement 11) and a provision for this has been included in
project costs (see appraisal reports).
14.       The Nigerian Produce Marketing Company (NPMC) was created by the
State Marketing Boards to act as their export sales agent. NPMC collected
sale proceeds, paid export duties, port, shipping and handling charges and
remitted the balance of the proceeds less its operating and handling charges
to the respective Marketing Boards. NPMC has several produce departments
(cotton, oil palm products, groundnuts, and cocoa) and owns the Bulk Oil
Company which handles palm oil. NPMC's administrative expenses have been
increasing and together with a declining volume of business have resulted
in high overhead costs per ton of produce handled.
15.       In early 1973 the Federal Government announced measures to reform
the export commodity marketing and price fixing systems. Major objectives
of these reforms are to:
(a) improve efficiency of commodity marketing;
(b) increase producers income as a means to generate greater
incentives for agricultural production.
For further details see Supplement 12.

Federal Department of Agriculture
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU)
General
1.        Under the Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA) which is a depart-
ment of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (FMANR),
a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) would be established, because of the
urgent need to strengthen the Ministry's capability of monitoring and evaluat-
ing the extensive agricultural development programs that are being planned.
The MEU would be primarily concerned with:
(a)  the financial and technical monitoring of on-going projects;
(b) evaluating their financial, economic, and socio-economic
impact; and
(c) providing assistance in the planning and preparation of
future development programs.
2.        The main three crops involved are cocoa, oil palm, and rubber and
Benin in the Mid-Western State would be a suitable base for staff concerned
with monitoring these projects. FDA would be the executing agency and
within one year of the commencement of the projects a team of specialists
would be recruited to form the Tree Crop Section of the Monitoring and
Evaluation Division (MED).
3.        In consultation with the Tree Crop Section (TCU) in the Mid-Western
State, and the Smallholder Management Units (SMU's) in the Western and East-
Central States, and the Federal research institutions, such as the Nigerian
Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), the Cocoa Research Institute of
Nigeria (CRIN), the Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN), the Tree Crop
Section of MEU would be responsible for specifying the planting techniques and
standards to be adopted in project implementation.
4.        Continuous evaluation of the economic and socio-economic impact of
the projects would be carried out in conjunction with institutions such as
the Nigerian Institute for Social and Economic Research (NISER) as well as
appropriate faculties of the universities.
5.        In addition to monitoring and evaluating progress in projects, the
Tree Crop Section of MEU would also be concerned with the planning and
preparation of future development programs that involve Federal financing.



SUPPLEMENT 4
Page 2
Having a Federal orientation, tree crop development planning would be
rationalized on an "industry" basis as opposed to the present individual
State approach. To cover specific fields of activity such as research,
business management, processing engineering and project preparation, consult-
ants would be called in from time to time. The Tree Crop Section of MEU would
prepare progress reports for submission to Federal and State Governments, and
where appropriate external financing agencies.
Financial/Technical Inspection
6.        The financial control systems being used in projects would be
examined at regular intervals (at least twice a year) with particular atten-
tion being given to the timing and procedures used in procurement; disburse-
ment control; grant/credit accounting; produce price formulation and the control
of credit repayment. Technical evaluation would concentrate on assessing the
standards being attained in (i) field planting, maintenance and harvesting/
tapping, and (ii) produce collection and central processing -- where applicable,
for example in rubber and oil palm. This would involve very experienced staff
making regular visits to the field and selecting specific areas for inspection
-- not leaving it to project staff to decide where and what should be inspected.
Field inspections should ensure a good coverage of nurseries and a cross-section
of areas that were in (a) the first year of planting, (b) immature maintenance,
and (c) mature maintenance and harvesting/tapping. In order to facilitate
objective evaluation it will be necessary to establish an agreed system for
quantitative assessment of work standards in relation to the main field prac-
tices. Inspection and field supervisory staff must apply the same criteria
when making quantitative assessments if the analysis of inspection data and
the recommendations arising there from are to serve as an effective instrument
of management. For example, when assessing work standards for circle weeding
oil palms, field observations should relate to the following:
(a) size of circles in relation to age;
(b) cleanliness of circles;
(c) damage to root systems;
(d) saucer depressions.
For each of these factors, the number of observations where work items had not
been completed to the specified standards would be recorded and expressed as
a percentage of the total number of circles in the inspection samples.
Necessary corrective action should be taken either to remedy a fault, or
ensure it is not repeated in subsequent rounds.
Project Evaluation
7.        The broad objectives would be to evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency of project activities particularly in relation to their economic
and socio-economic impact in the rural areas. In addition to measuring
the financial/economic benefits accruing to the participating farmers and



SUPPLEMENT 4
Page 3
companies, assessments would be made of such items as changes in employment
levels, business activity, consumption patterns, participation in education
and other economic and socio-economic indicators of community well-being.
8.        Though the Tree Crop Section of MEU would be ultimately responsible
for this work it would need to rely heavily on specialists from NISER, the
universities and in certain instances expatriate consultants. Some of the
data needed for analyses would be generated by project records and inspection
reports. Other data would need to be collected by surveys and from secondary
sources outside the project. It is envisaged that field enumeration would
involve both project field staff and resource personnel such as university
and college students.
Planning and Preparation of Future Development Programs
9.        The Tree Crop Section of MEU would assist in the planning and pre-
paration of future development programs by providing the executing agencies
such as the Tree Crop Unit (TCU), Smallholder Management Units (SMU's), Oil
Palm Companies, and Agricultural Development Authority with the basic support
services required. Such services would take the form of:
(i) providing detailed guidelines for project preparation
highlighting any problem areas requiring particular
emphasis and making positive recommendations as to how
such issues should be tackled;
(ii) liaising with TCU, SMU's State and Federal Government agencies
ensuring that any services required from other institutions
are made available for project preparation. For example,
soil and land use surveys, main and feeder road development
plans, future emphasis in education programs, etc.; and
(iii) attending Steering Committee and Board Meetings
a representative of the Tree Crop Section of MEU would
from time to time attend meetings of the Steering
Committee of TCU and SMU's and also the Boards of the
Oil Palm Companies as an observer.
Staffing
10.       The specialist staff required to monitor and evaluate the tree
crop projects would need to be very experienced and in the early years of
establishing the Tree Crop Section of MEU in Benin it is envisaged that about
a third of them would be recruited internationally.

/1   Including specialists from NISER and universities.
The agriculturalists should be men with 8 to 10 years' experience at senior
management level in large scale oil palm, rubber or cocoa operations.
Similarly the expatriate financial analyst and economist should have exten-
sive experience - at least 5 - 7 years - of financial control, project pre-
paration, appraisal and evaluation. To attract the highly experienced people
needed for this type of work, appropriate contract and salary terms will
need to be offered. The Nigerian professional staff would receive specialist
training either in neighboring West African countries or, in some instances,
in countries like Malaysia.
From time to time consultants would be engaged to:
(a) carry out specific studies such as, preparation of the
design and tender specifications for processing systems;
reviewing the work programs being carried out by the
crop research institutes; reviewing the financial control
systems being operated by projects;
(b) provide support staff for the preparation of future development
programs.
Training
11.       The Nigerian financial specialists would be given the opportunity to
gain experience of the financial control systems being applied by large-scale
nucleus estates with smallholder outgrowers and individual smallholder replant-
ing/new planting schemes. Arrangements would be made to attach staff for
periods of a month or so to organizations such as Sodepalm in the Ivory Coast,
Camdev in the Cameroons, and the Rubber Industry Smallholder Development
Authority in Malaysia. The agriculturalists would also need specialized
training in the planting techniques and the organization and control of
field practices for the main tree crops involved. For oil palm and rubber the
Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Malaysia would be the most appropriate countries



SUPPLEMENT 4
Page 5
to visit. For cocoa, Nigeria would be able to provide the sources for training.
Arrangements would be made to attach staff to public or private sector research
establishments, large-scale estates, and organizations specializing in small-
holder replanting and new planting schemes. In view of the wide spectrum of
technology and organizational control involved, staff would need to be
attached to appropriate institutions for periods ranging from 3 to 4 months
each. The economists would need to be trained in project evaluation, pre-
paration and appraisal techniques, and NISER and the Economic Development
Institute of the Bank Group would be suitable institutions for providing such
training.
Financing
12.       The Tree Crop Section of the MEU would be financed wholly by the
FMG. During the period 1975 through 1983 expenditures are estimated to amount
to N 5.52 million (US$8.39 million) including N 1.85 million (US$2.81 million)
for contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about
i 1.81 million (US$2.74 million) or 33% of total costs. It is proposed that
the Bank finance N 2.76 million (US$4.20 million) or 50% of the cost for the
period 1975 through 1983 (for details see Table 1).
13.       Expenditures are estimated at N 5.52 million (US$8.39 million) for
a nine-year period. Average annual expenditures amount to N 0.61 million
(US$0.93 million). The Tree Crop Section of MEU covers projects in oil palm,
rubber and cocoa and it is estimated that 50% of its costs could be charged
to the oil palm projects (or N 0.31 million, US$0.47 million). Three oil palm
projects have been appraised in Western, Mid-Western, and East Central States
and consequently the average annual costs of the Tree Crop Section of MEU for
each project would be about N 100,000 (US$152,000).

OIL PALM PROJECTS
A Comparison between Small and Large-Scale
Palm Oil Mills
General
1.        The fruits produced from the project's smallholdings could be
processed at small mills using hand hydraulic presses or at large fully
integrated central mills. The small-scale units would involve low capital
investment but high operating costs coupled with lower oil extraction rates
and poor oil quality in terms of free fatty acid (ffa) content and keeping
properties. The large central mills would apply advanced technology involving
higher capital expenditure and well qualified engineers. However, these
large mills would have economies of scale, lower unit production costs, higher
oil extraction rates and better oil quality.
2.        In the following sections existing palm oil extraction systems are
compared from the standpoint of:
(i)  the investment and operating costs for varying siz.; and types
of processing equipment;
(ii)  processing costs and returns per ton of fresh fruit bunches (ffb)
processed in mills of different types and sizes; and
(iii)  economic returns to investment using small and large-scale
mills.
A.   Comparison of investment and operating costs for varying types and sizes
of equipment
3.        The processing of palm oil fruit bunches is essentially a succession
of physical separations that can be schematized as follows:

4.        The final efficiency in relation to the extraction of oil and kernels
from the bunches is a function of the efficiency of the separations from which
they derive; consequently, each of them is of equal importance. The efficiency
at any stage of separation is primarily conditioned by the equipment used.
However, when selecting the equipment, a compromise has to be made between
its cost and efficiency.
5.        In general, for a given level of extraction efficiency the cost
per unit of fruit processed decreases as the capacity of the equipment used
increases. Furthermore, as the size of mill increases the operating and
management costs do not increase in direct proportion. The cost of processing
equipment can be reduced but only by lowering extraction efficiency levels
and sometimes the quality of the products, and raising operating costs per
unit of throughput.
6.        The following sections examine the effect of the volume of through-
put on:
(a) the type of equipment used;
(b) the cost of such equipment;
(c) its extraction efficiency;
(d) the quality of the products; and
(e) the operating expenses.
7.        It is assumed that the fruit to be processed is Tenera, as this is
the material to be planted in the projects. Dura fruit from wild palm groves
requires somewhat different processing equipment, particularly in relation
to the use of continuous screw presses for oil extraction.
Sterilization
8.        Sterilization prepares the bunches for separating the fruits from
their stalks. It must be emphasized that the sterilization process affects
the efficiency levels attained at all subsequent separation stages, as well
as the quality of the final products - essentially the acidity of oil and
the color of the kernels.
9.        During sterilization the bunches are treated with steam or boiling
water in order to weaken both the connecting tissues attaching the fruits
to the stalks and the walls of the oil cells in the mesocarp. Simultaneously,
the enzymes that build-up the free fatty acids in damaged fruit are destroyed.
If sterilization is carried out using steam at sufficiently high pressure
(2.2 to 3 kg per cm2), part of the kernels become loosened in the shells
making subsequent separation easier.

10.       Mills with an ffb capacity of 6 tons/hr and over.  For efficient
sterilization and ease of fruit handling, it is now standard practice to
install horizontal sterilizers using steam under a pressure of 3 kgs/cm2.
The bunches are loaded into perforated sterilizer cages that have a capacity
of 1.5 or 2.5 tons. Trains of 3 to 8 cages are rolled into the sterilizer
where they are treated with steam at a pressure of 2.2 to 3.0 kg/cm2. Steam
consumption is very high at the beginning of the operation and to reduce the
peak requirements for steam to levels compatible with boiler capacities, it
is necessary to distribute the load by installing at least two sterilizers.
The trains of sterilizer cages are normally handled by electric winches or
locomotives.
11.       These horizontal sterilizers have to resist steam under medium
pressure and need to be fitted with steam-tight doors that have a diameter
of 1.70 m or 2.05 m depending on the size of cage being used. The door,
the dome-shaped end, the operating and control fittings are the most expensive
part of a sterilizer; consequently, for the larger mills, sterilizers are
built as long as possible but compatible with peak boiler capacity and the
manouvering of the trains. In practice, sterilizers tend to be confined to
capacities of twenty tons of ffb (8 cages of 2.5 tons each).
12.       The cost of sterilizing equipment per ton/hr capacity decreases
with the size of the installation. On the basis of current prices, it is
estimated that if the cost index for a sterilizer unit capable of handling
6 ton/hr was 600 (using 1.5 ton cages) a 20-ton per hour unit would have a
cost index of 1040 (using 2.5 ton cages). Expressed in terms of ton/hr
capacity, these cost indices would be 100 and 52 respectively.
13.       Mills with an ffb capacity of less than 6 tons/hr.  In the past,
vertical sterilizers with manual unloading have been widely used in mills of
this capacity range. With these sterilizers unloading is slow and heavy on
labor and loss of oil in the stalks is high. For these reasons, the current
trend is to use vertical sterilizers with removable perforated fruit con-
tainers that hold 1.5 tons. These containers are loaded into the sterilizer
by electric hoist, which at the end of sterilization unloads and empties them
into the threshing unit.
14.       Equipment capable of sterilizing 1.5 tons of fruit per hour costs
about 75% of the 6 ton/hr horizontal sterilizer unit mentioned earlier.
The cost of a 3-ton/hr vertical unit would, however, be the same as a 6 ton/hr
horizontal unit. The main reason for the relatively high costs is that the
steam-tight doors and dome-shaped ends of the vertical sterilizers are the
same size as those used in horizontal sterilizers.
15.       The vertical sterilizers, however, need much less floor space than
the horizontal units, which require shunting area for the fruit cages. Below
6 ton/hr capacity, savings in civil works and building costs compensate for
the higher cost of equipment and the vertical sterilizer system tends to be
cheaper.

of mills with a small throughput, the installation of a conventional sterili-
zing unit is frequently considered too expensive. As an alternative, boiling
water or,steam at atmospheric pressure is used for sterilization. Under these
conditions, the sterilizing equipment does not have to be capable of resisting
high pressure nor does it require steam-tight doors. The most simple sterili-
zing unit would comprise a metal container for the fruit bunches and the
boiling water heated by an open fire.
17.       With an operating temperature of 100 °C as compared with pressurized
steam at 135 to 145 °C, the transmission of heat through the bunches is slower
and hence the time required for sterilization has to be extended. In order
to accelerate heat penetration, the bunches are usually quartered, but this
leads to' fruit damage, the build-up of ffa and oil losses. Even with bunch
quartering, the time required for sterilization is much longer than when
pressurized steam is used. In practice, the time required to complete the
operation may be up to 5 times that needed when using pressurized steam.
This means that the container capacity required may be up to five times that
of a conventional sterilizer. In addition, the low efficiency of the open
fire means that fuel consumption is high. Furthermore, the lack of precision
inherent in this system leads to uneven performance. In view of this,
sterilization with pressurized steam is recommended even for processing
systems involving 0.5 to 1.5 tons per hours.

Threshing
19.       Threshing is the separation of fruits from their stalks.  A measure
of the efficiency of this operation is the extent to which the fruits are
removed from the bunches with a minimu loss of oil in the stalks.



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 6
20.       Mills with an ffb capacity of 1.5 tons/hr or over.  Mills of this
capacity would normally use the "squirrel cage" thresher. This cage rotates
at a speed that creates a peripheral centrifugal force that is slightly lower
than gravity. Consequently, the bunches in the rotating cage drop just prior
to reaching the top of the cage and the impact loosens some of the fruits
which drop between the bars of the cage. This process is repeated until
all fruits have been removed from the bunch.
21.       Based on experience, a suitable cage diameter which gives the
desired intensity of impact to loosen fruit appears to be between 1.70 m and
2.1 m. The length of the cage is a function of the number of impacts needed
to loosen all the fruit and the quantity of bunches to be processed per hour.
In practice, it has been found that a suitable length ranges between 3 to
5 m. The smaller cages are used for throughputs ranging from 1.5 to 3 tons
per hour; the larger cages being capable of processing up to 30 tons of
bunches per hours.
22.       The cost of these threshing cages does not vary in direct proportion
to their capacities. A unit measuring 1.7 m diameter and 3 m in length that
can process up to 3 tons/hr would cost about 60% of a cage with a 2 m diameter
and 4 m in length capable of handling up to 20 tons per hour.
23.       Mills with an ffb capacity of 1.5 to 0.8 tons/hr.  A "rotating
arms" thresher would be used. These machines though relatively inexpensive
are hand loaded and operating costs are comparatively high. In addition,
oil losses in the stalks are high.

Digesting
25.       This involves the preparation of fruit for oil extraction.  Fruits
are kneaded at high temperature (about 1000C) to break the oil containing
cells. The walls of these cells should have been weakened during sterilization
and hence the results obtained in digesting will be partly dependent on the
efficiency of the first operation.
26.       Digesting takes place in a cylindrical mixing machine fitted with
a slowly rotating shaft which has specially shaped arms. Steam is injected
into the base of the digestor to raise the temperature of the fruit mash to
100C. Fruits are fed into the top of the digestor and the heated mash
drawn off through a sliding panel in the lower section. In practice, results
obtained with small digestors compare satisfactorily with large digestors,
providing the period allowed for digestion is sufficient (approximately 30
minutes). Hence, the size of the digestor must be geared to the throughput.
27.       The largest digestors currently in use are about 3 m high with a
diameter of 1.2 m and a capacity of 10 to 12 tons of ffb per hr, which in
turn corresponds to the throughput of a continuous screw press.
28.       The cost of a large digestor capable of handling the fruits of
10 to 12 tons of ffb per hour is about 3 times that of a machine capable
of digesting the fruits of 1.5 tons of ffb an hour; in terms of cost per
uznit of throughput (tons of ffb per hr), the small digestor being about
2.5 times more expensive than the large unit.
Extraction
29.       This involves the separation of the crude oil from the mash by
either a "wet" or a "dry" process.
30.       In practice, the wet process is only used for small scale units
with a ffb throughput of less than 1 ton/hr. In this process the digestor
has a perforated base plate and during the early stages of digestion sore
oil and oil containing cells flow through the holes. After a few minutes,
boiling water is sprayed over the fruits so as to wash the mash, thus removing
the bulk of the oil and oil containing cells. At the end of the process the
vashed fibers and nuts are discharged through a door at the lower end of the
digestor which is refilled with fruits.
31.       The dry process is the ethod of oil extraction aost extensively
used. Essentially, this process involves loading the mash from the digestor
into a perforated cage and subjecting it to high pressure in order to expell
the crude oil (oil, water and oil containin cells). The efficiency of this
separation process is a function of a combination of the degree of pressure,
the period of time for which it is applied and the temperature, which shoulo
be as close to 100l as possible so as to reduce the viscosity of the oil
and facilitate its flw.

32.       The continuous screw press produces pressures that are at least
double those attained by the hydraulic press, which is subject to mechanical
strength limitations and sealing problems. Additional advantages of the
screw press result from its low requirements for labor, spare parts and
maintenance. The continuous screw press is basically designed for through-
puts ranging from 3 to 12 tons of ffb per hour. However, it must be pointed
out that with the continuous screw press an efficient separation of clarified
oil from the crude oil involves the use of elaborate and expensive clarifi-
cation equipment. Therefore, for throughputs of less than 3 tons of ffb per
hour the hydraulic press, which requires less sophisticated and cheaper
clarification equipment, is preferred.

Clarification
34.       The crude oil produced at the extraction stage contains a mixture
of oil, water and cell tissue and the objective of clarification is to separate
the oil from the other components. The oil and the cell tissue have specific
gravities that are very similat and therefore, complete separation by settle-
ment is not possible. However, approximately 50% of cell tissue can be
dissolved in boiling water, thus releasing any oil that was adhering to this
tissue. Hence, the first stage in clarification involves separating the
fraction of the crude oil containing the cell tissue and boiling it. To recover
the oil from the undissolved cell tissue necessitates the use of large high
speed centrifuges.



SUPPLEM4ENT 5
Page 9
35.       In both the "wet process" and continuous screw press the crude oil
contains a high proportion of cell tissue. On the other hand, due to lower
pressure exerted during extraction the crude oil produced by hydraulic presses
has a relatively low cell tissue content.
36.       As pointed out earlier, the wet process is only used for units with
a throughput of less than 1 ton of ffb per hour. However, the smallest centri-
fuge capable of giving a satisfactory separation efficiency has a capacity
which corresponds to 3 tons of ffb per hour. In practice, such a machine is
considered to be too expensive for a unit with a throughput of less than
1 ton/hr. Therefore, with a small scale wet process unit, the oil adhering
to the 50% undissolved cell tissue cannot be recovered.
37.       When using hydraulic presses for throughputs of less than 3 tons
of ffb per hour, the percentage of cell tissue in the crude oil is low. In
view of this, it is difficult to justify the installation of an expensive
centrifuge for recovering the oil adhering to the 50% of cell tissue that is
insoluble in boiling water.

costs of clarification units for varying throughputs and type of extraction

Separation of Fibers and Nuts
39.       For mills with a throughput of 1.5 tons of ffb/hr or over, even small
amounts of fibers on the nuts are sufficient to cause them to conglomerate and
prevent their even flow through the drying silos and, therefore, all fibers
must be removed prior to drying.
40.       In the dry process mills, the cake residue from the extraction
process is broken and then exposed to a vertically ascending current of air
moving at a speed that carries the loose fibers up to the boiler room and
allows the nuts to drop into a rotating polishing drum.

41.       For throughputs of less than 1.5 tons of ffb per hour using the dry
or wet process, the nuts are usually sorted by hand and invariably some are
lost in the fibers.

Separation of the Kernels and the Shells
43.       Separation of the kernels from the nuts is made in four successive
steps:
1.   Detaching the kernel from the internal wall of the shell;
2.   Nut cracking, which involves breaking the shell without
damaging the kernel;
3.   Separating the lighter parts of shell fragments from the
cracked mixture; and
4.   Separating the kernels from the large shell fragments.
Detaching the Kernel from the Shell
44.       This is done by drying during which the kernel shrinks and separates
from the shell wall.



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 11
45.       Mills with an ffb capacity of more than 1.5 tons/hr.  The dryers
used are vertical silos with a capacity of at least 20 hours of nut output.
Warm air is blown into the upper and middle sections to dry the nuts; cool
air is blown into the lower section to cool the nuts and make their shells
brittle prior to cracking. The process is fully automatic with the nuts
loaded at the top of the silo, which is kept continuously full. Nuts are
extracted at the base by a device which ensures an even flow through the
silo.
46.       Mills with an ffb capacity of between 0.5 and 1.5 tons/hr.  Silo-
type dryers are too expensive for this level of throughput and drying is
usually done by treating the nuts with steam under pressure. Steam pressure
of about 3 kg per cm2 is applied two or three times for a few minutes. Part
of the water content of the kernels evaporates at each release of the steam
pressure and drying then proceeds slowly for a few hours when the nuts are
cooled prior to cracking. Though the results obtained with this drying
system are good, the equipment is expensive and a certain amount of labor is
required.
47.       For mills with a throughput of less than 0.5 tons of ffb per hour,
the nuts are sun-dried for a few days before cracking. Although no equipment
is needed, the labor requirements are high and the drying tends to be uneven.
Nut Cracking
48.       The objective in this process is to crack the nuts without damaging
the kernels. Tenera nuts are, however, difficult to crack because although
the shells are thin, one end is covered by a tuft of ligneous fibers that
can deaden the impact of cracking. Good results can be obtained using large
centrifugal crackers which throw the nuts against a steel wall that is a
sufficient distance from the center to enable the nuts to be orientated so
that the tufts are to the rear, thus ensuring that the unprotected surface
of the shell strikes the wall. Centrifugal nut crackers for tenera nuts must
have a minimum diameter of 1.20 m and hence have a large capacity.
49.       With tenera nuts there tends to be a correlation between nut size
and shell thickness, with small nuts having a thin shell. The energy required
to break the shells will, therefore, be different for small as opposed to
large nuts. Given this situation, to obtain good results the nuts should be
sorted into two size groups and cracked in centrifuges that are running at
different speeds.
50.       For mills with a throughput of more than 12 tons of ffb per hour,
in order to attain a high level of efficiency, the nut cracking station would
need to be equipped with two centrifugal nut crackers; this equipment being
capable of handling the nuts of a throughput of up to 30 tons of ffb per hour.



SUPPLEMENT 5
Page 12
51.       For mills with a throughput ranging from 1.5 to 12 tons of ffb
per hour, in order to reduce investment cost a single nut cracker would
usually be installed. However, some of the small kernels would be shattered
and lost - thus reducing efficiency.
52.       Mills with a throughput of less than 1.5 tons of ffb per hour are
generally equipped with small nut crackers that are basically designed for
dura nuts that are not tufted. These nut-crackers though inexpensive give
poor results with tenera material and efficiency levels may drop to around
85%.
Separating the Lighter Part of the Shell Fragments from the Cracked Mixture
53.       The kernels and the small pieces of shell with tufts of fibers have
similar specific gravities and, therefore, cannot be separated by settlement.
However, their shape, and therefore their resistance to a current of air, is
markedly different. By exposing the cracked mixture to a vertical current
of air, the small pieces of shell and tufts of fiber are carried up and to
the boilers, whereas the kernels and the large fragments of shell drop down
to the clay baths or hydrocyclones for subsequent separation.
54.       Mills with a throughput of less than 1.5 tons of ffb per hour are
usually not equipped with a light particles separator. This means that the
light shell particles and the kernels have to be separated manually before
bagging.
Separation of the Kernels from the Large Shell Fragments
55.       For mills with a throughput of more than 6 tons of ffb per hour,
separation is made using hydrocyclones. The results are good, no labor is
needed but the energy consumption is high requiring an output of around 40
kilowatts.
56.       Hydrocyclones are therefore used only in mills that are large
enough (6 tons of ffb/hr and over) to have boilers and steam engines with
an efficiency high enough to deliver this power using their own fiber and
shell as fuel.
57.       For mills with a throughput of less than 6 tons of ffb per hour,
claybaths, which have a low energy consumption, are used for separating
kernels and shells. The density of the clay suspension is such that the
kernels float and the shells sink. The kernels are skimmed off, washed and
then dried.
58.       The claybath system involves considerable use of labor for the daily
preparation of the clay suspension, which has to be continually tested and
adjusted if necessary in order to ensure satisfactory separation.



SUPPLEMENT 5

Kernel Drying
59.       To avoid deterioration in storage, the water content of kernels has
to be reduced to about 7%. The dryer is essentially a vertical silo in which
warm air is injected at several levels. When drying, the temperature of the
kernels should not exceed 60°C in order to prevent oil losses. To achieve
this, the drying process has to be gradual and usually takes about 10 hours.
The kernels are fed into the top of the dryer and extracted at the base using
a mechanism that ensures an even flow through the system.
60.       For mills with a throughput of less than 1.5 tons of ffb per hour,
kernels are generally sun-dried. Sun drying involves labor for spreading
the kernels in thin layers and collecting each evening or in the event of rain.

B. Comparison of Processing Costs and Returns per ton of
ffb processed in mills of different types and sizes
62.       The production situation in terms of hectarage and location being
known, the problem of determining the type of processing system best suited
to the established production patterns becomes essentially a matter of
assessing:
(a)  the processing capacity required to handle the fruit produced;
(b)  the capital expenditure involved in establishing the
different processing systems;
(c)  the management costs for these processing systems;
(d)  the maintenance costs for the processing systems;
(e)  the transport costs involved in bringing the fruit to
the processing sites;
(f)  the cost of any road improvements required to facilitate
fruit collection; and
(g)  the relative extraction efficiencies of the different
processing systems.
Appendix 1 gives a comparison of processing costs (in 1973 terms) and returns
per ton of ffb for different types and sizes of mills, given a production
situation similar to that projected for the proposed smallholder project in
the East Central State.
63.       Assuming that at maturity the annual level of production reaches
about 160,000 tons, the various processing systems examined are:
(i)  a single central mill with a capacity of 40 tons/hour;
(ii)  two mills with capacities of 30 and 10 tons/hour respectively;
(iii)  two mills with capacities of 20 tons/hour each;
(iv)  four mills with capacities of 10 tons/hour each;
(v)  eight mills with capacities of 5/6 tons/hour each;
(vi)  60 rural oil palm kits with capacities of 0.8 tons/hour; and
(vii)  89 to 99 hydraulic hand presses with capacities of
just under 0.5 tons/hour.

64.       It is assumed that a two stage fruit collection system is used in
the case of all continuous screw press mills. This fruit collection system
essentially comprises using tractor/trailers to bring fruit bunches from the
farm-gate to central collection points from where fruit is transported by
truck to the mill sites. Assuming that the tractor/trailer costs remains
unchanged for all the screw press systems, Table 1 through 5 in Appendix 2
show that as the number of mills increases the cost of truck transportation
decreases--this being essentially due to the shorter haulages involved.
65.       With the "oil palm kit" and "hand hydraulic press" systems, fruit
collection is not costed as it is assumed that the bunches would be brought
directly to the mills by the producers. Though not costed, in fact, a
considerable amount of time and labor would be involved in bringing fruit
to the small mills. It must also be emphasized that with a large number
of small mills, the location of reliable water supplies could be a major
constraint. In addition, waste disposal in heavily populated areas would
be a serious problem.
66.       Column 1 Appendix 1 quotes figures given by S. C. Nwanze in the
Journal of West Africa Institute for Oil Palm Research (1965). Costs have
been updated to 1973 levels but some cost items such as management and spare
parts were not included and so total processing costs would be higher than
those quoted.
67.       Column 2 in Appendix 1 is based on results obtained in the Ilutitun
mill (near Okitipupa, Western State) from January to October 1973. This mill
has six Stork hydraulic hand presses, a mechanical digestor with sterilization
in boiling water or steam at atmospheric pressure. A diesel driven alternator
generates the power required by the digestor and nut-cracker.
68.       The rural oil palm kit has a capacity of 0.8 tons of ffb/hour and
uses the wet processes for oil extraction. The equipment includes two digestors
that are driven by diesel engine, a nut-cracker, a hand operated claybath for
separating kernels and shell fragments and a steam boiler for sterilization
and the clarification of the crude oil.
69.       The continuous screw press mills of capacities ranging from 6 to
40 tons of ffb/hour, are basically the same design, differing only in details
such as the number of nut-crackers (1 for the 5/6 and 10/12 tons/hour mills
with 2 for all other sizes). The kernel/shell fragment separators also
differ (claybaths for the 5/6 tons/hour mill and hydrocyclones for all others).
70.       From this analysis it is clear that there are considerable advantages
accruing to the large-scale mills with returns per ton of ffb processed ranging
from N 23.63 for the hydraulic hand press system to N 41.74 for the 40 ton/hour
continuous screw press mill.

C. Economic Returns to Investment When Using Small and
Large-Scale Mills
71.       The economic costs and benefits of a scheme involving the planting
of about 16,000 ha of smallholdings 1/ with high yielding material together with
establishing a fully integrated fruit collection and central processing system
are shown in Table 1, Appendix 4. With the same planting program, it might
be argued that large numbers of small-scale hand hydraulic processing units
are economically more "efficient" and therefore preferable to a fully
integrated fruit collection and central processing system employing large-
scale mills. The two systems are therefore compared.
Costs
72.       For purposes of comparison all costs of field establishment, field
maintenance, staff, headquarters and regional unit capital and recurrent
expenditure remain unchanged. The road improvement program will be required
for both systems being compared, as substantial quantities of oil will have
to be assembled from the large number of small processing units for distribution
to the large urban markets. On the assumption that transport costs per ton
of oil are the same as the transport costs per ton of ffb and assuming that
the hand hydraulic presses extract 19% oil to bunch then the oil assembly
costs in the area could be estimated at 19% of the fruit collection
costs. However, with larger quantities of fruit than oil and a well coordi-
nated fruit collection system, economies of scale would be expected in favor
of fruit. For purposes of this comparison, therefore, it has been assumed
that the assembly costs of oil from the small processing units, would be 25%
of the fruit collection costs for large central mills. Costs for
the development and processing of 16,000 ha of oil palm using small hand
hydraulic mills are given in Table 2 Appendix 4.
Benefits
73.       The large central mills are expected to achieve a 22Z extraction
rate from year 9 onwards 2/ and the project benefit stream is given in Table 1,
Appendix 4. Two streams of benefits have been calculated for the hand
hydraulic press systems applying oil to bunch extraction rates at full
maturity (year 9 and onwards) of 16% and 19% respectively. 3/ (Table 2,
Appendix 4.)
1/   This analysis is based on the actual East Central State Project.
2/   Year 0 is year of planting.
Extraction Rate (%):   4    5    6    7    8        9 onwards

3/   The following extraction rates have been used:
Extraction Rate (%)   16   17   18   19   19            19
Extraction Rate (%)   16   16   16   16   16            16

Comparison of Economic Rates of Return
74.       The rates of return for the small and large-scale processing systems
are given in Table 3, Appendix 4. Lven with the comparatively optimistic
assumption (19% extraction) for the small unit, the large central mills
system yields a higher rate of return.  In practice extraction rates in excess
of 16% are not likely to be achieved by small hand hydraulic mill operators.
From Table 3, Appendix 4, it can be seen that the rate of return for large
scale processing is 19.7% and for small scale processing 14.3% (assuming 19%
extraction rate) or 11.2% (assuming 16% extraction rate). Table 3, Appendix 4
also gives a sensitivity analysis of these rates of returns. From these figures
it becomes clear that the large central mills yield an economic rate of return
75% higher than that for the lhand hydraulic press operating at a 16% extraction
rate.
75.       The foregoing financial and economic analyses demonstrate the
advantages of large mills over small processing units both with respect to
returns to investment and the prices that producers can be paid for their
fruit.  WXhere nucleus estates have cr are to be established, additional oil
mill investment required to process outgrowers production is even lower than
the figures used above, since all the infrastructure and the bulk of civil
works will have been absorbed by the estates.

Basic Steam, Power and Water Requirements
for Mills of Varying Sizes
1.        Steam is required for sterilization, clarification and the dryers.
2.        Power is required for driving the equipment.
3.        Water is required for the boilers, clarification and the hydro-
cyclones or claybaths.
Steam Production
4.        Approximately 500 kg of steam are required to process 1 ton of ffb.
5.        For mills with a throughput of 10 tons of ffb/hr or more.  Boilers
would be of the water tube-type with forced draught. Their unit capacity
would range from 6 to 11 tons of steam per hour at a pressure of 20-22 kg
per cm2 and the steam would be overheated to about 300°C. The water and fuel
feed systems would be automatic and one fireman would be capable of operating
one boiler.
6.        For mills with a throughput between 3 and less than 10 tons of
ffb/hr. Boilers would be of the locomotive type with natural draught. Their
capacity per unit would be about 3 tons of steam per hour at 13 to 15 kg per
cm2. The water and fuel feed systems are usually automated and one fireman
operates one boiler.
7.        For mills with a throughput below 3 tons of ffb/hr.  Boilers would
be of the vertical "Field" type using natural draught. Their capacity per
unit would range from 600 kg to 1200 kg of saturated steam per hour at a
pressure of 8 to 12 kg per cm2. These boilers are manually stocked by one or
two firemen. The investment cost of the different types of boilers per ton
of steam/hour and consequently, per ton of ffb processed is practically the
same. h-owever, the smaller boilers have a lower thermal efficiency and they
produce steam at a lower pressure and temperature.

Power Production
8.        Mills with a capacity of 10 tons of ffb/hr or more are normally
equipped with water tube-type boilers providing overheated steam at 20 kg
per cm2. Part of the steam produced is used to drive turbo-alternators and
the exhaust steam from these turbines is not lost but is used for-processing.
As a result of this steam recovery and the high efficiency of the boilers,
no fuel problems arise and usually only part of the shells are required.
9.        Mills with a throughput between 3 and 10 tons of ffb/hr.  The steam
generated by the locomotive boilers is saturated and at a pressure that is
too low to drive turbines. The power is generated by steam engines driving
medium speed alternators (500-750 rpm). Again the exhaust steam is recovered
for use in processing but as the efficiency of the smaller boilers as well as
the engines is lower than the efficiency of the equipment used in the larger
mills, all the fibers and shells are required for fuel.
10.       For mills with a throughput of less than 3 tons of ffb/hr.  Due to
the low efficiency of the Field type boilers and the low pressure of their
steam, power cannot be generated by steam engines. This means that diesel
engines have to be installed to drive the equipment.
Water Requirements
11.       Mills require 1 ton of water per ton of ffb processed; half of it
for the boilers and the balance for the hydrocyclones or claybaths. The
water pumps are proportionately cheaper for the large mills but their more
sophisticated boilers require expensive water treatment plants.

OIL PALM  PROJECTS
Field Studies of Small-Scale Processing Systems in Wild Palm Groves
1.        The wild palm groves will continue to be a major source of Nigeria's
palm oil for many years and there is a need to examine ways of improving the
extraction of oil and kernels from this source.
2.        NIFOR/UNDP have set up a program which includes -- "the development
and building and testing of a complete range of small scale equipment." How-
ever, the program does not appear to include studying processing systems
specifically adapted to meeting the needs of wild palm groves.
3.        After discussions with the Director of NIFOR and the UNDP project
manager, it was agreed that there is a need to establish field studies of
processing systems geared to meeting the needs of the existing wild palm grove
production.
4.        These studies would be implemented by the NIFOR/UNDP program and
would aim at:
(a) establishing simple but complete processing systems adapted
to the production conditions of the wild palm groves;
(b) making comparisons between the dry and wet process of oil
extraction by installing units such as the Vandekerckhove
Rural Oil Palm Kit, the Wecker Hydraulic Press and the
Hydraulic Hand Press; and
(c) evaluating such systems from the point of view of their
technical, economic and socioeconomic suitability under
actual field conditions.
5.        The following are some broad guidelines to the type of research
program that should be undertaken:
(a) The Wet Process, using the Vandekerckhove Rural Oil Palm Kit.
(i) making a comparison between sterilization in an auto-
clave under high pressure steam and sterilization under
atmospheric pressure using locally made equipment:
(ii)  determining the most effective digesting cycle in
relation to the duration and quantity of water added;



SUPPLEMENT 6
Page 2
(iii) separation of oil from the sludge. Assessing the value
of a second boiling and settling tank.  Timing the
operations and making an assessment of the water require-
ments;
(Iv) Pn"ArAtfon of the fiber from the nuts using a simple
but efficient process that reduces handling - this could
probably be done using a rotating screen or a blower; and
(v) establishing an efficient nut-cracking process; to include
assessing the most effective autoclaving cycle and sub-
sequently the speed at which the nut cracker should operate.
(b) The Dry Process
(i) examining the scope for operating the hydraulic hand press
using a mechanically driven pump (to reduce the manual
labor input) and comparing the results with those pre-
viously obtained at NIFOR; and
(ii) developing a simple digester for the preparation of the
fruit in order to replace the heavy labor element involved
in normal pounding.
6.        If the dry processing gives good results with wild grove fruit, then
it might be justifiable to carry out further studies using the Wecker hydraulic
press. As in the wet process program, studies should be made to determine the
most efficient way to sterilize the fruit; separate the fibre from nuts; and
cracking the nuts.
7.        All these technical studies should be made using Dura fruit from
wild palm groves. It must be emphasized that the design of processing systems
used in the wild grove areas should be simple and robust in order to keep
the mechanical skill required for operation and maintenance to a comparatively
unsophisticated level.
8.        Prior to installing any type of processing system in the wild grove
areas, the equipment would have to be tested at NIFOR to assess its suitability
and determine the most appropriate methods to be used in the field.
9.        Economic Research would comprise making cost/benefit analyses for
the different processing systems, carrying out studies to determine the size
and number of processing units required for any given area.  Assessing
farmer response to the in-troduction of these units and measuring their
economic and social impact in the areas concerned.
10.       Training.  A program of practical training should be developed at
NIFOR to enable the small processing units to be built and operated in the
selected areas. When the units have been built, on the spot training should
be given to local people so that eventually these systems can be taken over
and run on communal/co-operative lines.

Estimated Costs of Program
11.       The technical staff for these studies would be provided by the
UNDP/NIFOR program and the estimates given below only relate to the
purchase of equipment and running costs for 6-month operation. The
estimates can only be considered as tentative in that precise details
of the type of processing units to be finally established cannot be
assessed at this juncture.
12.       The cost of a Vanderkerckhove rural oil palm kit, installed in
an existing building, such as an old abandoned pioneer mill, would be
about N 50,000. Two such sites were located by the appraisal mission:
- near Okwohia on the river Onuiyin north and west of Umuahia;
- near Ikeuebara on the river Mba north and east of Owerri.
The actual price of a Wecker hydraulic press is not known, but it would be
higher than the rural oil palm kit and for estimation purposes is costed
at N 60,000. Details of the capital and recurrent expenditure for these
field studies are given in Appendix 1 together with capital expenditure for
equipment required for the NIFOR training center.

OIL PALM PROJECTS
Road Improvement
Introduction
1.        All three States (Western State, Mid-Western State, and East Central
State) have well developed communication systems consisting of roads, navig-
able rivers, and railroads. Domestic air services are provided by Nigerian
Airways. 1/
2.        Federal "A" roads provide trunk links between the Federal and State
capitals, other large towns, ports, and neighboring countries. They were built
by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Lagos, but are maintained by
the State authorities acting as executing agents for the Federal Government.
The 2-lane paved roads are generally in good condition.
3.        The "B" roads (Western State 2,300 km, Mid-Western State 2,400 km,
and East Central State 2,150 km) are State trunk roads, connecting the State
capital with larger towns and divisional headquarters. They are constructed
and maintained by the State Ministries of Works and Transport. Although the
formation of the roads is built to a 2-lane standard, only one lane is paved,
which creates maintenance problems at the shoulders caused by passing and
overtaking vehicles. The roads are not well maintained and need urgent
improvement. Most of the bridges in Mid-Western and East Central States are
"temporary" Bailey-bridges, which were erected after the civil war and have
not been replaced by permanent new bridges.
4.        The States have extensive networks of earth roads (Western State
9,500 km, Mid-Western State 6,000 km, and East Central State 15,000 km) which
connect the many villages with each other and with the trunk road network.
The roads were built by the State Ministries of Works and Transport and handed
over to the local authorities for maintenance. The roads were designed to a
very low standard--in effect, narrow tracks that are barely passable for
vehicles--and are today in poor condition.
5.        The State Ministries of Works and Transport are in charge of "A",
"B", and some of the earth roads. These ministries are understaffed, their
organization is not efficient, and shortage of funds has resulted in poor
road maintenance.
6.        There is no formal machinery for coordination or consultation
between the Federal and State Governments on matters concerning roads. The
Federal Government has no direct control over the State's highway expendi-
tures, not even over the funds provided for the maintenance of Federal
roads by the State's Ministries of Works and Transport.
1/   More detailed descriptions are in the appraisal reports.



SUPPLEMENT 7
Page 2
7.        The Federal and the State authorities are both aware of the problem
and in 1968 commissioned the Danish consulting firm KAMPSAX to undertake a
study of the trunk road situation. KAIPSAX recommended that both "A" and
"B" roads should be the responsibility of the Federal Government. It also
recommended that administration should consist of an autonomous Federal
highway administration with a highway department in each state responsible
for the construction and maintenance of all trunk roads. The re-classification
of the trunk "A"r roads according to the "grid" proposed by KAMPSAX has been
effected and interministerial discussions on the organization of highway
authorities as a separate agency are now underway.
Paved Roads
8.        The paved roads within the project areas are mostly class "B"
roads, built to the standard of a 2-lane highway with a 24 ft wide carriage-
way and 8 ft shoulders. However, only one land (12 ft) of the carriageway
has been paved, as a result of which vehicles must drive on the shoulders
while meeting and overtaking other vehicles. The shoulders, which consist
mostly of laterite, but also of earth taken directly from the roadside,
have been compacted by the traffic only. Even at a moderate flow of traffic,
the shoulders quickly subside and the edges of the pavement gradually break
off until most of the pavement has vanished.
9.        Moreover, the roads were built 12 to 15 years ago and due to lack
of maintenance they are rapidly deteriorating. The reason for the poor
condition of today's paved roads can be summarized as follows:
(a) the low standard to which the roads were originally designed
and built;
(b) the increase in axle load during the lifetime of the road:
today 8 tons for single axle and 12 tons for tandem;
(c) shortage of maintenance funds and equipment;
(d) organizational disruption following the creation of the
12 new states;
(e) administrative delays in providing maintenance funds; and
(f) poor management, low standards of workmanship and material
control.
10.       As a result, the paved roads are today characterized by potholes
in the paved surface, deteriorated shoulders and shallow ditches. Water-
logging during heavy rains leads to seepage into the pavement,.which in
time seriously weakens the base and results in the pavement breaking up.
In some cases, the pavement has deteriorated completely, resulting in a
very rough surface and, consequently, poor drainage.



SUPPLEMENT 7
Page 3
1?.       For most of the paved roads within the project areas, immediate
stres are needed to prevent further deterioration. Where the surface is
Gt.i3l int-act  the potholes should be cleaned and filled with good granular
material, sealed with bituminous mix and compacted with a light roller or
.ardcontrolled vibrator.  The same proceaure should be applied to the
4zsrZ-oaut edges of the pavement. Where potholes are too numerous, it might
Oe cheaper tc re-seal the whole surface.  The shoulders need to be reshaped
4w1th fresh material and compacted, the ditches must be cleaned and deepened
1n order to allow  a quick runoff of the rainwater from the carriageway.  The
costs of these repairs would amount to about N 1,200 to N 1,800 per kilometer.
aowever, it should be emDhasized that the above steps must be
considered as a temporary remedial measure. The roads were originally
bui-it to a standard which does not lend itself to the actual increase in
tcaf2ic th^t, has occurred.  Base failures will soon occur, resulting in
undulation and finally breakup of the pavement. In thie long run, it will
hb necessary to scarify the remaining pavement, provide a new base and
rerave the surface as a 2-lane paved carriageway. The cost of such a
reconstruction would amount to N 30,000 to 40,000 per kilometer.
13.       An efficient trunk road network is essential to an effective oil
2alr, fruit collection system. it would, therefore, be prudent to ensure
th,at government estimates provide for the funds necessary for repairs and/or
recoaztraction on the lines indicated above.
Earth Roads
14.       General.  The existing earth roads have varying but generally
ine.uificient jungle clearance and are, in effect, narrow tracks with no
shoulders or ditches, and with rutted and rough surfaces. The alignment
is usually good and can be retained, but the tracks will have to be reshaped
into low-cost all-weather roads of proper design.
15.       Design Standards.  The design standards to which the new earth
roads should be built are indicated in the chart attached to this Supplement
where a cross section of the road is shown. The carriageway should be 3.60 m
with shoulders of 1 m on each side. To enable the runoff of the rainwater
from the carriageway to form a sheet of water of uniform depth, so as to keep
the infiltration and the gullying to a minimum, the side slopes should be about
4 to 5%, giving the road a camber of 15 to 20 cm.
16.       The ditches made by a bulldozer should be given a V-shape, with
the bottom of the ditch at least 60 cm lower than the crown of the carriage-
way to prevent seepage into the formation. Natural outlets for the rain-
water collected in the ditches are essential. Construction of culverts in
proper locations will help solve the drainage problem.
17.        in order to obtain a quick dry-out of the road surface after a
rainstorm, trees and underbrushes on each side of the road should be cleared
111d-a enough to leave the formation of the road properly exposed to air and

sunshine so that the evaporation of moisture from the road surface is
accelerated. The road formation should also be outside the drip line of
the trees.
18.       Cost of Reconstruction.  The upgrading of earth roads to the stand-
ards discussed above would be done by a construction team 1/ or contractors 2/
working under the supervision of a road engineer and his staff.  Costs ex-
cluding supervision and depreciation, are estimated as follows:
(a) N 360/km for improving an existing earthroad to tractor/trailer
standards.
(b) N 560/km for improving an existing earthroad to truck standard.
(c)  N 430/km for constructing a new earthroad to tractor/trailer
standards.
(d)  N 610/km for constructing a new earthroad to truck standard.
If depreciation is included, the above costs are respectively N495, N 675,
N545, and N 725.
19.       The construction should be done as follows.  After trees and
underbrush have been cleared away, the road surface should be scarified,
the top soil being removed by a bulldozer. The rotovator, pulled by a
tractor, loosens the soil; then the bulldozer cuts the ditches and moves
the earth towards the center of the road, gradually building up the formation.
Additional material, if required, is hauled by two tippers. Each layer of
the formation is compacted by a roller. A grader is then used to establish
the final profile of the road.
20.       Concrete pipes should be used for culverts.  They must be placed
on a sand-filled cushion, the trench filled with the excavated material and
thoroughly compacted. Box culverts constructed of hardwood could also be
used; if properly maintained, such culverts have the same lifetime as the
road.
Road Maintenance
21.       A properly maintained road reduces vehicle operating costs and
permits higher speeds and hence better utilization of vehicle time.  Good
maintenance of the roads within the project area is essential for the
economic operation of the fruit collection system.
22.       The paved roads, once repaired or reconstructed, should be regularly
inspected. Potholes should immediately be filled; shoulders kept level with
the pavement; and roadside ditches cleaned at monthly intervals. The annual
costs of maintaining a paved road would amount to about N 600/km.
1/   In case of the Mid-Western State and East Central State.
2/   In case of the Western State.



SUPPLEMENT 7
Page 5
23.       Earth roads are more sensitive to proper maintenance than paved
roads. Surface undulation being the most common problem, even with light
traffic. Therefore, after heavy rain, a grader should be used to smooth
out undulations, fill the ruts and the potholes, and bring the displaced
material back to the carriageway thus restoring the camber. The grader
should at the same time reshape the shoulders and clean the ditqhes. The
annual cost of maintaining an earthroad would amount to about N 100/km.
Administration of the Construction Program 1/
24.       The earth roads program would require experience and skills which
are in short supply in Nigeria. Neither the State Ministries of Works and
Transport nor the consultants in the States (whether local or foreign) appear
to have wide experience in building and maintaining all-weather earth roads.
However, the timber companies, which construct such roads for extraction
purposes, have personnel with adequate qualifications.
25.       A road engineer should be engaged to organize and supervise the
road construction program, assisted by two supervisors and two clerks. The
road engineer should have wide experience in the construction of low-cost,
all-weather earthroads and be recruited preferably from the timber exploiting
companies.
26.       The improvement of the earthroads could be executed by a construction
team or contractor working under the supervision of the road engineer. In case
of a construction team the equipment could, after completion of the work, be
handed over to the PWD on the understanding that it would be used exclusively
for the maintenance of the roads within the project area. The repair of the
bridges would be undertaken by the lncal contractors.
1/   Cost calculations are in the appraisal reports.

Fruit Collection
1.        In planning a collection system for delivering the smallholder's
fruit to the central mills, a combination of factors has to be considered.
Firstly, the successful operation of a fully integrated central mill neces-
sitates establishing a regular flow of fruit from the field to the mill
reception center. To achieve this, all fruit collection and mill delivery
systems should be controlled by the central mill. Secondly, the system has
to cater for large numbers of relatively small production units that may
be located at distance ranging up to 40 kilometers from the mill. Thirdly,
oil palm fruit bunches are bulky and quite heavy (large bunches of Tenera
material weighing up to 20 kilos each) which makes it both difficult and
time consuming for producers to deliver fruit directly to the mill. This
means that bunches have to be picked up either at the farm gate or at
producer collecting points that are within reasonable head porterage
distance. In the proposed projects the maximum distance that participating
smallholders would have to carry fruit to a roadside pick-up point would
be about 600 meters. Fourthly, in order to keep the build-up of free fatty
acid to a minimum it is essential that fruit is transported to the mill
rapidly and that handling procedures reduce fruit damage to a minimum.
Finally, fruit handling systems must also provide quick, accurate and
reliable means of loading and weighing individual producers' fruit bunches.
2.        Choice with regard to the type of vehicles to be used for fruit
collection, i.e., trucks, tractor/trailers or a combination of both, depends
largely on the condition of the existing road network and the distances
involved. Tractor/trailers can be operated effectively for relatively
short hauls of 5-6 kml on roads that are not suitable for all-weather use by
6-7 ton trucks. For distances ranging from 6 to 20 km trucks which are
faster, but require better roads, are considered more suitable than tractor/
trailers for direct fruit pick-up. Where a high proportion of road surfaces
are paved, trucks would be more suitable than tractor/trailers for even
longer hauls. However, in circurnstances where the average haulage involves
distances of around 30 kIn or more, a combination of tractor/trailers and
trucks involving a two-stage system with central collection points is more
economical.
3.        Xechanized loading on to trucks or tractor/trailers would be done
using rear mounted cranes fitted with built-in scales that would register
the weight of individual smallholders' fruit at the pick-up point. The use
of cranes and nets reduces loading time which in turn leads to better utili-
zation of collection vehicles and eliminates individual handling of fruit



SUPPLEMENT 8
Page 2
bunches thus reducing fruit damage and the build-up of free fatty acid.
Estates in Malaysia that have used this system report a 57% reduction in fruit
collection and transportation costs. Observations made during appraisal
indicate that the average cost of fruit collection and transportation from
smallholders in the Sapele area of Mid-Western State, using manual loading,
amounted to over N 1.00 per ton. Alternative estimates show that fruit
collection and transportation costs can be reduced by about 25% when mechanized
loading is used (see Appendix 1).
4.        Harvested fruit bunches would be heaped in nets on the road side
to await collection on a scheduled day. Nets would be delivered to the
smallholders according to a predetermined timetable geared to the harvesting
pattern of the areas involved. Smallholders would be notified well in advance
of any changes in the collection schedule. The trucks would be accompanied
by two special laborers. One of the laborers would stay on the truck, un-
hook the net from the crane, remove and stow away the emptied nets and stack
the bunches. The other laborer would be responsible for attaching the filled
nets to the crane. The driver, who would be in overall charge of the collec-
tion, would grade the fruit, operate the crane, record the weight and issue
a receipt to the seller. The receipt would record the weight, grade and
price to be paid.
5.        Because palm fruit bunches tend to have a high volume/weight ratio,
the trucks should have high-sided platforms in order to provide an effective
carrying capacity of 7 tons of ffb. If loose fruits have to be loaded and
weighed separately from fruit bunches, additional time would be required at
each pickup. To avoid such unnecessary delays, it is recommended that collec-
tion nets have meshes that are not larger than 1 cm x 1 cm, thus enabling
loose fruits and fruit bunches to be loaded and weighed simultaneously. The
weighing scales should be robust, of simple construction, and easy to maintain
to acceptable limits of accuracy in the field. As the smallholders are to be
paid on the basis of the weight loaded at roadside pick-up points, it is
important that they understand and have confidence in the whole proceddre.
6.        The estate fruit collection system would essentially be the same
as that used for smallholders. Harvesting would be done by harVesting
teams. Through the use of nets and cranes with built-in scales, the fruit
bunches of individual harvesting teams would be weighed at the harvesting
platforms.
7.        Costs of smallholder and estate fruit collection following procedures
outlined above are in the appraisal reports.

With a manual loading system it took an average of two hours 20 minutes to
load one 5/6-ton trailer. With mechanical loading it was possible to reduce
the time taken to load the same trailer to an average of 28 minutes (i.e.,
five times as fast) and the cost of loading and transporting of fruit to
the mill was reduced by 57%.

The following table presents a comparison between fruit collection
costs using mechanical loading and manual loading. The data for manual

Smallholder Operational Procedures
1.        The project would aim at confining participation under the Grant/
Credit scheme to genuine operating farmers, with the minimum size qualifying
for inclusion being 1 ha and the maximum confined to 10 ha. The minimum
of 1 ha is considered to be the smallest area that it is administratively
practical to accept under the project. The maximum of 10 ha of oil palm would
provide employment for an extended farm family and allow it some time for
the cultivation of food crops. Where land is owned communally, a maximum
of 10 ha would be applied to each identifiable farm family unit within the
community.
2.        Notices calling for applications from smallholders and giving
details of where forms can be obtained would be published through such media
as local newspapers, radio and public administration offices, such as community
centers. In order to facilitate the concentration of field staff, particularly
in the year of planting when the heaviest intensity of farm visits is required,
a zonal approach to development would be used. In any given year, applica-
tions for replanting/new planting would be restricted to specific zones within
the project area.  Allowance for any shortfall in applications from a given
primary zone could be catered for by having an adjacent reserve zone from
which applications could be requested but only be accepted in the event of
there being a shortfall in the primary zone. To allow adequate time for
applications to be filled and submitted by smallholders and appraised by
SMU (TCU) technical staff, applications would be called for at the beginning
of January of the year preceding planting and the closing date would be the
end of March in the same year. Where applicable, the zones would be selected
so as to coincide with the future location of the central fruit collection
points. Agricultural Assistants (AA) will be the field staff in direct and
continuous contact with the farmers and the aim should be to allocate these
men to farms that are relatively close to one another, thereby reducing
travelling time during farm visits and also facilitating the organization of
demonstrations and group discussion activities. Field staff requirements have
been derived using the following assumptions:
(a) one AA for every 80 ha in the year of planting - at an
average size of 2 ha per smallholding, this would mean
about 40 holdings per AA. At 4 farm visits per day for
5 days, the AA could visit each holding every 2 weeks;
(b) one AA for every 240 ha during the rest of the establishment
period (3 years from planting). At 6 farm visits per day,
the AA could visit each holding once every month;
(c) one AA for every 400 ha in maturity.



SUPPLEIENT 9

3.        When an application has been approved under a given annual replanting/
new planting program, the field operations pertaining to the first year of
planting must be completed within the year to which the approval refers. At
the end of each year, the approvals should be deemed to have lapsed in respect
of the whole or part of any areas so approved, which have not been planted/
replanted. The applicant would, however, be at liberty to submit a new appli-
cation for any ensuing annual program for the specific area or zone in respect
of such unplanted areas.
4.        Grants/Credits would be made in respect of approved applications
for replanting/new planting in accordance with any general or specific in-
structions which the SMU(TCU) may from time to time prescribe. Grant/Credit in
cash or kind would only be made in respect of areas planted according to the
standards specified by the SMU(TCU). In all instances payments in cash or kind
would only be made subject to a field inspection report verifying that accepta-
ble husbandry standards had been attained. Loan repayments would be deducted
from the fresh fruit bunch sales proceeds according to the conditions specified
in a loan agreement (see Supplement 10).



SUPPLEMENT 10

OIL PALM PROJECTS
Grant/Credit Arrangements with Smallholders
1.        Background.  In the Oil Palm Rehabilitation Scheme introduced in
the early 1960s and continued until the outbreak of civil war, smallholders
received grants comprising (a) N 100 per ha in cash towards the cost of land
clearing and compensation for income lost, and (b) planting material and
fertilizers valued at N 10 per ha. The Mid-Western and East Central State
propose continuing grants to smallholders for replanting/new planting
including (a) planting material and fertilizers for crop establishment, and
(b) N 50 per ha in cash towards the cost of clearing and compensation for
the loss of crop. (The South East State has introduced a similar rehabilita-
tion scheme, but has increased the cash payment to N 100 per ha.)
2.        If Nigeria is to avoid becoming a major importer of palm oil, the
old wild groves must be replanted with high yielding material. Past producer
prices for palm oil have been substantially below world prices. The surpluses
accruing to Marketing Boards have been largely used for development in other
sectors; farmers have been unable to accum:ulate the savings th&y need to re-
plant their farms. In addition, farmers suffer loss of income when old palms
are removed, or other crops displaced, to allow new planting or replanting.
3.        In previous rehabilitation programs, smallholders had been allowed
to leave up to 20 palms standing until the new palms came into bearing. In
the proposed projects, all old trees would be removed before planting to avoid
the severe root competition and reduced light effect that results from leaving
some of the old trees standing. In addition, because of the poor discipline
maintained by smallholders with respect to encroachment into the root system
areas of the young palms, the practice of intercropping during the first two
years of planting is not recommended. The introduction of these strict
technical standards would necessitate providing adequate compensation for
loss of income through the cash element of the grant/credit package if the
producers are to respond in the manner anticipated.
4.        Establishment Costs.  Estimated total costs of smallholder clearing,
planting and establishment (at end 1973/beginning 1974 actual prices; and
fertilizers and chemicals not at subsidized but at full cost) are as follows:

Grant/Credit Terms
5.        Once accepted into the scheme, the farmer, provided he attained the
husbandry standards required, would receive the inputs needed to establish
and maintain his holding. The necessary means include both cash (for hiring
additional labor) and materials, of which the latter account for about 55%
of total establishment costs over Years - 1 to 3.
6.        For reasons both of accounting simplicity and of presentation to
the farmer, it is proposed to treat the provision of materials for planting
as a straight grant by the SMU (TCU) and the cash assistance as a medium-term
loan. Thus, of the total grant/credit 'package' offered by the project,
almost two-thirds would be given as grant and the balance as loan; grant/
credit would cover over 80% of estimated total establishment costs, the
remainder (part of the labot required and hand tools) being provided by
smallholders.

to be maintained at the rate of 50%.
7.        The annual phasing of the cash assistance is intended both to
reflect the labor required and to maintain an incentive to the smallholder
during the years before his planting comes into bearing. Part of the high
payment in Year 0 could in practice be used by him for 'retroactive financing'
of labor hired for clearing, and N 20 per ha would therefore be paid early
in Year 0 at or just before the time of planting. In all instances the cash
payments or supply of materials would be subject to a field inspection report
verifying that acceptable husbandry standards had been attained.
8.        The cash credit would be granted at a rate of interest of 9.5%
for 13 years from planting, including a 7-year grace period during which
interest would be capitalized. Indebtedness would thus reach N 160 per ha
by the end of the grace period. Equal annual installments over 6 years would
then be N 36.21 per ha; for simplicity, repayment would be by deductions (at
a monthly rate equivalent to N 3.00 per ha) from value of fruit bunch sales
to the mill.
9.        The rate of loan repayment proposed would allow a very satisfactory
net return per ha to the grower on prices assumed. (See the appraisal reports
for details.)



SUPPLEMENT 10
Page 4
Short-Term Credit
10.       Short-term credit would be made available for nonlabor maintenance
inputs - particularly fertilizers - during the mature stage. Interest would
be charged at 9.5% with repayment in twelve equal monthly installments commenc-
ing one month after disbursement.
11.       The majority of smallholders involved in oil palm cultivation also
grow food crops. The introduction of credit in the proposed project would
establish an institutional framework for credit which could also be used to
provide participating farmers with the credit needs of other enterprises such
as food crops, using palm fruit sales as a collateral. Once smallholders
have established their palms, SMU (TCU) would aim to hand over the provision
of short-term credit for regular inputs to the cooperatives themselves as
soon as practicable.
Arrangements for Grant/Credit Distribution
12.       SMU (TCU) would be responsible for channelling materials and cash
to the smallholders. To be eligible for project grant/credit assistance,
smallholders would be required to be members of a registered Cooperative
Society. 1/ SMU (TCU) staff would appraise the applicants for technical suit-
ability and would assess their creditworthiness after consultation with the
cooperative society concerned. Applications would be reviewed and approved
by a Planting Authorization Committee (PAC) composed of the General Manager
as chairman, the Controller of Field Operations, the Controller of Finance
and a representative of the cooperative societies.
13.       Successful applicants would sign a three-party loan agreement with
their cooperative 1/ and with SMU (TCU), set out in accordance with Federal
and State legal requirements and acceptable to the Bank. The Loan Agreement
would stipulate the amount, terms, conditions and schedule of loan repayments
and would include an undertaking by the smallholder to sell his fresh fruit
bunches (ffb) to the central processing mill.
14.       The grant/credit assistance would be limited to a minimum of 1 ha
and a maximum of 10 ha per farm family. Credit payments would be made directly
to smallholders at SMU (TCU) headquarters or regional unit offices. Delivery
of grant-provided materials for planting would be made directly to smallholders
by SMU (TCU) vehicles. The procedures involved in grant/credit distribution
are summarized in Appendix 1.
15.       Credit facilities would be provided through SMU (TCU) in conjunction
with registered cooperatives since an institutional framework for agricultural
credit is not yet sufficiently established in the project area. In addition,
both the small scale of the credit operation relative to SMU (TCU) other costs
1/   In the Western State the Western State Farmers Union (WSFU), if organized,
funded and staffed in the forms acceptable to the Bank, would participate
in the project as the cooperatives. The word cooperative therefore
includes reference to WSFU for the Western State.

and its close relationship with SMU (TCU) technical supervision function make
it desirable for credit disbursement, accounting and recovery to be handled
within SMU (TCU). The smallholders loan accounts would be integrated with
the accounts and statistical research maintained for the grant scheme and for
the purpose of evaluating the progress of the project. Since the additional
cost of maintaining the loan accounts would thus be relatively small, the
cost of the staff and equipment required would be borne by SMU (TCU) (see
Appendix 2).
Arrangements for Credit Collection
16.       It is proposed to use registered Cooperative Societies as a medium
for credit collection, and to restrict participation in the smallholder scheme
to their members, for the following reasons:
(a) they offer the best assurance of individual credit
worthiness;
(b) they will provide a mutual guarantee of loan repayment,
since it is not feasible to rely on distraint of land or
property for loan recovery;
(c) by involvement in the project, the cooperatives would be
given a direct interest in representing smallholders'
interests on the SMU (TCU) Steering Committee, on the
Planting Authorization Committee (PAC), and on the Price
Formulation Committee, all of which would include a
representative of the State cooperative movement;
(d) involvement in the project would act as an important
stimulus to the further development of community/
cooperative group activities in smallholder agriculture,
which are already playing an active role; and
(e) payment to the societies of a margin in recognition of
their loan repayment guarantees should benefit them
financially (provided their members maintain a satisfactory
rate of repayment) (see Appendix 3).
17.       The processing mills, which are to be operated by separate commercial
entities, would provide the SMU (TCU) with a bi-weekly summary of bunch pur-
chases and a check for the full value thereof.  The SMU (TCU) Accounting Unit
would check this against its own copies of bunch purchase slip (bps) and,
when verified, would analyze by cooperative society and individual smallholder,
to determine the amount of loan repayments due.  S3U (TCU) would then credit
each Society's account with the value of its members' bunch sales during the
previous month, less credit repayments due calculated on the basis of an
interest rate of 7.5% (N 2.50 per ha planted per month over Years 7 to 12).



SUPPLEMENT 10

18.       On receipt of funds to its account, each Society would then pay
the net amounts owing to its members after deduction of credit repayments
on the basis of the full interest rate proposed for the smallholder loans
of 9.5% (N 3.00 per ha planted per month over Years 7-12).
19.       The cooperative societies would also be the channel through which
smallholders would receive any bonus paid by the central mills for fruit
bunch purchases.
20.       The procedures involved in credit repayment are summarized in
Appendix 4.

Smallholder Grant/Credit - Distribution (Years-1 to 3)
1.   Smallholder applies to join scheme.
2.   SMU (TCU) inspects holding, consults with cooperative society on credit
rating.
3.  A.   If Eupatorium infestation was under 30%, PAC reviews
application, considering report on 2.
B.   If Eupatorium infestation was over 30%, PAC would not
review application. Smallholder would be advised to
clear his holding and would be instructed that the best
way to do this would be to clear by taking a crop on
this land. However, the smallholder could request a second
inspection in December/January and if his holding is
completely cleared, PAC would review his application.
4.   If accepted, the smallholder, cooperative and S4U (TCU) sign
three-party Loan Agreement (including Promissory Note).
5.   PAC authorizes planting (1 - 10 ha per family).
6.   SMU (TCU) issues first cash payment (N 20 per ha) after clearing and
delivers first materials for planting.
7.   SMU (TCU) continues to supply materials as appropriate, subject to
acceptable progress reports and regular inspection from field
assistants.
8.   Each smallholder's participation in scheme reviewed annually by
PAC (based on inspection reports by field assistants) and
terminated if necessary, after adequate warnings given.
9.   On satisfactory annual review by PAC, SHu (TCU) issues annual cash
payments in arrear.
10. After the establishment period, when plantings start producing
at least 2 tons/ha in Year 4, SMU (TCU) makes available seasonal
inputs (viz. fertilizer) on short-term credit to smallholder,
if required. Loan Agreement endorsed by smallholder, cooperative
and SMU (TCU). Short-term credit probably not required after Year 8,
when full yield attained.

Grant/Credit Accounting Control for Smallholders
1.        SMU (TCU) would have to maintain separate accounts for individual
smallholders (analyzed by cooperative society) to record the following basic
information:
(a) disbursement of grant components in kind during the
establishment period;
(b) disbursement of medium-term credit in cash during the
establishment period;
(c) disbursement of seasonal credit in maturity (Year 4
from planting);
(d) weight, grade and value of fresh fruit bunches sold
to the mill by dates;
(e) deductions made for the repayment of medium-term and
seasonal credit;
(f) block payments to cooperatives.
2.        SMU (TCU) would have to maintain smallholder accounts, each requirlng
4 - 5 entries per year during the development period and 25 per year when
harvesting commences. Since the recording requirements would be too numerous
to be done manually, provision would be made for mechanical recording on
individual cards using simple accounting machines each capable of registering
about 10,000 entries per month. These machines can be operated by a specially
trained typist. Number of smallholder accounts and machines needed are given
below.

Financial Effect on Cooperatives
1.        On the proposed phasing of distribution and repayment of the
smallholder loans of N 100 per hectare, repayments due from the smallholder
to his cooperative are at N 3.00 per hectare per month over 72 months, based
on an interest rate of 9.5%. If the cooperatives are charged interest at
a rate of only 7.5%, in recognition of their guarantee of loan repayments
by their members, then their monthly obligation to SMU (TCU) in respect of
members' planted area under the scheme amounts to only N 2.50 per hectare
per month. Thus with no default on members' repayments to the cooperatives,
the Societies would gain a margin of N 0.50 per month or N 6.00 per year
over the 6-year repayment period.
2.        This margin is, in fact, sufficient to cover current repayment
obligations to SMU (TCU) with a rate of default or arrears of up to 16.6%
of members' own repayments. Net margin (loss) per hectare to cooperatives
at different rates of default/arrears are shown below.

/1   The net margin for any intervening or higher rate of default can be
calculated as follows y - 6.0 - 36.x;
y - net margin (loss)
6.0 = annual margin to cooperatives at no default (N 36.00-N30.00 - N 6.00)
36 - annual repayments by smallholder to cooperative (N 36.00)
x = percentage default.
Thus, provided that members' early repayments performance was reasonably
satisfactory (default of not more than say 5%) the cooperatives would fairly
soon accumulate surpluses to their account sufficient to tide them over any
temporary decline in members' bunch sales to the mill, due for instance to
seasonal low yields, and allow them to maintain full payment of their obliga-
tions both to SMU (TCU) and to growers. The importance of regular and prompt

cash payments to the smallholders is one of the main reasons for maintaining
a 2% interest-spread in favor of the cooperatives.
3.        Based on the smallholder planting programs proposed for the three
projects, Table 1 summarizes the annual and cumulative effect of the credit
arrangements on the cooperative movement finances in the three States, on
assumed default rates of 0, 5, 10 and 15% (16.6% default marks break-even
point for cooperatives).
4.        Table 1 shows that even with default on smallholder repayments of
5%, the cooperatives in all three States should accumulate sizable cash
surpluses as a consequence of the margin allowed to them on credit repayments
to SMU (TCU). By the time, annual repayments reached their peak (project
year 11), they would be in a position to have accumulated a cash reserve
approximately equal to three months' repayments due to SMU (TCU). With satis-
factory repayment performance by smallholders, surpluses over and above a
prudent level of reserves would be available for financing of seasonal credit
requirements or distribution to members whose accounts were in good standing.
Distribution of mill bonuses through the cooperatives would also assist in
maintaining a high rate of repayments to the cooperative and thus sustain
their cash-flow position.

Training
1.        Technical training at all-levels will comprise a very important
sector of project activity. To ensure an effective start-up in 1975, inten-
sive training in selected spheres such as nursery and field planting tech-
niques will need to be started as soon as possible. The type of training
involved can be divided into four basic categories: Senior Officers, Nur-
sery Staff, Field Staff, and Farmer Training. A schedule and estimate of
the cost of training are given in the appraisal reports.
2.        Senior Staff.  Senior officers (Agricultural Officer or above)
would be given 6 months refresher training in field planting techniques and
management methods. These officers would be attached to large scale oil palm
development schemes or commercial estates where appropriate husbandry standards
were practiced. The scope for meeting these training requirements is somewhat
limited in Nigeria and staff will probably have to be sent to neighboring
countries such as the Cameroon and the Ivory Coast; in the case of the latter,
the language problem may be a constraint. In certain cases officers might
be sent to organizations such as the Federal Land Development Authority in
Malaysia where they would get an opportunity to study modern planting tech-
niques as well as management systems geared to small farmer operations. The
establishments to which these officers are sent should be provided with quite
detailed outlines of the spheres of field and management practice that require
emphasis. On return these men would be expected to submit a full report on
their work, giving details of the techniques and management systems studied.
3.        Nursery Staff.  For each Regional Unit, 2 Agricultural Assistants
will need to receive special training in nursery techniques. In order to
cover a complete schedule of nursery operations from the germinated seed
stage to field planting, it will be necessary to allow a full twelve-month
period for nursery training. If commercial estates with sufficiently ex-
tensive planting programs to justify large irrigated central nurseries (8 to
10 ha of main nursery) can be found in Nigeria, the nursery staff will be
trained in Nigeria. In addition to training Agricultural Assistants, at
least one Agricultural Officer should also be trained so as to assume over-
all responsibility for the nurseries. It is proposed for the Western and
Mid-Western States that the estate nurseries would produce the planting
material required for both the estates and smallholders 1976 planting pro-
gram. SMU/rCU's nursery staff would be trained at these nurseries in 1975
and would establish central nurseries in the Regional areas in 1976 to meet
the needs of the smallholders 1977 planting program. In East Central State
in order to meet the needs of the 1976 planting program nurseries will have
to be established in early 1975 and unless experienced staff are available
training would have to commence in 1974.



SUPPLEMENT 11
Page 2
4.        Field Staff.  Training would comprise a 3-month intensive course
in modern planting techniques followed by 2-3 months practical training in
the supervision of field operations on a large commercial estate. While
the course would include the basic techniques of nursery cultivation, the
emphasis would be on the methods and control of planting in the field and
of post-planting operations. The intensive course of lectures and demon-
strations would be given at NIFOR and an outline of a syllabus is shown in
Appendix 1. The course would include visits to nearby estates (e.g.,
Ajagbodudu and Aden River) to demonstrate the employment of labor in the
various operations. All field staff would also be trained in appraisal
and grant/credit supervision procedures.
5.        Refresher Courses.  Short refresher courses should be arranged at
NIFOR from time to time to ensure that all practices being used are up-to-date.
In particular, it will be desirable for Agricultural Assistants to return for
short courses in harvesting practice before their areas come into bearing.
In the smallholders' areas harvesting discipline is going to be a critical
factor in the early years and the importance of providing special training at
the right time for both field staff and farmers cannot be overemphasized.
6.        Farmer Training - would be developed on a group activity basis and
would include:
i)   simple outlining of application procedures and conditions
of the loan agreement;
ii)   demonstrations of specific planting practices at selected
smallholdings;
iii)   group discussions supported with visual aid material prior to,
and in the course of, the agricultural planting program; and
iv) short courses of 1 to 2 days at the Regional Units or
Headquarters.
7.        Estates.  Training would also be important on the estates, and the
companies would be responsible for adequate training of all staff levels.
However, the Estate managers and oil mill engineers would be recruited inter-
nationally if necessary. The estate managers would be responsible for the
establishment of the estates and they would in the meantime train their suc-
cessor, who would take over immediately after the last planting year (i.e.,
after five years). The oil mill engineers would be responsible for operating
the mills until they reached full capacity. They would train their successors,
who however would also be trained by the suppliers. This would be embodied
in the suppliers' contract.

Outline of a course in oil palm planting techniques
Objectives - A course to be conducted at NIFOR for Agricultural Assistants
aimed at providing them with a sound working knowledge of the basic prac-
tices involved in establishing and maintaining oil palm plantings.
Method - the approach used being essentially
(a) a lecture on a selected subject/practice followed by
(b) a field demonstration and/or observation followed by
(c) a discussion period
NIFOR advisory sheets and other papers to be issued at the lectures.
For specific practices such as land clearing, lining and holing, cover crop
establishment, planting, weeding, fertilizer application and harvesting,
trainees would spend time in the field carrying out the various tasks involved
so as to be in a position to demonstrate the practices to smallholders.
Duration - about three months divided into two periods to coincide with the
main seasons for (a) land preparation and (b) planting.
A. Outline of Lectures
1.        Timing of operations

OIL PALM PROJECTS
Markets and Prices
A. World Supply and Demand Outlook for Palm Oil
1.        The world supply of palm oil increased very rapidly in recent years
following a long period of slow growth. From 1950-52 to 1967-69 world produc-
tion rose at an annual average rate of 1.2% while from 1967-69 to 1971 the
annual growth rate averaged more than 12%. World exports of palm oil, which
practically stagnated throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, began to
increase at a 15% average annual rate after 1967-69. By 1972 the share of
palm oil in exports of all fats and oils had nearly reached the level at
which it stood in the early 1950s.
2.        World production of palm oil is expected to increase rapidly as new
plantings of high-yielding varieties reach maturity. Oil palm projects
financed by the Bank Group will contribute between 15 and 16% to the total
increase in production during the decade from 1970 to 1980. Although the
share of the output consumed domestically in producing countries will decline,
total consumption of palm oil is expected to grow more rapidly in the 1970s
than in the 1960s.
3.        The demand for palm oil is largely influenced by the demand for all
oils and fats and for vegetable oils as a group. Total estimated consumption
of fats and oils expanded steadily at a trend rate of 2.9% from 1960 to
1970, but both the geographic and the product composition of demand changed
during this period. While consumption in developed and developing countries
rose at a trend rate of 3.2% the trend rate of growth reached only 1.8%
in centrally planned economies. Developed countries which represent the
main export market for fats and oils produced in developing countries,
accounted for one-half of the total world consumption in 1970. Demand for
palm oil rose most rapidly in Oceania, Japan and South Africa combined (7.0%
per annum), followed by Western Europe (3.0% per annum) and the United
States and Canada (2.6% per annum). Among the developing regions, Latin
America recorded the greatest trend rate of growth in consumption (4.3%)
followed by Africa and Asia.
4.        The past decade saw a significant change in the pattern of consump-
tion of fats and oils -- away from animal fats and oils towards vegetable oils.
Consumption of animal fats and marine oils increased at a rate far below that
for vegetable oils. Within the group of vegetable oils the composition of
demand changed in response to availabilities of the various oils and to a
number of economic and non-economic factors affecting the use of oils.



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 2
5.        The shift of demand away from animal fats and oils and to vegetable
oils is expected to continue. This will strengthen the markets for vegetable
oils as a group. Increasing interchangeability among these oils will tend
to reduce price differences in the long run. In the short run, however, prices
will still reflect relative availabilities of individual oils. According to
Bank projections, world demand for all fats and oils at 1972 prices will rise
to 56 million tons in 1980. This is 31.5% more than in 1970 (42.6 million
tons) and represents a somewhat slower rate of increase than in the preceding
decade (33.1%). World consumption of vegetable oils in 1980 is expected to
reach about 39 million tons (69.5% of the total), an increase of 41% over
1970.
6.        During the past decade world production of animal fats and marine
oils has increased more slowly compared to the output of vegetable oils.
Within the group of vegetable oils, soybean oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil and
sunflowerseed oil showed steepest increase. On the basis of past production
trends, world supply of all fats and oils combined in 1980 is expected to
be roughly in balance with world demand at the level of 56 million tons of
oil or fat equivalent. This in turn implies that increased supplies of fats
and oils will be absorbed in the market without any persistent downward pres-
sure on the prices of these commodities as a group.
7.        On the basis of present estimates of future output of the different
commodities involved, it seems clear that palm oil will account for a larger
increase in world demand for vegetable oils than in the 1960-1970 decade.
Total demand for palm oil is expected to reach 4,130 thousand tons in 1980
compared with 2,078 thousand tons in 1971. Slightly more than half of this
quantity will be absorbed by developed countries, compared to 42% in 1971
and 35% in 1967. Total output of palm oil is projected to reach between
4,080 and 4,230 thousand metric tons (depending on alternative production
forecasts for Malaysia). Exports will range between 2,535 and 2,685 thousand
metric tons (Table 1). This corresponds to about 63% of the total production
compared to 48% in 1971 and 49% in the period 1967 - 69. Malaysia will
dominate exports, followed by Indonesia; the Ivory Coast and Zaire will be
the only important exporters in West Africa, although Dahomey will expand
its markets further. The share of developing countries in total consumption
will fall from 57% in 1971 to 48% in 1980, but the share of intra-developing
countries trade in total exports will increase from 10 to 18% (low output
assumption).
8.        The following factors will affect the future price of palm oil.
World consumption of palm oil is projected at 4,130 thousand metric tons in
1980; 1,520 metric tons will be consumed domestically in producing countries.
This leaves a total import requirement of 2,610 thousand metric tons, of
which 14% would come from non-producing developing countries and 4% from
Nigeria, which is expected to become a net importer of palm oil in the amount
of 130 thousand metric tons. Output is projected to reach between 4,080
and 4,230 thousand metric tons, depending on developments in Malaysia. The
150 thousand ton supplement in the higher projection for Malaysia is expected



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 3
to find its way into exports, giving alternative world export figures of
2,535 to 2,685 thousand tons. The projected difference between import
demand and export supply is small and, given the expected overall balance
between demand and supply of all fats and oils of vegetable oils. The price
for palm oil is projected at 495 US dollars per metric ton (in 1980 dollars).
Taking into account a rate of inflation forecasted (1974 = 100 and 1980
165), the price for palm oil will be about 300-US dollars per metric ton
in 1974 constant terms.
9.        Table 2 contains monthly prices for palm oil (Malayan, bulk, 5%,
cif European ports) for the period from 1967 to 1973. These figures
illustrate the dramatic increase in palm oil prices in more recent years.
From 1967 to 1973 annual average prices increased at a rate of 10.9% - well
above the average rate of inflation in developed-countries. In August and
September 1974 prices were at record levels and prices of over US$700 per
metric ton were quoted for palm oil.
B. Market Prospects for Palm Oil in Nigeria
Past Trends in Production
10.       During the early sixties Nigeria was one of the world's leading
producers and exporters of palm oil and palm kernels, accounting for about
40% of total production and nearly 3X of world trade. However, during the
period from 1960-1966 annual production remained more or less stagnant.  The
civil war (1966-1970) took place mostly in the heart of the palm belt of
Nigeria which adversely affected the oil palm industry. Many palm areas
(wild groves and estates) and processing facilities were then destroyed,
large palm areas were cleared for emergency food production and the whole
socioeconomic framework of oil palm production and marketing was disrupted.
Since the cessation of the hostilities, production has been increasing but
has not yet attained the pre-war level. Thus, stagnant production and a
growing domestic demand has substantially reduced Nigeria's commercial
surplus (Table 3).
11.       The major palm producing areas of Nigeria are located in the
Western, Mid-Western, East Central, South East and the Rivers States. Apart
from the production from some commercial estates, farm settlement and re-
habilitated groves, the bulk of the supply of palm products comes from the
wild groves. Reliable data on total production are not available and there
is considerable variation in the estimates of total production. For example,
the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) pre-civil war estimates
put 1960-1966 annual average production at about 546,000 tons. An FAO study
for the same period estimates the total quantity at 20-50,000 tons lower than
this figure. The Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture has estimated



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 4
production at a level which is about 200,000 tons higher than the USDA
estimate. Palm oil production is currently estimated to be about 550,000
tons. The bulk of this production comes from the wild palm groves which
cover an area estimated at about 2.4 million ha.
Utilization of Palm Produce
12.       There are basically three sources of demand for palm products in
Nigeria:
(a) for household consumption in the preparation of food;
(b) for the production of soap, margarine and other such related
products; and
(c) for export.
13.       Large quantities of palm oil produced in Nigeria are used for direct
domestic consumption, both for cooking and frying. It is cheaper than its
nearest substitute, groundnut oil. For example, in the Southern States,
prices of palm oil are about 602t lower than groundnut oil, and in the Northern
States prices differ by about 25%. However, with increases in income levels,
Nigerians appear to substitute a part of their use of palm oil (particularly
for frying) with groundnut oil. A rural household survey 1/ conducted by
the Federal Ministry of Statistics indicates that the average per capita
annual intake (1963/64 and 1965/66) of fats and oils in Nigeria was around
9.1 kg of which about 8.1 kg (about 89%) was palm oil. There are, however,
wide regional variations (about 2.3 kg in the Northern States, 11.4 in the
Eastern States) and the above figure represents a weighted national average
(Table 4). Using this average quantity and assuming 89% of the total
population to be effective consumption units, consumption of palm oil by
households in Nigeria is estimated at an annual average of about 413 thousand
metric tons for the period 1962-1966.
14.       Domestic industrial consumption of palm oil in Nigeria (as measured
by Marketing Boards' domestic sales) average about 12,000 metric tons per
annum during 1962-1972, which is about 2% of the total annual production
of this period and as such, represents a minor source of product utilization
(Table 5).
15.       During the early sixties Nigeria used to export more than 20% of
its total palm oil production (Table 6). However, a rapidly growing popu-
lation (rate of growth over 2.6%), increases in per capita real income and
a positive, although less than unitary, income elasticity of demand has
resulted in a steady upward shift of the demand function and consequent re-
duction in net commercial surpluses. Export trade was virtually terminated

SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 5
during the civil war years and since then annual exports have fluctuated
between 2,000 - 20,000 metric tons. In sharp contrast to a total export of
200,000 metric tons in 1953 - 1954, Nigeria shipped only about 2,000 tons
in 1972.
16.       Production of palm kernels, as measured by Marketing Boards'
purchases, has averaged about 416 thousand metric tons during the five pre-war
periods (Table 7). Before 1965 roughly about one percent of this quantity
was crushed in Nigeria and the rest were exported. However, since 1965 several
palm kernel crushing mills have been established and domestic utilization of
kernels had increased to about 71 thousand tons in 1970 as opposed to about
3,000 tons in 1962. Increases in the palm kernel crushing facilities have
also led to increases in the export of palm kernel oil - from a mere 3,000
tons in 1963 to about 33,000 tons in 1970 (Table 8).
Future Prospects
17.       The supply of palm oil suffers from certain inflexibilities that
are inherent in tree crops. For example, it has a relatively long gestation
period between planting and harvesting and its output cannot be changed from
year to year. Nearly 90% of the present supply of palm oil produced in
Nigera comes from the wild groves. However, exploitation of wild palms had
reached a maximum level in the mid-1960s and any improvements in future
extraction rates through the introduction of more efficient processing will
be largely offset by decreased production of fruits as the trees age and
become increasingly difficult to harvest. Production may also be depressed
by the felling of wild palms to clear land for food crops as population
densities increase in the Southern States.
18.       As such, the scope for increasing the production of palm oil from
the existing sources is limited and is therefore dependent upon the success-
ful implementation of new planting and replanting programs. Prior to 1966
some plantings of improved palm on estates, farm settlements and rehabilitated
groves had been initiated, but in Eastern Nigeria the program was halted
during the civil war. The study group on oil palm of the National Agricultural
Development Committee estimates in its report (June 1972) that until 1971/72
about 162,802 ac (66 thousand ha) of palm had been improved. Taking all such
developments into consideration, it is estimated that total domestic pro-
duction from existing plantings, including the improved palm planted before
the civil war, will average about 570,000 tons per annum during 1975-1980.
Of this quantity, nearly 515,000 tons are expected from wild palm groves and
about 53,000 tons from improved palms.
19.       Domestic consumption of palm oil and kernels will continue to
increase over the next decade. Based on an expected population growth of
3% per annum from 1975 to 1980, projected per capita income growth of 3%
and income elasticity coefficient of 0.5, domestic household consumption of
palm oil is expected to increase by about 4.5% per annum, reaching about
690,000 metric tons in 1980, or about 8.8 kg per capita. During the early



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 6
1980s, per capita consumption is expected to level off, with total consumption
growing at about 3.25% per annum and reaching about 810,000 metric tons in
1985 (Table 9). If we take into consideration an industrial demand for
about 10 - 15,000 tons of palm oil per annum, the total domestic demand in
Nigeria would be about 702,000 metric tons in 1980 and 825,000 metric tons
in 1985.
20.       Projected growth of supply and demand of palm oil in Nigeria is
presented in Table 10. It shows that by the years 1980 and 1985, there will
be a net deficit of about 130,000 and 275,000 metric tons respectively. Unless
an extensive program of planting/replanting using improved planting materials
is initiated in the mid-1970s, Nigeria faces the prospect of becoming a major
importer of palm oil. Assuming an average output of 2.20 metric tons of oil
per ha for smallholdings (10 tons of ffb with an extraction rate of 22%),
it would be necessary to bring about 125,000 ha of land under improved palms
in order to be able to meet the projected shortfall of about 275,000 metric
tons. The projects being appraised involve planting about 42,000 ha which
at full development in the late 80s would produce about 100,000 tons of
palm oil. These projects are Phase 1 of a program ultimately scheduled
to plant/replant about 75,000 ha in Western, Mid-Western, and East Central
States by 1982/83. Though extensive, these planting programs will not meet
the projected shortfall in palm oil supply during the mid 80s. If, however,
effective new planting/replanting programs can also be implemented in the
other main oil palm areas of South East and Rivers States, and a planned
estate development program materializes in East-Central State, the supply
shortfall should be considerably reduced.
C.  Marketing Institutions
Marketing Boards
21.       Nigeria's major agricultural exports - cocoa, groundnuts, palm
produce - and a number of other commercial crops 1/ are marketed through 6
State Marketing Boards 2/ and through their export sales outlet, the Nigerian
Produce Marketing Company (NPMC). Major commodities not controlled by Market-
ing Boards are rubber and food crops. The original objectives of these Boards,
which were established during World War II, 3/ were to stabilize prices for
farmers and to improve the organization of marketing. The Boards were charged
1/   Benniseed (sesame), coffee, copra, cotton, grapefruit, kenat, sheanut
and soybeans.
2/   The Western, Mid-Western, East Central, South East, Rivers and
Northern States Marketing Boards.
3/   For historical details see Report 282a-UNI, Appraisal of Second Cocoa
Project, Nigeria.



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 7
by law with responsibilities for fixing the producer prices of these crops, 1/
buying the marketed surplus from the growers and arranging for packaging,
storage, handling and transportation to the port of shipment.
22.       Each year the Marketing Boards announce Marketing Schemes for
individual commodities wherein the list of gazetted buying stations, the
Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) are specified. The LBA's act on behalf of the
Boards in purchasing, grading, storing, packaging and transporting the pro-
duce and are responsible for losses and/or damage (resulting from theft,
pilferage, defective packaging and such other reasons) incurred from the
time of purchase to the time of delivery into the Boards' designated ware-
houses. All products bought by the Buying Agents, however, have to be
graded and approved by the Produce Inspection Division of the State's
Ministry of Trade. In return for their services, the LBA's are paid block
allowances. However, Marketing Boards have no effective control over the
prices paid by LBA's to farmers who often consider that they are being
exploited by them.
23.       Since the 1960s the Marketing Boards have acted as convenient instru-
ments for transferring resources from Agriculture to the State Exchequers,
most of the trading profits being channelled into various government depart-
ments in the State and very little spent on the development of the enterprises
that produced the products. The Boards have also been obliged to subsidize
certain nonviable enterprises which have added to overhead costs; for example,
the Boards have to charge the total running expenses of the States' Produce
Inspection Division to their produce trading accounts. These Divisions have
grown despite the decline in export volume. Further, the Bulk Oil Company,
owned by NPMC, debits its full operational costs to the Boards despite very
low utilization of the facilities by the latter. In addition to such payments,
surplus Marketing Board revenues have been invested in Government securities,
thereby diverting agricultural revenues away from the agricultural sector.
24.       On the other hand, all through this period, the producer prices
paid to the farmers were much lower than the actual FOB prices received by
the Boards (Table 11). The pricing policy followed has not reflected local
price conditions. While Nigerian domestic prices for palm oil are about
three times their pre-war level, the producers' prices fixed by the Marketing
Boards have not been given adequate upward revisions. For example, the average
wholesale price of palm oil during 1973 (January - October) was about N 220
per ton as opposed to N 100 offered by the Boards. Consequently, smallholders
choose to sell their surplus to the local markets rather than to the Boards
and this has limited the Boards' purchases primarily to the output from a
few small estates owned by the State governments and from some of the smaller
palm oil mills.
1/   The Marketing Boards have now been diverted from the power to fix
producer prices (see para 32).



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 8
25.       By the provision of law, all processors of palm oil and palm kernels
are required to sell their produce directly to the Marketing Boards. These
provisions have, however, been relaxed in recent years and now entities like
the Oil Palm Company (OPC), 1/ the Agricultural Development Authority (ADA), 2/
the Agricultural Investment Corporation (AIC) 3/ and NIFOR are allowed to
sell palm oil and kernels in the domestic market, as well as directly to
the NPMC.
26.       Most of the State Marketing Boards are now financially weak due to
a combination of (a) increasing costs per ton of product handled resulting
from declining produce sales and the Boards' failure to contract their admin-
istrative structures proportionately, (b) inefficiencies and (c) direct
and indirect taxation.
Western Nigeria Marketing Board
27.       In September 1954 the Western Nigeria Marketing Board was established
and its area of operation included what is now Mid-Western State. In 1963
it was split up into the Western State Marketing Board (WSMB) and the Mid-
Western State Marketing Board (MWSMB). Quantities of palm oil and palm
kernel handled by the WSMB are given below.

Since 1967 the WSMB has not purchased any significant quantities of palm oil

palm kernels and had only one for palm oil. The Board has not purchased any
palm oil from the producers in recent times. The Agricultural Investment
Corporation (AIC), which owns three plantations and processing facilities,
is the main supplier of palm oil to the Marketing Board. However, because
the Marketing Boards' prices are lower than the free market price, AIC has
been bypassing the Boards and selling most of its output to the wholesale
(60%) and retail (40%) outlets. Fifty percent of the kernels handled by the
Western State Marketing Board are sold to the local processors (Vegetable
Oil Mills, Lever Bros., etc.) and the balance is forwarded to the NPMC for
export. The Board's palm oil trading account has sustained a net trading
loss since 1964-65 and its kernel trading account since 1969-70.

Mid-Western State Marketing Board
28.       Prior to 1963 the Western Nigeria Marketing Board used to handle
the scheduled export crops produced in what is now the Mid-Western State.
In 1963 the Mid-Western State Marketing Board (MWSMB) was created by splitting
up the parent organization (see para 27). Details of the Board's palm kernel
and palm oil operation are given below:

From the figures it is clear that since 1963-64 MWSMB has been handling
diminishing quantities of palm produce. During 1969-70, the Board had a
net trading deficit on the palm produce account. The Oil Palm Company and
NIFOR have been its major suppliers of palm oil, but both are now selling
directly to the domestic market also. There are, however, some cooperative
marketing unions which act as Licensed Buying Agents for the Board. Because
the Marketing Board's purchase prices have been lower than the prevailing
market prices, it has not been able to acquire any significant quantities
of palm oil in recent years. MWSMB is currently planning to establish its
own oil palm plantation and processing facilities. With this in view,
about 5,000 ac of land has been cleared near Okhuo, 22 miles north of
Benin, and management negotiations are in progress with the NIJAL.

East Central State Marketing Board
29.       East Central State Marketing Board came into existence in 1970 when
the former Eastern Nigeria Marketing Board was split into East Central, South
Eastern and Rivers State Marketing Boards. The East Central State Marketing
Board has been facing financial difficulties. During 1972 it had a net trad-
ing deficit of N 1.5 million on the produce account and a total deficit of
about N 2.00 million including all products handled. It operates through a
system of Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) and during 1973 it employed about 100
LBA's for palm oil purchases, about 200 for palm kernels and about 30 for cocoa.
Details of the quantities of palm oil and palm kernels handled by the Board
are given below:

From the figures it is clear that the East Central Marketing Board is handling
diminishing quantities of palm oil and palm kernels. The Agricultural Devel-
opment Authority (ADA) now bypasses the marketing board and is engaged in
oil palm processing and palm produce marketing. Currently it runs about 20
rehabilitated Pioneer Oil Mills, wherein fruit bunches collected from small-
holders are processed. It also purchases palm oil from free markets at
prevailing market prices and after packaging them in 44-gallon drums, sells
them to bulk purchasers. During the period April 1972 to September 1973,
the ADA oil palm unit handled about 2,200 tons of palm oil and 1,200 tons
of kernels. Almost all its sales are to soap, margarine and allied production
enterprises in Nigeria.
Nigerian Produce Marketing Company (NPMC)
30.       Scheduled crops which are handled by the Marketing Boards, when
exported, are shipped and sold exclusively by the NPMC which acts as export
agent for the different Marketing Boards.  From the total sales proceeds
various expenses incurred on overseas shipping of the produce (such as handling
at the port, wharfage, lighterage, bulking charges, insurance, export duties,
freight charges, etc.) plus an agency fee (which currently is assessed at
N 4.00 to 6.00 per ton) to cover its own establishment expenses are deducted
and the balances are remitted to the respective Marketing Boards. The NPMC
has several produce departments (cotton, palm produce, groundnuts and cocoa)
and owns the Bulk Oil Company which handles palm oil. Like the Marketing
Boards, the NPMC also has not adjusted its fixed administrative expenses to
the changed revenue situation created by a declining volume of business. This
has resulted in high costs per ton of product handled and weakened the
financial position of the company.
Future Role of Marketing Institutions
31.       The past performances of the State Marketing Boards, particularly
the principles under which they operate, have been facing adverse criticisms
in recent years. In early 1973 the FMG announced certain reforms in the



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 12
Government's policies on the marketing of export commodities. The details
of the decree announcing the proposed reforms have not yet been made public
However, the following appear to be the main elements of a new policy that is
under consideration:
(a) The Nigerian Produce Marketing Company, exclusively taken over by
the FMG will be the sole owner of all scheduled export crops (cocoa, cotton,
benniseeds, soybean, groundnuts and palm products). It will also assume
responsibilities for the domestic sales of these commodities to local pro-
cessors. The State Marketing Boards will exist as the principal buying agents
for the NPMC and will be responsible for purchasing, handling, grading, stor-
age and delivery of the scheduled crops to the NPMC warehouses. They will
be entitled to get loans from the Central Bank to finance their operations
but neither the NPMC nor the Marketing Boards will be allowed to build up
financial reserves. The Marketing Boards will retain their present system of
Licensed Buying Agents for handling the local purchases.
(b) Estates and large producers will be permitted to bypass the
Marketing Boards and sell directly to NPMC.
(c) The State Marketing Boards will be divested of the powers to fix
producer prices. Instead, producer prices will now be fixed by the Head of
the FMG, assisted by a Technical Committee on producer prices. The Technical
Committee, headed by the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Finance,
consists of the General Managers of all the State Marketing Boards, two re-
presentatives from the Central Bank, Permanent Secretaries of the Federal
Ministries of Trade and Economic Development, and representatives from the
NPMC. The Technical Committee would have subcommittees for each of the
commodities handled. The subcommittees would make recommendations which
would then be forwarded to the Head of FMG as the recommendations of the
Technical Committee. It should be noted that these recommendations would not
be binding on the Head of the FMG, who could overrule them and take his own
decision. Each year two sets of prices will be announced by the Technical
Committee: the producer prices to be paid by the Marketing Board and the
NPMC take-over prices (which will be a common price for the same commodities
irrespective of its origin). Producer prices will be directly related to
the FOB prices. They will present a net of FOB prices after deducting all
expenses and commissions. The FOB prices will be calculated on the basis
of an average of the previous shipping periods and adjusted by projected
domestic and world supply and demand conditions. The FMG has given assurances
that irrespective of whatever adverse changes may take place in world prices,
producer prices will be maintained at the announced level during the particular
season, if necessary even through Government subsidies.
(d) Under the new marketing reforms there might be a provision requiring
domestic processors of scheduled commodities to purchase their raw materials
from NPMC and at FOB prices.



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 13
(e) All export duties on Marketing Board products have been abolished
with effect from April 1973. Produce sales tax and export duties were merged
into a single 10% ad valorem produce tax to be levied on the producer price
and paid to the pertinent State governments. However, early in 1974 FMG
announced in its budget message that the 10% sales tax on agricultural products
would be abolished.
32.       Producer prices for all scheduled crops, except palm oil and kernels,
have been announced for the 1973-1974 shipping period (cocoa N 400.00 per
ton, benniseed N 110.00 per ton, soybean N 50.00 per ton and groundnut N 94.25
per ton). Early in 1974, in the budget message for 1974/75, FMG announced
new prices: cocoa N 450 per ton; groundnuts N 165 per ton; cotton N 201 per
ton and palm kernels N 132 per ton.
Implications of Future Marketing Policies
33.       No full assessment can be made of the proposed marketing reforms
until FMG issues the new decrees and specifies the crops over which NPMC will
have regulatory powers. At present hardly any palm oil is exported from
Nigeria and according to the projected demand and supply conditions, palm
oil output from the projects will easily find a ready market within Nigeria.
The project does not envisage at this juncture going into kernel crushing
and therefore kernel output from the project would be either sold for export
or sold to domestic producers for further crushing.
34.       The marketing of palm products in Nigeria has changed fundamentally.
Palm oil for All nrAwt'eal nutrnoses is no ioneer an exDort commoditv. thouph
lsaw,lq  t-4Il can be regarded as such.  NPMC's main objective is towards the
regulation of producer prices of export crops.
35.       The projects are aimed at reducing the shortfall of domestic supply
of palm oil.  However, if the central processing companies are to operate
efficiently, their throughput will need to be maintained at the capacity
levels projected; to achieve this, they must be in a position to offer small-
holders prices that are competitive with local markets. Therefore, the oil
palm companies should be free, as they are at present, to sell their palm
oil on the domestic market at prices determined by the local market forces.
D. Pricing Policy for the Purchase of Fresh Fruit Bunches

would comprise:

The committee would establish the principles to be applied in determining the
price to be paid for ffb by the Companies' central mills when purchasing fruit
from participating smallholders. They would determine a purchasing price
formula which the Companies would be obliged to apply in calculating the price
they would pay for ffb. Using this formula the mill, from month to month, or
other suitable time span, would announce a price to be paid for ffb. Any
departure from this formula would be referred back to the Committee prior
to implementation. The following factors would be taken into account by the
Committee in determining the purchasing price formula.
Price Calculation
37.       The price paid per ton of ffb would be determined from the revenue
received for the palm oil and kernels produced from a ton of ffb after allow-
ing for the costs of fruit collection and processing, including depreciation,
taxes and financial charges. The financial charges would be adequate to pro-
vide a reasonable return on the required capital investment, which would
be sufficient to cover interest charges, and margins for building up reserves
and paying dividends to the Company's shareholders. The return on capital
would be measured on the basis of a percentage of net revalued fixed assets
plus a reasonable allowance for working capital; this percentage would be
agreed by the price policy committee within a suggested 10% - 15% range. De-
preciation on fixed assets would be taken on a straight line basis for short-
lived assets, such as those used for fruit collection; for longer lived assets,
such as the mill, it is suggested that a more appropriate basis would be an

State.

SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 15
allocation over output processed compared to the estimated processing capacity
of the mills over their estimated remaining useful life. Having deducted
these costs, calculated on a cost/ton basis, from the revenue received from
the sale of one ton of produce, the price per ton of products net of all costs
is known. This would be the base price.
38.       Applying the appropriate extraction rate of products to bunches to
this base price the price per ton of ffb can be calculated. Extraction rates
applied would be related to the mill's previous three months processing results
with all participants receiving a price based on an overall average extraction
rate. W4hilst this means that producers with more mature trees would be re-
ceiving slightly lower extraction assessment than might be justified, on
balance, the application of a standard extraction rate is considered to be
more practical from an operational standpoint.
39.       Any profits in excess of the agreed return on capital would be dis-
tributed to the smallholders in the form of a cash bonus at the end of, say,
each half-year. The amount paid to the individual smallholders being pro-
portional to the quantity of fruit sold to the company over the period con-
cerned.
Grading
40.       Having determined an ffb purchase price for Grade 1 fruit (suitable
stage of ripeness of tenera bunches) discount rates would need to be determined
and agreed with producers in order to take account of:
(a) under and over-ripe bunches;
(b) excessively long stalks;
(c) bunches having dirty fruits, stones, mud, etc.; and
(d) fruits from wild palm groves or dura material
having a lower oil content.
Due to the fact that the mill would not have a captive market, prices offered
at any time must be competitive with bids prevailing in the areas from which
produce is being purchased, and hence the minimum price paid for ffb will be
determined by prices prevailing in the local market for similar fruit. Hence
it seems reasonable to assume that when deriving a price per ton of ffb, the
central mill could apply a combination of:
(a) its own short-term selling price, say, a three-month average
from which it calculates a base price and hence an ffb price
per ton; and
(b) short-term trends in the local markets.



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 16
In the short-run, the mill may sustain losses in order to compete with local
market conditions. To anticipate changes in local market conditions, a monthly
index (adjustment factor) could be applied either to the base price or to
the ffb price calculated from the base price.
E. Calculation of Economic and Financial Millgate Prices
for Palm Oil and Kernels
41.       For the purpose of this project the economic and financial prices
for palm oil and kernels have been calculated using the world market price
projections for 1980 by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Depart-
ment (see Tables 12 and 13).
Palm Oil
42.       It has been assumed that without the proposed projects Nigeria
would be a net importer of palm oil by 1980. The projections indicate that
by 1985 the net deficit would be around 275,000 tons of palm oil and most of
this deficit would have to be supplied from Malaysia. The Ivory Coast would
be able to supply part of this deficit but it is unlikely that the cif price
would be much below the Malaysian price. It has further been assumed that
palm oil imported or produced by the project would be sold in or around the
large urban markets of Western Nigeria, such as Ibadan. Implicit in this
assumption is that the other urban and rural markets in Nigeria would be
fully supplied from alternative sources. It is probably, however, that the
areas would also be the markets for the project and this would result in
higher economic and financial millgate prices since (a) the transport from
port to the market would be higher, and (b) the transport from the mill to
the market would be less than projected with Ibadan as the market. Hence
the price estimates tend to be on the conservative side. Furthermore projects
would be in full production after 1985 and the forecasted price for 1985 in
constant 1974 terms is substantially higher than the 1980 price.
Kernels
43.       For the purposes of the economic and financial millgate prices it
has been assumed that kernels will be exported at a projected 1980 price
of US$330 per metric ton. The charges included are based on what is currently
expected to be the role of the Marketing Boards and NPMC, where the Mill can
bypass the Marketing Board and sell directly to NPMC and hence avoid any
Marketing Board commission.
44.       With the rapid expansion of kernel crushing industries from 2 mills
at present, with a combined crushing capacity of 110,000 tons per annum, to
about 7 - 9 mills with a capacity of 350 - 400,000 tons, provided all present-
ly projected investment programs materialize (nearly all joint enterprises
with State participation), it is probable that a large proportion of kernels



SUPPLEMENT 12
Page 17
would be processed locally and exported as kernel oil. In that case the
export price for kernel oil would be obtained and given efficiency in the
crushing operations the added value for Nigeria would be higher. Therefore
taking the export prices for kernels is again a conservative estimate.

OIL PALM PROJECTS
Production Estimates for the Projects
1.        A method of estimating adult oil palm yields from a knowledge of
soil class and water deficit (estimated by a standard formula) has been used
by IRHO in West Africa and has been broadly successful. Applying this to
the project areas yields would be:
Metric Tons per ha per Annum (per acre in brackets)
State       WESTERN                  MID-WESTERN             EAST CENTRAL

/1   Based on calculations for the period 1950-62 made in a study of
climatic conditions in Southern Nigeria by J. Olivin of Institut
de Recherches pour les Iluiles et Oleagineux (IRHO).
2.        It has been suggested that the Acid Sand Soils covering the project
areas fall into classes IIa and Ilb. Yield figures for NIFOR, Ajagbodudu
Estate and recorded plots in East Central State have been checked against
the above table and with the aid of soil analysis data available and soil
observations made during the mission a judgment has been made of the soil
class, or mean soil class, in each area. The judgment is tentative for the
Mid-Western areas, since soil analyses for the areas concerned are still
awaited. 1/
1/   Subsequent information received after appraisal, however, confirms
basically the tentative conclusions reached during appraisal.



SUPPLEMENT 13
Page 2
3.        In general, the Benin fasc (red) soils may be expected to be Class
IIa except on slopes or where they are unusually sandy. Calabar fasc (yellow)
soils may be Class Ila or IIb, but they are often excessively sandy, in which
case they will be comparable to Class III soils or worse.
4.        NIFOR yield figures suggest that their 'plateau' soils usually
reach Class Ila. Steep slope soils are between lIb and III, i.e.:
Plateau                Slope
per ha        per acre  per ha    per acre
Mean Yield, metric tons        11.5           4.7       8.8         3.5
5.        Ajagbodudu Estate yields from good 1958/59 replants on Calabar fasc
soil of good clay content have averaged 10.5m tons per hectare. Much of
Cowan is, however, on Benin fasc. East Central State soils are mostly Benin
fasc but heavily degraded by over-farming. Yields of an old plot at Mbawsi
suggest that modern material would give Class IIb yields - 11.8 tons/ha - if
fertilized with potassium and nitrogen. In the few areas where farming in
the groves has not been so continuous, Class IIa yields might be attained
under estate conditions.
6.        Western State soils are mostly good Benin fasc (Ha).
Estate Adult Yield Predictions
7.        "Estate standard" adult yield predictions are thus as follows
(metric tons):
State                           Western       Mid-Western           East Central
Areas                             all      Mosogar    Nsukwa            all

Adult Yield per acre              5.1        5.1        4.6             4.9

Smallholders Adult Yield Predictions
8.        A yield of 10 tons per ha is taken for all areas on the assumption
that fertilizers are properly applied and supervision of other work adequate.
For the Nsukwa area of the Mid-Western State a yield of 10 ton/ha is also
taken on the assumption that all smallholders areas are to the west and south
of the nucleus estate and therefore have water deficits less than that of the
estate area.



SUPPLEMENT 13
Page 3
Yield Progression
9.        As with adult yields, yield progression is often affected by the
unfavorable effects of previous severe dry seasons. A conservative view
of yield build-up is therefore advisable and this is supported by NIFOR
experience. Mean annual yield expectations are as follows:

Oil and Kernel Extraction
10.       NIFOR material which will be used is characterized by high fruit
to bunch ratios, fairly high mesocarp to fruit, high kernel to fruit and
low to fairly low shell to fruit (10-14%). Taking a lower figure (62.5%)
for millside fruit to bunch ratios than is shown in field laboratory analysis,
90% mill efficiencies, 50% oil to mesocarp and a 6% allowance for loss of
moisture from kernels, estimates of the eventual outturn are:
Percent of ffb:           22% palm oil              5% palm kernels.



SUPPLEMENT 13

11.       Figures of increase of oil to bunch with age are not available
for Nigerian Tenera material. Figures provided by Chemara Research Station 1/
have therefore been used and mill extraction rates are expected to be as
follows:
Percent                        N4       N5      N6       N7      N8      N9
