REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA
FOR A RURAL ROADS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$7.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rural roads project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The basic problems of economic development in Upper Volta were set
out in a report entitled "The Economic Development of Upper Volta" dated
November 27, 1970 (R70-237 and R71-2). An updating memorandum of January 13,
1972, was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 2, 1972 (R72-47).
An economic mission visited Upper Volta in March/April 1974; its draft report
was discussed with Government for comments and will be distributed to the
Executive Directors shortly. The mission's main findings are incorporated
in this report.
Background
3.        With a GDP per capita of about US$70 in 1972, Upper Volta is one of
the 25 "least developed countries" identified by the United Nations. The
country's economic structure is typical of a situation of extreme under-
development: agriculture and livestock provide a living for over 90 percent
of the population, but, with very low productivity, account directly for less
than 50 percent of GDP; manufacturing, closely linked to agriculture, provides
only 10 percent of GDP; the remainder comes from the service sector, which
includes the Government; exports, usually a dominant growth factor in most
African countries, represent only between 7 and 9 percent of GDP; despite
modest investment rates (8 to 10 percent), the resource gap was about 8 per-
cent of GDP until 1971, nearly doubled in 1972, and reached an unusually
high level of 20 percent of GDP in 1973.
4.        A number of years of sparse rainfall since 1968 culminating
in a severe drought in 1973 have resulted in a serious setback in agricultural
production and overall economic stagnation. This is all the more serious be-
cause in the years since 1960 growth had been very limited, probably not
exceeding one percent per year per head. Compared to 1969/70 agricultural
production declined by 15 percent in 1970/71 and by 17 percent in 1972/73.
The most serious crop failures and livestock losses occurred in the northern
and central parts of the country, thus accentuating existing income dispari-
ties between regions. Emergency food imports were about 40,000 tons in



- 2 -
1971/72, 60,000 tons in 1972/73, and over 100,000 tons in 1973/74. Climatic
conditions in 1974 were normal, and crop production for 1974/75 should regain
the levels achieved in 1969/70. The drought has brought out more clearly
than ever the basic problem facing Upper Volta's rural sector: uneven popula-
tion distribution with respect to available resources throughout the country
and excessive population pressure in the central region (the Mossi Plateau);
about 61 percent of the total population, or 3.5 million people, live in
this region which comprises only 32 percent of the total area and is much
less favorably endowed than the south and southwestern regions from the view-
point of both rainfall and soil quality. This explains why the bulk of the
migrants to other parts of the country and to neighboring countries come from
this region.
Financial Developments
5.        Despite the persistently large trade deficit, the overall balance
of payments has been in surplus over the six years, 1968-73. Even in 1974,
the Central Bank's provisional figures show a surplus of US$10 million.
Net foreign assets tripled between 1968 and the middle of 1974 to reach over
US$70 million or about 8 months worth of imports of goods and non-factor
services. This was made possible by the increasing flows of both external
aid and private transfers, mainly Voltaic workers' remittances from the
Ivory Coast. In February 1974, the prices of refined petroleum products
doubled at delivery point in Upper Volta. Though consumption of petroleum
products is small, representing 6 percent of total imports (1972) and a very
low percentage of all the inputs used in the economy, they are the only source
of modern energy in the country and, therefore, little room exists for reducing
consumption. The hydroelectric potential is under study, but seems to be very
limited. Higher petroleum prices, combined with other rises, particularly
in import prices and in local wages, have set the economy on an inflationary
path, which is in sharp contrast with the past. As a result of these develop-
ments, effective April 1, 1974 most workers received wage increases ranging
from 3 percent to as much as 38 percent.
6.        Over the past six years the Treasury's liquidity position has re-
mained comfortable as a result of three factors: a policy of strict budget-
ary austerity applied since 1967 by the military regime, the continuation of
French budget subsidies, surpluses accruing from autonomous public institu-
tions, especially the Price Stabilization Fund for Agricultural Products and
special aid received in connection with the drought. The Government's
current budget turned from a deficit of CFAF 200 million in 1966 into a sur-
plus of CFAF 300 million in 1967, and since then a surplus of between
CFAF 300 and 900 million has been generated every year. The Government was
thus able to liquidate the stock of unpaid bills by 1969, and the public
sector as a whole has been able to gradually build up substantial reserves
with the Central Bank. These were negative in 1966 and close to CFAF 10
billion or 4-5 months of imports in mid-1974.



-3-
7.        This remarkable financial performance has been achieved at a cost,
however, with undesirable consequences that have, to some degree, hindered
economic development in three related ways: first, by excessively cutting
back operating funds of the Government's economic services; second, by
limiting Government agencies capacity to participate in the financing of new
development projects; third, by making more difficult the needed follow-up
on a number of projects financed largely by external aid. Thus, while it is
essential for a country like Upper Volta to control carefully current expen-
ditures, it would seem nevertheless that the time is opportune now for a more
aggressive and development-oriented expenditure policy. The first manifest
example of this new orientation is the establishment of a new entity, the
Caisse Nationale de Depots et d'Investissements, which is designed to mobilize
savings from both public and private bodies and channel them into economically
and financially profitable undertakings. This institution started operations
in January, 1975 and has already committed CFAF 2.5 billion for development
projects mainly in the industrial and public utilities sectors and the roads
sector.
Foreign Aid
8.        Over the 12 years from 1960 to 1972, foreign aid disbursements
totalled about CFAF 91 billion ($360 million) or an annual average of
$30 million. About 90 percent of total aid disbursements have been grants
and the remainder loans, of which 90 percent on concessionary terms. Capi-
tal aid has constituted the largest component accounting for about 65 per-
cent of total aid, followed by technical assistance (20 percent).
9.        Foreign sources have financed more than two-thirds of total actual
investment expenditures under the first Development Plan (1967-70), and are
expected to finance about four-fifths of total estimated investment (CFAF 63.2
billion) under the second Development Plan (1972-76). The major sources of
aid have been the "Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation" (FAC) of France, and the
"Fonds Europeen de Developpement" (FED) of the European Economic Community.
These two agencies together have provided between 1960 and 1972 about 75 per-
cent of all foreign aid to Upper Volta, principally in the form of grants.
French aid has been quite diversified; for example for the period 1969-73,
about half the total was capital aid for specific projects; one fourth,
technical assistance; the remainder, "equipment grants" to the Government's
budget. French capital aid in 1972 was distributed as follows: infrastruc-
ture (65 percent), production development, i.e., agriculture (26 percent),
general studies (16 percent), and social equipment (15 percent). FED aid
has been entirely grant, mainly for capital projects. Highest priority
was given to agriculture (52 percent) and social sectors (42 percent) in the
first FED (1958-1963); to road construction (about half) in the second FED
(1964-68); to some large agro-industrial projects, such as the sugar plant
at Banfora in the third FED (1969-74). IDA is gradually becoming one of the
main sources of aid with total commitments as of May 31, 1975, of $39.7
million (not including this project). Other aid agencies and countries with
sizeable programs now include UNDP, USAID, and the Federal Republic of
Germany.



-4-
10.       Outstanding external public debt at the end of 1973 was US$120
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$89 million. This figure
includes a loan of $44.5 million from the People's Republic of China. The
status and terms of this loan are not known as yet. The ratio of debt service
payments to exports of goods and non-factor services was about 6 percent in
1973, and is not expected to vary much in the near future. The Association's
share of total external debt (including undisbursed) at the end of 1974 was
about 18%. The Association only began lending to Upper Volta in 1969 and
therefore its share in debt service is still insignificant.
Development Policies and Prospects
11.       The three plans, 1966-1970, 1971 (interim), and 1972-76 undertaken
so far have generally been well conceived, well oriented documents taking a
realistic view of the country's meager resource base. As the First Plan,
the current Plan (1972-76) is essentially a set of sectoral projects, and
its target is very moderate, i.e., an annual real growth rate of GDP of 3.5
percent. The Plan correctly assigns highest priority to rural development
and in this sector, specific attention is paid to a program for the development
of the river valleys following the Riverblindness eradication campaign that
effectively started at the end of 1974. The Government also attaches high
priority to the exploitation of manganese deposits in the northern regions,
an undertaking that would require construction of a rail link of 350 Km.
between Ouagadougou and the prospective mine at Tambao. For the first two
years of the Plan, 1972 and 1973, financing commitments reached almost 100
percent of targets, while projects execution met about three-fourths of the
objective, which should be considered as a relatively good performance. Ex-
ternal financing of capital expenditure has apparently not been the major
obstacle in carrying out the Plan so far; on the other hand, lack of operat-
ing funds, limited administration capacity, inadequate preparation of pro-
jects, and most recently adverse external factors as diverse as drought,
world inflation, and delays in deliveries of material and equipment from
overseas, are very real obstacles to the smooth execution of projects.
12.       Foreign capital and technical assistance will continue to play a
decisive role in the development of Upper Volta. The economic mission's
estimates show that a moderate increase in the real value of foreign aid,
relative to the 1972 level, should occur over the next six years (1975-1980),
and that this should be sufficient to meet the costs of economic expansion
at a rate -- about 2 percent per annum of GDP growth per capita in real
terms -- which is considered consistent with the country's absorptive capacity
in the medium run. However, if this aid is to be truly effective, there will
be need for better coordination within the Government and for some relaxation
of present budgetary limits over development expenditures. On the other hand,
foreign aid should continue to be provided on concessionary terms, in view
of the present level of poverty of the country and its limited growth poten-
tial.  External debt service at present absorbs about 6 percent of Upper
Volta's export earnings, and although this figure is fairly low in absolute
terms, it is high in relation to the country's very limited savings capacity.
Although Upper Volta should be expected to make a more significant contribu-
tion to the financing of public investment, this will necessarily remain
modest, and external lending agencies must continue to finance a high pro-
portion of total costs, including local costs of development projects.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date the Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's development
has consisted of eight IDA projects totaling $39.7 million on which a little
over US$7.65 million has so far been disbursed (Annex II). The first tele-
communications project, for which a credit of US$0.8 million was made in
1969, was completed in September of 1974. The West Volta Cotton project,
for which a credit of US$6.2 million was made in 1970, has not proceeded as
well as planned mainly because of drought conditions which led farmers to
favor food crops over cotton growing. Linked with this was a credit of
US$2.8 million approved in 1972 for upgrading to gravelled surface two roads
in the project area; an increase of US$1.35 million in the amount of this
credit was approved by the Executive Directors in March 1974 to take into
account increases in project cost due to currency realignments and to cost
overruns on the road construction component. The rural development fund
project, for which a credit of US$2.2 million was approved in 1972, is now
making some progress after a slow start resulting from delays over project
prefinancing and staff appointments; a similar project for Drought Relief
(US$2.0 million) was approved in December of 1972. Further credits of
US$2.85 million for an education project and US$4.5 million for a second
telecommunications project were approved in June 1973, and the projects are
now getting underway. The Bougouriba rural development project (US$8 million
credit approved in June 1974) has been delayed by difficulties in recruiting
expatriate staff, but these are being overcome, and the project should be
started satisfactorily in the near future. Finally, the Livestock Development
Project (US$9.0 million) was approved by the Executive Directors on May 27,
1975.
14.       The Bank Group's strategy in Upper Volta is dictated by the extreme
poverty of the country and the need to raise productivity in agriculture and
livestock on which the bulk of the population depend for a livelihood. Some
basic infrastructure is required for the operation of the economy, and the
IDA projects for telecommunications, and road construction and road better-
ment are designed to help in providing this. For the rest, IDA lending is
directed primarily to projects in agriculture, education and rural village
improvements with special emphasis on operations which will favor movements
of people away from the overpopulated central plateau with poor soils to
the southwest where ecological conditions are much better. Within this
broad strategy, the campaign for the control of riverblindness in the Volta
River Basin, for which the Bank has been mobilizing the necessary external
financing, should open up new opportunities for investment in land settlement
and agricultural development, and the Bank Group stands ready to assist in
the identification, preparation and eventual financing of suitable projects
in this field. Meanwhile, a special unit has been created with the assist-
ance of the French Government to prepare schemes for the development of some
of the river valleys.
15.       In addition to the proposed project, a number of projects are under
consideration for IDA financing. Consultants are currently preparing and



-6-
evaluating the West Volta Cotton Project with a view to the preparation of
a follow-up project which would probably take the form of an integrated
rural development project. A second Rural Development Fund operation and
additional highway financing based on studies carried out under the earlier
project (Credit 316 UV) are further possibilities for the next two years.
PART III: ROAD SECTOR
Roads and Agricultural Development
16.       As stated previously (para. 3), the country's economy depends on
agriculture which provides a livelihood for more than 90 percent of the
population. Agricultural development is however limited by three major
factors: sparse rainfall, ranging from 1,000-1,300 mm annually in the south
to only about 500-800 mm in the north; generally poor soils, except for some
regions in the south and west; and the prevalence of debilitating diseases,
in particular bilharzia and onchocerciasis (Riverblindness), which affect
large segments of the population. In addition to the constraints imposed by
nature, one of the primary factors inhibiting the development of agricultural
production is the poor condition (due primarily to inadequate maintenance)
and in many cases the total absence, of rural roads.
The Marketing System
17.       Agricultural production falls into two main categories, crops grown
for export, mainly cotton and groundnuts, and those grown for domestic con-
sumption, primarily cereals; the mechanism for marketing and price-setting
varies according to these categories. In the case of export commodities,
producer prices and exporter margins are officially set by the Caisse de
Stabilisation des Prix des Produits (CSPP), and the products are marketed
mainly by private traders who are licensed by CSPP, and who sell to exporters.
The impact that may be expected from road improvement in this case is limited
to the savings in transport costs. With respect to the marketing of cereals,
total production of which accounts for about 80 percent of the country's agri-
cultural output, the situation is different and road improvement would have
a much wider impact. Minimum producer prices for cereals are set by the
Ministry of Finance prior to the marketing season, but except for this
restriction, products are sold freely. Private traders predominate and
competition prevails in the most accessible areas. In regions where poor
road conditions allow limited access, the pattern is different; in such cases,
the unreliability of transport and the resulting high costs of the service
tends to discourage traders from collecting produce, and farmers are conse-
quently less inclined to generate marketable surpluses. The lack of competi-
tion means that the few traders who do enter these areas to collect produce
derive high profit margins. In these circumstances, road improvement should
both increase producer prices commensurate with the reduction of transport
costs to the market and generate substantial production increases.



-7-
Highway Network and Traffic
18.       For administrative purposes, the road system is divided into two
categories: classified (about 8,700 km) which are grouped into national,
departmental, and regional roads; and unclassified (about 7,800 km) which
consist only of tracks. Functionally, the system is divided into trunk roads
and rural roads. For the purpose of this project, the rural network consists
of departmental and regional roads, and tracks.
19.       The network of trunk roads (about 4,450 km, of which 575 km paved)
radiates from the capital city Ouagadougou and the main commercial center
Bobo-Dioulasso, and is generally adequate for current needs. The majority
of the unpaved roads are gravel-surfaced and are considered to be of all-
weather standard, but sections are often closed to heavy traffic for short
periods after major rains. The rural roads are essentially dry-weather
facilities which become impassable during the rains; a large number of these
roads have deteriorated over the past decade due to lack of proper mainte-
nance.
Road Transport Industry
20.       The road transport industry is highly fragmented, consisting of one
large fleet operator and many very small firms or owner-operators. The
industry is supervised by the Transport Division of the Ministry of Public
Works, Transport, and Urban Development (NPW) but there are at present no
significant barriers to entry or other regulations inhibiting growth. The
bulk of goods traffic in the country is carried by an estimated 8,100 heavy
vehicles; on rural roads, small vehicles continue to account for much of the
commercial traffic.
Highway Administration
21.       Within the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Develop-
ment (MPW), the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) is responsible for the
planning, design, construction, and maintenance of roads and bridges. DPW
is divided into four divisions for planning and design of new works; mainte-
nance of national roads; equipment and mechanical workshops; and the newly
established division for rural roads (SERS). DPW also operates a technical
training school in Ouagadougou (Centre de Formation des Techniciens des
Travaux Publics) for foremen, mechanics, and operators.
22.       DPW's maintenance division which is responsible for national roads
has been supported over the past several years by about US$5.0 million worth
of highway equipment provided by FAC which covers most of its needs. Mainte-
nance of rural roads is the responsibility of local authorities, but they have
had neither the funds, equipment, nor personnel necessary to undertake the
work required. Responsibility for these roads has now been taken over by SERS
(established in January 1975).



- 8 -
23.       SERS has four sections for administration, studies, construction
and improvement, and maintenance. SERS will rely for the establishment of
priorities of rural road construction and planning of annual programs on a
Bureau of Planning and Programming (Development Credit Agreement Section
3.02) to be created within DPW. The Bureau will serve as a liaison between
the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Planning, and will be respon-
sible for the country's entire road network, primarily for: (i) collecting
and evaluating traffic and inventory data on a permanent basis; (ii) formulating
and coordinating with the various Government agencies the priorities for road
improvement; and (iii) analyzing sector issues for developing transport policy
recommendations and future investment plans. The Government has requested
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to help establish the Bureau,
and to provide two experts for about three years, as well as overseas fellow-
ships for local staff. UNDP has indicated its willingness in principle to
provide this assistance, and would wish the Bank Group to act as executing
agency. Early establishment of the unit is important to improving DPW's insti-
tutional capacity. Assurances were obtained from Government at negotiations
that the Bureau will be established not later than June 30, 1976 (Development
Credit Agreement Section 3.02), the expected starting date for the physical
implementat'on of the project. The receipt of a firm commitment from the UIDP
or such other source of technical assistance as shall be acceptable to the
Association to provide the borrower with the technical assistance needed to
establish and maintain the Bureau of Planning and Programming referred to
above, is a condition of effectiveness of the project. (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 6.01).
24.       Most of DPW's foreign assistance staff is provided by FAC; there
are at present 31 FAC experts at various levels, including three Division
Chiefs, some accountants, and several highway technicians supplementing the
84 local staff. The Government is presently making a major effort to train
Voltaics to take over positions in DPW now held by forelgn staff.
Financing Highway Maintenance
25.       Maintenance of national roads is financed through allocations frorm
a Road Fund established in 1968, as well as through supplementary appropria-
tions from the current budget, and by contributions from FAC. Total alloca--
tions to DPW Lor this purpose ranged from CFAF 550 million (US$2.5 million
equivalent) in 1968 to CFAF 693 million (US$3.1 million equivalent) in 1974.
26.       According to the law establishing the Road Fund, 59 percent of all
Government revenue from taxes, duties, and other levies on gasoline and diesel-
oil are to be allocated to the Fund and used exclusively on the national net-
work. Revenues increased from US$5.2 million equivalent in 1970 to US$6.1
million equivalent in 1974, representing about 10 percent of the current
budget. However, the Ministry of Finance, in line with its general policy
of fiscal austerity, has not been making allocations to the Road Fund as
stipulated by law, and between 1970-74, allocations ranged between only 46
percent and 57 percent of the revenues accruing to the Fund. The reduced
allocations have not been detrimental to the national road network and the
Association feels that they were justified given the priorities created as
a result of the drought.



27.       For maintenance of rural roads, the annual allocation to DPEW on
termination of the proposed project should be about CFAF 200 million (US$0.9
million) to assure effective operations. This additional expenditure for
maintenance of rural roads would not appear to be an excessive burden on public
finances and could be met from the revenues from fuel taxes which, as indicated
above, are only partly used for the maintenance of national roads. During nego-
tiations Government agreed to allocate CFAF 200 milllon for rural road maintenance
in the first year after project completion, and that this amount will be aug-
mented in line with cost increases, and adjusted to reflect the evolution of
maintenance requirements on the rural road network (Development Credit Agree-
ment, Section 4.04). Although the initial financing requirements of the feeder
road maintenance program will not initially be an unbearable burden on public
finances, it is not negligible in comparison to the requirements of the national
network and could conceivably increase very substantially as the scope of the
feeder road operation increases. Alternative sources of revenues should there-
fore be sought. They could possibly come from the budget of the local communi-
ties who will directly benefit from the feeder road improvement maintenance
program, or alternatively the local communities could participate in the execution
of the work through self help programs. In addition to providing relief to the
public finances these alternatives would ensure that local communities are
committed to the feeder road program. The Government will review these
alternative financing methods and discuss its findings with IDA no later
than June 30, 1976.
The Road Construction Industry
28.       Since 1968, an average of about CFAF 2.5 billion (US$11 million
equivalent) has been spent on road investments.    All major contracts have
been carried out by foreign firms, many of which operate throughout West
Africa. There is only one local contractor of any importance involved in
road construction works, and his firm's activities are limited to supply and
haulage of materials, and construction of culverts. On the other hand, 15
domestic entrepreneurs who have the potential to carry out some of the civil
works called for in the project, had contracts with DPW in 1973. The
Government will use local contractors as widely as possible in carrying
out the annual rural roads improvement program (see para. 36).
Training of Local Entrepreneurs
29.       To help develop the domestic industry, the Government in 1970
created the Office de Promotion de }'Entreprise Voltaique (OPEV) and gave
it responsibility for training and assisting the management of small- and
medium-sized domestic enterprises.   OPEV has a training center which provides
courses in accounting, management and elementary technology for home construc-
tion; about 275 Voltaics have been trained so far.
30.       Since its creation, OPEV received technical and financial assistance

et de Promotion Artisanale) (CFAF 180 million); from Germany (DM 925,000 or
CFAF 85 million); and as of February 1975, from UNIDO (US$530,000 or CFAF 119
million).
PART IV: THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Rural Road Project" (No. 738-UV)
is being circulated separately. A credit and project summary, including a
breakdown of costs is contained in Annex III, and the project area is shown on
the attached map (IBRD 11504). The project is based on a study financed by
FAC and carried out by BCEOM (France) in 1972 and on additional project prep-
aration done by RMWA. A field appraisal took place in December 1974 and
negotiations were held in Ouagadougou from May 21, 1975 through May 24, 1975.
The Voltaic delegation was led by His Excellency, MIahamadou Ouedrago, Minister
of Public Works, Transport and Urban Development.
The Project Area
32.       The proposed project is concentrated in the West and South of the
country, on the Mossi Plateau and in the Sahelian area. There is a marked
regional bias towards the agricultural development frontiers in the areas
of the West Volta, the White Volta and Banfora and Bougouriba. There are
2,100 km of existing rural roads to be maintained under the project and
1,200 km of roads to be improved.
Project Description
The proposed project would cover a three-year period and consist
of:
(a) Improving and subsequent maintenance of about 1,200 km
of rural roads, and maintenance of about 2,100 km of
existing rural roads;
(b) strengthening of SERS through technical assistance to MPW
for implementation of the above road program, and procurement
of highway equipment; and
(c) consulting services for an evaluation study of the impact
and effectiveness of road components included in agricul-
tural and rural development projects financed by the
Association over the past five years.



Project Execution
34.       Physical execution of the project is expected to start in mid-1976,
and to take about three years to complete. DPW will be responsible for over-
all execution. SERS will submit to the Director of DPW annual work programs
prepared by the Bureau of Planning and Programming in coordination with SERS'
studies group. DPW will present this program for approval to an Interministerial
Technical Committee (ITC) which the Government plans to create shortly. It is
intended that ITC will be chaired by the Minister of Public Works and consist
of representatives of Ministries and local agencies which have a direct interest
in rural roads; ITC will be similar to a committee which was created for the
Drought Relief Fund project, and which is functioning satisfactorily. The
Government has provided assurances at Credit negotiations that ITC will be
established not later than June 30, 1976 (Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.04(a)). Once SERS' annual program is adopted by ITC, it will be submitted
to the Association-for approval; the Association will satisfy itself that the
roads selected for improvement meet agreed criteria (Development Credit Agree-
ment, Section 3.04(b)).
35.       In order to create a legal basis for budgetary appropriations for
improvement and maintenance works, all roads included in the project which
are not yet classified must be upgraded into this category. Accordingly,
the Government provided assurances at negotiations that it will fulfill the
required administrative and legal procedures for classifying such roads.
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.03).
36.       Road improvement and maintenance works will be carried out by SERS'
own forces, with some support provided by contractors and community self-
help programs. In view of the scattered nature of the operations and the
flexibility required in conducting them, this method of execution is expected
to provide the lowest cost solution. Contractors (most likely small domestic
entrepreneurs) would be involved in the construction of minor works, mainly
drainage and crossing structures, and in haulage of road surfacing materials.
(See para. 41).
37.       Regarding the proposed community action programs, basically similar
labor-intensive work methods were used extensively in execution of the RDF/DRF
projects, but the degree of participation of the population as well as the
technical results were uneven among the various project areas. In the present
project, labor-intensive activity can be applied most effectively in day-to-day
patching and repairs, clearing of ditches and culverts, and minor earthworks.
The extent to which SERS intends to make use of labor-intensive methods,
local contractors and self-help schemes will be described in the work program
to be submitted to the Association for its approval (para. 34).
38.       Consultants should be engaged in time to permit them to a start on
the evaluation study not later than September 1976. (Development Credit Agree-
ment, Section 3.03). SERS will be assisted by the Bureau of Planning and
Programming in supervising the study.

Training
39.       Although the proposed project does not finance a specific training
component, it does provide a medium for the development of a wide range of
technical skills. To carry out the project SERS will require about 120
foremen, mechanics, plant operators, equipment overseers, and laborers; these
personnel would all be recruited and trained locally at DPS's technical
training school in Ouagadougou (Centre de Formation des Techniciens des
Travaux Publics). In addition, the duties of the technical assistance
experts under the project would include on-the-job training of qualified
local counterparts.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
40.       The total cost of the project net of taxes but including con-
tingencies is US$8.5 million. The proposed Credit of US$7.5 million will
finance 88 percent of total project costs net of taxes, i.e., all the
foreign costs (US$6.8 million) and US$0.9 million equivalent of the local
costs. The remaining local costs of the project (US$1 million equivalent)
plus about US$1.7 million equivalent in taxes, will be provided by the
Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       Equipment, materials, and spare parts and supplies amounting to
US$4.1 million will be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Items which would not be
bulked into packages costing US$40,000 equivalent or less and which would not
be sufficient to attract the interest of foreign bidders could be purchased
through local suppliers in accordance with Government competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Association. Manufactured items in this category
are available from local representatives of international suppliers, service is
adequate and prices are competitive, the total amount of such purchases would
not exceed US$250,000. Contracts for selected minor works (mainly drainage
and crossing structures) and haulage of materials, will be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertized locally following procedures which are
acceptable to IDA. A small part of project cost (US$0.7 million) would be for
staff salaries and operating costs which are not suitable for competitive bid--
ding. Studies will be executed by consultants selected in agreement with, and
under terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
42.       Credit funds will be disbursed as follows:
(a)  100 percent of c.i.fL. costs (Bobo-Dioulasso or Ouadougou) of
imported equipment, spare parts, and materials;
(b)  100 percent of foreign expenditures for consulting services
and technical assistance;



- 13 -
(c) 50 percent of total expenditures (net of taxes) for direct
operating costs for betterment and maintenance works by SERS'
forces; and
(d) 80 percent of total costs (net of taxes) of works by
contractors.
Benefits and Justification
43.       The economic justification of the project rests on two complemen-
tary factors: favorable conditions for road construction and low traffic
volumes. The first element results from the generally easy terrain in the
country and the abundance of natural construction materials which make it
possible to achieve major road improvements at very low cost. Traffic volume
is low and goods generally move in small vehicles, thus transport costs are
high; as a result, any road improvement tends to have a substantial impact
on the level of transport costs. The combined effect of the above factors
implies that relatively small expenditures on improvement and maintenance of
rural roads can be expected to have a significant impact on transport condi-
tions and in turn on agricultural production.
44.       Institution-building is of primary importance, and the component
included in the project represents a major benefit which cannot be quantified.
It consists of: (i) establishment within DPW of a division for improving and
maintaining rural roads; and (ii) establishment of an ITC for coordinating
the development of agriculture and of rural roads. Also a Bureau of Planning
and Programming would be created at the level of the DPW.
45.       The overall economic justification for the improvement works will
become available only as project execution progresses and specific roads are
selected; for roads which have been identified, a rate of return of between
10 percent and 18 percent has been ascertained. All roads selected will have
to yield an economic rate of return of at least 10 percent.
46.       The economic justification of the maintenance component of the
project is based on vehicle operating cost savings only. It ignores any
attributable indirect benefits resulting from induced agricultural develop-
ment. The computed economic return is therefore very conservative, ranging
between 10-18 percent, depending on assumptions made about the rate of road
deterioration with no maintenance.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Upper Volta, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit,
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for credits for highway projects. Special features of interest
are referred to in paragraphs 23 through 38 of this report. The receipt of
a firm commitment from the UNDP or such other source of technical assistance
as shall be acceptable to the Association to provide the borrower with the
technical assistance needed to establish and maintain the Bureau of Planning
and Programming referred to above, is a condition of effectiveness of the
Project    (Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01).
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EvXECUTION
Credit 225: West Volta Cotton Project. US$6.2 Million Credit of
December 30, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 1976
The project is in the final stage of a cotton production development
program in West Volta, which originally started with FAC financing in 1963.
It consists of both expansion of the area under cotton cultivation on some
46,000 farms and improvement of yields through credit and extension services,
and provision of better communications and processing facilities. The proj-
ect also includes funds for detailed engineering of secondary roads and prepara-
tion of the Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project.
Plagued by very poor weather conditions during the past three years
and a severe drought last year, seed cotton production in the project area
remained below expectations (about 20,000 t as against 50,000 t estimated in
the appraisal report) and the areas under cotton also remained stagnant.
Improved rainfall distribution in 1974/75 increased yields to about 25,000 t.
which however is still low.
Because of the low production, the existing ginneries in Bobo-
Dioulasso and Koudougou work at only 50 percent capacity, and therefore the
construction of an additional ginnery at Hounde, estimated in the appraisal
report at CFA 256 million, is for the time being not justified. With
favorable weather conditions and improved prices, the project areas may
reach the 40,000 t production goal in 1978, at which point the present gin-
neries would have to work at full capacity.
Although the production goals as set out in the appraisal report
have not yet been reached, the project is having a favorable impact on the
rural population of the project area and therefore a follow-up rural develop-
ment project is being considered.
Credit 316: Road Project. US$4.15 Million Credit of June 26, 1972
(as amended on March 25, 1974); Closing Date December 31,
1975
Originally the project comprised (a) the reconstruction of the
Solenzo Koudougou (70 km) and the Hounde-Bereba (27 km) roads, and (b) fea-
sibility studies for about 400 km of primary roads, and engineering of those
sections found to have the highest priority.
The pre-selection of contractors for part (a) above took place in
November 1972. Four bids were received in 1973, the lowest being about 25
percent higher than the appraisal estimate. Construction of the Solenzo
Koudougou road began in March 1974. This road should be completed shortly.
Construction of the Hounde-Bereba road is now deleted from the project as
cotton production does not merit the construction of the ginnery and without
the ginnery there is no justification for the road. Government suggestions
for alternative road projects are being considered presently.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 6 pages
Regarding (b) above, the Government proposed four roads to be
studied and the Association agreed to only two, from Bobo-Dioulasso to Hounde
and Bobo-Dioulasso to Banfora (a total of about 190 kim) as these were the
only roads considered likely to show a satisfactory rate of return. Feasi-
bility studies have been completed and detailed engineering is now underway.
Due to currency realignments and to cost overruns on the road
construction part of the project, the dollar cost of the project increased.
Consequently, to enable completion of the project, on March 25, 1974 the
Association approved an increase of US$1.35 million in the amount of the
Credit from US$2.8 million to US$4.15 million. It is expected that the proj-
ect will be completed and the credit fully disbursed by the present closing
date.
Credit 317: Rural Development Fund Project. US$2.2 Million Credit of
June 26, 1972; Closing Date September 30 1976
Between 300,000 and 450,000 people are benefiting from the project.
The Rural Development Fund (RDF) Division has been established within the
Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) to execute the project; it started
operating in September 1972. BND's performance and project management are
satisfactory. It has just completed its first annual program on the basis of
proposals made by the Organismes Regionaux de Developpement (ORD). The main
components of this program are dug and tube wells, village warehouses and
development of bottomlands. Execution of the project which started slowly
mainly due to delays over project prefinancing and staff appointments has
gained momentum during the 1973/74 season. Experience has shown that the
project concept is sound, in that financing small projects can have a direct
and beneficial effect on the poorest 40 percent who are willing to co-
operate fully in contributing their labor. It is also encouraging to see
how a fairly complex management set-up involving the expertise of various
governmental institutions (iER, PW, Agriculture and the ORD) can be used to
make a combined effort in rural development. A follow-up project, RDF II, is
presently under preparation.
Credit 430: Education Project. US$2.85 Mlillion Credit of September 28,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973 and signed on September 28,
1973.  It became effective on June 27, 1974.
The project consists of two parts:
Part A
Reconstruction and equipping of 40 rural education centers (CERs)
and equipping of 80 such centers; organization equipping and servicing of 150
cooperative groups (GPS) of former CER students as the pilot phase of a



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
scheme to create some 500 such groups; creation of three rural development
centers; related technical assistance for project implementation and evalua-
tion; a feasibility study of a system to train managers for rural development
projects.
Part B
Provision of science facilities for 21 secondary schools.
While progress on Part B of the project which is under the Ministry
of Education has been satisfactory, there have been no disbursements under
Part A. This is mainly the result of the weakness in project management. The
rural education part of the project is particularly complex because it involves
the coordination of two other donors, the FAC and the FED. In addition,
certain changes proved necessary in the concept of rural education: (a) the
linkage of the centers to specific rural development activities; (b) full
participation of the communities in the objectives of the centers.
The Project is under continuous supervision from the RMWA in
Abidjan and the Government, FAC, FED and the Bank are working to strengthen
project management.
Credit 431: Second Telecommunications Project. US$4.5 Million Credit of
September 28, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973 and signed on September
28, 1973. It became effective on May 23, 1974.
This credit, the second made to Upper Volta for telecommunications,
finances the major part of Upper Volta's 1974-77 telecommunications expansion
program. The project comprises provision of automatic and trunk switching
equipment, local distribution networks and subscribers' apparatus, microwave
links, auxillary construction and equipment, consultants services and training
of personnel. The executing agency for the project is the Office des Postes
et Telecommunications de Haute-Volta (OPT) an autonomous public entity.
The execution of the project has been progressing on schedule. All
major contracts were awarded by the end of 1974. It should be completed by
December 1977. As compared to appraisal forecasts, project costs have in-
creased only slightly on the project's local cost components, and the
IDA Credit is judged sufficient to cover the project's foreign exchange
requirements. The financial results for the year ending December 31, 1973
were satisfactory, though the actual rate of return was 8 percent compared to
the appraised rate of return of 10.4 percent. OPT financial outlook for the
years 74-77 is projected to deteriorate, however. OPT is aware of this, and
is currently studying several financial policy alternatives.

Credit 442: Drought Relief Project. US$2.0 Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976
The Credit was approved on November 13, 1973 and signed on December
7, 1973. It was declared effective on April 24, 1974.
This Credit is one of six credits made available to the six Sahelian
countries to help people in drought-affected areas to re-establish their
self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improvement of their farms and
herds. The project is being executed by the Rural Development Fund Division
which was established within the Banque Nationale de Developpement to execute
the on-going IDA-financed Rural Development Fund Project.
The project consists of four sub-projects; (i) construction and
equipment of 150 wells; (ii) construction of three earth dams; (iii) purclhase
of road equipment for repair of feeder roads; (iv) construction of six seed
storage warehouses. The Project area is that part of Northern Upper Volta
affected by the drought.
The procurement phase is completed and the execution of the tube-
well drilling program, the most important component of the project, will St.!''
shortly. The well drilling program was delayed for almost one year due to
default by suppliers of vehicle parts and drilling pipes, which are essential
to the assembling of the drilling rigs. It is anticipated that ouly one
of the originally planned three dams will be constructed due to price increases
in the other sub-projects. Management has the project well in hand, but it
is doubtful that the project will be completed on time due to the late arrival
of new drilling rigs.
Credit 496: Bougouriba Agricultural Development. US$8.0 Million
Credit of July 19, 1974; Closing Date May 31, 1979
The Credit was approved on May 30. 1974 and signed on July 19,
1974. The Credit is not yet effective and no disbursements have taken place.
Delays have been due primarily to problems in recruiting key staff. However,
the Project Director has been appointed and preparatory work is proceeding,
and the credit should become effective very shortly.
The project, to be carried out over a four-year period, is the first
major effort to develop the natural and human resources of the Bougouriba ORD.
The project will concentrate on the areas presently free of onchocerciasis.
The project includes food crop and cotton development; a program for prophylac-
tic vaccinations of livestock, provision of agricultural credit and extension
services, well construction, feeder road improvement, intensive staff training,
applied research and road studies.

Financing Plan:           The proposed Credit of US$7.5 million will finance
88 percent of total project costs net of taxes,
i.e., all the foreign costs (US$6.6 million) and
US$0.9 million equivalent of the local costs. The
remaining local costs of the project (US$1.0 million
equivalent) plus about US$1.7 million equivalent in
taxes, would be provided by the Government.

Procurement
Arrangements:           Physical implementation of the project is expected
to start in mid-1976. The project will be executed
by SERS' own forces, with support provided by con-
tractors and community self-help programs. Equipment,
materials, and spare parts and supplies amounting to
US$4.1 million will be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. Items which could not be bulked
into packages costing US$40,000 equivalent or less
and which would not be sufficient to attract the
interest of foreign bidders, could be purchased through
local suppliers in accordance with Government competi-
tive bidding procedures acceptable to the Association.
Manufacture items in this category are available from
local representatives of international suppliers,
service is adequate and prices are competitive; the
total amount of such purchases would not exceed
US$250,000. Contracts for selected minor works
(mainly drainage and crossing structures) and haulage
of materials, will be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertized locally following
procedures which are acceptable to IDA. A small part
of project cost (US$0.7 million) would be for staff
salaries and operating costs which are not suitable
for competitive bidding. Studies will be executed
by consultants selected in agreement with, and under
terms of reference and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
Staffing:                 Of the eleven positions to be created in the SERS(the
Department of Rural Roads), eight can be filled-by
Voltaic personnel. The remaining three positions,
two road engineers and one accountant for equipment

management, will be provided by foreign experts
financed by IDA, each for a period of two years.
Foreign experts would have qualified counterparts,
provided by Government who would replace them after
two years. In addition, 25 man-months of consulting
services are provided to do the expost evaluation
study.
Economic
Rate of Return:         Between 10 and 18 percent.
