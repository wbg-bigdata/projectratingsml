                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                                Slow disbursement level, due to: (a) slow physical progress of some contractors in the three provinces, more specifically in the Northern province; and (b) delays in the
                         submission of withdrawal applications for the completed civil works;
                                Lack of counterpartfunding for the road maintenance component, thus delaying the award of maintenance contracts in Uva province;

                                Lack of allocation of funds to the PRDDs for the routine maintenance, collected through the Vehicle License fee;
                                Relocation of Utilities (power lines, poles, telecom lines and water lines)- behind schedule- requires the respective provincial councils' actions
