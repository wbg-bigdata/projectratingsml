EAST PAKISTAN
FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Pakistan has requested IDA financing for the
establishment of modern grain stora0e and handling facilities in East
Pakistan. The total estimated cost of the Project, excluding the construc-
tion of a port silo at Chalna, is $39 million equivalent, of which $24 mil-
lion would be foreign exchange cost. The Swedish Government has offered to
contribute 20 percent, or $4.8 million, towards the financing of the foreign
exchange cost. An IDA credit for the balance of the foreign exchange cost,
$19.2 million, is recommended.
ii.       The Project would provide five reinforced concrete silos with a
total capacity of 315,000 tons, located at strategic points for efficient
distribution of foodgrains throughout the Province. Although the Project
includes a silo of 80,000 ton capacity at the proposed port of Chalna, only
site surveys and engineering design are being financed at this time due to
uncertainties regarding the proposed port. When these uncertainties have
been cleared up, the Government proposes to approach the Association for the
financing of the construction of the Chalna silo.
iii.      In addition to the construction of silos, the Project would pro-
vide for the improvement of existing storage facilities, the establishment
of modern inventory control methods, the introduction of effective control
of insect infestation and damage, the provision for bulk transportation of
grain, and the provision of technical assistance in management and operation
of modern grain storage and transportation systems.
iv.       The Project would be executed by the Food Department of the Pro-
vincial Government of East Pakistan. This Department would be suitably
strengthened through improved organization and appointment of necessary
personnel.
v.        Tenders for the construction work involved would be subject to
competitive international bidding. Detailed engineering designs, prelim-
inary works and the awarding of contracts would require about one year; and
the construction of silos would require an additional 2/2 years.
vi.       The Project -would produce benefits by reducing spoilage of food-
grains, reducing shipping, port and inland transportation costs through
bulk handling, and by making possible increased efficiency in overall stor-
age, handling and milling of grains.  Without any increase in imports, the
people of East Pakistan w,ould have more grain foods of better quality.
vii.      The local currency cost would be provided through allocations in
the budget of the Provincial Government. The borrower would be the Central
Government, which would relend the proceeds of the proposed credit to the
Provincial Government on the same terms and conditions as those agreed upon
between IDA and the borrower.



EA ST    PAK IS T AN
FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        East Pakistan faces a serious problem in the storage and handling
of foodgrains. Grain storage is the responsibility of the Food Department
of the Provincial Government, whose function it is to assure adequate
supplies to consumers at reasonable cost, to meet emergency shortages due
to natural disasters and to guarantee a fair and stable price to producers.
2.        The Food Department's problem in storage, marketing and price
stabilization are complicated by year to year variations in rice production
which have amounted to as much as 28 percent (Annex 1). The situation is
rendered even more difficult by regional differences in production relative
to consumption. Of the 17 districts of Pakistan, nine have a surplus over
local needs and eight a deficit. In addition, foodgrain production as a
whole has been about 9 percent short of needs in recent years. To meet
this deficit, wheat and rice were imported, Imports during the period
1957-1965 averaged 700,000 tons annually. M4ost of the recent imports have
been wheat. All imports have been received and marketed by the Food
Department.
3.        The role of the Food Department in storage and handling of dom-
estic production is limited since most locally grown rice is kept on the
farms and in the villages with only about 10 percent moving through trade
channels beyond the village level. In years of surplus production, however,
the Department may make substantial purchases in line with its price sup-
port operations.
4.        The Food Department is handicapped by not having modern grain
storage facilities. Grains have to be bagged and stored in flat storage
sheds, or so-called "godowns", in vhich effective fumigation is difficult.
In this type of storage, excessive damage is caused by rodents, insects,
molds and moisture.
5.        In April 1963, the Government of Pakistan consulted the Bank on
the problem. The Food Department of the Provincial Government subsequently
engaged the Wleitz-Hettelsater engineering firm in Lecember 1963 to carry
out a storage study. The resulting feasibility report was completed in
September 1964. Appraisal of this foodgrain storage project is based on
this feasibility study, on engineering surveys subsequently undertaken by
the same consulting firm during December 1964 to April 1965, on information
supplied by the Food Department and on the findings of an appraisal mission
consisting of Messrs. Elco L. Greenshields (Mission Leader), A.J. Leeks
(FAO), C.B. Davidson (FAO), L. Heidenreich (Bank Consultant) and Raymond
Pelon (Bank Consultant), in December 1964 and a follow-up million (Mr. Green
shields) in February/March 1965.

II. BACKGROUND
6.        The economy of East Pakistan is based essentially on agriculture.
About 95 percent of the population is rural with 83 percent engaged directly
in agriculture and 60 percent of the gross national product coming from agri-
culture. With a large part of the population consuming home produced food,
marketing of food is limited. However, with the current shift of population
to cities, the problems of storing, transporting and marketing of foods are
increasing.
Foodgrain Production and Consumption Trends
7.        Rice is the most important crop. It accounts for over three-
fourths of the total crop acreage. Wheat acreage and production is insignifi-
cant. In recent years, annual rice production has averaged approximately 8.0
million tons, ranging from a low of 6.4 to a high of 10.5 million tons (Annex
1). Yearly variations in output have averaged 800,000 tons, or 10 percent
of average production.
8.        Following a stagnant period during the 1950's, food production over
the past five years has increased at a rate of about 31/2 percent annually.
Rice production accounted for a large part of this. About 2)Y2 percent an-
nual growth rate in rice output has been attributed to yield increases and
about 0.8 percent to increased acreage. Prospects for continued increase
in rice acreage are limited, but a continuing increase in yield can be ex-
pected. The feasibility report projects a 2.5 percent annual increase for
rice for the next 10 years and concludes that this would be insufficient to
keep pace with the population increase expected to continue at 2.8 percent
annually.
9.        The consumption rates of foodgrain over the past 10 years have
averaged 14.7 ounces per person per day (Annex 2). Ixlheat provides only a
small percentage of this, but its relative importance has increased. This
development is of importance to the Project.
10.       To meet the overall foodgrain deficit, the Government has promoted
the use of imported wheat for a number of reasons including the now pre-
vailing favorable terms of import under the U.S. PL 480 program and the need
to improve the level and adequacy of the diet of the people. Wheat consump-
tion has been stimulated primarily by keeping the price of wheat approxi-
mately one-third lower than the price of rice. From 1954-1956 to 1962-1965
wheat consumption per capita has increased from 0.1 ounce per day to 1.0
ounce per day (Annex 2). There is now considerable evidence that the people
of East Pakistan have developed a taste for wheat products. Even though
the Province should become self-sufficient in rice production, wheat con-
sumption will likely continue at current or higher per capita levels. To
meet this situation importation would be necessary.
11.       Foodgrain imports into East Pakistan are shown in Annex 3. The
largest yearly import was 1.5 million tons in 1963. Wheat has replaced



- 3 -
rice as the principal foodgrain import. In 1957, wheat and flour represent-
ed only 15 percent of the total, vhile in 1965, about 80 percent of food-
grain imports was wheat.
12.       Based on the assumptions used in the feasibility study that the
population growth will continue to increase at about 2.8 percent per year,
and the per capita intake of wheat will increase with the change to urban-
ization and improved levels of income, the wheat deficit would increase
from about 600,000 tons per year in 1970 to about one million tons by 1975
(Annex 3). The Government in its Third Plan (1965/66-1969/70) anticipates
a substantial increase in rice output but estimates that the wheat imports
into East Pakistan will be of the order of 700,000 tons per year.
III. FOOD DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS
13.       The Food Department of the Provincial Government performs its
functions through four Directorates (Chart 1). The Directorate of Procure-
ment and Distribution functions throughout the Province with four Regional,
17 District and 53 Subdivisional offices. The Directorate of Movement and
Storage maintains storage and movement officers at each of the 10 central
storage depots. The Inspection and Control and the Accounts Directorates
maintain officers only at Provincial Headquarters.
14.       The regulation and control of production, processing, procurement,
storage and distribution of foodstuffs in East Pakistan (both domestic and
imported), are the functions assigned to the Food Department. Its policy
objective is to maintain guaranteed supplies of foodgrains at prescribed
prices to the consumers, especially in urban areas and at times when local
supplies are short during pre-harvest seasons.
15.       The purchase of rice from producers at guaranteed minimum "fair
prices" is designed to increase foodgrain production. By establishing
"ceiling prices" for the foodgrain to consumers, it aims at stabilizing
consumer prices.
16.       The foodgrain storage and distribution system involves the man-
agement of 10 central storage depots (CSD's) having a total capacity of
263,000 tons and 291 local storage depots (ISD's) having a capacity of
474,000 tons. The number and capacity by type, and distribution of godowns
are shown in Annex 4. The CSD's serve mainly as depositories for reserve
grain supplies and the ISD!s mainly as distribution warehouses. In addi-
tion, the Food Department controls stocks in storage agencies and mills
which have approximately 16,000 tons storage capacity. The combined
storage would be sufficient to supply the total foodgrain needs of the
Province for about one month.
17.       The transportation systems and actual flow of wheat are shown in
Maps 1 and 2. All CSD's have rail access, with the exception of Barisal,
which is located on a year-round water route. Four of the CSD's (Chitta-
gong, Khulna, Chandpur and Narayanganj) are located on water and served by



- 4.-
the powered fleet. Roughly 60 percent of the LSD's tonnage is in places
served by railroads in addition to either roads or water transportation.
About 30 percent of ISDts tonnage is served by year-round road or water
transportation and 10 percent is served only by seasonal road or water trans-
portation.
18.       The CSD's received 94 percent of their supplies from the port
cities in 1962, and 97 percent in 1963. Most of the off-take from CSD's is
to ISD's; a part goes directly to flour mills. In 1962 and 1963, respect-
ively, LSD's received l47 and 68 percent of their supplies from ports and the
balance from CSD's. The off-take from LSD's moves out to local dealers and
millew, and a small amount to other LSD's. About 36 percent of the off-take
is moved by rail, 32 percent by truck, 19 percent by boat and 12 percent by
cart.
19.       Each CSD is managed by a storage and movement officer who is res-
ponsible to the Director of Movement and Storage in the Food Department.
The administration of each LSD is the responsibility of the Director of
Procurement and Distribution.
20.       About 10 percent of the total supply of grain (domestic produc-
tion and imports) is handled by the Food Department. The quantity ranges
between 0.8 and 1.0 million tons per annum. The quantity in storage varies
considerably from month to month. The low point occurs in November immed-
iately prior to the harvest of the aman rice crop which normally accounts
for 70 percent of total rice production. The highest storage is immediately
following the aman crop from December to February. The heaviest off-take
is during the monsoons - June through August.
21.       The Food Department receives, stores and markets all foodgrain
inports.  Local procurement by the Food Department comes from two sources.
First there is the amount sold to the Government at established prices on
a voluntary basis by producers. Then there are the stocks acquired through
the conrpulsory sales to the Government in the five-mile zone bordering India.
Sales are compulsory for surpluses over 10 maunds (823 lbs) per family in this
zone where authorities fear smuggling to the neighboring rice deficit areas
of India. The Food Department is prepared to purchase all paddy or rice
offered either through approved dealers or directly from producers. Apart
from the border zone purchases, local procurement is a price support opera-
tion which aims to provide a floor to farm prices rather than to secure
supplies for distribution. Local procurement of rice has been relatively
small, ranging from a few thousand tons to 197,000 tons in 1958/59 (Annex
5). Price support operations, however, are sizeable in years of high pro-
duction. This pattern is likely to continue. Large local purchases in-
crease the storage and handling problems of the Food Department.
IV. STORAGE AND HANDLING LOSSES
22.       Foodgrains, particularly wheat, in East Pakistan are liable to
suffer considerable damage in storage and handling. When grain is stored



- 5 -
improperly, deterioration results from insects, molds, heat, germs, sprout-
ing, rotting, rodents and birds. These factors cause actual wleight loss
and bring about undesirable changes in odor and nutritive value.
23.       Direct losses as accounted for by stocks condemned as unfit for
human consumption have been less than 2 percent of the total off-take from
Food Department godowns. However, this is only a small part of the real
loss. Insect damage is only partially accounted for since inventory con-
trol is made by bag count and not by actual weight and inspection of
quality,
24.       The magnitude of insect damage was checked by sampling stored
grain at all CSD's and a representative sample of LSD's in 1964 (Annex 6).
Grain stored over 3 months showed 65 percent damaged kernels and a lowered
food value of nearly 50 percent. Even grain stored between six weeks to
three months showed nearly 20 percent loss in nutritive value.
25.       Damage due to fungi and moisture has occured under the unfavor-
able climatic conditions characteristic of East Pakistan. In most cases
this type of damage reduce8 the palatability of the grain and causes an
objectionable odor. Records are not available on the amount of grain so
affected, but observations of actual conditions indicate that such damage
is substantial.
26.       In addition to loss through these biological causes, pilferage
during shipment and especially during transshipment, is a source of con-
siderable financial loss. INhen total disappearance of grain is calculated
by comparing the off-take figures with ships manifests, a total loss of
approximately 320,000 tons was apparently suffered in the period 1952 to
1963. These losses are inevitable under the inefficient handling systems
and lack of adequate inventory control.
V. NEED FOR MlODERNI FACILITIES
27.       The foregoing indicates the need to modernize facilities.   Apart
from the improvement of existing godowns so that damage to grain is reduced
to a minimum, the provision of silos to permit safe and rapid bulk handling
is necessary to increase storage and handling capacity and to lower costs.
The increased efficiency of operations would also reduce pipeline require-
ments for imports and relieve port congestion.
28.       Transportation in East Pakistan is a major factor to consider in
the design of a satisfactory foodgrain storage and handling system (Map 1).
A satisfactory foodgrain system must locate storage in such a manner so as
to minimize transport costs and to ensure that periodic interruptions of
the transport system will not seriously affect grain movements. Poor com-
munications, especially during floods, make it essential to maintain reserve
stocks of foodgrains at strategic locations in the interior, as well as at
the ports.



29.       In order to provide silo facilities for both the eastern and
western regions of the Province, which are separated by the great Jamuna-
Meghna rivers, the Project includes port silos at Chittagong and at the
site of the proposed perman'ent port of Chalna. Preliminary studies indi-
cate that Chalna is suitable for a permanent port. About 40 percent of
the grain imports into East Pakistan are now off-loaded at the Chalna
Anchorage. The total volume of cargo handled at the Chalna Anchorage in
1964 was 1.7 million tons. However, before a final decision can be made
regarding the feasibility of a permanent port at Chalna, an engineering
survey of the proposed location would have to be undertaken. For this
reason, the suggested silo at Chalna has been excluded from financing at
the present stage. In case the construction of a port at Chalna does not
prove feasible, the discharge of grain for the western region of the Pro-
vince could continue to be based on lighterage and delivered to a silo at
a suitable alternative location.
30.       In any case, appropriate silo facilities would be provided for
the western areas in order to obtain complete coverage of the Province.
During negotiations the Government advised that it is proceeding to clear
up the problems regarding the location of these facilities as rapidly as
possible. As soon as a firm decision has been made, the Government will
approach the Association for additional financing for the construction of
the silo at Chalna or an alternative location.
VI. THE PROJECT
General Structure of System
31.       The Project would establish a foodgrain storage and handling
system, including: (1) improvement of existing storage facilities; (2)
construction of two port silos and three major inland silos with a combined
capacity of 315,000 tons for bulk grain; (3) establishment of a modern in-
ventory control system; (4) establishment of effective sanitation and
infestation control; (5) provision for bulk transportation of grain; and (6)
provision of technical assistance in the management and operation of modern
silos and in grain inventory and quality control.
Improvement of Existing Storage Facilities
32.      Wiherever possible, godowns which can be economically repaired
would be improved and equipped so that bagged grain could be stored for
short periods relatively free from damage. These improvements would
include: (1) repairing floors to eliminate cracks and crevices; (2) making
buildings bird-proof and rodent-proof; (3) providing proper type venti-
lation; (4) building protective walls around godowns subject to occasional
flooding; (5) improving loading and unloading facilities especially at
major riverside CSD's; and (6) improving access. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Food Department will undertake, on a priority
basis, needed modifications and repairs of godowns.



- 7 -
Construction of Silos and Port Facilities
33.       Five storage and handling silos would be constructed at the ports
of Chittagong and Chalna (or alternative location) and at the inland cities
of Narayanganj, Ashuganj and Santahar. (Map 1).
34.       All silos are designed for construction with reinforced concrete
with loading and unloading capacities sufficient to meet peak seasonal de-
mands and storage capacities sufficient to maintain inventories for emer-
gency needs. Each silo would be equipped for bulk receiving and loading,
for bagging and for bag loading on rail, water and truck, except for the
silo at Santahar where facilities to load bagged grain on barges or country
boats would not be required. Provision would be made for fumigation at the
time the grain reaches the silo, for weighing all grain entering or leaving
the silo, for dust collection and for temperature recording in all major
bins.  Drying equipment would be installed at the Chittagong and Chalna
silos to dry grain which may become wet during unloading operations in rainy
weather.
35.       Contracts for engineering and supervision of construction would
be awarded as early as possible after signing of Credit with the view of
having designs, specifications and tender documents ready wTithin one year
after signing of Credit.  All contracts for construction would be aw.arded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bidders would be pre-
qualified and bids would be requested in separate calls for tenders on each
silo. Each tender would provide for separate schedules on: (1) piling,
docks, railroad trackage and roads; (2) buildings; and (3) all equipment
installed and in operating condition. Bidders would have the option of
bidding on one or all silos and on any or all parts. Land for the silos
has been acquired.
36.       Since construction is generally not practicable during the mon-
soon season, arrangements would be made by the Provincial Government to
have the fill put on the sites at the same time as the engineering design
work is underway during the initial stage of the Project. By doing the
fill work while plans are being prepared, considerable time would be saved
in the final completion of construction. The proposed schedule on all
engineering,construction of the silos and training is shown in Chart 3.
In this schedule, it has been assumed that all silos would be built at the
same time. During negotiations the Government advised that they were al-
ready proceeding with the required fill.
Inventory Control
37.       An inventory control system would be established to ensure that
adequate supplies of foodgrain are maintained in all ISD's, CSD's and silos
at levels corresponding with changing demands.
38.       During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that consultants would be appointed to help draw up a grain inventory sys-
tem and to provide training to personnel. They further agreed to arrange,
as necessary, for the reassignment of staff to a central statistical unit;



- 8 -
to establish a statistical reporting service to provide monthly farm and
retail prices, and quarterly reports on farmer, private dealer and miller
stocks; to coordinate the statistical services of the various departments
so that all required data is fed into the central statistical unit on a
regular basis; and to adopt and put into effect a system of standard wheat
grades.
Infestation Control and Sanitation Measures
39.       Specially trained staff operating modern facilities at each silo
would clean and fumigate any infested wheat entering the silos so that in-
ventories would remain free of infestation as long as stored in the silos.
The temperature recording system in silo bins, the fumigating equipment and
the facilities for drying and turning of grain would make it possible to
maintain grain quality for as long as necessary.
40.       To permit the Food Department to establish an effective program
of infestation control, IDA financing is proposed for the import of chemi-
cals over an establishment period of 3 years (Annex 7). These costs,
totalling US$ 365,ooo, would represent less than 2 percent of the total
proposed financing. This is considered necessary and also justifiable as
a developmental expenditure since the procedures are new to Pakistan.
Timely procurement of the necessary materials has been difficult due to
foreign exchange restrictions and reliance on aid supported imports through
other agencies. These are likely to be changed in view of the overall need
of the country for pesticides, but in the interim the Food Department needs
the foreign exchange funds to make a beginning.
41.       During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that the infestation control staff and services of the Food Department
vould be strengthened, that foreign training and technical assistance would
be obtained as required, and that a modern pest infestation program of
godown storage iould be introduced and put into full operation prior to the
completion of the construction of silos. In addition it was agreed that
the Food Department would import pesticides directly instead of through the
Supply Directorate, the agency responsible for most Government procurement
from abroad.
Transportation
42.       The foodgrain storage and handling system to be provided under
the Project would make possible increased efficiency in the transportation
of foodgrain.  However, the Project does not involve investment in trans-
portation by IDA. Transportation items needed for the Project include
slight modification of railway wagons for bulk hauling, cleaning and in
some cases lining of river boats, steamers and coasters.
43.       During negotiations the Government agreed to take all practicable
steps to make modification of covered rail wagons and to allocate wagons
for bulk grain movement as required for the orderly movement of foodgrain
as visualized under the Project.

44.       Improvements in road and river transport are expected to keep
abreast with the increase in grain movement. As roads are improved and
facilitate greater movement of grain by truck, it can be expected that
trucks capable of hauling bulk grain would be provided by private enter-
prise. Estimated inland flow in 1970/71 is shown in Map 3.
Technical Assistance
45.       The physical plant proposed would not by itself eliminate present
inadequacies, and to make the storage system vork, the provision of well
trained and experienced personnel would be necessary. The successful op-
eration of the Project is, in fact, directly dependent upon the quality of
the management and operating staff. Through technical assistance and the
provision of specialized training, the Project would help provide this
needed management and operating personnel (Annex 8).
46.       The Project provides for the establishment of a management train-
ing program satisfactory to the Association which would include intensive
training of selected management personnel.
VII. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
47.       The Project would be carried out by the Provincial Food Depart-
ment of East Pakistan. During construction and for as long as required
thereafter for the efficient operation of the silos, a Project Manager
would be appointed to serve at the appropriate level in the Food Department.
The Project Manager would act on authority of the Secretary of the Food
Department on all matters relating to the construction of the Project and
in getting the several directorates to carry out the functions and services
necessary for the successful operation of the Project.
48.       A new organization to operate the silos would be established
within the Fbod Department at least one year prior to the completion of the
silos. Each silo would be headed by a superintendent, who would have an
immediate staff for management of operations consisting of a silo foreman
and an assistant foreman (Chart 2).
49.       The accounting of investments for the Project would be made
according to regular established procedures of the Government. Separate
accounts would be kept on the operation of the silos.
50.       During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would make arrangements for the successful operation and management of the
Project satisfactory to the Association. The Government would consult the
Association on the appointments of Project Manager and the Head of the new
Silo Organization. The appointment of the Project Manager would be a prior
condition to effectiveness of the Credit.

under local costs.
52.       The cost estimates are based on first stage engineering investi-
gations, including engineering surveys of the sites selected for the silos,
soil borings to determine foundation conditions, determination of site
improvements, -su-rvey of all road, railway, electric power, water and com-
munication connections, and preliminary designs of each silo based upon
the results of the site engineering. The site engineering surveys were
made in the period January - Apr-il 1965 and all equipment and unit costs
of civil works have been up-dated to this period. The silo cost estimates
include all engineering services. Contingency allowances of approximately
15 percent on foreign exchange costs and 30 percent on local rupee costs
have been added primarily to cover anticipated price increases over the
3>2 year engineering design and construction period.



Operation and lIaintenance Costs
53.       On the basis of the tonnage to be handled with the Chalna silo in
operation, the cost of operation and maintenance of the silos would be as
follows in US$ per ton of grain handled:
Maintenance   Labor and
Silo         Depreciation   Utilities    and repairs   Management   Total
Chittagong          0.99         0.18         0.54           0.30       2.01

54.       The five silos would handle 876,000 tons of grain in 1970/71
(Annex 10), and the estimated annual handling costs would be US$2.05 million.
Annual costs of the infestation control program are estimated at about
US$250,000, making the total annual cost of operation and maintent-nce of
the Project about US$2.3 million. The financing of these costs would be
provided through the regular budgetary allocations to the Food Department.
Financing
55.       The total estimated cost of the Project, excluding construction
of the Chalna silo, is US$39 million equivalent. The estimated foreign
exchange cost is US$24 million equivalent - about 62 percent of the total
cost - and would be for construction, imported equipment and materials, and
engineering services.
56.       The Swedish Government has offered to finance 20 percent, or
US$4,800,OOO of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The proposed IDA
credit would cover the balance of the total estimated foreign exchange cost,
or US$19,200,000.
57.       The local currency cost, US$15 million equivalent (Rs. 71.4 mil-
lion), would be provided through allocations in the budget of the Provin-
cial Government. The borrower would be the Central Government which would
relend the proceeds of the proposed Credit to the Provincial Government on
the same terms and conditions as those agreed upon between IDA, the Swedish
Government and the Central Government.
58.       Expenditures would be approximately as followe, assuming that the
Project would start early in 1966 (Chart 3):

1970          4.4                 3.6                      0.8
Total        39.0                 24.0                    15.0
IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
59.       The benefits from the Project, including the Chalna silo, would
accrue in several ways, chiefly from a reduction in waste and spoilage of
foodgrains, a reduction in ocean shipping and port unloading costs, a re-
duction of inland transportation costs, increased efficiency in storage,
handling and milling of grains, reduction in grain inventories tied up in
transit, and in more effective price stabilization of foodgrain prices. The
Project would, without an increase in foodgrain imports, result in the
people of East Pakistan having not merely more to eat, but food of a much
higher quality.
Transportation Savings
60.       At the ports and anchorages, the Project would provide quick un-
loading facilities for bulk grain. The high port unloading costs, not
considering the cost of grain losses and delays in transit, are shown by an
analysis of the expenditures of the Food Department (Annex 11). On the
basis of the projected wheat tonnage to be received at Chittagong and Chalna
in 29  l, the annual savings in unloading costs on the basis of 1964 costs
would amount to about US$1.6 million.
61.       Another source of transportation benefits resulting from the Pro-
ject would be more efficient and less costly inland freight and handling of
wheat. A conservative estimate of an overall reduction in inland freight
costs would be 10 percent or Rs. 5 per ton. For the projected wheat ton-
nage to be handled in i ),this would amount to an annual saving of over
US$60o,ooo.
62.       Under the Project, grain could be moved in bulk to the major
flour mills in Dacca, Chittagong and Khulna at considerable savings in
trucking and handling [costs. The combined annual savings in bagging and
bag costs alone Tould be about US$300,000.
Savings in Grain Handling Costs
63.       The silos would replace all wheat handling at central storage
depots. A detailed cost analysis of the two CSDts at Dacca and Tejgaon



- 13-
shows that the average cost of handling grain is Rs. 13.10 per ton (Annex
12). Handling costs in silos computed on a comparable basis, including
full depreciation costs on buildings and machinery, would average Rs. 10.44
per ton. The resultant savings of Rs. 2.66 per ton on the projected 633,000
tons of wheat imports with a resulting 876,000 tons to be put through the
silos in 1970/71 would amount to about uS$49o,OO0 per year.
Reduction of Grain Losses
64.       The estimated annual reduction in vheat losses, based on the pro-
jected imports in 1970/71, would be $15.4 million (Annex 13). This esti-
mate represents the reduction in the actual physical weight loss as well as
the loss in food value due mainly from insect infestation.
Summary of Benefits
65.       The above estimated annual benefits, assuming construction of the
full 5-silo Project, are summarized as follows:
Savings in port unloading and handling      US$ 1.6 million
Savings in inland freight and handling           o.6
Savings resulting from bulk movement
to flour mills                                  0.3    "
Savings in central storage and handling
costs                                          0° 
Reduction in grain losses                       15.4   "
US$18.4 million
66.       In the event the Chalna silo is not constructed in due course,
about 1/4 of these benefits would not be realized.
X. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
67.       Improvement of the storage and handling of foodgrain has become
an urgent problem for the Province of East Pakistan. This Project would
help resolve present difficulties and produce substantial long-range bene-
fits to the food economy of the Province.
68.       The silos located so as to serve the whole Province would require
most of the proposed credit., The other features of the Project would not
require large expenditures, but the ultimate success of the whole Project
will depend to a large extend upon them. The importance of these features
was stressed during negotiations and the major actions agreed upon by the
Province of East Pakistan were as follows:



(a)   that the Food Department of the Province of East Pakistan,
which would be responsible for the execution of the Project,
would be suitably reorganized and strengthened;
(b)   that steps would be taken to train personnel abroad and in
East Pakistan in silo operation and maintenance, grain in-
ventory control techniques, pest-infestation control, sani-
tation measures and all other essential techniques for con-
ditioning, handling and storing foodgrain;
(c)   that a modern inventory control system would be established,
including the collection and analysis on a timely and re-
gular basis of essential data on farm and retail prices,
farmer, private dealer and miller stocks, as well as on
consumption and supply trends; and
(d)   that an adequate program of sanitation and pest-infestation
control, including the provision of transport facilities,
equipment and chemicals, would be established and implement-
ed without delay.
69.       The Association would follow up closely the execution of the Pro-
ject, particularly with respect to the actions listed above and would assist
the Province in carrying them out successfully. The Association would make
a full scale review of the progress on the Project prior to the letting of
contracts for construction but not later than June 30, 1967. If the posi-
tion is not found to be satisfactory, the Association would have the option
to cancel the credit.
70.       The Project is suitable for an IDA credit on usual terms in an
amount of $19.2 million equivalent.

ANNEX 7
Page 1
EXPANDED INFESTATION CONTROL PROGRAM
1.        The Project would provide for strengthening the pest control work
of the Directorate of Inspection and Control of the Food Department. This
Directorate has been unable to function satisfactorily *with the resources
at hand. WJith grains stored in over 300 widely dispersed storage depots
under adverse climatic conditions, the shortage of staff, equipment, material
and funds has prevented adequate control. Since infestation is prevalent
at all points of storage and in transit from ports to LSD's, storage in the
proposed silos prior to delivery to LSD's for distribution would not complete-
ly resolve this problem.
2.        The expanded pest control program under the Project for a 5-year
period would involve a total additional cost over the present program of
Rs. 7,245,000, comprising non-recurring costs amounting to Rs. 1,202,500
and annual recurring expenditures of Rs. 1,208,500.   The annual expenditures
cover additional pay of officers and staff amounting to Rs. 476,000, addi-
tional chemicals costing Rs. 58O,00O and transport and other operating costs
of Rs. 152,500.
3.        The present organization employs 12 roving squads, each operating
in one of 12 zones in the Province. The expanded organization would consist
of 36 squads comprising 36 pest control officers, 10 assistant pest control
officers and 92 operators.  Also, under the expanded program, the number
of supervisory staff would be increased.
4.        An entomologist would be posted at each of the four regional offices
of the Food Department for the purpose of giving effective management of
pest control at all storage points in each region. These entomologists
would be given special training abroad. They would have a small staff for
laboratory work and for maintaining and distributing pest control equipment
and chemicals.
5.        Sanitary maintenance of foodgrain stocks would be achieved by pro-
viding training of godown staff on hygiene measures for control of infesta-
tion. The regional and district Controllers of Food would be advised on
how to detect defaults in godown sanitation and to bring about suitable
action as a part of their regular inspection.
6.        Adequate transport for pest control squads would be provided.
Ability to quickly transport men and materials is the key to the success of
the squad control organization. By having their own vehicles especially
fitted with sprayers and pumps, the squads will be able to do a better job
more quickly and maintain the equipment in operating condition.
7.        To help attain the objectives of the expanded program, a foreign
specialist in pest control of stored foodgrains would be employed for two
years.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
8.        A major foreign exchange cost of pest control would be for in-
secticide chemicals. At present about Rs. 370,000 is being provided annually
for chemicals.  IDA credit would be used to purchase the additional amount
(Rs. 580,000 per year) required for the expanded program for a 3-year est-
ablishment period. The annual requirements of major chemicals would be
about 60 tons of Methyl Bromide, 16 tons of Malathion wettable powder (25%),
140 tons of Malathion 1% dust and 40 tons of Ethelene dichloride Tetrach-
loride Mixture.
9.        The equipment and apparatus requirements for the expanded program
would be as follows:
Number          Cost
Item                             required         (Rs)
Equipment for Methyl Bromide              225           414,900
Power Mist Dusters                         50            47,000
Air compression sprayers                   50             5,000
Foot pumps for cynegas                     50             4,250
Gas masks                                 100            10,500
Gas mask canisters                        156             2,250
Boiler suits                              300            15,000
Microscopes                                 4             1,600
Gas proof sheets                          135           135s000
Total                                              635,500
30.       In addition to chemicals and insecticide equipment, the expanded
pest control program would require foreign exchange investment in transport,
communication facilities, laboratory equipment, foreign training and tech-
nical assistance. All foreign exchange costs for the 3-year program prop-
osed as a part of the Project and financed by IDA would be:
