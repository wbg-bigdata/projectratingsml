INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit of an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$19.7
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard IDA terms, to
help finance a Foodgrain Storage Project. This Credit would replace a
US$19.2 million development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of
February 1966 for the same project (Credit No. 83-PAK) on the basis sEt
out in paragraph 2 of my Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors
dated September 15, 1972, on the Chandpur II Irrigation Project (IDA/R72-77).
The proposed project would be jointly financed with the Kingdom of Sweden,
which would provide a 25 million Kronor (equivalent to US$5.53 million) credit
to Bangladesh, replacing a previous credit of the same Kronor amount to
Pakistan (which at that time was equivalent to US$4.8 million).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(R72-230) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972.
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of the territory comprising the former East Wing of Pakistan. Even in the
best of circumstances Bangladesh constitutes a complex development problem.
The population is poor (per capita income of US$50 to US$70 per annum,
a figure which has not risen over the past 20 years), overcrowded (population
density is nearly 1,400 per square mile) and becoming more so (population is
growing at 3 percent per annum), short-lived (life expectance at birth is
well under 50 years), in many cases unemployed (perhaps 25-30 percent),
and largely illiterate (under 20 percent literacy rate).
4.        The physical problems of Bangladesh -- its precarious environment,
lack of natural resources, and alluvial terrain with resultant high cost of
infrastructure -- have been compounded by poorly chosen and implemented
investment programs in the past. Perhaps the most striking failure lies in
the increasing gap between foodgrain production and requirements. Bangladesh,
a predominantly agricultural country, must import about 15 percent of its
food requirements even in years of "normal" production such as 1969/70
when 1.5 million tons of foodgrains were imported. Bangladesh today is one
of the most extreme examples of rural poverty in the world.
5.        The one year in which the Government of Bangladesh has been in
control of the country has been dominated by the need to tackle the urgent
rehabilitation tasks arising out of the cyclone of November 1970 and the
political struggles and war of 1971. First, law and order had to be re-
established, political stability achieved and the administrative framework



reconstituted. Second, refugees had to be resettled, relief provided and
the transport system reconstructed to permit the distribution of food. Third,
the economy had to be restored to pre-war levels of output and employment.
6.        Two of the principal achievements of the Government since indepen-
dence have been the progress towards restoration of law and order to the
countryside and the formulation of a new constituttion. The constitution
which came into effect on December 16, 1972, provides for the establishment
of a parlianentary democracv in which the President is; the constitutional
Head of State and executive authority is exercised by the Cabinet under
the Prime Minister. The Cabinet collectively is responsible to Parliament,
which consists of 300 members elected by the people froni singli territorial
constituencies by direct election. The first parl-iamentary elections
were held in Mareh 1973.
7.        Most o-f the refugees have been resettled, relief has been
provided and the widely feared famine has not materialized, thanks in
part to massive assistance initially from India and subsequently from a
number of other countries, mosl:ly under the auspices of UNROD (United
Nations Relief Operation in Dacca).   The port of Chittagong was restored
to 90 percent of its prewar capacity by the end of last Jtune. The roads
were quickly repaired and ferries brought in to substitute for damaged
bridges.  The vital Bhairab bridge which links Chittagong to Dacca by rail
will not however be usable til; October 1973. The reconstruction process is
now well in hand and aid cormmitments have been received for me2ting the
most urgent needs.
8.        The gravest problem confronting the Goverement since independence
has been the food situation.   The 1970/71 crops were poor and the aman crop
of December 1971 was disrupted by the war. Record levels of food imports of
about 2.5 million tons in 1972 have prevented famine from occurring.    Never-
theless, per ca--ta foodgrain availabilities in 1972 were well below 1969/70
levels and this, combDined with the internal transport difficulties, widespread
hoarding, and smuggling of foodgrains to India, led to a 50 percent rise in
prices over the year.   By October 1972 it was apparent: that thie mo.nsoon .i as
exceptionally poor and that a critical situation was likely to develop once
again. According to preliminary assessments the main rice crop was 20
percent lower than the original estimates. Even assuming that the winter
rice crop is satisfactory, there will still be a total. foodgrain import
requirement of at least 2.5 million tons in 1973.
9.        Non-agricultural sectors have also been slow to recover.    Indus-
trial activity came to a virtual standstill from November 1971 to January
1972. Since then, production in general seems to have returned to about
70 percent of pre-war levels, though there is considerable variation among
industries. 'Many industries have experienced serious shortages of raw
materials (such as cotton, yarn, chemicals and cement), spare parts and
capital goods.   In large part this is due to the disruption of trade both
during the war and subsequently with new Government licensing and importing
institutions not operating effectively. In addition industrial production
has been affected by a variety of problems ranging from lack of demand



- 3 -
(especially for those industries formerly exporting to West Pakistan) to
labor problems. Low output, combined with the Government's inability to
get a substantial amount of imported consumer goods flowing into the
country, has been a major factor contributing to the rapid price increases.
10.       Exports increased fairly rapidly after the resumption of trade in
February 1972. The recovery was made possible by the existence of large
inventories of jute and jute products at a time when the prices fetched on
world markets still reflected the severe shortages of 1971. One of the
first acts of the Government was to devalue the taka by 53 percent at
official rates, to establish it at par with the Indian rupee. The bonus
voucher system for exports was removed and this, combined with the devaluation,
had the important effect of offering a higher effective exchange rate for
raw jute and a somewhat lower rate for locally manufactured jute goods.
As 1972 wore on, there were reminders of the difficult world market position
of jute, with clear evidence of European raw jute importers switching to
synthetics and of declining demand. As a result, jute exports are projected
at US$325 million in 1972/73 as against US$350 million in 1969/70. Total
exports of the country over the year are projected at about US$375 million,
which compares with about US$500 million exported to West Pakistan and third
countries in the pre-war period. Most of this decline is on account of
items such as tea, matches, fish and paper products which were formerly
exported to West Pakistan.
11.       In July 1972 the first budget and Annual Plan were presented.
The Plan proposed some US$430 million of public development expenditure
and a further US$160 million for reconstruction. About half of the develop-
ment expenditure was for agriculture, rural institutions, and water and
flood control. The Plan is a pragmatic document which aims at restoring
economic activity to the pre-war level. Even so, the projected amounts of
development expenditure represent a sizeable increase from the past and
there is likely to be a considerable shortfall. The level of imports
(and the consequent foreign aid disbursements) which is assumed in the Plan,
may not be achieved in 1972/73, leading to shortfalls in revenues from
customs duties and counterpart funds. The budgetary situation is very
closely tied to indirect taxation and this in turn is dependent on foreign
trade levels. Pressing budgetary needs have had to be met through an
expansion in the money supply of 82 percent between January and December
1972. This has combined with commodity shortages to cause the serious price
problems, which because of their political implications loom largest in
short-term economic concerns of the Government at present.
12.       The elections of March 1973 and the publication of the Five-year
Plan expected for June signal the end of the "reconstruction" phase and the
attempt by the Government to come to grips with the long-term development
problems. The authorities will be faced with a host of fundamental decisions
concerning policies and programs. The Plan will provide the basis for
analysing the quantitative dimensions of the development problem. The
following is an attempt to delineate the issues in general terms, drawn mainly
from the Economic Report on Bangladesh.



- 4 -
13.       Perhaps the highest priority attaches to gearing up the economic
administration to prepare and implement development projects in a manner
quite different from the past. While the Planning Commission is now technically
well prepared to devise economic plans, the need for effective coordination
and improved project preparation and implementation has not yet been met.
The operating ministries and autonomous institutions, which were already weak,
were in many cases weakened still further as a result: of changes in key per-
sonnel during 1971 and the unsettled period in early 1972. It will be
necessary to face these problems squarely, identify the gaps in personnel and
prepare for the combination of training and technical assistance which will
be necessary to close these gaps.
14.       The urgent need to engineer a rapid and visible improvement in
rural living standards points to a rapid expansion of programs related to
rural development. These programs are central to future development, and
development activities in all sectors should be designed to reflect the
crucial importance of rural development. The programs evolved at the Comilla
Academy for Rural Development are especially promising and deserving of
support.
15.       In view of the great technical difficulties arising in the construc--
tiun of large-scale water control projects, Bangladesh's urgent need to
increase food production requires emphasis to be placed initially on less
ambitious projects with greater immediate impact in increasing yields.
Emphasis should be placed upon improved distribution of inputs; appropriate
pricing policies for both inputs and agricultural products; much more research
than hitherto on developing new varieties, improved methods of cultivation,
input requirements and alternative cropping possibilities; attention to
such currently neglected areas as livestock production and fisheries;
encouragement to private investment in agriculture, and extension of credit
facilities to smallholders.
16.       Products such as leather goods, fish and paper products are
minor export items at present, but represent possible growth opportunities
for the economy. A proper system of incentives for these and new export
items needs to be considered. Marketing and promotion activities need to
be undertaken both to redirect the products formerly exported to West
Pakistan and to increase and diversify exports.
17.       There is no easy way to increase public savings in the short-run.
A program of taxation needs to be drawn up which will be elastic to growth
in income. An essential element in any such program will be the efficient
operation and economic pricing of public utilities and enterprises. There
should be flexibility and experimentation to provide financial incentives
to management and labor, and improved financial reporting to enable
authorities to make necessary changes.
18.       Programs with a high employment content should be emphasized.
The rural works program has the potential for creating productive
infrastructure in the rural areas, through tapping the seasonally unemployed;
smallscale industries can have an impact on both output and employment if



promotion, financing and incentives are adequate; and the high labor content
of jute production increases the importance of efforts to keep jute price
competitive.
19.       The education system, based on traditional models, has overemphasized
theoretical formal education and has been excessively concentrated in urban
areas. Education must be reoriented towards a better-educated rural
population and skilled manpower in the modern sector. Proposals for mass
education have been put forward which, while far from being fully worked
out, represent a step in the right direction. The deterioration of quality
in higher education and the divorce of the universities from the real
development situation are problems requiring urgent attenti-*...
20.       The population will double by the year 2000 if present growth rates
are maintained. The population control program needs a completely new
approach with proper political backing and a sense of real urgency. It
must be not merely the particular program of one department, but a concern
permeating the entire administration.
21.       Bangladesh will require large and continuing external assistance
to achieve an acceptable growth rate. Long-term projections suggest that,
even to maintain the existing per capita income level in the face of
continued population growth, net aid disbursements of between US$100 million
and US$200 million per annum would be required. Aid disbursement levels of
about half the former Pakistan level (i.e., US$300 million -or Bangladesh)
would permit imports of only about US$700 million, which, given the higher
foodgrain component, would allow for no more investment goods and raw materials
than were imported in 1969/70. Average aid disbursements of US$500 million
per year over the five year plan period would be required to permit imports
to be maintained at a level of US$900 million and the rate of investment at
the 12-15 percent of GDP figure which is needed for a 5 percent per annum
growth of GDP. There is little prospect for substantial domestic financing
of investment in the short-term given the depressed levels of income. In
time, of course, the substitution of domestically grown foodgrains for
imports would release foreign exchange for expanded capital and raw materials
imports.
22.       Aid disbursements this year and next are likely to be around
US$400 to US$500 million. About one-third of this will be food aid.
The limits of aid disbursements in these years are being set by the capacity
to import efficiently rather than by inadequate commitment levels. Commit-
rmients, which were about US$1.3 billion as of the end of 1972, have been
extremely high, reflecting the sympathetic response from donors to the needs
of the critical food situation and reconstruction program. While levels of
aid commitments during the next few years will certainly be lower, it is
essential for disbursements to be maintained well above pre-war levels if
Bangladesh is to make any significant progress in raising living standards.
23.       With an adequate aid flow and better economic management, Bangladesh
should certainly improve on past growth rates. A sustained growth rate
of close to 5 percent should be possible, although it would need good



- 6 -
fortune as well as exceptionally good management to get above that level
given the unfavorable ratio of population to resources. The keys to growth
will probably be increased agriculture production oni the one hand, and good
export performance on the other. A sustained rate of growth of 5 percent
would mean that by the end of the century the majority of the population
could be adequately, if simply, fed, housed, clothed and educated. Given
the difficult circunstances of Bangladesh, even this wrould be a major
achievement.
PART II - BA`NK GROUP OPERATIONS INT BAXGLADESH
24.       Prior to the indepencience of Bangladeshi, -he Bank a-id the
Association had made one loan and nineteen development, credits, -_otalling
US$4.7 million and US$168.1 million respectively (net of cancellations),
for projects located wholly within what was then East Pakistan. Of these,
the loan and seven of the credits had been fully disbursed, and US$95.6
million remained undisbursed under twelve de'velopment credits.  In addition,
under ten loans and eight development credits for projects involving expendi-
tures in both East and West Pakistan, a total amount of US$257 million was
outstanding in December 1971; part of this anount has been used to finance
goods located in Bangladesh, or services rendered there. The right of Pakistan
to make further withdrawals in respect of expenditures for projects located
in the East was suspended on December 29, 1971 (Sec M71-60), and the undisbursed
amounts for projects in the East were carncelled on September 29, 1972.
25.       In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the LZIternational
Monetary Fund, the Bank and the Association. it was decided that proposals
would be submitted to the Executive Directors for reactivation of all the
uncompleted projects wholly located in Bangladesh- which had previously
been financed w t.'- credits to Pakistan.  Accordinlgy, e1g>c such Credits in
an aggregate amount of US$85.7 million have since then been made to 3angla-
desh. Following the proposed reactivation of the Foodgraini Storage Project,
only two more remain, for education and highways, in an amount of US$46.0
million. These should be ready for submission to the Executive Directors
before the end of this fiscal year. The aggregate amount of these reactivation
credits of US$151.4 includes about US$44.1 million for the notional repayment
of amounts disbursed under the corresponding previous credit ag-eements with
Pakistan, thus debiting Bangladeshi with this amount.
26.       In addition to the reactivation of pre-independence projects
described in the preceding paragraph, the Association has made one new
credit for US$50 million to Bangladesh to help finance the foreign exchange
costs of imports required for the Government's reconstruction program.
Several other new projects are under preparation, particularly in the field
of agriculture.  Proposals for credits of about US$7 million for a cereal
seeds project, about US$3 million for inland water transport rehabilitation,
and about US$4 million for technical assistance may be ready for submission
to the Executive Directors before the end of this fiscal year.

27.       Annex II contains a summary statement of (i) IDA credits made
to Bangladesh since 1972, and (ii) the loan and credits to Pakistan for
projects located wholly in Bangladesh, which have not been reactivated.
Annex II also contains notes on the status of execution of ongoing projects.
There are no IFC investments in Bangladesh.
28.       The Bank Group intends to assist the Government towards its
development objectives in various ways. In the early years, a large measure
of program lending will be needed, to finance the import of production and
construction materials and components. In the longer run, the emphasis
of Bank Group financing would again be on project assistance. In order to
build up a sizeable project pipeline, a major input of technical assistance
will be of high priority in the near future.
PART III - TIIE PROJECT
Project History
29.       In February 1966, IDA and the Kingdom of Sweden agreed to finance
the estimated foreign exchange cost of a project consisting of (a) the
construction of four foodgrain storage silos and supporting facilities;
(b) training of personnel to operate the silos; (c) a rehabilitation program
for the country wide system of foodgrain storage godowns (flat storage
units) and the establishment of an infestation control program for the go-
downs; and (d) a feasibility study for a second foodgrain storage project.
The major portion of the project has been completed. Of the US$24 million
external financing originally allocated to the project (80 percent from IDA,
20 percent from Sweden), slightly over US$23 million was disbursed prior to
December 29, 1971, when disbursements under these credits were suspended.
30.       Construction of the silos was completed in 1971, but the installa-
tion work required to make the electrical and mechanical equipment fully
operational could not be completed by the contractors due to the civil
disturbances. In addition, rocket fire damaged one of the silos during
the hostilities of 1971. The Bangladesh Government, faced with the threat
of famine and the need for handling massive foodgrain imports, assigned
personnel and resources of the Ministry of Food to repair the silos and to
put the facilities expeditiously into full operation. By the time of the
August 1972 appraisal mission, Ministry personnel had succeeded in putting
all the silos into full operation and the benefits anticipated from the silos
were already being realized at levels at least as high as originally estimated.
The training of silo operational personnel has also been successfully com-
pleted, and the silos are being satisfactorily operated and maintained.
31.       The feasibility study for a second foodgrain storage project was
completed in 1970 and negotiations for a proposed second-stage project took
place in February 1971. Due to the disturbances of March 1971, no further
action was taken.



- 8 -
32.       The two remaining parts of the original project -- the godown
rehabilitation and infestation control programs -- have only been partially
implemented. The rehabilitation program, 90 percent of which was to have
been financed by the Government, suffered from higher than anticipated costs,
insufficient local funding, and deficiencies in planning and contractor
selection and supervision. Measures to remedy these deficiencies were being
worked out with the Government prior to the outbreak of civil disturbances
in 1971. However, in view of the changes in trade patterns resulting from
independence and the lessons learned in facing the current food crisis,
further study is now required prior to resumption of investment in godown
rehabilitation. The proposed reactivated project includes provision for such
a study as part of the revision of the feasibility study referred to in para-
graph 31 (see also paragraph 36). The godown infestation control program
was slow in starting and further delayed by the disturbances in 1971, but
the program is being revived and continued with UNROD assistance, including
the financing of the cost of employing an infestation control axpert for six
months.
The Need for Foodgrain Storge Facilities
33.       With a population density of about 3.4 per acre of arable land,
Bangladesh has a fundamental problem feeding its people. Over the past
decade production of rice, the country's basic foodstuff, increased at only
2 percent per annum, while the number of people to be fed grew at 2.7 to
3 percent per year. To compensate, at least in part, foodgrain imports
increased by about 10 percent per annum. The unsettled conditions of 1971
caused a sharp decline in foodgrain production in 1971/72 and the poor rains
of 1972 have resulted once again in sub-normal grain output and foodgrain
iiiiport requirements of about 2.5 million tons.
34.       Looking beyond the current food crisis, the Bangladesii Government
is expected to initiate ambitious programs to increase rice and wheat pro-
duction through improved irrigation, high yielding varieties, application
of fertilizers and improved agriculture extension during the First Five-
Year Plan. However, even if these programs are successful, Bangladesh is
likely to continue to require sizeable food imports for many more years to
meet the food requirements of its growing population. The high level of
wheat imports, averaging about 900,000 tons over the past five years, has
developed a permanent demand for wheat, particularly in urban areas. This
demand cannot be met from local production. Thus, there will be a permanent
need for facilities to cope with large scale grain imports, even when
Bangladesh reaches overall self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Furthermore,
there will be the need to maintain a reserve stock to guard against crop
failures from drought, flood or cyclone disasters, common in Bangladesh.
At present consumption levels, 600,000 tons of grain is considered the
minimum safe contingency stock. Based on 6% of forecast grain requirements
this figure will rise to approximately I million tons of foodgrain by 1980.
The modern silo facilities built under the Project will provide quality



- 9 -
storage for a fourth of this stock requirement. Thus, the Project is viewed
by the Government as a first step in setting up an efficient and responsive
foodgrain storage and distribution system.
Requirements for Completing the Project
35.       A number of minor construction tasks associated with the silos
still need to be completed. One of these tasks is the modification of
the jetty serving the Chittagong silo. This jetty was acquired by the Minis-
try of Food from a steel company in 1970; and, although temporary measures
enable small ocean going ships to berth and unload under restricted tidal
and weather conditions, the jetty requires modifications to meet acceptable
port safety standards. The reactivated credit would provide about $250,000
for these modifications. In addition, some silo equipment and spare parts
destroyed during the war will have to be replaced. The reactivated credit
would provide about US$100,000 for meeting the foreign exchange costs of
such equipment and spare parts. Most remaining civil works (access roads,
boundary roads, and imnprovements in site drainage) are being carried out by
local contractors with government funds under the supervision of a satisfactory
local engineering consultant. In addition, Bangladesh Railways are providing
two rail spurs which are expected to be completed within the next few months.
36.       As for the feasibility study for a second stage project, completed
in 1970, some of its underlying assumptions have been significantly altered.
While it had been previously expected that all grain imports would come by
sea, Bangladesh now has new opportunities for overland shipments of foodgrains
from India. In addition, the lessons learned in dealing with the current
food emergency have to be taken into account in planning a proposed second
grain storage project. As a result, a new feasibility study is required.
The reactivated credit would provide approximately US$125,000 to finance
suich a new feasibility study by consultants acceptable to the Association.
Due to the changed conditions described above, no additional IDA funding
for godowri rehabilitation is considered appropriate until ttcese further
studies have been completed.   Therefore, this item has been omitted from the
reactivated project. Consideration will be given to financing further
godown rehabilitation as a part of a second foodgrain storage project. About
US$20,000 is included in the proposed credit for extending the services of
the godown infestation control expert for an additional six months beyond
that provided by UNROD financing (see paragraph 32) to continue the training
of infestation control squads.
37.       The amount of the proposed IDA credit has been increased from
US$19.2 million for the original project to US$19.7 million to take account of
cost increases and recent currency changes. About 95 percent of the funds
in the proposed new credits from IDA and Sweden would be allocated to
financing notional repayment of the amounts disbursed under the previous
credits to Pakistan, thus debiting Bangladesh with these amounts. About
US$1.25 million equivalent of additional funds would remain-from the IDA
credit, plus US$0.25 million equivalent from the Swedish credit (taking into
account the increased value of the Swedish Kronor). Of these amounts, about
US$800,000 would be used to finance the foreign exchange portion of final



- 10 -
payments to contractors and consultants for goods and services already pro-
vided in constructing the silos. About $350,000 would be used to cover
estimated foreign exchange expenditures for the construction, equipment and
spare parts required to complete the project (para 35). About US$145,000
would be provided for the new feasibility study for a second foodgrain
storage project, and consultants' services for the godown infestation
control program, with the remaining US$205,000 provided for contingencies.
In addition the Government would provide about US$800,000 equivalent to cover
the costs of goods and services required to complete the Project. A Project
Summary is attached hereto as Annex III, and a Technical Note describing
the history and assessing the present status of the project is attached as
Annex IV.
Benefits of the Proje ct
38.       The project facilities played a major role in helping Bangladesh
avert famine in the aftermath of the events of 1971, for the international
endeavor to avoid widespread starvation in Bangladesh could not have been
carried out as effectively if the project facilities had not already been
in place. It is also evident that the silo facilities are achieving their
original objectives of savings in port unloading and transfer costs, inland
transport and handling costs and reduced grain storage losses and are
yielding on economic rate of return estimated to be about 16 percent.
Procurerent
39.       The procurement provisions of the original credit, requiring
international competitive bidding for contracts for goods and equipment
exceeding US$50,000 or for civ-il works contracts exceeding US$100,000,
would be retained under the proposed new credit. For contracts below these

PAKr IV - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND_ AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the draft Joint ?ianancing Agree-
ment among the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Kingdom of Sweden and
the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V Section
1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The provisions of the draft Development Credit Agreement and
Joint Financing Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the
previous Development Credit Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
and Administration Agreement among the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the
Kingdom of Sweden and the Association, and incorporate the relevant provisions
of the Project Agreement with the then Province of East Pakistan. There will
not be a separate Project Agreement.



41.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C.   Projects in Execution-
Cr. No. 339     Cyclone Area Reconstruction Project; $2$5.0 Million
Credit of October 18, 1972; Closing Date June 30, 1976
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. Implementation
of the original project, financed under Credit No. 228-PAK of 1971, did
not commence prior to the suspension of disbursements. The Government has
now set up the central organization for the project, and task forces for
the execution of the sub-projects are being assembled. Sites for cyclone
shelters are being selected, tenders for construction have been invited,
and the Project Coordinator is hopeful of completing sixty shelters before
the onset of the monsoon season. On the primary roads sub-project, surveyors
are in the field determining alignments and making detailed assessments
of work quantities. On the Cyclone Warning sub-project, the sub-project
manager is finalizing specifications of equipment which must be imported
to strengthen the meteorological stations serving the coastal area. Other
sub-projects (inland water transport, telecommunications, feeder roads, and
coastal fisheries) are less advanced. A supervision mission ii March
1973 has reviewed with Government the actions required to expedite imple-
mentation of these sub-projects.
Cr. No. 340    Chandpur Irrigation II Project; $13.0 Million Credit of
October 18X_972; Clog Date December 31, 1977
This Credit became effective on January 17, 1973. When work on
the project, previously financed under Credit No. 184-PAK of 1970, was
suspended in 1971, the major project civil works were about half completed.
The contractor manufacturing equipment for the regulators hGi also made
substantial progress.   Interim financIng by Sweden has allov-~d reappointment
of project consultants, resumption of construction and renegotiation of the
contract for manufacture and installation of the equipment for the regulators.
Cr. No. 341    Tubewells Project; $14.0 Million Credit of November 6, 1972;
Closing Date December 31. 1976                     __      _
The prolect is also being assisted by a $6 m'llion credit from
Sweden and a $6 million grant from Canada. The IDA and Swedish credits
became effective on January 17, 1973. The project was originally "inanced
by IDA Credit No. 208-PAK of 1970 and credits from Sweden and Canada.    Bids
for the drilling of project wells had been received in 1971 but no
contracts were awarded due to the disturbed conditions. Interim financing
from Sweden has permitted reappointment of project consultants and
retendering. Bids have been received for well drilling and suoply of
pumps and engines for the wells, and contracts are expected to be awarded
in the next few weeks. Contracts have been awarded for required vehicles
and miscellaneous equipment.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

facilities for the silos and for replacement of spare parts
and equipment destroyed during the war remain to be procured.
The procurement provisions of Credit 83-PAK stipulated
that contracts for procurement of goods and equipment
for US$50,000 equivalent or more and civil works contracts
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. These
provisions would be maintained for the proposed credit,
except for replacement of some spare parts and machinery
damaged during the war, which must be procured from the
original manufacturers. For goods and services contracts
below US$50,000, (other than for spare parts and machinery
which must be procured from the original manufacturers)
and for civil works contracts below US$100,000, procedures
ensuring adequate local competition would be employed.
CONSULTANTS:        Consultants satisfactory to the association would
be employed to revise the feasibility study.
RATE OF RETURN:     The economic rate of return is about 16%.
APPRAISAL REPORT:   A technical note was prepared in December 1972 and
updated in April 1973.

TECHNICAL NOTE
ON
FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This technical note is based on the findings of a mission which
visited Bangladesh from August 8 to August 15,1972 to supervise the
Foodgrain Storage Project 1/. The Project was originally appraised in early
1965. In February 1966, two Credit Agreements were signed in which IDA
and the Swedish Government respectively agreed to provide a total of
US$24 million (IDA US$19.2 million Credit 83-PAK; Swedish Government US$4.8
million) to the Government of Pakistan to finance the foreign exchange cost
of a project to improve the storage and handling of foodgrains in what is
now Bangladesh. The disturbances which broke out in March 1971 prevented
completion of the project. In December 1971, the Association after con-
sultation with the Government of Pakistan suspended disbursements for the
Project, at which time about US$750,000 remained undisbursed from the IDA
credit and about US$190,000 from the Swedish credit. The Government of
Bangladesh has now requested the Association and Sweden to provide financing
for completion of the Project. Due to cost increases and recent currency
changes about US$1.5 million is now required to pay outstanding bills and
to complete the project. The amount of the proposed IDA credit has been
increased to US$19.7 million.
II. BACKGROUND
2.        Bangladesh, with a population of about 75 million inhabiting a
flood plain of about 55,000 sq mi, has one of the highest population den-
sities in the world. The population which is increasing at the rate of
about 3% per annum is primarily (about 80%) employed in agriculture, mainly
in the cultivation of rice and jute. Rice is the basic foodstuff consumed;
however, the consumption of wheat has increased, as large quantities of
wheat have been imported to alleviate the overall food shortage.
3.        During the sixties, annual rice production in Bangladesh grew
from an average of about 9.7 million tons in the 1960-65 period to an
average of about 10.7 million tons in the period 1966-70, a mere 2.0% annual
expansion rate. Average wheat production, although insignificant, rose from
37,000 tons to 69,000 tons in the same period, showing a 13% annual increase.
Average annual foodgrain imports, on the other hand, grew from about 800,000
tons to about 1.1 million tons during this period, about a 10% annual in-
crease. Despite this increase in food imports and production, the average
daily per capita foodgrain availability remained between 15 to 16 oz. At
1/   IDA mission composed of Messrs. R. Frank (IDA) and F. Adams (Consultant).



this level, caloric intake (closely dependent on availability of cereals)
is inadequate 1/.
4.        The unsettled conditions over the past year have resulted in
worsening of the foodgrain situation in Bangladesh. The 1971/72 rice
production is estimated at 9.8 million tons, 12% below the previous year
and almost 20% below the 1969/70 production. To assure 14-15 oz per
capita grain consumption and a reasonable stocks buildup, foodgrain imports
on the order of 2.85 million tons may be required during 1972/73 2/. The
bulk of the foodgrains imports are being arranged under various bilateral
and multilateral aid schemes, coordinated by the United Natio-as Relief
Operation in Dacca (UNROD).  Project facilities are playing a cey role in
this massive grain imports program. These facilities allow rapid dis-
charge of bulk import shipments at the ocean port of Chittagong and the
river ports of Nrayanganj and Ashuganj and they also facilitate safe storage
of needed stocks within reach of critical deficit areas in Bangladesh.
It is no exaggeration to say that the international endeavor to avoid
widespread starvation in Bangladesh--in the aftermath of disturbances and
the war-could not have been as successfully carried out without the Project.
5.        Looking beyond the current food crisis, the Bangladesh Government
is expected to initiate ambitious programs to increase rice and wheat pro-
duction through improved irrigation, high yielding varieties, application
of fertilizers and improved agriculture extension during the First Five-
Year Plan.  However, even if these programs are successful, Bangladesh
is likely to continue to require sizeable food imports for riany more years
to meet the food requiremenits of its growing population. The nigh level
of wheat imports averaging about 900,000 tons over the past five years
has developed a permanent demand for wheat particularly in urban areas.
This demand cannot be met from local production.   Thus, there will be
a permanent need for facilities to cope with large scale grain imports, even
when Bangladesh reaches overall self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Furthermore,
there will be the need to maintain a reserve stock to guard against crop
failures from drought, flood or cyclone disasters--conmon in Bangladesh.
At present consumption levels, 600,000 tons of grain is considered the
minimum safe contingency stock.   Based on 6% of forecast grain requiremerts
this figure will rise to approximately 1 million t:ons of foodgrain by 1980.
The modern silo facilities built under the Project will prov`Lde quality
storage for a fourth of this stock requirement, Thus, the F-rcect is viewed

of Health in collaboration with the University of Dacca, and the Office

holds .. hlave inadequate calorie intake."

by the Government as only a first step in setting up an efficient and
responsive foodgrain storage and distribution system.
III. THE PROJECT
A. History and Status
6.        The Foodgrain Storage Project financed under Credit 83-PAK and
the Swedish Credit (described in Appraisal Report No. TO-480a dated
January 25, 1966) consists of the following:
(a) Construction of, and engineering services for, foodgrain
storage silos and supporting facilities at:
Capacity
(m tons)
(i)  Chittagong                           104,000
(ii)  Narayanganj                           51,000
(iii)  Ashugani                              51,000
(iv)  Santahar                              26,000
232,000
(b)  overseas and local training of silo operators and quality
control personnel, and an inventory control system;
(c) a godown (flat storage unit) rehabilitation program,
establishment of an infestation control program; and,
(d) a feasibility study for silos at Chalna and Khulna.
7.        Storage Silos.  The engineering firm of Weitz Hettelsater Engineers
(US) were engaged in 1966 as consultants for the Project. Following inter-
national competitive bidding in 1967, contractors were selected for construc-
tion of the silo facilities. The firm of Skanska (Swedish) was selected as
the civil works contractor and the joint venture association of Miag/Buhler
(German/Swiss) was selected to provide the electrical/mechanical installations.
Civil works construction began in 1969 and the certificate of completion was
issued in June 1971. Installation of electrical and mechanical equipment was
completed in 1970, but the adjustments required to make the equipment fully
operational could not be completed by the contractors due to the civil disturb-
ances. In addition, during the disturbances one of the silo facilities was
substantially damaged by rocket fire. In early 1972, the personnel of the
Itinistry of Food set about to both repair the damage and put the facilities
into full operation. By August 1972, the damaged silo had been fully re-
paired and all silos were operational. Silo repairs, commissioning and
subsequent smooth operation in difficult circumstances reflect great credit
on the Silo Directorate and testify to the success of the training program
(see para 8).



8.        Overseas and Local Training of Silo Operation and Quality Control
Personnel. Five silo superintendents spent two years abroad in academic
and practical training. Five maintenance engineers have received one year
training abroad and four quality control trainees spent one year at the
Tropical Products Institute in England. The Dacca Training Institute, created
by the Ministry of Food, has given introductory courses for the infestation
control inspectors and provides facilities for training silo operators and
foremen. These training efforts have been quite effective and the silos are
being satisfactorily operated and maintained and an improved inventory control
system has been established.
9.        Godomn Rehabilitation.   The program was designed to rehabilitate
800 godowns with a total capacity of about 400,000 tons. Abou-: 90% of the
cost of the rehabilitation works, representing the estimated local costs,
were to be financed by Government. The remainder of t:he required funds was
to he provided by the IDA/SIDA credits and to be used to finance a general
engineering survey of the godowns and the engineering supervision to rehabil-
itate three model godowns. However, from the outset the program faced many
difficulties including shortage of local funds, deficient contractor
selection procedures (godowns were individually tendered and awards made to
very small contractors), absence of a comprehensive implementation plan and
lack of qualified supervisory personnel. Only about 60 godowns have been
rehabilitated at substantially higher cost than was originally envisaged.
Consideration is now being given to transferring the task of rehabilitating
and maintaining the godowns from the Ministry of Food to the Public Works
Ministry which has the necessary capability. At the same tiine, it has be-
come increasingly clear that investment in godown rehabilitation calls for
careful study in the light of changed trade patterns in the wake of inde-
pendence (para 15).
10.       Godown Infestation Control Program.    While the infestation control
program has been partially implemented and some of the 36 infestation control
squads have been fully equipped, inadequate training, lack of fumigants and
a shortage of vehicles prevented full execution of the planned program.
After a long delay, an infestation control expert was contracted under the
project and began work with the Iinistry of Food in late 1970 to prepaze
and implement a comprehensive godown infestation control program including
the training of infestation control personnel. Hlis activities were inter-
rupted by the disturbances in 1971 (para 14d).
11.       Feasibility Study.   The Project provided for a feasibility study
to determine the additional storage and handling facilities required by
the Ministry of Food. The study was completed in 1970 and was followed by
Bank appraisal, which recommended a second Foodgrain Storage Project, includ-
ing the construction of silos at Chalna and Khulna. The outbreak of civil
disturbances disrupted further processing of the second project and the
changed circumstances as well as new Government policies call for another
feasibility study (para 15).

12.       Disbursements to Date.   When disbursements from Credit 83-PAK
were suspended on December 29, 1971 the total amount disbursed under both
the IDA and SIDA Credit was about US$23.1 million. An additional amount of
about US$800,000 of foreign exchange is owed to contractors and consultants
for work performed to date but not yet disbursed.
B. Project Reappraisal
13.       The proposed reactivated project would remain basically the same
as the original project (described in para 6) except for the completion of
the godowm rehabilitation program (para 9). The work remaining to be carried
out under the Project is described below.
Silos and Supporting Facilities
14.       a.   The Chittagong Jetty.   The jetty serving the. Chittagong silo
was officially transferred to the Ministry of Food in July 1970 from the
steel mill located adjacent to the silo in the port area. In its present
condition the jetty accommodates berthing of small ocean going grain car-
riers (up to 7,000-9,000 tons) only under restricted tidal and weather
conditions and with the help of buoys provided by the Chittagong Port
Authority. The Port Authority considers the use of buoys as only a tem-
porary expedient. Accordingly, the Ministry of Food in conjunction with the
Port Authority is preparing a plan to improve the jetty. Assurances have
been obtained from the Government that within six months of credit signature
they will have completed structural tests of the jetty and a program of
observations satisfactory to the Association and will have prepared a plan
and implementation schedule satisfactory to the Association for improving
the jetty so that the Port Authority considers it safe for use by ocean-
going grain carriers with loads of up to 7,000-9,000 tons. An assurance
from the Government that the Port Authority would permit ocean-going grain
carriers with loads of up to 7,000 to 9,000 tons to continue to berth at
the jetty with the help of buoys until the improvements have been completed
also has been obtained.
b.   Other Facilities.   In addition, civil works ancillary to the
silo facilities must be completed and silo access roads, boundary roads and
site drainage need improvement. The Ministry of Food has engaged a satis-
factory local engineering consultant to supervise local contractors who
are performing these works. Rail spurs are still required for two sites
and these are to be provided by the Bangladesh Railways within the next
few months. The Government has confirmed that the additional facilities
required for efficient operation of the Project will be completed and
adequately maintained over the life of the Project.
c.   Replacement of Spare Parts and Equipment.   While silo construction
has been satisfactorily completed, some equipment and spare parts were
destroyed during the war and will have to be replaced. In addition some
vehicles to speed offloading are required.



- 6 -
d.   Godown Infestation Control Program.   UIROD has made allocations to
finance the cost of the expert who had previously worked on the Project
(para 10) for six months as well as the necessary infestation control mat-
erials. The continuation of the infestation control efforts is very import-
ant to prevent substantial foodgrain losses within the godown storage facili-
ties. The proposed credit provides for an additional six months extension
of the infestation control expert, who would be employed under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The Government has confirmed that the
program of infestation control and the training of infestation control squads
would continue as necessary during the Project life.
Feasibility Studies
15.       Independence has changed the sources and the optimal transport
modes of much of the grain imports into Bangladesh by making possible over-
land imports from India. Also UNROD has introduced a fleet of inland water
vessels, some of which (shallow crafts) are proving to be very effective
and flexible for inland transport of grains. In view of these changes and
the need for intermediate bulk handling and grain drying facilities, a new
feasibility study is required to determine the need for new grain storage
and marketing facilities, improvements to existing facilities, an increased
use of the storage system for domestic grain procurement and a review of
procurement and pricing policies and their financial implications, to be
included in a second Foodgrain Storage Project. Consultants satisfactory
to IDA would be employed to carry out the study. The terms of reference for
the study as well as the terms and conditions of consultants' employment
would be subject to IDA approval.
IV.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
16.       Total project cost net of duties and taxes are estimated at US$32.2
million of which foreign exchange is US$24.5 million equivalent. The or-
iginal estimated project cost was US$39 million with US$24 million equivalent
foreign exchange component. The decrease in the project's local costs is
due to a combination of the effects of the devaluation of the taka and
decreased local expenditure for godown rehabilitation and ancillary works.
The small. increase in foreign exchange costs results from costs increases
and the recent currency changes. New cost estimates are summarized as
follows:

17.       Of the proposed US$19.7 million IDA credit, about US$18.45 million
would be used to repay IDA for amounts withdrawn under Credit 83-PAK
leaving about US$1.25 million for completion of the Project.    The 25 million
Swedish Kroner credit, equivalent in 1966 to US$4.8 million, is currently
equivalent to about US$5.53 million. The equivalent of about US$5.28
million would be used to repay amounts withdrawn under the 1966 Swedish
Credit, leaving the equivalent of about US$0.25 million for the completion
of the Project. The combined total of about US$1.5 million available from
the proposed IDA and Swedish Government credits for completion of the Project
would be used to meet the outstanding foreign exchange cost as follows:
US$
Payment to Silo Contractors and Consultants for work
performed prior to credit reactivation                             800,000

In addition the Government would provide about US$800,000 equivalent to cover
the costs of goods and works needed to complete the Project.
Timing and Phasing
19.       Work on supporting project facilities (apart from the Chittagong
Jetty), the feasibility study, and technical assistance for infestation
control would all be completed by the end of 1973. I't is expected that
modifications to the Chittagong jetty would be completed before June, 1974.
V. PROCUREMENT
20.       Only goods and services required for the completion of supporting
facilities and replacement of spare parts and equipment destroyed during
the war remain to be procured. The procurement provisions of Credit 83-PAK
stipulated that contracts for procurement of goods and equipment for US$50,000
equivalent or more and civil works contracts exceeding US$100,000 equivalent
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement. These provisions would be
maintained for the proposed credit, except for replacement of some spa,re parts
and machinery damaged during the war, which must be procured from the original
manufacturers. For goods and services contracts below US$50,000 (other than
for spare parts and machinery which must be procured from the original manu-
facturers) and for civil works contracts below US$100,000 procedures ensuring
adequate local competition would be employed.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
21.       As already described (see para 4) the Project has made a
dramatic contribution to the Bangladesh economy by enabling the Government,
assisted by UNROD, to mount a sufficiently large food imports and public
distribution program to ward off starvation. The project facilities form
a key part of the food import and distribution system established for this
purpose. The ocean port silo at Chittagong and the river port silo at
Narayanganj, operating three shifts a day, handle most of the grain imported
in bulk. Food Department and UNROD officials have repeatedly stressed



their reliance on project fiacilities for timoly import ;m(d dfqistrMution of
the necessary food supplies.
22.       Although the silos have only been in full operation for less
than six months, benefits from them are being realized at levels at least
as high as originally estimated. The major economic benefits that had
been originally estimated to accrue from the Project were: (a) reduction
of grain storage losses; (b) reduction in port unloading and handling
costs; and, (c) reduction in inland transport and handling costs.
23.       Project consultants had projected that grain storage losses
estimated at 30% in the godown system would be reduced to about 6% in the
storage silos. This compares to losses of less than 1% in efficiently
operated silos in Europe and the US. Operating efficiency in the completed
silos has been higher than expected and estimates to date, based on surveys
and checks conducted by the Silo Directorate, indicate that storage losses
are considerably less than 6% and are probably close to the figure of European
and American silos. A conservative estimate based on a reduction in storage
losses of 20 percent of grain stored in the new silos (20% of 232,000 tons)
results in an annual benefit of US$3.3 million.
24.       Likewise, the rapid discharge of ships and the special shallow
draft vessels has resulted in less costly handling and lower transport
cost. The small ocean-going ships lightering 7,000-9,000 tons from the
large grain ships at the outer anchorage are discharged by the Chittagong
silo facility in an average two days' time (three shifts per day). The
time required by the traditional hand bagging and head carrying methods to
unload the same amount is eight days (24 hour work day). Since the
lightering ships (old surplus "liberty" type ships) are chartered on a daily
basis at US$900, the silo facilities save about US$5,400 in charter costs
on each ship unloaded, even without considering the extra waiting time caused
by the queueing effect of the slower manual discharge which allows less margin
for fluctuations in arrival schedule or handling time.
25.       With respect to (c), the savings in inland transport costs are
substantial. The special shallow draft vessels (mini-bulkers) which are
being used extensively to deliver grain throughout the main branches of
the inland waterway system carry an average of 2,000 tons of grain and are
chartered at US$1,400 per day. The silo facilities at Chittagong, Narayan-
ganj and Ashuganj can completely bulk discharge a mini-bulker in 10 hours,
while the time required by the traditional method is nearly two (24 hour
work day) days.
26.       By the end of 1972 the silo facilities were able to
discharge and bag about 100,000 tons a month. Handling this volume at
the level of efficiency achieved to date, the silo facilities would
produce annual economic benefits conservatively estimated at US$3.3 million
in reduced storage losses, US$2.7 million in reduced transport charges and
US$400,000 in reduction of handling costs for a total of US$6.4 million.
Taking into consideration the project's total cost but excluding any bene-
fits from the uncompleted godown rehabilitation and infestation control

programs, the annual economic benefit provides an economic rate of return
of about 16%. By comparison the economic rate of return of the original
project, including substantial benefits from the godowi and infestation
control programs, was about 23%.
VII.  REC0OIIE7-1DATIONS
27.       It is recommended that a development credit of USS19.7 million
