MEMORANDUM AND RECOMQENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBUD TO TUE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOXS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO EACIONAL FIRANCIERA, S.N.C.
FOR AN IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE SECTOR PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$400.0 million equivalent is
submitted fcr approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by
the United Mexican States, would be repayable over 17 years, including five
years of grace, at the Bsank's variable interest rate and charges. RABIN
would be the Borrower and the National Water Commission (Comision Nacional
del Agua, CRA) would be the executing agency.
1.        Background. Although irrigated farmland represents only about
30 percent of all land harvested, it accounts for half the value of Mexican
agricultural production and provides 60 percent of agricultural exports.
Historically, the Government emphasized the expansion of irrigated lands,
rather than the improvement of the efficiency of existing irrigation
schemes. The strategy had the objectives of expanding the arable land
available for resettlement in the arid and sparsely inhabited north and
increasing farm incomes. The rapid expansion of irrigated lands came to a
virtual halt in the early 19809 as a consequence of the financial crisis in
1982 and the sharp reduction in public investment characterizing subsequent
stabilization programs. Public investment and expenditures for irrigation
and drainage declined from US$3,600 million in 1981 to US$320 million in
1990. The rate of expansion of irrigated land, which had reached an
s;erage oi nearly 150,000 hectares per annum in 1979-1981, declined to a
mere 5,000 hectares in 1988. Moreover, the economic crisis resulted in a
reduction by over 80 percent in real terms in operation and maintenance
expenditures over the last decade. Consequently, about 0.8 million
hectares of irrigated land are lying idle, or badly under-utilized, and a
further 1.5 million hectares are in need of rehabilitation to restore them
to their original level of efficiency.
2.        About 60 percent of irrigated areas is organized in 77 large
Irrigation Districts, each serving more than 3,000 hectares. The
construction and rehabilitation of hydraulic works in these districts is
carried out by the Government and financed by budgetary resources. In most
cases the Government is fully responsible for operation and maintenance
(O&M) of the irrigation and drainage system in the Irrigation Districts.
The remaining irrigation schemes are smaller (from 100 to 3,000 hectares)
and organized under 27,000 Irrigation Units in which farmers contribute
about 40 percent of investment costs (mostly by labor) and the Government
the remaining 60 percent. The Irrigation Units are operated and maintained
by farmers through user associations.
3.        The Government's current strategy calls for an increase in
agricultural production mainly by improving the efficiency in the use of
existing irrigated areas and only on an exceptional basis through expansion
of such areas. Efficiency will be promoted through rehabilitation,
modernization and completion of existing works and through improved
irrigation techniques. In line with its National Development Plan for



- 2 -
1988-1994 the Government plans to transfer gradually the responsibility for
operation and maintenance (O&M) to water users and increase farmer
contributions to O&W expenses and investment costs. Under its new
strategy, to be implemented in the proposed project, the Governmeut will
apply rigorous economic, social, and environmental criteria to make
decisions on the allocation of investment resources and to prevent the
degradation of water resources.
4.        Ratlionale for Bank Involveegnt. The Bank's Irrigation Sub-
Sector Survey of 1982 estimated that production on existing land could be
doubled through a combination of increased area and cropping intensity,
improved productivity, and diversification toward higher value crops.
These findings have been checked and are still valid. The completion of
partially constructed irrigation works and the rehabilitation and
modernization of existing works a-e essential to achieve such an increase
in productionu these would be supported by the proposed operation.
5.        However, without an iv-provement in the incentive structure for
farmers and without other sectoral changes that have been and will be
supported by the Bank, improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure
could not ensure production increases. Prior to 1986, Mexico's highly
protected economy caused major distortions in internal terms of trade
favoring industry. The negative protection for agriculture resulted in
producer prices frequently being far below international prices.
Industrial protection began to be dismantled with the Bank's Trade Policy
loans (1986-1987). The further reduction of discrimination against
agriculture that was achieved with the support for the Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan (AGSAL I); approved in 1988, brought producer prices in
line with international prices and helped assure a better return on
irrigation investment. The liberalization of trade and prices for agricul-
tural commodities and inputs supported by both AGSAL I and AGSAL II (FY91)
have also improved the incentive framework for agriculture. Other planned
Bank operations which will help support increased agricultural productivity
include projects under preparation to help upgrade extension and research
services and establish a sound agricultural credit system. The proposed
operation, along with other Bank operations in the agricultural sector, has
been designed incorporating lessons learned (para. 12) to provide a
comprehensive and coherent policy framework, and to create supporting
infrastructure, which will encourage private sector investment in
agriculture that will lead to increased productivity.
6.        Project Objectives. The project would help the Government to:
(a) sustain the irrigation and drainage sector through adequate levels of
investments selected on the basis of rigorous economic and technical
criteria, procured competitively and implemented efficiently;
(b) decentralize irrigation funding and management through institutional
reforms that would gradually move funding of irrigation and drainage
investments from a centrally managed system of Government grants towards a
system based on regional and local public utilities which would help to
recover costs through user charges and collection instruments, and thus
help sustain the investments by the beneficiaries; (¢) fully utilize
existing irrigation schemes by finishing uncompleted works, upgrading



- 3 -
deteriorated infrastructure, and rehabilitating irrigated land affected by
water logging, salinity problems and lack of maintenances (d) improve wa;.er
use efficiency by introducingt better water management techniques, the
conjur.ctive use of surface and ground water, volumetric measurement of
water, providing more adaptive research results, and training of
technicians and farmers in better operation and maintenance of the
irrigation infrastructures; (e) strengthen the institutional capacity of
CNA and user organizations to implement policy programs, investments and
maintenance; (f) monitor and help prevent environmental and natural
resource degradation; and (g) optimize the use of land and water resources
in the Irrigation Districts and Units.
7.        Prolect Description.  The project is the Government's irrigation
and drainage investment program for the fiscal years 1991 through 1994.
The investment program is estimated at US$1.2 billion. The Bank loan would
finance up to US$400 million of the program and the Inter-American
Development Bank (1DB) would finance US$200 million. The loan takes a
sector investment approach rather than a specific project financing
approach. It would finance a percentage, or "time slice", of the public
investment program for irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The
Government would define investment priorities and evaluate investment
proposals on the basis of criteria agreed to with the Bank. The Bank and
IDB funds would be used to finance all of the project's estimated foreign
exchange costs. About 68Z of Bank loan funds would finance major civil
works, about 202 would finance small contracts for civil works, engineering
services and elec,ro-mechanical repairs, about 1 would finance the
acquisition of equipment, materials and parts, and about 21 would finance
technical assistance. The kinds of physical investments to be financed by
the project, policy changes that will be supported, and areas of
institutional reform are described in the preceding two sections.
8.        The project comprises 12 sub-components grouped in three main
categories:  A.  Irritation and Drainage Construction Components
(US$1,099.0 million) including seven sub-components for Construction of
Irrigation DY stricts, Construction of Small Irrigation, Rehabilitation and
Modernization of Irrigation Districts, Rehabilitation of Small Irrigation,
Deferred Maintenance, O&N equipment and Reuse of Sewage Waters; B. SuDDort
Actions CGmnonents (US$58.0 million), ircluding two sub-components for
Environmental Actions and Institutional Development; and C. Other Proiect
Components (US$88.0 million) including three sub-components for Studies and
Designs, Small River Training Works (i.e., small drainage infrastructure),
and Dam Safety.
9.        The total project cost is estimated at US$1,245.0 million
equivalent, excluding taxes and duties (estimated at 15 percent), with a
foreign exchange component of US$613.8 million equivalent (49.3 percent).
Breakdowns of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$40.0 million
equivalent would be provided Cor eligible expenditures incurred after
January 1, 1991 and a Special Account of US$40.0 million would be
established. A timetable of key project processing events and the status



- 4 -
of L'nk Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9779-ME dated October 29,
1991 is also attached.
10.       Envroental Aspects.  Inefficient or poorly designed
irrigation projects could cause, or exacerbate problem. of waterlogging,
soil salinity, water contamination and soil erosion. All sub-projects
eligible for financing under the project would be subject to an
environmental impact assessment consistent with the Government's
legislation and the Bank's Environmental Guidelines for Irrigation and
Drainage Projects. The project executing agency would be strengthened to
monitor the project's environmental impact and to prevent environmental and
natural resource degradation.
11.       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  In the last
twenty-five years, the Bank has provided Mexico loans totalling US$0.8
billion to support 17 hydraulic infrastructure projects, with a total cost
of US$3.4 billion. The projects have increased the irrigated area by 0.5
million hectares and have rehabilitated 0.9 million hectares.
12.       Past Bank lending for investment projects focussed on tecmnical
issues of specific investments and frequently ignored sector and resource
allocation issues.  The proposed sector investment operation corrects this
shortcoming by focussing on issues such as the pricing of water, beneficia-
ry participation in financing investment and 0&M costs, institutional
arrangements (e.g. moving from a centrally managed system to a decentral-
ized system partly managed by users), and the improvement of analytical
capacity and the skill mix necessary to make inveatment decisions.
13.       Prosect Benefits. The proposed investment program is expected
to benefit some 425,000 farmers, of which 55 percent earn less than the
minimum wage. Once the projects included in the time-slice financing have
reached full development, the income of these low-income producers is
expected to increase by a factor of 5, in the case of the lowest paid, and
of about 2 for those at the other end of the scale within this lowest
income group. Some 250,000 or nearly 60 percent of the total number of
producers participating in the program would take over the operation and
maintenance of their irrigation schemes thus improving their operation
efficiency and saving about US$30 million per annum in O&M expenses once
the rehabilitation and the transfer has been completed. Additionally, some
100,000 people would benef..t from flood prevention as a result of the river
control component.
14.       Project Risks. An inherent risk of a time-slice operation is
related to the Governrment's comitments to provide adequate resources
(fiscal counterpart funds plus cash generation through water charges):
(i) for projects which will be completed after the Closing Date of the
proposed time-slice; and (ii) for maintenance of the existing irrigation
infrastructure. A sharp shortfall in any of these areas could compromise
the viability of the investment program. These risks would be reduced
through increased cost recovery supported by the institutional
decentralization and beneficiary participation in water management.



Moreover, tne annusl review of the investment program and budget under the
project vill help to adjust the scope of planned investments and O&M
expenditures to the changing macroeconomic conditions.
15.       Since this Is the first time-slice irrigation project in Mexico
there is a risk tLat the investment selection criteria will not be strictly
adhered to. This risk will be substantially reduced through training and
institutional strengthening of both CNA and Water Users' Associations and
by intensive Bank su?ervision.
16.       IsSUes and tctigns.  The following assurances have been
obtained. (A) CNA will adhere to the a8reed Operating Regulations which
would not be changed without the Bank's consent. (B) The investment
program will comply with the agreed investment selection criteria and
methodology.  (C) Subject to the Bank's agreement and based on social
factors, activities not meeting the economic efficiency criteria set forth
in the Operating Regulations may be fina-nced under the Project provided,
however, that the aggregate cost of all such activities shallt (1) not
exceed, at any time, three (31) percen' of the total cost of the 1991-94
irrigation investment program (i.e., the Project); and (2) not result in a
decrease exceeding fifteen (151) percent of the total net present value of
economic benefits of the Project. (D) Implementation of the Institutional
Development component shall be in accordance with the respective agreed
Institutional Development Action Plan. (E) Irrigation Districts will be
transferred according to the respective agreed Action Plan. (F) Cost
recovery would be achieved in accordance with the targets established in
the agreed Cost Recovery Action Plan. This Action Plan establishes
increasing annual targets for the recovery of Irrigation District O&M
costs, resulting in the recovery of 90 percent of O&M costs in 1994. The
Action Plan also reflects agreement that capital costs for new investments
will be recovered at a rate of 40 percent for rehabilitation and
modernization works and 30 percent for new construction (farmers with 5
hectares or less would repay a smaller percentage, 30 percent and 20
percent, respectively). (G) A feasibility study for market transfer of
water shall be completed not later than September 15, 1992. (H) CNA would
maintain adequate staffing with relevant functions and skills for
implementation of the project.  (I) CIA would submit to the Bank the Annual
Investment and Operational Plan (AIOP) for the next year not later than
September 15 of each year.  (J) Annual reviews would be held in October of
each year to assess progress in project implementation, including
allocation plans, Action Plans, and compliance with investment selection
criteria, and reach agreement on the AIOP for the next year; if progress is
found to be unsatisfactory, the Government shall implement remedial action
satisfactory to the Bank. (K) Transfers of Irrigation Districts will be
conditional upon assumption of full OEM cost recovery; CNA shall supervise
and monitor the performance of the associations (transferred Irrigation
Districts and units) end shall take prompt remedial actions in case of non-
compliance with contractual terms. (L) The Government guarantees to
complete all investments and rehabilitation works begun but not completed
within the time-slice period. (M) The Government would: (1) submit to its
Congress proposed annual fiscal budgets for fiscal year 1992 and
thereafter, each of such budgets to be consistent, in the opinion of the



- 6 -
Government and the Bank, with the macroeconomic policy framework and with
an adequate allocation of resources to cover the operation and maintenance
costs of the hydraulic infrastructure; and (2) furnish by March 15 of each
year evidence of its approved budgetary allocation and expenditures made by
CNA for this purpose. (N) CNA would have final designs of all dams, and
related structures, to be construct d under the project reviewed and the
construction of such dams inspected periodically by a panel of experts with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank; should project
implementation require displacement or resettlement of population, the
Government will present and implement a resettlement plan satisfactory to
the Bank.  (0) CNA will complete a study on the feasibility of User
Associations raising resources through public borrowings by no later than
December 1, 1993.
17.       The Conditions of Effectiveness are as follows:  (a) the
Monitoring System (SPS) is fully operational; (b) NAFIN and Government have
signed an agreement for transferring the loan proceeds; and (c) the Bank
has received the final and official budget proposal presented by CIA to
SPP, covering the operation and maintenance costs of the hydraulic
infrastructure.
18.       Conditions of Disbursement would be that no disbursement would
be made for:  (a) any project activity unless such activity is included 'n
an approved AIOP; (b) any new sub-project unlsss formal commitment has been
reached with beneficiaries on their capital contribution; and (c) any civil
works contract estimated to cost US$2.0 million or less and goods contract
esti.ated to cost US$100,000 or less; exceptions wetuld be for retroactive
financing of civil works procured under contracts a-er US$500,000
equivalent executed after January 1, 1991 and up to an aggregate amount of
US$40.0 million.
19.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
