KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
RURAL BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3295-MOR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Rural Basic Education
Development Project in the Kingdom of Morocco, for which Loan 3295-MOR in the
amount of US$ 145 million equivalent was approved on February 26, 1991, and made
effective on March 19, 1992. Following four cancellations on March 4, 1996, August 19,
1997, March 9, 1998 and September 23, 1998, the project loan was reduced to US$ 55
million equivalent.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1998, following an extension (agreed to on June
23, 1997) from its original closing date of June 30, 1997. Final disbursement took place
on, at which time a balance of US$ 472,460.47 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Jeffrey Waite (HDNED) and reviewed by Jacques
Baudouy (Director MNSHD) and Marisa Femandez-Palacios (Project Adviser). The
borrower provided an official note that is included as appendixes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Banks final supervision/completion
mission, from July 20 to August 1, 1998. It is based on material in the project file. The
borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the
project's execution and commenting on the draft ICR.

RURAL BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3295-MOR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
In 1985, the Government launched a thoroughgoing reform of the educational system with
the goal of expanding access to quality education while simultaneously containing costs.
The Government's main objective was to improve basic education enrollment figures in
rural areas, particularly among girls.
The reforn had already received Bank support in the form of two loans. This project was
designed as a follow-up to those earlier loans insofar as it sought, first, to increase the
capacity of upper basic education in order to accommodate a growing number of students
who complete the sixth grade as a result of expanded access to lower basic education, and,
second, to motivate parents to enroll their children in primary school with the knowledge
that children will henceforth have the opportunity to continue their studies through the ninth
grade.
Project Objectives
Thus, the goal of this project was to support the Government's educational objectives
through investments designed:
a.   To promote greater equality of educational opportunity and increased school
attendance by improving college enrollment figures among disadvantaged populations such
as rural children and girls; and
b.   To improve the educational environment through in-service teacher training,
general inspections, curriculum development, assessment of student achievement and
proper use of students' materials.
The first objective was translated into quantifiable terms: (i) to increase rural enrollment
from 51,600 (in 1989/1990) to 115,200 (at project completion, initially scheduled for
1995/1996); and (ii) to increase the rate of continuation from lower basic to upper basic
education from 62.0% to 77.2% over the same period. Although it incorporated major
components, such as in-service training and development of a National Assessment Program
(NAP), the second objective was never quantified.
Implementation Experience and Results
Construction of colleges: Of the 208 colleges that were to be built in connection with the
project, only 78 had been put into service with IBRD financing as of June 30, 1998.
iii



Enrollment figures: The project was able to provide only a very modest contribution to the
main goal of the 1985 reform package, i.e. expanded access to nine years of basic education.
In fact, net upper basic enrollment rates have risen only very slightly nationwide since
1994/1995, when the first IBRD-financed colleges were put into service. Even though the
proportion of young people enrolled in college progressed only slightly at the national level,
the project nevertheless nearly reached its objective of increasing rural upper basic
enrollment figures by 54,500 students during the three-year period initially projected for
putting new colleges into service. During the four years of actual implementation, the
project witnessed increased enrollment of nearly 53,000.
Enrollment figures for girls: Enrollment at the 78 colleges financed through the IBRD loan
and put into service by 1997/1998 came to approximately 26,000 students during this school
year, including 24.0% girls. The objective of increasing the proportion of girls was not
quantified at the time of the initial project appraisal. It is nonetheless justifiable to express
disappointment over the fact that rural upper basic enrollment figures for girls have
progressed so slowly, from 23% in 1994/1995 to 28% in 1998/1999.
Quality of instruction: In-service training was provided to teachers in conjunction with
overall MOE activities, but was not specifically adapted to rural education. Insofar as
teachers are often young and inexperienced and have just recently graduated from teacher
training institutes, this lack of appropriate training may diminish the quality of instruction in
rural areas.
With respect to technical assistance, the project was supposed to include two major studies.
One, assessing the irmpact of certain variables on school enrollments and attendance in rural
areas, which was submitted to MOE in 1997, has only recently been endorsed by the
monitoring committee. The other, designed to help institute a National Assessment Program
(NAP), has not yet been carried out and will be transferred to the Social Priorities Project
(4024-MOR.)
Assessment of Outcome and Key Lessons Learned
On the Bank's rating system, the project was rated highly unsatisfactory. However, a social
assessment, carried out independently of MOE by a team of Moroccan researchers at the
same time as the implementation completion mission, demonstrated that the project should
be seen in a better light, if only because the colleges are likely to improve over time, as they
reach their "cruising speed" and the communities they serve adapt to the new context. This
trend can be seen quite clearly in the occupancy rates, which continue to grow in the
colleges that have been the longest in operation..
There are four lessons to be drawn from the project:
*    Support from senior government officials throughout the project is critical to its
success;
*    The choice oiF a site - an issue that was neglected during project preparation - is
essential to the success of a college in a rural setting;
iv



*    Community contributions must not be ignored, even in countries where traditions of
local participation are not strong;
*    Putting additional resources into the building program cannot compensate for the lack
of activities designed to improve the quality of instruction.

RURAL UPPER BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3295-MOR)
PART I
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Project Objectives
1.    The goal of this project was to support the Government's educational objectives
through investments designed:
a.    To promote greater equality of educational opportunity and increased school
attendance by improving college enrollment figures among disadvantaged
populations such as rural children and girls; and
b.    To improve the educational environment through in-service teacher training,
general inspections, curriculum development, assessment of student achievement
and proper use of students' materials.
2.    In 1985, the Government launched a thoroughgoing reform of the educational
system with the goal of expanding access to quality education while simultaneously
containing costs. To generate savings on wages paid to teaching and non-teaching staff,'
the primary level (five years) and secondary level (seven years) were replaced by a system
of basic education (nine years) and secondary education (three years). Basic education was
then divided into two levels: six years of lower basic education, followed by three years of
upper basic education. The Government's main objective was to improve basic education
enrollment figures in rural areas, particularly among girls.
3.    The reform had already received Bank support in the form of two loans (2664-MOR
and 3026-MOR). The purpose of the first loan was to provide broad support for
implementing the reform, while the second focused on expanding lower basic education
enrollment figures in rural areas and improving the quality of instruction nationwide. Loan
No. 3295-MOR was designed as a follow-up to the latter, in the sense that it addressed the
following concerns in particular:
a.    First, to increase the capacity of upper basic education in order to
accommodate the growing number of students completing the sixth grade as a result
of expanded access to lower basic education;
'Primary/basic education teachers' salaries are lower than those paid to secondary education teachers.
1



b.    Second, to motivate parents to enroll their children in primary school with
the knowledge that children will henceforth have the opportunity to continue their
studies through the ninth grade.
4.    To achieve these objectives, the Government opted for the concept of a "rural
college" that would operate like urban colleges - covering upper basic education (i.e. the
last three grades of the nine-year system) - but in a predominantly rural setting. By
reducing the distance between home and school, the Government expected to increase
demand for education.
5.    It is importaLnt to note that the "rural college" concept was neither tested on a pilot
basis, nor compared with other options through a rigorous evaluation process. Indeed, the
rural college optioll was explicitly chosen over building urban colleges with boarding
facilities. This choice appears to have been justified by the Government's more general
policy of slowing urban drift by creating small townships around a core of basic
infrastructure: roads, water, electricity, health services, mosques and... schools. The
Government also rejected the option of adding Grades 7, 8 and 9 to rural primary schools to
create an "integrated school" covering all nine years of basic education -- on the grounds
that it was too difficult to reconcile the major differences that separate the two levels of
basic education. Upper basic education is in fact closer to secondary education with respect
to teacher management and organizational structure.
6.    With a loan of US$ 145 million, the project was large and probably fell just within
the financial and operational capacity of the MOE. The risk was increased however by the
fact that the Government had not indicated clear support for this level of the education
system, that it was facing a number of challenging issues (most notably the need to make
lower basic education universal), and that its budget was only increasing slightly.
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
7.    Construction of colleges. The initial program is being implemented much more
slowly than originally anticipated. Of the 208 colleges that were to be built as part of the
project, only 78 had been put into service with IBRD financing as of June 30, 1998.
Although World Bank loan proceeds are no longer available in the case, MOE expects to
put approximately fifty of the other colleges originally called for in the project into service
at the beginning of the 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 school years. (Of the 42 colleges to be
financed through the parallel AfDB loan, 35 were in operation on June 30, 1998. It is
anticipated that all 42 will come on stream before this loan, likely to be extended through
December 31, 1999., is closed.)

8.     Enrollment figures.   The project was able to provide only a very modest
contribution to the main goal of the 1985 reform package, i.e. expanded access to nine years
of basic education. In fact, net upper basic enrollment rates have risen only very slightly
nationwide since 1994/1995, when the first IBRD-financed colleges were put into service.
For the seventh grade, the net rate rose from 19% in 1994/1995 to 20% in 1997/1998 for
boys, and from 16% to 19% for girls, while at the ninth grade level, over the same period,
the rate remained at 13% for boys and climbed from 12% to 13% for girls.

9.     Even though the proportion of young people enrolled in college progressed only
slightly at the national level, the project nevertheless nearly reached its objective (albeit two
years late) of increasing rural upper basic enrollment figures by 54,500 students during the
three-year period initially projected for putting new colleges into service (1993/1994 to
1995/1996). During the four years of actual implementation, i.e. from 1994/1995 to
1997/1998, the project (IBRD and AfDB components combined) witnessed increased
enrollment of 52,600.

10.    Girls' participation. The objective of increasing the proportion of girls was not
quantified at the time of the initial project appraisal. It is nonetheless justifiable to express
disappointment over the fact that rural upper basic enrollment figures for girls have
progressed so slowly, from 23%  in 1994/1995 to 28%  in 1998/19992 -- especially as this
increase appears to be the straightforward consequence of girls' increasing their share of
enrollments in lower basic education, rather than as the result of policies specifically
targeted at girls (see para 25).

11.    Promotion from lower to upper basic education. The initial appraisal envisioned a
gradual increase in the rate of promotion from Grade 6 to Grade 7, rising from 62.7% in
1989/1990 to 77.2% in 1995/1996. In fact, the real rate has been falling over the last few
years, from 84.2% in 1994/95 to 77.9% in 1998/99, probably because overall demand has
been weaker than originally anticipated.
12.    Occupancy rate. The staff appraisal report envisioned colleges of "minimal" size,
i.e. schools comprising nine classrooms to be occupied by twelve sections (approximately
360 students). In 1997/1998, average enrollment in the 78 IBRD-financed colleges was 333
students. Although the number of students varies considerably from college to college, the
breakdown of school enrollment figures, based on the year of being put into service,
suggests a gradual increase in enrollment, ultimately approaching the standard college
enrollment capacity.
2 Between 1989190 and 1998,'1999, urban upper basic enrollment figures for girls gradually increased from 42% of students to 45%.

13.    Pupil-teacher ratio. The student-teacher ratio was expected to rise and then fall over
the life of the project, down to 15.1 students per teacher in the final year of the project. In
fact, the real ratio was higher than projected (18.6 in 1995/1996), but fell to 18.1 in
1997/1998. This resulted in a lower than expected unit cost for upper basic education.

14.    Student achievement. It is impossible to know whether the project has had any
impact on student achievement. An assessment of the learning achievement of the student
population affected by the project could have been carried out as part of the National
Assessment Program (NAP), but this part of the project was never implemented.
Furthermore, the lack of standardized national exarns at the end of the upper basic level
makes it impossible to compare the results of end-of-year testing for different groups of
students.
15.    Boarding and canteen scholarships: The number of boarding scholarships awarded
to students from rural areas has not met expectations. Instead of the 9,500 boarding
scholarships expected for 1995/1996, the figure at project completion in 1997/1998 was
6,090. Only 17.5% of these scholarships were awarded to girls, far below the figure of 40%
projected at the time of the initial appraisal. Of the 634 canteen scholarships awarded in
rural areas in 1997/1998, 120 (or 18.9%) went to girls. It should be noted that the
Government has preferred to finance the scholarships through the national budget instead of
the loan.

C.    Impilementation Record and Key Factors Influencing the Project
C].  Implementation Record
16.   The project was overly large. When the project was first designed, both the unit
cost of the colleges and the MOE's implementation capacity were overestimated. This
overestimation, when combined with the MOE's changing priorities and the weakening of
the Moroccan currenacy against the US dollar, led to four successive reductions in the loan
amount that lowerecl it by almost two-thirds (from US$145 million to US$55 million).
17.   The project started two years behind schedule because of protracted dealings
between MOE and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOF) over the issue of the unit
cost of construction. MOF insisted that contracts be negotiated at a lower cost range than
MOE estimates had initially projected. This delay was partially offset by a one-year
extension of the projlect (from June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1998).
18.   School building. Of the 208 colleges projected for World Bank financing, 78 were
in operation when the loan was closed; 57 were under construction (including six contracts
to be terninated) and 18 were in the approval, start-up or study phase. The rest were
dropped after the series of reductions in the amount of the World Bank loan.

19.   Sanitation, water, electicity. With a view to reducing the cost, sanitation and water
and power hook-ups were not a condition of the choice of site, and were not included in the
building specifications. However, toward the end of the project, the MOE made a particular
effort to make up for this oversight: all 78 colleges already in operation have septic tanks
and cesspits; almost all colleges have water supply -- some are connected to community
mains but most have a water tower and a well, or just a well; most colleges that have been
in operation for three or four years have electricity (they are either connected to the
community grid or, in a few cases, possess a generator). Classroom and boarding fumiture
and fittings have been delivered to the colleges already in operation. Textbooks have not
yet been delivered.

20.    Teacher training. The "quality of services" component was less successful than the
"physical achievements" component. In-service training was provided to teachers in
conjunction with overall MOE activities, but was not specifically adapted to rural
education. Insofar as teachers are often young and inexperienced and have just recently
graduated from teacher training institutes, this lack of appropriate training may diminish the
quality of instruction in rural areas.
21.    Service vehicles. Although MOE purchased 46 service vehicles in March 1996 so
that inspectors could more easily cover rural areas, the level of educational supervision is
clearly inadequate to offset the additional difficulties faced by teachers in such areas (which
include lack of training for inspectors, overly heavy workload given the distances that must
be covered, and the intermittent availability of vehicles often used by the MOE's provincial
office for other tasks).
22.    Technical assistance. The Government did not take ownership of the technical
assistance activities, which were either delayed or were not undertaken at all. The project
was supposed to include two major studies. The study assessing the impact of certain
variables on school enrollments and attendance in rural areas was submitted to MOE in
1997 and still awaits the endorsement of the monitoring committee. As for the other study
(designed to help institute a National Assessment Program (NAP)), a call for tenders was
issued on two occasions, with no successful outcome. This underscores not only the
institutional weakness of MOE in procurement, but also the low priority accorded to this
program by the MOF. (In contrast, the MOE appears eager to complete this study and has
asked the Bank to finance it from another loan currently being implemented.)
C2.   Key Factors Influencing the Project
23.    Several factors apparently led to weak performance in this project. The main ones
are covered by just three themes: (i) weak Government ownership, especially on the part of
the MOF; (ii) inadequate project preparation; and (iii) overestimation of the MOE's
financial and operational capacity.
24.    Weak Government ownership. The MOF showed little enthusiasm for the project
from the start, and, once the loan was made, tried to limit its scope. MOF reservations seem
to have become even more pronounced as a result of several years of difficult economic
circumstances (partly caused by droughts), which obliged the Government to make drastic
7



cuts in investments. Following a reduction in the unit cost of rural colleges (and the
resulting reduction in the level of facilities provided), as well as the delays imposed by the
MOF, the MOE lost interest in a project that was no longer accorded budgetary resources.
25.   In addition, whilst both the Bank and the MOE attached great importance to girls'
education, the two diverged significantly as to what measures needed to be put into place.
The State did not inmplement policies aimed specifically at compensating for the fact that
many parents consider their sons' education more important than their daughters'. In
addition to the opportunity costs of schooling their daughters (in terrms of loss of household
labor for tasks such as childcare, housework, agricultural chores, fetching firewood and
water, and carpet weaving), parents think of college as being ill-equipped to prepare their
daughters for their future as housewives and mothers, and as a place where their daughters
risk running wild. According to the social assessment undertaken for this report, there is
nevertheless a demand for girls' education which could have been expanded if only more
appropriate incentives had been put in place.
26.   The assessment identified the following incentives as being the most important:
a.    an unbroken school day (that enables students to return home early);
b.    the presence of adults (especially parents) to accompany students home;
c.    a convenient transport system;
d.    the existence of appropriate facilities: latrines, boarding facilities, canteens,
water and electricity;
e.    the siting of the college and boarding facilities in a small, well-equipped
township (e.g. in the county's main town);
f.    the separation of sexes, with respect to latrines and sleeping quarters.
27.   Inadequate preparation: Without taking away from the project design, it must be
pointed out that no serious study was undertaken to ensure that the strategy finally adopted
was the most cost-effective. In addition, more solid and painstaking project preparation,
particularly as regards plans and manufacturing processes, could have helped the project
start at an earlier date. As indicated above, the project started two years behind schedule
because of lengthy dealings between MOE and MOF over the issue of the unit cost of
construction.
28.   Furthermore, the factors that were necessary to select sites that would guarantee the
success of rural colleges were not identified beforehand. This meant that the availability of
land (offered free of charge to MOE by local authorities, for example) sometimes weighed
too heavily on the choice of college sites, and therefore, resulted in sites that had few
facilities (e.g. water, power). Few colleges were built in rural townships, where they would
have benefited from better facilities and transport without noticeably reducing most
students' ease of access.
29.   Overestimation of MOE's financial and operational capacity. It is unlikely that the
MEN could have implemented such a large project without major adjustments to its
procedures and without intensjive management training and other groundwork. The MOE is
highly centralized and, as a result, has only a limited capacity in procurement and in
8



monitoring worksites throughout the country. This capacity was further weakened early on
in the project with the elimination of the Funded Projects Division, initially established to
manage this type of project, and a dispersal of its functions among the various MOE
directorates. The resulting break-up of responsibility made project coordination and
management more difficult.
30.   The MOE had difficulty allocating a sufficient portion of its budget to the project
for new investments to be made at the rate envisioned at the time of the initial appraisal.
This difficulty is due to the fact that, however large the loan, the MOE budget remains at a
fixed level, usually insufficient to meet all its priorities. The Moroccan Government's
practice leaves little incentive to the MOE to use the loan, and led to successive
cancellations of two-thirds of the loan amount.
31.   Finally, the MOE has relatively little experience with studies, technical assistance
and training. It is even weaker in this area than in school construction. The administrative
procedures related to qualitative activities appear to have been even more difficult to follow
efficiently than those related to physical outputs.
D.    Project Sustainability
32.   Provided that the Government continues to provide necessary staffing, keeps the
existing colleges in operation and sets up a reliable system of building and equipment
maintenance, then it is highly probable that the project will maintain at least the level of
activity observed at implementation completion. Evidence obtained in the course of the
implementation completion mission suggests that the MOE intends in fact to extend the
program to other rural communities - in a form that incorporates lessons from this project.
E.    Bank Performance
33.   Identification, preparation and appraisal. A better contribution by the Bank with
respect to project preparation, particularly in assessing MOE's capacity to manage a loan of
US$145 million, would undoubtedly have produced a more modest operation with a greater
likelihood of achieving its objectives.
34.   Supervision. The Banks performance was inadequate. High turnover of project
managers throughout the life of the project (one project manager during the preparation
phase, six others during the supervision phase) certainly did not facilitate, on the part of the
Bank, proper implementation. Insufficient familiarity with the project and its key players
and a lack of accountability for project outcomes -- sentiments often attributable to a lack of
continuity in project management -- also contributed to lax supervision and to the absence
of restructuring in the face of persistent problems.

35.    Although the Bank observed a decline in project performance as expressed in the
implemtentation record3 -- indeed, a decline much more pronounced than is usually found in
the region, as the following graph indicates -- it is not clear that, until nearly the end of the
project, the Bank made any efforts to convince the Government to take project
implementation more seriously. However, it must be said that impact assessment is made
difficult by the fact that a college takes three years - from the time it opens - to reach its
"cruising speed".

F.     Borirower Performance
36.    The Borrower's performance was generally inadequate. On the one hand, an MOF
wanting to limit the scope of the project, for fiscal reasons; on the other, an MOE only
weakly defending the project and confronted with other priorities, most notably,
demographic pressure in peri-urban areas. This lack of coordination, along with MOE's
own management problems led to delays of at least two years.
G.     Assessment of Outcome
37.    On the Bank's rating system, the project was rated highly unsatisfactory. However,
the social assessmeint demonstrated that the project should be seen in a better light, if only
because the colleges are likely to improve over time, as they reach their "cruising speed"

out the project status report after each supervision mission. The other is the "achievement of development objectives.

and the communities they serve adapt to the new context. This trend can be seen quite
clearly in the occupancy rates, which continue to grow in the colleges that have been the
longest in operation.

38.   As for girls' education, the social assessment (conducted in parallel to the
implementation completion mission and independently of the MOE by a team of Moroccan
researchers) showed that current policies need revisiting. Having sampled the opinion of
students, parents of students, elected officials, local government, teachers, administrators
and inspectors, the researchers concluded that the Government must (a) adopt particular
measures - scholarships, boarding facilities - to promote girls' education, (b) take into
account infrastructure and surroundings in order to improve the siting of colleges, and (c)
pay particular attention to the quality of teaching. They accordingly emphasized the need to
return education to the position it deserves and to work toward efficient management by
simplifying and bringing into agreement administrative procedures and channels and by
decentralizing the implementation of school operations.
H.    Future Operations
39.   One of the conclusions to be drawn from the social assessment is that a significant
demand for this level of education exists in rural communities. This in itself justifies the
MOE's intention of continuing to establish rural colleges, all the while benefiting from the
lessons this project provides. These lessons relate essentially to the choice of sites and the
"holistic" treatment of each college (i.e. planning, construction, facilities, maintenance,
training and local involvement).
40.   Extending this program in no way precludes other, more appropriate options being
considered. It would be possible for instance to build colleges that have girls-only boarding
facilities, since one college having two dormitories (one each for girls and boys aged
between 12 and 14) does nothing to reassure parents, at least not in more conservative
regions. Indeed, given that opinions and attitudes vary from region to region, it is important
to find whatever solution -- ideally the cheapest -- best fits with the values of parents and
the wider community.
41.   For those colleges already in service, the social assessment recommended a two- or
three-year period of "consolidation" before taking further action. To ensure this period is
11



used efficiently, the Government is advised to organize "workshops" involving the MOE's
provincial representatives, parent associations and county councils with a view to defining
the problems that are particular to each province and each college, formulating possible
solutions, and identifying specific measures and resources. These workshops would be
fol!lowed by rigorous operational planning (which in turn would be properly implemented
by the various players) and by periodic monitoring and evaluation sessions.
I.     Key Lessons Learned
42.    Support from senior government officials throughout the project is critical to its
success. The absence of a clear strategic orientation and the very uneven support given to
the project by senior Government officials clearly had the effect of diverting the attention of
staff involved in the project toward other priorities.  The Government's wavering
commitment to the strategic choice adopted for the project should have led to a joint review
by the Bank and the Government to see whether some change in the mode of operation, or
even cancellation of the loan, was warranted.
43.    The choice of a site - an issue that was neglected during project preparation - is
essential to the success of a college in a rural setting. The siting of a college must follow,
and not precede, investment in other infrastructure. Much of the cost associated with rural
colleges (e.g. water and power hook-ups, teaching housing, maintenance) could have been
reduced if colleges had been established (with public or community-based boarding
facilities4 and boarding scholarships) in rural townships that had a minimum level of
infrastructure and social services - without a significant reduction in most students' ease of
access. Siting of this kind, undertaken as an integral part of annual planning of school
construction, can only improve the performance of rural colleges. This would however
require improvements in the way school construction plans are drawn up and carried out,
especially in the integration of geographical information (housing, topography,
transportation routes) and administrative boundaries.
44.    Community contributions must not be ignored, even in countries where traditions of
local participation are not strong. As noted in the social assessment, the emergence of rural
colleges is creating a new dynamic. There are local initiatives (a) to establish "dar attalib"
(student hostels) to compensate for the lack of, or insufficient capacity of, public boarding
facilities, (b) to organize school transport, and (c) to provide colleges with additional
facilities. These initiatives are the work of parent associations, charity organization, county
councils and local authorities. Initiatives of this kind, still unusual at this stage, may be
critical for the success of a college. However, these partnerships can only be developed at
the provincial level, and therefore require that the responsibility for construction and
development be delegated to this level. Local authorities must be given the resources to
enter into agreements with parent associations or non-governmental organizations in ways
that involve the latter in the management of the college, thereby placing some responsibility
in the hands of the beneficiaries.
4 Some colleges have a "dar attalib", established by a local charity, with help from the Department of
National Welfare, provincial authorities, and private donors.
12



45.   Putting additional resources into the building program cannot compensate for the
lack of activities designed to improve the quality of instruction. Even if the project
succeeds in filling the newly constructed colleges within three years of the date when they
are put into service, college enrollment does not automatically translate into quality
education that will prepare students for their future life as family members, participants in
the labor force and citizens. In this project, the failure to develop a teacher training program
specific to rural areas and the poor performance of the two technical assistance activities
(ICV and NAP) undoubtedly weakened the project's impact.
46.   The components not yet implemented must be launched now: improving teaching
quality through improvements in curriculum and teaching materials; delivering in-service
teacher training; improving supervision and inspection; and establishing a national
assessment program (essential to the development of better policies and practices). These
are critical tasks, agreed to more than ten years ago after careful analysis of relevant
information. That they are both worthwhile and and urgently needed is only too obvious.

Annex A: ICR Mission Aide-Memoire
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
RURAL UPPER BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3295-MOR)
Mission of July 20 - August 1, 1998
1.   A World Bank mission, consisting of Messrs. Jeffrey Waite and Mohammed Arbi
Ben-Achour, visited Rabat from July 20 to August 1 in connection with preparation of the
implementation completion report for the Rural Upper Basic Education Development
("Rural Colleges") Project, financed through World Bank Loan No. 3295-MOR, which was
closed on June 30, 1998. The mission would like to thank the Government of Morocco and,
in particular, the heads of department of the Ministry of Education for their generous
welcome and cooperation.
2.   The goals of the mission were: to gather from the Moroccan authorities essential data,
information and observations for use in compiling the Bank's implementation completion
report on the Rural Colleges Project; and to make preparations for the social assessment
study to be carried out among beneficiaries and other stakeholders as a means of obtaining
additional information on the project. The mission's conclusions are presented below in the
following order: (A) implementation completion report, (B) social assessment study, and
(C) next steps.
A.    Implementation Completion Report
3.   The mission obtained statistical and financial data and gathered very useful
observations on the project from the Moroccan authorities. This information will be
summarized under the various chapter headings of the final implementation completion
report. The mission made every effort to obtain all necessary information pertaining to the
report during its visit to Morocco, but it is highly probable that the Bank will present
additional requests for information during the process of preparing the report. The mission
wishes to thank the Government of Morocco in advance for its support in this area.
4.   Assessment of Project Objectives: In the Rural Colleges Project, the Government's
objectives were (i) to bring rural enrollment rates, particularly for girls, closer to the rates
already achieved in urban areas, and (ii) to improve the quality of instruction provided by
the educational system, especially in rural areas. (The Government can be said to have
grafted on to the project a secondary objective, stemming from its regional planning policy,
namely that of curbing rural-urban migration by developing small communities around a
core of basic infrastructure: roads, water, electricity, health services, mosques and, most
pointedly, schools.)
5.   The first objective was translated into quantifiable terms: the project sought (a) to
increase rural enrollment from 51,600 (in 1989/1990) to 115,200 (at project completion,
35



initially scheduled for 1995/1996); and (b) to increase the rate of continuation from lower
basic to upper basic education from 62.0% to 77.2% over the same period.
6.   Although it incorporated major components, such as in-service training and
development of a National Assessment Program (NAP), the second objective was never
quantified, presurnably because student achievement assessment tools remain largely
ineffective.
7.   Project objectives, as established at the appraisal stage, clearly fell within feasible
limits. However, the fact that the Government's priorities would change during
implementation was an unknown at that point. As a result of the dwindling irmportance
assigned to the project, the MOE budget was no longer able to absorb the entire loan.
8.   Achievement of Project Objectives:  The Govermment supported the objectives
throughout the project, but with varying degrees of conviction. The strength of its
cormmitment to the project appears to have faltered in midstream, perhaps because of
questions regarding the cost-effiectiveness of the approach selected.
9.   Of the 208 colleges that were to be built as part of the project, only 78 have so far
been put into service with IBRID financing.1 As a result, the expected increase in enrollment
has not occurred. Instead of adding 63,600 students2 to rural school enrollmernt, project
impact has been much smaller: as far as the World Bank component is concerned, some
26,000 students attended the 78 colleges in 1997/1998, while enrollment of girls came to
24.0% of total enrollment in IBRD-financed colleges in 1997/1998.
1 0. Although enrollment figures did not meet expectations, the rate of continuation from
lower basic to upper basic education exceeded the established objective by a few points.3
Instead of the 77.2% expected at project completion, the 1997/1998 figure for rural colleges
was 83%. The estimated rate for the 1998/1999 school year is slightly lower., at 81%.
These rates are very close to those recorded in urban areas, namely 85% and 82%
respectively.
11.  The number of scholarships awarded to students from rural areas greatly exceeded
expectations. The goal at project completion was a total of 9,500 full (i.e. boarding)
scholarships. In 1997/1998, MOE awarded 22,178 full scholarships and 8,020 partial (i.e.
canteen) scholarships. The high number of scholarships can be explained by the fact that
MOE built fewer nevv colleges than expected and students were therefore required to seek
boarding privileges in order to register for upper basic education.
12. Implementation Record: Owing primarily to changing priorities and the budget
constraints therefore weighing on the project (but also due to the weakened position of the
Moroccan dirham in relation to the US dollar and even the initial over-estimate of the unit
" The 42 colleges financed through an AfDB loan will all come on stream before this loan, likely to be
extended through December 31, is closed.
2 This figure applies to the entire project (both its IBRD and AfDB components).
3This implies a higher than expected drop-out rate between the 7t and 91h grades.
36



cost of construction), there were three successive reductions which lowered the loan amount
by one-half (from US$145 million
to US$75 million).
13. The project started at least one year behind schedule because of protracted dealings
between MOE and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOF) over the issue of the unit
cost of construction. MOF insisted that contracts be negotiated in a lower cost range than
MOE estimates had initially projected. This delay was partially offset by a one-year
extension of the project (from June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1998).
14. Of the 208 colleges projected for World Bank financing, 78 were in operation when
the loan was closed. Some fifty colleges now under construction will be put into service at
the beginning of the 1998/1999 or 1999/2000 school year. In the case of 26 operations
already under way, contracts could not be submitted for Bank approval before the deadline
set. The rest were dropped, in most cases after a portion of the loan was canceled.
Classroom and boarding furniture and fittings have been delivered to the colleges already in
operation, but the contract to supply textbooks to these same colleges awaits final approval.
15.  The "quality of services" component was less successful than the "physical
achievements" component. In-service training was provided to teachers in conjunction with
overall MOE activities, but was not specifically adapted to rural education. Insofar as
teachers are often young and inexperienced and have just recently graduated from teacher
training institutes, this lack of appropriate training may diminish the quality of instruction in
rural areas.
16. Although MOE purchased 46 service vehicles in March 1996 so that inspectors could
more easily cover rural areas, the level of educational supervision is clearly inadequate to
offset the additional difficulties faced by teachers in such areas.
17.  With respect to technical assistance, the project was supposed to include two major
studies. The study assessing the impact of certain variables on school enrollments and
attendance in rural areas was submitted to MOE in 1997 and has only recently been
endorsed by the monitoring committee. This study still awaits endorsement by the steering
committee and will not be of any particular benefit to the Rural Colleges Project. However,
it should serve to improve the quality and efficiency of services provided by rural colleges in
the future. The other study, designed to help institute a National Assessment Program
(NAP), has not yet been carried out. Without a program of this sort, formulating optimal
educational policies for urban and rural areas alike becomes difficult. (To emphasize the
across-the-board importance of this program, the Bank has already indicated its willingness
to consider financing the study under the BAJI Education Project.)
18. Key Factors Influencing the Project: More than anything else, it was the midstream
slackening of Government support for the project, linked to the weak budget capacity of
MOE, that kept the project from being fully implemented (thus leading to successive
cancellations of half the loan amount).
37



19.  Better project preparation, particularly as regards cost estimates and the process of
negotiating sample documents (such as CPSs that meet Bank guidelines) with all future
players within the Government of Morocco, would clearly have got the project off to an
earlier start.
20. In certain cases, the availability of land (offered free of charge to MOE by local
authorities) may have weighed too heavily on the choice of college sites. This may explain
why some colleges are located in areas without roads, water supply or electricity and far
from a large segment of the population they are supposed to serve.
21.  The role that distance plays in decisions by parents to send their children, particularly
their daughters, to college may have been misjudged. It appears that boarding facilities (or
at least dormitories) should have been provided at more colleges.
22. The complexity of the imanagement issues and the heavily centralized nature of the
Government were partially responsible for the slow pace of the project (and, occasionally,
the quality of the decisions ultimately made). In certain cases, the quality and efficiency of
construction activities, for example, could have benefited from fuller participation by
provincial branches of government and municipal bodies in decisions about how to adapt
centrally designed programs to meet local conditions.
23.  The administrative procedures related to qualitative activities appear to have been
even more difficult to follow efficiently than those related to physical outputs. It is also
possible that "traditional" MOE practices favor tangible results rather than activities that
leave no physical trace (but which are nonetheless very important to the quality of
instruction).
24.  Project Sustainability:  Since the colleges generally appear to reach enrollment
capacity within three years of being put into service, and the Government will continue to
provide necessary staffing and keep existing colleges in operation, it is likely that the project
will maintain at least the level of activity observed at implementation completion.
25.  Bank Performance: MOE would have preferred a better contribution from the Bank
at the project preparation stage, particularly as regards cost estimates and the drafting of
sample documents.
26. Borrower Performance: The complexity of management issues (e.g. payment system)
and the highly centralized nature of the Government, at least with respect to the educational
system, resulted in delays that probably could have been avoided by adopting a results-
oriented approach rather than focusing on procedures.
27. Assessment of Outcome: The project outcome must be considered disappointing, in
the sense that the Government was never able to utilize the full loan amount available. But
it should be recognized that the project uncovered a considerable interest in rural colleges on
the part of many parents.
38



28. Future Operation: Given the apparent demand from parents for upper basic education
that is accessible to the local population, it appears that the Government will inevitably
move forward with the program of opening new rural colleges. One can hope that the
lessons drawn from this project will be put to good use in this new phase.
B.    Social Assessment Study
29. The primary objective of this study, launched by the World Bank with MOE support,
is to evaluate the Government's innovative efforts to increase enrollment rates and improve
the quality of instruction in rural areas. The study will focus on the successes and failures of
the Rural Colleges Project, identify and analyze the causes underlying these successes and
failures, formulate the lessons to be drawn, and make recommendations for improving
similar activities in Morocco and North Africa in the future.
30.  The study has been entrusted to a team of Moroccan social scientists and educators.
The team's preliminary, generalized terms of reference are attached to this report, together
with the implementation schedule. Team members' names and detailed terms of reference
are also attached.
31.  The approach adopted by the team will be participatory and will take into account the
points of view of: (i) the Government, particularly MOE; (ii) local elected officials; (iii)
college teachers and administrators; (iv) parents of students; and (v) the students themselves.
The team will focus on the results obtained and their effects, as well as the chief
determinants of the situation observed at project completion.
32. Although the team will remain fully independent, team members will collaborate
closely with MOE experts. To this end, it is suggested that a coordinating committee (CC)
be set up within MOE, under the authority and jurisdiction of the Secretary-General, and
that it consist of two or three officials/experts/resource persons to serve as counterparts to
the study team. Among other things, the CC will comment on the terms of reference and the
preliminary and final product of the study team, provide the tearn with necessary
documentation, establish contacts and organize discussions with officials and resource
persons, both within and outside MOE, and take the necessary administrative and official
steps to facilitate the field work involved. The scope and success of the study will depend
heavily on the effectiveness of the coordinating committee.

PREFACE
1.   The Rural Upper Basic Education Development Project in Morocco was financed by
World Bank Loan No. 3295-MOR, initially in the amount of US$145 million, approved by
the Board of Executive Directors on February 26, 1991. Following three reductions,
totaling US$70 million, Loan No. 3295-MOR was scaled back to US$75 million, becoming
effective on March 19, 1992. The loan was closed on June 30, 1998, one year behind the
initial scheduled date.
2.   The African Developiment Bank helped finance the project with Loan No.
B/MRC/EDU/90/34, initially in the amount of UC 37 million (US$45 million equivalent),
which was subsequently reduced to UC 25 million.
3.   This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the project is based on documents
and tables prepared by the Divisions of the Directorate of Buildings and Infrastructure, on
information supplied by the DLirectorates of the Ministry of Education, aide-memroires filed
by Bank missions, and information culled from the basic project documents. This Report
also draws considerably on interviews with a number of Ministry of Education Directors
and with officials in charge of Ministry of Education regional offices and establishments
supported by this project.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.   This was the eighth education sector project in Morocco to be financed by the World
Bank, and the second to focus specifically on the development of education in rural areas.
The main objectives of the undertaking, initially anticipated to cost US$145 million, were:
a.    To improve school enrollment and attendance figures in upper basic education
among children in rural areas, and girls in particular. A total of 208 new colleges
were to be built and equipped, and 100 existing colleges rehabilitated, to achieve
this goal..  The project also contained provision for boarding and canteen
scholarships.
b.    To improve the quality of education through:
*  In-service teacher training;
*  Evaluation of the impact of certain variables on school enrollments and
attendance among girls in rural areas (ICV);
*  Strengthening of student achievement testing, with establishment of a National
Assessment Program (NAP);
-  Support for educational supervision, with purchase of vehicles for school-
inspector transportation.
2.  In the course of implementation, the project underwent two major modifications:
a.   The execution schedule had to be extended by one year;
b.   US$70 million, or approximately 48% of the initial loan amount, was cancelled.
3.   Difficulties encountered during project implementation:
a.   The Funded Projects Division, initially given the responsibility for managing the project, had
neither the human nor the material resources needed to carry out a project of this size;
b.   A series of structural changes in the Ministry of Education over the last four years
had repercussions on implementation of the project as originally conceived;
c.   Gaps in the original project design, cumbersome administrative procedures, budget
constraints, and problems with project supervision and contractors hampered
implementation.
4.   Project results as of June 30, 1998:
4.1  Measures to improve student enrollment and attendance
4.1.1 Construction and rehabilitation: Of the 208 rural colleges originally planned:
* 78 new colleges had been completed and were operating;
43



* 57 were still under constmction, 25 were to be ready by the start of the 1998/1999
school year, and 32 were to begin operating in 1999/2000;
* work on 18 had not yet started;
* 55 were excluded from World Bank financing following cancellation of US$45 million
of the loan;
* 39 existing colleges had been rehabilitated.
4.1.2 Equipment: T1eachers' materials and office supplies, and boarding and canteen
equipment, had been provided for 127 schools. Students' materials had been purchased
for 153 schools.
4.2  Measures to raise the quality of teaching
4.2.1 Evaluation of factors affecting school enrollments and attendance in rural areas
The findings from the study examining the impact of certain variables on school
enrollments and attendance in rural areas were finalized by the consulting firm responsible,
and endorsed by the monitoring committee. They are scheduled to be presented shortly to
the MOE Directors' Committee.

2.  Introduction
Aware of the importance of basic education in socioeconomic development, Morocco has
begun, to varying degrees, to launch educational reforms focused on both pedagogical and
institutional concerns and on curriculum development. At the same time, corrective
measures have also been devised and introduced. Some of these measures were worked
out within the framework of the 1985 reform, which aimed to expand access to basic
education by increasing enrollment capacity and extending the basic education network to
rural areas with the fewest school facilities. It is with that overall objective in view that
two rural education development projects were launched.
2.1  Rural Primary Education Project (1989-1996)
This project's key objectives were:
a.   To expand access to rural primary education by building classrooms and providing
equipment for them;
b.   To raise rural primary education enrollment rates, above all for girls, by improving
the distribution of teachers' materials and organizing sensitization campaigns;
c.   To enhance the quality of lower basic education through:
* Review of school curriculums;
Provision of teachers' materials;
* Improvement of leaming methods in multiple level classes;
* Strengthening of the role of school principals and upgrading of school health
care services;
d.   To enhance and strengthen Ministry of Education planning, monibring, and evaluation
capabilities;
e.   To rationalize the use of resources in lower basic education.
2.2 Rural Upper Basic Education Project
In order to complement the activities carried out under the first project, the Rural Upper
Basic Education Project pursued the four main objectives indicated below.

____________________________       Ischool inspectors).
4.   Scope and Structure oiF the Project
4.1 General points
In general, project pre-design studies do not seem to have delved very deep. The resulting gaps,
which delayed launchi:ng of the project, mainly concerned the following points:
a.     Certain players in the project -Ministry of Finance, Office of the Comptroller-General of
Expenditure Commitments, Treasury - were not all informed of the procedures required for
its implementation;
b.     Sample bidding documents were not prepared in advance and were not the product
of negotiations involving all parties to the project;
c.     The project management unit had not been given adequate human or material
resources.
4.2   Specific points related to college construction
The college construction program, supported by the World Bank, the African Development
Bank and the Government of Morocco, originally called for the building of 250 colleges
(208 financed by the World Bank and 42 by AfDB), in three tranches:
a. The first tranche comprised 65 colleges co-financed by the World Bank. The sites
selected have appropriate infrastructure facilities (access roads, water, electricity);
b. The second tranche comprised 85 colleges, with 43 of them co-financed by the World
Bank. In this case, the sites selected afford only limited infrastructure: facilities
(access roads, water, aiid electricity);
46



c. The third tranche comprised 100 schools co-financed by the World Bank, in difficult
areas where infrastructure is very limited.
This project component suffered from the following the design flaws:
4.2.1 Size of the program: The size of the program (250 colleges) posed monitoring
problems, caused mainly by the lack of adequate personnel and physical resources.
4.2.2 Centralized management: It proved impossible to guarantee regular and effective
monitoring from Rabat of numerous construction sites all over the country. That had a
negative impact in terms of delays.
4.2.3 Choice of locations and sites: Since the question of college locations and sites had
not been settled at the start, several projects were slow to get off the ground either because
the site was not available or because purchase had not been completed.
4.2.4 Types of site chosen: The sites chosen frequently came with one or more of the
following problems: terrain too hilly; soil poor; difficult to get to; lack of (or distance
from) infrastructure (power supply, water supply, sewerage). This resulted in cost
overruns, delays in implementation, and difficulties in ensuring power and water supply.
4.2.5 Initial cost estimates and end costs of buildings: Cost overruns were frequent, owing
to:
*  Lack of data on features of the terrain at building sites;
D Issue of calls for bids on the colleges making up the first tranche before geotechnical
studies were conducted;
* Award of contracts to the lowest bidders, which at a time of fierce competition meant
that contract prices were too low.
4.2.6 Technical supervision: The first tranche did not benefit from the services of a
supervisory office. This created a handicap as regards quality control of both studies and
construction work.
4.2.7 Architects' fees: Architects' fees were set at 3.5%, instead of the 5% usual on
government projects, with the result that drawings and the like were not properly finalized
and supervision of construction work in progress was not fully satisfactory.
5.   Project Implementation
5.1  Measures to improve school enrollment and attendance figures
5.1.1 Construction of rural colleges: The original plan was to build 208 colleges with
guaranteed World Bank co-financing, but the program was cut back following three loan
reductions totaling US$70 million. In addition, as a condition for extending the loan
closure date by one year, the Bank required that all new construction projects be canceled,
except those for which MOE had awarded contracts prior to May 23, 1997. For these
reasons, the construction program covered only 135 new colleges. Of these, 78 have been
47



built and put into service; another 57 are under construction, with 25 to be in operation by
the beginning of the 1998/1999 school year and 32 to come on stream in 1999/2000.
In the case of the 78 completed colleges, the situation as regards electricity and water connections is
as follows:
Electricity
45 colleges have electricity (40 are connected to their community grid, three have
generators, and two have solar power);
* 26 colleges are in the process of being connected;
* seven have not yet been connected.
Water
* 63 colleges have water supply (22 are connected to community mains, 29 have water
towers and wells, 12 have wells);
* seven are currently being connected;
* eight have not yet been connected.
As for sanitation, all new colleges already in operation use a septic tank and cesspits.
5.1.2 Rehabilitation of existing colleges: The idea here was to rehabilitate certain existing
establishments in order to increase enrollment capacity and provide a cleaner and healthier
educational environment. The US$5 million originally allocated for rehabilitation of 100
existing colleges was used up entirely in renovating 39 dilapidated establishments.
Renovation costs on the others were met from the national budget.
5.1.3 Rural school equipment: The equipment and supplies covered by Bank-financed
procurement contracts fell into four classes: classroom furniture and fittings; boarding and
canteen equipment; teachers' materials; textbooks.
5.1.3.1    Classroom furniture and fittings; boarding and canteen equipment, teachers'
materials: All competitive contracts for procurement of these necessities have been or are
being fulfilled. The following setbacks, however, affected the procurement of teachers'
materials:
a.   The Bank lodged an objection in the case of the first invitation to bid (No. 52
MADI/96, of April 26, 1996) just prior to the opening of bidding envelopes, on grounds
that: (i) suppliers should not have been required to deliver to MOE regional branch offices;
and (ii) there should have been a requirement that all customs formalities be handled by the
MOE and not by the supplier.
b.   Following correspondence and meetings with Bank representatives, Mr. Grees in
particular, a compromise was reached: Adjudication would be for sub-lots and not for
individual items. This would solve the transportation problem for suppliers, who might
otherwise be awarded a contract for a single item, for instance, and would then face
48



[transportation diseconomies]. In addition, suppliers were to receive 70% upon delivery to
the intermediary, in this case MOE's Equipment Division.
c.   Making a special exception in this case, the Bank agreed to suppliers handling
customs formalities. In future cases, responsibility for these formalities was to revert to the
authorities. However, it is evident that if this constraint is not lifted it will be difficult, if
not impossible, to obtain teachers' materials by competitive procurement.
5.1.3.2    Textbooks: The contracts to supply 127 colleges with textbooks were not
approved by the Comptroller-General.
5.1.4 Boarding and canteen scholarships: In order to encourage pupils from poor families,
especially girls, to enroll for upper basic education, the project included funding for student
boarding and canteen scholarships to the new colleges. As provided, these scholarships
were awarded to needy pupils at rural colleges, although the corresponding costs were
covered from MOE operating budgets.
5.2 Measures to improve the quality of instruction
5.2.1 In-service teacher training: The project contained provision for in-service teacher
training, as follows:
a. 1991-1993: Approximately 52,000 college teachers a year were to receive training in
preparation for the introduction of new curriculums and to equip them to make
effective use of teaching and laboratory materials;
b. Starting in 1994, first- and second-year teachers in the secondary schools were to
receive training in preparation for the introduction of new curriculums as they were
developed.
This component of upper basic education reform ran parallel with the introduction of new
curriculums and textbooks. For the three years beginning with the start of the 1990/1991
school year, MOE ran in-service training seminars for teachers in upper basic education.
This in-service training focused on basic education objectives, the new curriculums and
new guidelines for teachers, proper utilization of textbooks, and on modem methods of
measuring student achievement, classroom strategies, formulation of working objectives,
etc.
Training activities were organized as follows, on an annual basis:
a. Stage I: Workshops were organized at MOE headquarters for coordinator-inspectors
(from both the capital and the regions) in all subjects, the idea being to identify
teacher training needs and define the content of training seminars for each level of
education. Teaching guidelines were prepared for later use;
b. Stage II: Seminars were organized by the regional education authorities to bring
together regional coordinator-inspectors and zone inspectors, in order to prepare the
49



latter to support teachers at their own local level. Adjustments were made to adapt
materials and methods to specific local needs;
c. Stage III: Organization of local seminars, with zone inspectors providing instruction
and support for participating teachers. Some 4,500 upper basic education teachers
per year benefited from this training. Despite plans to the contrary at thle project
appraisal stage, these training activities were financed exclusively by the
Government.
5.2.2 Impact of certain variables on student enrollment and attendance figures (ICV):
Study of these variables focused on evaluating factors possibly affecting college
enrollments and attendance in rural areas, and aimed to:
a. analyze school attendance by children in rural areas, particularly girls, in upper basic
education;
b. develop a diversified upper basic education strategy that would allow specific local
needs to be tEken into account.
T'he subject addressed by the study was the interface between demand for schooling in rural
areas and supply of educational services.  Geographically, it encompassed all the mainly
rural areas targeted by the Upper Basic Education Development Project, areas from which
the sample of households surveyed had been selected.
The study was conducted in two main stages:
*    Stage 1: Analysis of school enrollment figures in the communities selected;
*    Stage 2: Formulation of a strategy to improve the existing situation.
Diagnosis of the existing situation focused on:
* Supply of and demand for upper basic education;
* Enrollment figures in upper basic education;
* Reasons for non-enrollment and parents' expectations;
* Analysis of the factors determining enrollment for this level of education.
Strategy formulation to promote school enrollment in rural areas focused on:
* Obstacles to enrollment in upper basic education in rural areas, and families'
expectations;
* Corrective measures and !global strategy, in light of the diagnosis made and families'
expectations;
* Essential elements of a strategy to promote enrollment in upper basic education.
A number of methodological instruments were employed, but notably a household survey
questionnaire and focus groups. A total of 32 provinces made up the sampling universe.
The survey, covering 1,000 households, used an experimental group and a control group.
50



Four reports were produced: a methodological report, a report on the diagnostic stage, a
strategy report, and a summary report.
Conducted by a Moroccan consulting firm, Business and Trade Center, the study was
launched in March 1996. Although completion was scheduled for March 1997, the process
was delayed because ratification of the diagnostic, strategy, and summary reports by the
MOE Directors' Committee took place only in September 1998. Consequently, the
findings from the study have not yet contributed to efforts to solve the problems facing the
education sector.
5.2.3 Strengthening of educational performance measurement: The project also provided
for introduction of a National Assessment Program (NAP), designed to assess the extent to
which the educational system is achieving its objectives. NAP findings were also expected
to provide a basis for future moves to enhance the system's performance.
While the Loan Agreement provided for limited consulting help with development of this
Program, the Ministry of Finance insisted on a competitive international bidding procedure
among consulting firms with recognized experience in the assessment field.
Following this procedure in 1993, Laval University was declared the successful bidder.
After a considerable delay, the Comptroller-General for Expenditure Commitments, in
March 1995, refused to approve the contract, on the grounds that an Order was in force
prohibiting the hiring of international consultants without government approval, although
the project documents stipulate that it is possible to do so. It took over six months for the
contract to receive the necessary waiver from the Deputy Minister of Administrative
Affairs. The impasse was resolved when a new MOE Directorate was created to oversee
performance assessment and the adoption of educational innovations: this entity opted for
updating the NAP, given the Ministry's objectives and new guidelines where the following
were concerned: (i) evaluation of students' academic achievement; (ii) evaluation of
educational units; and (iii) evaluation of its own organizational structure.
Following this exercise, a second call for tenders was issued in 1997. UNESCO obtained
the highest score, but, first, being an international organization, it turned down the contract,
and, second, the contract has, to this day, yet to be approved by the Comptroller-General
aof Expenditure Commitments. This official objected to the procurement of equipment
being included in a research contract. Given the importance of the NAP, the MOE intends
asking the World Bank to agree to finance it under Loan No. 4024-MOR.
5.2.4 Strengthening of school inspection capabilities: In order to enable inspectors to
perform their supervisory functions and conduct inspections at colleges in remote locations,
the project contained provision for the purchase of approximately 200 vehicles (an average
of four per MOE branch office). Of the 200 vehicles originally planned for, 46 were
purchased in the course of the 1996/1997 school year, although the cost was met from the
MOE budget.

7.  Bank Performance
To a large extent, the results achieved through the project can be ascribed to the flexibility
shown by the World Bank in responding to requests by the Borrower for specific
conditions to be modified (postponement of closing date, cancellation of part of the
project).
At the same time, the main weaknesses in the World Bank's performance had to do
with the following:
a. The Bank appears not to have gone far enough at project appraisal in its examnination of
the different aspects of the situation;
b. At the appropriate moment, the Bank should have insisted that the unit in charge of
managing the project be strengthened, specifying the human and material resources
required;
c. High turnover among the Bank staff assigned to the project had an adverse impact on
project implementation;
d. A lack of flexibility in Bank-mandated procedures;
e. Certain problems should have been solved during supervision missions;
f. Lack of coordination between the World Bank and the African Development Bank
regarding the project implementation process. Each donor went its own way
52



without at any point seeking to discuss what was needed to ensure better
implementation.
8.   Borrower Performance
The Borrower's mediocre performance in the project implementation process can be traced
to several factors:
a. Pre-project preparation, for which MOE was responsible, was less than satisfactory;
b. The MOE officials responsible failed to prepare the project in depth, given their
attempts, from the start, to negotiate the package with all parties involved in the
project cycle (Ministry of Finance, CGED, Treasury, etc.);
c. Those responsible failed to reflect on the Ministry's ability to handle a project of this
size. The Funded Projects Division, initially given the responsibility for its
management, had neither the required skills or experience to administer such a
project, which called not only for human resources but also logistical resources
(vehicles, means of communication, etc.);
d. Project implementation was adversely affected by organizational instability, a result of
high turnover among project officials.
9.   Conclusions and Recommendations
The Rural Upper Basic Education Development Project contributed to an increase in the
enrollment capacity of the Moroccan educational system by developing new school
infrastructure. The findings of the study - launched during the project - to assess the
impact of certain variables on school enrollment and attendance in rural areas should be
used to solve the problems that account for the weakness of the teaching personnel who
staff rural schools.
Finally, the experience gained in implementing this project highlights the need to
improve the performance of MOE project management staff. Where the donor is
concerned, better project  preparation at the appraisal stage, together with closer
supervision, will mean more effective execution of project components.
