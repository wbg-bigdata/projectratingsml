A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
Since 1994, significant progress has been made in Georgia toward establishment of a coherent legal
framework supportive of a market economy. Many important new laws and regulations have been
adopted. However, Georgia still faces the great challenge of implementing the necessary reforms to make
these changes part of its institutional and legal culture. To that end, Georgia has embarked upon a
comprehensive judicial reform program.
The objective of this project is to assist in the development of an independent and professional judiciary,
committed to high standards of judicial ethics and capable of efficient, effective dispute resolution. The
project supports key interventions to assist in the establishment of the judiciary as an independent third
branch of the Government. During the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussions in 1997, the
Government of Georgia requested IDA to assist in the further definition and implementation of its judicial
reform program. The proposed project responds to this request.
The success of the project will be assessed on the extent to which the following key performance
indicators are achieved:
(a) degree to which the new court administration system has been established. This entails the
establishment of the Court Administrative Committee of General Courts (as the rule-making
body) and the Coordinating Council on the Conference of Judges (as the executive organ of court
administration); it also involves the effective participation of sitting judges in the court
administration system;
(b) introduction of a new case management system including establishment of a chancellery
responsible for filing cases in the first and second instance courts, thereby providing adequate
information to the public on the status of pending court cases;
(c) improved public awareness of how the judicial system works, including better understanding
and perception of the reform program; awareness of their individual rights; increased willingness
of the judiciary to interface with the public; improved coverage of legal and judicial issues by the
media; and better understanding of alternative dispute resolution; and
(d) increased trust in the judicial system by actual and potential users, including the business and
legal communities.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17000-GE Date of latest CAS discussion: October 21, 1997
The Bank Group's strategy in Georgia for the period 1998-2000 supports the Government's development
agenda with the following four themes: (i) strengthening public finance; (ii) deepening and diversifying
sources of growth; (iii) protecting the environment; and (iv) reducing poverty. The proposed project
would assist the Government's development agenda with respect to the theme of "deepening and
diversifying sources of growth" in providing critical assistance needed for the establishment of the rule of
law. The judicial reform program of the Government will result in improved investor confidence, thus
facilitating economic growth by strengthening the enabling environment for private sector development.
As demonstrated in the World Development Report 1997. The State in a Changing World entrepreneurs
are unlikely to invest without an adequate legal and institutional framework for the protection and



Page 3
enforcement of contractual and property rights. Therefore the project is a crucial element needed for the
growth of the private sector. The development of the judiciary as an indepenidenit branch of government is
essential not only to provide for increased legal certainty but constitutes the foundation of the
Government's program to fight corruption.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Legacy of the Past
At independence from the Soviet Union, Georgia inherited a judiciary subordinate to the executive
branch, neither truly independent nor a respected venue for resolving disputes. The Procuracy and the
Ministry of Justice maintained administrative control over the judiciary. Judges received poor
remuneration, and held little if any prestige. For these reasons, the judiciary was staffed with individuals
who were often unwilling or incapable of providing independent, professional judicial decisions'
A baseline study on public awareness and the rule of law in Georgia was prepared under the ongoing
SATAC II project. Some of the key findings of the study indicate mistrust of the current legal system by
the majority of the public. Public perception is that the legal system in Georgia does not currently provide
a forum for seeking and receiving justice, and that the judicial system is corrupt.
Due to inadequate maintenance in the last decade, court buildings are generally run down and are in need
of rehabilitation. Many courthouses lack basic sanitary facilities, heating and reliable electric supply. The
situation is exacerbated by the fact that many courthouses share space with other agencies, such as the
Procuracy and even the police.
The Judicial Reform Agenda
The enactment of the Constitution of Georgia on August 24, 1995, in particular provisions of Chapter 5
dealing with the judiciary, was a crucial first step toward establishing the new Georgian judiciary. By
adopting the Law on the Judiciary in June 1997, the Georgian Parliament took the next important step
toward the establishment of an independent, corruption-free judiciary staffed with competent judges. It
contains a broad reform agenda, focusing on:
(i) unifying the court system by eliminating the Arbitrazh and Military Courts so that all
jurisdiction over criminal, administrative and civil cases rests with the Courts of General
Jurisdiction;
(ii) establishing an appellate jurisdiction in the second instance courts to replace the previous
"cassation" procedures;
(iii) establishment of the Council of Justice (COJ) and transfer of court administration support
services from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to the newly created Department of Logistical
Support (DLS);
(iv) establishment of a framework for qualification examinations of judges with the expectation
that the new Georgian judiciary would consist of judges of highi professional standards and
personal integrity; and
(v) provision of salaries for judges at a level at least equal to that of a member of Parliament.

Georgia, Judicial Assessment Report No. 17356-GE.



Page 4
The COJ, effectively established in October 1997, has 12 members: the President and the Parliament
appoint four members each; the Chairman of the Supreme Court appoints one member; the Chairmen of
the Supreme Court of Georgia and the High Courts of Adjara and Abkhazia are ex officio members. The
Council has been effective in leading the transformation process of the Georgian judiciary. Day-to-day
tasks of the Council are carried out by its Secretariat, headed by a full time member of the Council.
The Qualification and Examination Commission established by the COJ organizes and executes
qualification examinations for judges. The first round of judges' examinations was carried out in May
1998. There have been four rounds of qualification examinations passed by a total of 252 individuals.
The transparency and faimess of the judicial qualification examinations -- professionally prepared and
anonymously evaluated -- have been generally recognized in Georgia and abroad.
Disciplinary Procedures and Code of Ethics for the Judiciary
With the participation of judges, the COJ has prepared a statement on the mission, vision, values and
goals of the judiciary. This statement will be disseminated as an important part of the envisioned public
information effort.
Development of effective disciplinary procedures and a code of ethics for judges are essential components
of the judicial reform program. With donor assistance, the Government has organ1ized workshops in order
to review draft versions of the disciplinary procedure and code of ethics. The new Code of Ethics and a
new Disciplinary Procedures Code have been prepared. The former will be further reviewed and adopted
during the first meeting of the Conference of Judges, the assembly of Georgian judges to be convened
pursuant to the Law on the Judiciary. The Disciplinary Procedures Code is expected to be enacted before
the end of June 1999.
Law on the Bar Association
Georgia has not decided yet upon the future organization of the legal profession. Currently, the Collegium
of Lawyers represents lawyers admitted to the Bar during the Soviet era, and the Georgian Young
Lawyers Association (GYLA) represents the mostly younger generation of reform-minded lawyers. The
Georgian authorities, in particular the Minister of Justice, are aware of the need to define the framework
for establishment of a Bar Association, as well as a process for licensing of lawyers and for disciplinary
matters. Currently the Ministry of Justice is receiving technical assistance from other donors (GTZ and
USAID through ABA-CEELI) for the preparation of a draft law on the Bar Association. The future Bar
Association will be a crucial watchdog on the independence of the judiciary. It will contribute to the
public education effort together with the Conference of Judges. It is expected that the Law on the Bar
Association will be presented to the Parliament for enactment in the first half of year 2000.
Alternative Dispute Resolution
In Georgia, arbitration is not currently used to resolve disputes due to business community and
practitioners' inexperience and unfamiliarity with its usefulness. The legislative framework for arbitration
needs improvement. There are initiatives underway by the EU-TACIS funded GEPLAC program and
GTZ to assist in the preparation of a new arbitration law based on the UNCITRAL model. Two arbitration
panels have already been set up and the first arbitration case was heard in early 1999. Recently, a law was
adopted to regulate enforcement of foreign judgments in Georgia. The new Law on Arbitration has been
submitted to the Parliament in May and is expected to be enacted before the end of June 1999.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Court Administration
The new court administration system will need to be accountable, responsible and responsive. The proper
definition of legislative and administrative functions and structures is key for the development of an
efficient and independent judiciary. The legal framework for the judiciary does not yet provide for an
adequate court administration structure. Recently, the Parliament has enacted the Law on the Supreme
Court and amended to the Law on the Judiciary to provide for a new court administration structure.
Such legislative framework takes the following principles into consideration:
* The Conference of Judges will be the supreme organ of the new judiciary.
* The self-governing judiciary will require two additional bodies: one mandated with rule making and
the second with the executive function.
(i) The Court Administration Committee will carry out the rule-making function within the
judiciary. The Chief Justice will select a number of judges from the Supreme Court, and the
Conference of Judges will elect a number of judges of the first and second instance courts, to
serve together with the Chairmen of the Appellate Courts on the Court Administration
Committee. The Chief Justice will be the Chairman of the Court Administration Committee.
(ii) The Coordinating Council of the Conference of Judges will carry out the executive function.
It should be comprised of the managing judges (see below), the Director of the DLS, and one
judge appointed by each of the Chairmen of the Appellate Courts. The Chairman of the Supreme
Court or an individual appointed by the Chairman of the Supreme Court will serve as Chairperson
of the Coordinating Council together with a Deputy-Chairman elected by the Conference of
Judges.
e  The Department for Logistical Support is expected to serve as the Secretariat of the Coordinating
Council.
*  In each region and two sub-regions, the courts with the biggest caseload and number of assigned
judges will serve as a District Court with Demonstration and Administrative Function (DCDA). Also
in each such region and sub-region, a panel of three judges will be charged with court administration
matters for the region. One judge on the panel will be appointed Managing Judge. He/she will also
serve as a member of the Coordinating Council.
Judicial Training
The Georgian authorities recognize that judicial training must be one of the cornerstones of the judicial
reform program. In the short term, it is critical for the new cadre of judges to receive proper training
before assuming their judicial responsibilities. The Law on the Judiciary mandates a two-month training
program for newly appointed judges. For the longer term, it is important to institutionalize judicial
training and develop modem teaching tools and methodologies to make judicial education effective and
relevant for judges. The donor community was very pleased by the strategic decision of the Government
to create a new entity, the Judicial Training Center (JTC), to carry out judicial training, demonstrating its
commitment to break with the legacy of the past.
The Georgian authorities, together with their NGO partners, established the Judicial Training Center of
Georgia in June 1998. The Center is a foundation set up by a group representing state agencies (MOJ,



Page 6
Supreme Court, COJ, Tbilisi State University and the Institute of Law of the Academy of Science) and
non-state agencies (Conference of Judges, Young Lawyers Association and the Notary Chamber of
Georgia). EU-TACIS will assist the Center with a grant of ECU I million.
Public Information/Education
Georgia's legal and judicial reform is at a critical juncture. While an ambitious reform program is being
designed, the baseline study carried out under SATAC II shows that there is a widespread public mistrust
of the judiciary, law enforcement agencies and the Government at large. The fact that the courts are
perceived as corrupt by a majority of the population has created a serious gap between the judiciary and
the public it is meant to serve.
Despite the judiciary's negative image and lack of public trust, a majority of the population believes in the
importance of the rule of law as the basis for a democratic society and a market economy. This presents
an opportunity to build support for an independent, competent and efficient judiciary free of corruption,
through a comprehensive public education/information effort. In turn, a public that is better informed and
engaged with the system will be better able to demand the high standards it deserves. The Government
and the legal community in Georgia understand this and are ready to take steps to inform and educate the
public about their legal rights and how the judicial system functions, and to involve the public in judicial
reform.
Because of the cynicism of the public about state agencies and the failure of the public education effort in
the legal and judicial reform area so far, the Government agreed that public education activities under this
project should be carried out by an independent entity staffed by experts. The Association for Legal and
Judicial Public Education (ALPE) will be composed of Government and NGO associates (Open Society
Institute, Georgian Young Lawyers Association, Conference of Judges).
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown)
(see Table on the following page):
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project will provide assistance in the implementation of the judicial reforn program and strengthen
the institutional capacities of the MOJ, DLS, ALPE and the Department for the Enforcement of Court
Decisions.
3. Benefits and target population:
The expected result and benefit will be to promote an environment conducive to the establishment of the
rule of law. As demonstrated by the findings of the baseline study, the general view in Georgia is that the
rule of law does not exist. There is widespread mistrust of the judiciary. Judges are perceived as corrupt
and incompetent. These represent substantial obstacles to economic activity and investment. The project
will contribute to the radical reform of the judicial system. The entire population of Georgia, and in
particular the business community and foreign investors, will benefit from the presence of an independent
and competent judicial system, leading to the enforcement of more secure property rights and contractual
obligations.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Management and Coordination
The overall policy coordination for the project will be carried out by the Council of Justice. A project
coordinator will act as the liaison between the implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Justice, the
Association for Legal and Judicial Public Education, the Department for Logistical Support, and the
Department for the Enforcement of Court Decisions), the Bank and the already established Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). The coordinator will follow the preparation and execution of all project
activities. He/she will need to receive limited procurement and disbursement support from the PIU
located within the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations. The PIU was set up under the
Institution Building Credit (IBC) in 1994 and has implemented the IBC (closed June 1998), SATAC I
(closed December 1998) and SATAC II, and the ongoing IDF Grants for Public Procurement and the
Georgia Investment Center. Although the PIU staff have excellent skills in the areas of consultant
contracting and procurement of goods, they will need to receive some training in civil works and financial
management in order to manage this project.
Project Operational Manual (POM)
A POM is being prepared to facilitate the management and implementation of the project. The POM
includes: (i) detailed project objectives and description; (ii) key implementation issues and strategies; (iii)
summary of procedures for monitoring project implementation; (iv) guidelines for processing withdrawal
applications under the Credit; (v) methods of procurement to be followed as per the Procurement
Schedule in the Credit Agreement; (vi) guidelines for the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and
overall project funds; (vii) procedures for using the Special Account, including those for replenishment;
(viii) sample bidding documents and contracts for national shopping of civil works; and (ix) financial
management. Assurances were received at Negotiations that the POM would be completed and
maintained in a form satisfactory to IDA.
S. Disbursement Mechanisms.
The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three-and-a-half years. The
disbursement profile for the project has been based on experience gained during SATAC I and SATAC II.
The project has been designed within the capacity of the PIU to execute over a three-and-a-half-year
period. The Closing Date will be June 30, 2003.
By project effectiveness, an acceptable financial management system (FMS) will have been put in place.
Disbursements will begin using traditional disbursement mechanisms -- Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs), reimbursements, direct payment, etc. After the PIU has gained experience with the FMS and
reporting under project management reports (PMRs), and provided that an improved FMS is reviewed
and found satisfactory by the Bank, the project could move to PMR-based disbursements. All
disbursements against contracts for goods exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, and services and training
for consulting firms valued at $100,000 or more, and for individual consultants valued at $50,000 more
will be fully documented. This documentation will be made available for the required audit as well as to
the Bank supervision mission, and will be retained by the PIU for at least one year after receipt by the
Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. The processing,
disbursement and monitoring of the allocations of the proceeds of the IDA Credit and Borrower
counterpart financing will be managed by the PIU in coordination and consultation with the Ministry of
Finance.
Special Accounts
In order to facilitate Credit disbursements, the Government of Georgia will establish a Special Account in
a major commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover IDA's share of



Page 9
expenditures. The Authorized A]location for the Special Account will be US$1.1 million. During the
early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account is limited to US$0.4 million.
However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached US$ 2 million, the initial
allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$ 1.1 million by submitting the relevant
Application for Withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted
monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. The SA
should be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
6. Finance, Accounting and Auditing Arrangements:
The PIU will be responsible for its own financial management of the project. The Financial and
Accounting Officer in the PIU will design a Project and Financial Management Information System
(MIS) which will include, inter alia, an accounting and control module with the capability to record and
retrieve, in a timely manner, all financial transactions under the project. The MIS will comply with
internationally accepted standards and will: (i) reliably record and report all assets, liabilities, and
financial transactions of the project; and (ii) provide reliable financial information for managing and
monitoring project activities. The accounting module will have a Chart of Accounts reflecting the sources
of funds and broken down into different types of expenditures by type and component. It will provide
information on the receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports comparing
budget with actual expenditures at any time. The system will be capable of providing financial data to
measure performance when linked to the outputs of the project. The PIU will maintain consolidated
accounts and will ensure appropriate accounting of the funds provided. The PIU will prepare PMRs on a
quarterly basis. These reports will include financial statements, project progress reports and procurement
management reports. The PMR will be in a format discussed during Negotiations and will follow
examples given in the Bank's LACI Implementation Handbook. The Special Account will be audited in
accordance with Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World
Bank (March 1982) and the Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook, 1995. The audit
reports will be of such scope and details as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion
by an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or
are due to be made from the credit, and SOEs which will be included in the audit reports accompanying
the financial statements. The audited financial statements of the Special Account, and SOEs of the
preceding fiscal year, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified
SOEs, will be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection.
Given that the proposed project supports the key measures identified for 3 1/2 years, and the judicial
reform process likely need additional financing beyond the project implementation period, an Adaptable
Program Loan was considered. However, given the incipient stage of the reform program and some of the
entities charged with its implementation, such as the new court administration structure, the DLS, the JTC
and ALPE, it was considered too difficult to develop a longer-term development program beyond this
project implementation period.
2. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design.
Although the Bank Group has somewhat limited experience in the area of judicial reform, projects
implemented to date have shown the importance of ownership and commitment at the highest level of
government and among counterparts. The preparation of the Judicial Assessment report and its
subsequent discussion have been conducted not only with representatives of the Council of Justice but
also many other stakeholders, including representatives of the Supreme Court, active judges, and
representatives of the Georgian Young Lawyers Association and human rights organizations. The



Page 10
components of the proposed project have been designed to support a set of priority measures which are
commonly agreed upon. Furthermore, the comprehensive judicial reform program is fully supported by
the political leadership of both the administrative and the legislative branches of the Government.
3. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing
and planned) (see Table on the following page):
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The judicial reform program in Georgia is moving forward with good progress to date. The track record
of the Government is the best indication of strong ownership. The COJ has assLimed control of the
judicial reform process and has shown its commitment to the envisaged project activities. Recently, the
Ministry of Justice has taken new initiatives to play a leading role in the legal reform process in Georgia.
The Minister of Justice fully supports the activities financed by the project.
With the assistance of experts financed under SATAC II, the COJ prepared a inaster plan for the future
court administration and case management system. This master plan constitutes the results of the work of
six work groups, composed of representatives of the COJ, DLS, and the judiciary on1 the following topics:
(i) a vision statement; (ii) the administrative structure of the judiciary; (iii) case-management procedures
of the judiciary; (iv) space planning; (v) technological support to the courts of general jurisdiction; and
(vi) budget and finance of the judiciary and the court of appeals.
In addition to the commitment of the Parliament of Georgia, the COJ, the MOJ and the cadre of new
judges to the objectives of the judicial reform  program,  President Shevardniadze has repeatedly
emphasized that judicial reform is an essential step in the nation-building effort of Georgia and its future
economic development.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project.
The Bank's support is critical, not only for the fundamental reason that a modern democratic state with a
market economy requires a judiciary that is competent, independent of the other branches of government
and trusted by all parties, but also to consolidate parallel initiatives being undertakeni in anti-corruption
and civil service reform.
In mid-1997 the Georgian government asked the Bank to take the lead in coordinating the donor agencies
involved in assistance to the judicial sector. The Judicial Assessment report preparation, review and
discussion with the Government and the donor community helped define respective areas of intervention,
and unified donor support within a consistent framework.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis
The Association has carried out an analysis of the main bottlenecks in the Georgian judicial system. It is
not considered to be a trustworthy venue for dispute resolution. It is lacking in legal education, is
ineffective and prone to corruption. The study on public awareness and opinion of the judiciary reconfirm
such analysis. Preliminary estimates indicate that the return of the investments associated with the reform
measures far exceed the cost thereof. This is also confirmed by the findings set forth in the World Bank's
1997 World Development Report, The State in a Changing World.

2. Financial:
The recurrent costs to maintain and sustain the investments of the project will need to be supported by
substantially increased budget allocation and improved budget execution for the benefit of the judiciary.
The Government will develop a new mechanism to finance recurrent costs of the judiciary.
3. Technical:
There are proven methods to improve court administration and record keeping. Suggested technologies
have been evaluated and found viable.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies: MOJ, DLS, Department for Enforcement of Court Decisions, JTC, ALPE
b. Project management: Overall policy coordination by COJ, Project Coordinator located in the DLS,
working closely with the already established PIU located within the Ministry of Trade and Foreign
Economic Relations and the executing agencies.
5. Social:
There is a strong popular awareness of and demand for judicial reform. The project responds to such
need. While the project design will have an overall beneficial effect on social issues, USAID will assist in
developing a system of legal aide and legal support for the indigent population. In collaboration with
USAID, this aspect will be closely monitored during project execution.
6 Environmental assessment.  Environmental Category     [ I A   [XI B   [I C
Justification/Rationale for category rating: the physical infrastructure rehabilitation component (see Annex
2 - Component B) will include civil works; environmental issues have been identified and mitigation
measures described.
7. Participatory approach.
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The views and opinions of individuals who had recent experience with cases in the judicial system,
businesspersons, lawyers and human rights organizations, were sought during the preparation of the
Judicial Assessment report. Their views contributed to the recommendations of the report and the design
of the proposed project.
The public information/education program is designed to inform the public and provide for a feedback
function.
b. Other key stakeholders:
The Georgian Young Lawyers Association, human rights NGOs, judges and members of academia were
consulted and contributed to the project design.
The public information/education component will actively involve key stakeholders.
F: Sustainability and Risks
Sustainability
The process of project development has been largely collaborative and benefited from extensive
participation. The high degree of consensus in Georgia on the need for judicial reform will be important
for the sustainability of the reform process.



Page 13
Careful attention will need to be paid to Government budgetary support during and beyond the
implementation stage of the project. Adequate funding and procedures for the judicial reform program in
general, and in particular for operating costs (including salaries of judges and funds for operation and
maintenance of judicial infrastructure), should be ensured.
Other key issues for sustainability of interventions contemplated under the project include: (i) continued
political and public support for legal and judicial reform through a long-term program; (ii) systems to
hold judges accountable to the public they serve; and (iii) an incentive system to reward effective,
continued reform and good performance by the judges.
There is a risk related to the implementation arrangements for the rehabilitation works of the DCDAs.
This is the first project involving works in eight different regions or sub-regions and the DLS does not
have an established track record in the carrying out of works in the regions. The capacity of the Works
Department of the DLS seems to be adequate to the challenge but careful monitoring will be required.

Georgia Judicial Reform Project
Project Description
Component A. Court Administration and Case Management- US$ 3.06 million
Background
The legacy of the past of the Georgian judiciary is that the court administration function was never
designed to serve an independent judiciary, but to control the judicial system. With the adoption of the
Law on the Judiciary, the court administration responsibility was taken from the Ministry of Justice. The
DLS was established, with responsibilities limited to support services and management of the physical
infrastructure and material base of the judiciary. The Law on the Supreme Court and the Law on the
Judiciary have been amended to establish the new structures outlined in Section B.3 of this report.
Furthermore, the judiciary has never established modern case management procedures. Given that a new
Civil Procedures Code came into effect in the Fall of 1998, the judiciary will need to establish a system of
standard-setting and monitoring of case flows, homogenizing of court forms and case flow procedures.
With the assistance of experts financed under SATAC 11, two Georgian teams consisting of
representatives of the Council of Justice, judges and personnel of the DLS prepared outlines for a new
case management system and a new court administration system.
Objectives of the Component:
The objectives of this component are to assist the judiciary in (i) the establishment of a court
administration system under the leadership of bodies with adequate representation of the three instances
of the court system; (ii) implementation of a modem computerized system of case management; and (iii)
provision of a system for audio recording of court proceedings to ensure the integrity of court protocols.
Sub-component Al. Court Administration
Improvements needed
Georgia requires a decentralized system of court administration and management. There are 84 individual
courts of first instance, a number too large for each court to manage itself efficiently. Nor could all the
courts of first instance be managed properly from Tbilisi. Decentralization into administrative districts of
manageable size offers the best solution. The administrative districts require skilled, managing judges
and professional court administrators to lead them. These leaders exercise responsibility for all court
management affairs within their district, including responsibility for assuring quality court performance,
the achievement of goals and standards, and the implementation of uniform court programs. They are also
responsible for budget, personnel, space and facilities, and other administrative functions.
Specific activities to be financed
The project will develop and carry out a training program for managing judges and court administrators,
including workshops and study tours. The DLS, working in conjunction with the Coordinating Council of
the Conference of Judges will receive technical assistance with respect to the implementation of the new
court administration systems.



Page 18
Sub-component A2. Case Management
Improvements needed
The core function of courts is the management of cases. Case management includes the following:
* Access Management: to assure that the courts are available to the public at affordable costs and under
circumstances that encourage their use;
* Case Flow Management: to assure expeditious movement of cases from filing to disposition with
each case receiving individual attention with sensible cost parameters;
*  Caseload Management: to assure that dispositions are equal to filings on a yearly basis to avoid
backlog and congestion. Judicial productivity and maintaining an appropriately sized judiciary are the
keys to case load management;
*  Quality Management: to assure that judicial performance and service standards are established and
met. Judicial performance reviews and quality service programs are two cutting edge programs in
court administration; and
 Settlement of cases: to provide a mechanism for settlement of disputes that should be recognized as
an effective alternative to litigation.
Different case management systems are required for appellate courts and for courts of first instance. Also
different types of cases at the trial court level require unique case management systems.
Specif c activities to be financed
The project will provide technical assistance and training for the development and implementation of an
effective case management and court administration system. The DLS, working in conjunction with the
Coordinating Council of the Conference of Judges, will receive technical assistance with respect to the
implementation of the new case management and court administration procedures. The project will also
assist in the organization of workshops in Georgia to facilitate contacts between the Georgian judiciary
and representatives of developed judicial systems.
Sub-component A3. Case Processing/Record Keeping
Improvements needed
The integrity of court records is essential to public confidence in the courts. Neither case processing nor
record keeping is well developed in Georgia. This aspect of court administration includes:
* Receipt, registration and assignment of cases;
* Recording and accounting for court fees;
 Accepting court papers for filing;
* Maintaining a log of each court action and each paper filed with the court;
* Guarding the integrity of pending cases and managing court records so they are readily accessible'for
inspection by the public; and
* Managing court archives.



Page 19
In Georgia, once cases are registered they are turned over to individual judges until disposition. Judges
handle clerical tasks that should be the responsibility of Chancery departments. As a result, judges are less
productive than they could be. Further, the absence of a central repository for pending cases impedes
access to important public information and thus undermines public confidence in the courts. The lack of
modem equipment also handicaps court clerical operations. Substantial improvements in court
administration can be achieved through the expansion of responsibilities and modernization of Chancery
departments in Georgia.
Specific activities to be financed
The project will provide technical assistance and training to assist in the establishment of an effective case
processing and record keeping system.
Sub-component A4. Automation
Improvements needed
Automation is critical to improved court management. Computerization will improve the following court
operations:
-  word processing for preparation ofjudicial opinions;
-  case processing for case indexing, location of files, and preparation of forms:
*  case management for maintaining the flow of work through the courts, and statistical data collection
and analysis;
*  communications for email communications among judges and court employees;
-  judicial research for collection and accessing judicial opinions and laws; and
-  public information to provide access to court information promulgated by the judiciary through a web
site.
The working group papers on supplying technology to common law courts set out a phased approach for
the computerization of the courts of first and second instance. Given the lack of the most basic technology
in the court system at this time, the working group concluded that computerization of the court system is
necessary in order to carry out the radical changes in the organizational framework of the judiciary. In
addition, the introduction of the new case management system is predicated upon computerization.
Specific activities to be financed
The project will provide computerization for the Supreme Court, the Appellate Courts in Tbilisi, Kutaisi
and Adjara and eight District Courts with Demonstration and Administrative Functions (DCDAs).
Furthermore, the project will provide one PC, printer and UPS package and, if needed, generators for each
of the other courts of general jurisdiction. In the first phase, networks will be established within the
Appellate Courts and DCDAs only. In the second phase, all courts will be linked within the network.
The successful implementation of the computerization program will depend on adequate training of court
personnel. A training program has been designed and will be included in the terms of the computer
acquisition and installation contract.



Page 20
Sub-component A5. Court Reporting
Improvements needed
Proceedings in the courtroom are now taken down in long hand, which is inefficient, time consuming, and
leads to inaccurate, incomplete and illegible reporting. Audio recording overcomes these problems, and
brings integrity to court reporting. Recording will also help the Appellate Courts become more efficient
and effective, because they will be able to conduct appeals by reviewing the court record instead of being
required to conduct re-trials of cases.
The working group responsible for case management, in collaboration with the working group responsible
for technology, concluded that the installation of audio recording equipment in the courts is essential to
provide comprehensive records of the court proceedings. Under SATAC 11, two pieces of audio recording
equipment were financed on a pilot basis for the Tbilisi and Kutaisi Appellate Courts.
Specific activities to be financed
Based on an assessment of the experience of the pilot with audio equipment, the project will provide
audio recording machines for all judges.
Component B. Infrastructure Rehabilitation - US$ 6.99 million
Background
Due to lack of maintenance during the last decade and to the fact that the judicial system was not a top
priority under the earlier regime, court buildings in Georgia are generally, and in many cases seriously,
deteriorated. Basic physical rehabilitation is essential simply for most courts to function. Many lack
sanitary facilities, heating and functioning electrical systems. In addition, a great number of court houses
share space with the police and prosecutor functions, a legacy of the past and one of the constraints on
judicial independence that the reform program seeks to end. Existing court design supports the old system
and physical planning adjustments are needed to reflect the needs of new judicial procedures being
introduced by reform.
Objectives of the Component
The objective of the component is a system of court infrastructure wherein key elements reflect the new
procedures of an independent and better functioning judiciary, with an improved public perception of the
judicial system. This improvement in public perception is directly related to physical condition,
architectural design, and facilities management and maintenance.
Improvements needed
The rehabilitation of selected court facilities essential to reform is necessary to put reform into practice.
New planning standards and programmatic instructions for physical design are essential to a physical
infrastructure which supports institutional reform. Such standards are being developed, and will be ready
for implementation before credit effectiveness.
The component will include the adaptation and rehabilitation (or completion in some cases) of up to
eleven court buildings, facilities for the Judicial Training Center, offices for tlle Department of
Logistical Services (DLS), and minor works for the Ministry of Justice building.



Page 21
Sub-component B1. Court construction and rehabilitation
Court building construction and rehabilitation will include the following:
*  Construction completion of a building to house the new Tbilisi Appellate Court, and
rehabilitation of an existing court building for the new Kutaisi Appellate Court.
*  Rehabilitation of District Courts with Demonstration and Administrative Function
(DCDAs) in:
-  Tbilisi
-  Batumi
-  Telavi
-  Rustavi
-  Zugdidi
-  Gori
-  Akhaltsikhe
-  Poti
Development of Planning Standards. Planning standards and programmatic instructions as a basis for
physical design are essential to the success of the infrastructure rehabilitation component to enable reform
concepts to be put into practice. With SATAC II support, DLS has made a comparative analysis of
international and FSU judicial space-planning standards, and has applied them to the list of courts now
functioning in Georgia. With this background, DLS developed proposed Georgian standards. Refinements
that match these standards to feasible investments are being developed in a second phase, and will be
ready prior to credit effectiveness. The standards will be derived from a clear set of programmatic
instructions based on the new Georgian concepts ofjudicial reform.
The standards development activity will produce prototype schematic plans for the various court types
expected in the new Georgian system. This will constitute a "schematic design manual" that can be
revised as experience is gained in the use of the courts. It will serve the judicial system in the long term as
well, as the initial investments that are now urgently needed to put the new system into operation. The
manual will indicate functional relationships, basic design guidelines and area requirements. It is being
developed by DLS in a process organized by international court design experts. A workshop has been
organized to bring together stakeholders in the reform process (attorneys, judges, the Georgian judicial
reform leadership, the DLS, facilities management/operations staff and local architects) to develop clear
programmatic instructions for the translation of judicial reform concepts into physical form.
Other Civil Works Sub-components
Judicial Training Center. Under the project's Judicial Training component, the Bank will finance
necessary minor repairs to the proposed training center at Tskaltubo and rehabilitation of damaged space
in the Ministry of Justice building in order to meet the project's training needs. Work in Tskaltubo will be
limited to building envelope repair (roof and windows), sanitary facilitates, and the renovation of the
library and auditorium which have been damaged by water infiltration.
DLS offices. The DLS is a key implementing entity in the judicial reform program, and will require office
facilities. DLS will be responsible for the court system's material support and facilities management.
Construction was begun on an addition to the Supreme Court building to house the DLS but stopped after
completion of the structural frame for budget reasons. The credit will finance the basic completion of this
new office space.



Page 22
Ministry of Justice Building. The Ministry of Justice building is an historic structure dating from the
nineteenth century and has a prominent location on Tbilisi's main downtown avenue. Its deteriorated
physical condition is a source of discomfort for Government because of the poor working environment it
provides for Ministry employees, and the public image it presents at a time when the justice system is
being reformed. Improving its physical condition will play a role in raising the confidence of the public
and of MOJ employees in the judicial reform process, and contribute to the cultural heritage preservation
process in Georgia which is strongly backed by the President and the population at large. Fire damage
caused by faulty wiring has been largely repaired by the Ministry. Repairs to leaking underground water
pipes have been made by municipal authorities, and the foundation, which had been settling and causing
above-grade cracks, is now stable. Certification to this effect has been obtained from an independent
structural engineering authority. The credit will be used for limited above-ground rehabilitation needs,
including roof and fa,ade repair, new electrical wiring, plumbing and sanitary facilities repairs, and
selected interior works such as electrical system and sanitary facilities repairs, finishes, and lighting.
Implementation
Design and engineering. The costs of design and engineering are to be covered under the project. The
work is being carried out by local architects and engineers under supervision of the DLS Construction
Division. Preliminary design and engineering for Tbilisi and Kutaisi Appellate Courts were carried before
Appraisal in order to define project infrastructure costs and were covered under SATAC II.
Component C. Enforcement of Court Judgments - US$ 0.23 million
Background
As in most of the other transition economies, enforcement of judgements in civil cases does not function
well in Georgia. Bailiffs (court executors) are not properly trained and are badly compensated. They also
lack basic infrastructure, including means of transportation, to effectively discharge their duties. The
inefficient enforcement system exacerbates the low public acceptance of the court system as a venue for
dispute resolution.
Improvements Needed
Since efficient and reliable enforcement of contracts and property claims is a sine qua non for a
functioning market mechanism, the MOJ has recognized the need for a reorganization of the court
enforcement function. The Law on Enforcement of Court Decisions has recently been enacted. According
to the provisions of the draft law, a new department for enforcement of court decisions will need to be
established and made operational.
Specific Activities to be Financed
Development of a master plan for the development of an efficient court enforcement function, including
assessment of technology and training needs. Provision of training for bailiffs and equipment needed for
their activities.



Page 23
Component D. Assistance to the Ministry of Justice - US$ 0.27 million
Background
So far, the MOJ has not taken the lead in the legal or judicial reform process. However, since the summer
of 1998 when a new Minister of Justice was appointed, MOJ is seeking to become the leading agency for
the legal drafting and harmonization effort in Georgia. The new Minister of Justice has requested
assistance from the donor community for this endeavor.
Objectives
The objective of this component is to assist MOJ in becoming the leading entity in Georgia for legal
drafting and legal harmonization.
Improvements Needed
It is the intention of the Minister of Justice to establish within the Ministry of Justice substantial
capacities to provide for an adequate review of legislation and regulations prepared by the Government.
This will contribute to the harmonization of the Georgian legal system and assure a more consistent legal
review of proposed legislation than has been the case in the past.
Specific Activities to be Financed
Provision of technical assistance to strengthen the legal drafting and harmonization activities of MOJ and
provision of limited computer equipment to strengthen such activities.
Component E. Judicial Training Center - US$ 1.80 million (IDA financed: $0.80 million)
Background
The Georgian authorities have responded to the lack of a properly organized judicial training function by
establishing the Judicial Training Center (JTC) as an independent legal entity with NGO participation.
The JTC is responsible for the training of judges, assistant judges, chancery personnel and technical staff
of the courts. Representatives of other legal professions such as lawyers, and notaries can also participate
in courses of the JTC on a fee basis. The NGO status of the JTC enabled the Soros Foundation to assist in
the financing of its operating costs. The Soros Foundation is also a founder of thle JTC.
The European Commission through its EU-TACIS program has agreed to support the development of a
training methodology, training programs for judges and their implementation with an amount of US$1
million equivalent.
Objectives
The objective of the component is to assist the JTC in organizing and carrying out the judicial training
function to enhance the knowledge and judicial skills of new and sitting judges, assistant judges, chancery
personnel and technical staff of the courts.



Page 24
Improvements needed
The judiciary will need to receive high quality training in both procedural and substantive laws and in
judicial skills. The training function will need to be organized and modern teaching methods and tools
introduced. Training methodologies and programs will need to be devised for judicial support personnel.
Activities to be financed
The project will assist in the preparation of a methodology for the training of court support personnel, the
development of training programs and the execution of such training programs. The project will also
provide training in the area of bankruptcy procedures and any other priority area suggested by and agreed
upon with the JTC. The project will also assist in carrying out the training of trainers program. Study
tours and workshops will facilitate contacts between the Georgian judiciary and representatives of
developed judicial systems.
Component F. Public Information/Education - US$1.37 million
Background
The Georgian authorities are aware that devising a sophisticated judicial reform program is in itself not
sufficient to create an independent, competent and equitable judiciary. The Georgian population should
recognize the need for such an institution, value its functions and understand the way it operates in order
to make the best use of it. It is therefore essential to create two-way communications channels between
the authorities and the public to facilitate an ongoing dialogue on the judicial systemr.
Objectives
The objective of the public information/education component is to raise appreciation among the Georgian
population about the importance of an independent, competent and equitable judiciary and of the reform
efforts currently undertaken in the country. In particular, the component aims at achieving the following
goals:
*  inform and educate the public about their rights;
*  explain the judicial system to users and potential users and how to go about USinlg it;
*  inform the judiciary about the reform process;
*  build consensus around the judicial reform;
*  build media understanding on the legal and judicial system;
*  build trust in the judicial system and increase the prestige of judges;
*  explain the utility of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR) and promote their usage;
*  build communications capacity among entities involved in judicial reform;
* improve the judiciary's internal communications; and
*  provide feedback to the judiciary on a systematic way on the public's understanding and perceptions
on the reform.
Target Audiences
General public: a large majority of Georgians do not presently view the law as a means to solving
personal and business disputes. The population is not aware of their rights nor of the functioning of the
judicial system. Moreover, it is highly skeptical about the system's competence and fairness.



Page 25
Mass media. legal issues, especially legal reform, are not adequately covered by the media. This
concerns both the scope and the quality of the coverage. A serious drawback is that the media fail to
fulfill the role of educator of the population. Instead, it frequently acts as a purveyor of gossip and its
pervasive tone of cynicism serves to discredit the already discredited legal system.
Business community: businesspeople often recur to the "black world" to solve disputes, where resolutions
are issued immediately and are timely implemented. The mistrust in the judicial system has meant that
businesspeople have paid little attention to legal and judicial reforn and that the introduction of
innovative mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution like arbitration have had negligible results.
Legal community: many lawyers are not abreast of the changes in legislation nor of the judicial reforms
being implemented, yet they should be involved throughout the whole reform process.
Judiciary: judges down to the first instance courts have to be informed about, and when possible,
consulted upon, the reforms which are being undertaken. A substantial number of judges have opposed
the reform and in particular the re-qualification exams. It is essential to bring judges on board this
process as early as possible and reassure them of the benefit which ensues from hiaving an independent
and efficient judiciary. The same applies to court employees.
Teachers and students: the education system is key in conveying the importance of the rule of law in a
democratic society and a market economy, since it cannot be expected that young people will learn this at
home.
NGOs and civil society organizations: several organizations are already active in the field of legal and
judicial reform and a lot can be gained by enlisting their support and working together.
International investors: the international business community should be aware of the efforts undertaken
in Georgia to set in place a competent and fair judiciary and ensure the rule of law.
Component Design
In determining the design of the component, the following key considerations come into play:
*  Lack of past communications efforts. In the past very little was done to explain either the legal and
judicial systems or the nature and scope of the reforms being undertaken. Officials would limit
themselves to deny rumors or to react to criticisms as opposed to takilg the lead and proactively
interacting with the public, sharing information with them and enlisting their support for the reform.
*  Immediacy of need to communicate. Several reform measures have already been undertaken and
there is currently an ongoing public debate around this issue. There is therefore a need to begin the
public education/information effort as soon as possible.
*  Little communications capacity. Professional communications skills and experience -- beyond the
field of journalism -- are limited in Georgia as well as within the different government agencies
involved in the project. Moreover, the value of basic professional communications functions such as
strategic communications, opinion research or social marketing, etc. are new and as yet not well
understood within the region.
*  Multiple counterparts. This project includes four counterparts, and although all of them are
committed to the process of judicial reform, each has its own vision of the process and priorities.



Page 26
Given the key design considerations discussed above, the most effective way of achieving the objectives
of the Public Information/Education component of the project will be to divide it into three distinct
phases.
1. Immediate Action: May-September 1999. As noted above, it is important to start the public
education/information effort as soon as possible. For this purpose a short-term action plan has been
devised. It remains critical, however, that the communications effort is undertaken only under a
strategically planned approach and with the advice and support of experienced communications
professionals. Because setting up the Association for Legal and Judicial Public Education (ALPE)
and selecting and hiring the international communications consultants to work with them may take
several months, a highly qualified international consultant with experience in the region will be
selected to help refine and carry-out the short term action plan and to help lay the groundwork for the
longer-term activities of the project by focusing on building the skills and know-how of the local
communications team.
2. Launching the public information/education campaign: October 1999-March 2001. This is the
core substantive phase of the component, with the goal to ensure that all public education/
information activities are placed on a strategic footing for maximum impact. Local communications
capabilities will be solidified through capacity building and skills transfer, prepared to operate with
recourse to further foreign expertise for advice only on specialized issues. In this phase, a team of
international consultants will work with ALPE on the strategy design and key implementation tasks
outlined in the matrix below, focusing their work on building local capacity.
3. Public information/education campaign continues on an on-going high-impact basis: April 200 1-
September 2002. In this period, ALPE will carry out all basic public information/education functions
following the strategy designed in the preceding phase.
Activities to be financed
The matrix in the attachment to this Annex specifies the framework covering the niext six months as well
as the 3-year project period, linking each of the objectives with specific target audiences, indicative
activities that will be used to reach them, a tentative timetable, performance indicators and expertise
requirements.

Annex 4
Judicial Reform Project
Financial Management
General:
A review of Financial Management System was undertaken from May 3-8, 1999 to (a) review the
financial management arrangement of the project including such elements as internal controls, project
accounting, project staffing and audit arrangements; and (b) prepare a time-bound action plan for
strengthening the financial management system to achieve Project Management Report (PMR)-based
disbursements.
PIU Office Space:
The project intends to use the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) facility that already exists
within the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations. The present PIU was set up under the
Institutional Building Credit (IBC) in 1994 that which closed June 1998. The same PIU was also used for
SATAC I (closed December 1998), and the ongoing IDF grants for Public Procurement and the Georgia
Investment Center.
PIU Staffing:
The PIU has six full time positions as follows:
(i) Head PIU (Mr. Alexander Sikharulidze);
(ii) Financial and Accounting Officer (Ms. Lali Bakhutashvili);
(iii) Disbursement Specialist (Ms. Tamuna Zurabvishvili);
(iv) Procurement Specialist (Mr. Zurab Baratashvili);
(v) Interpreter/Secretary (Ms. Lela Karchkhadz); and
(vi) Driver (Mr. Irakli Tushurashvili).
Ms. Lali Bakhutashvili (Accountant): Ms. Bakhutashvili has been working under the World Bank
Institutional Building Project PIU since September 1995. Prior to this she worked at the Ministry of
Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Georgia as an Assistant to the Minister. She also has some
experience working as an accountant and an assistant economist in local firms. She is familiar with
microsoft computer software.
In order to strengthen financial management capacity of the PIU, arrangements have been made
to recruit another accountant who is expected to be familiar with IAS and preferably has previous World
Bank experience. In this respect advertisements in the local newspapers have already been placed.
Arrangements have also been made to provide additional training for Ms. Bakhutashvili and the new
accountant, if necessary.
PIU Budgetfor equipnent, auditors, accounting software, and training on lAS:
Detail break-down of the PIU budget was reviewed and found satisfactory. The PIU presently
possesses four computers and basic office equipment (printer, fax, copier) from previous project. In
addition, funds have been allocated for the accountant's salaries, additional hardware for the accounting
system, accounting software, training course for the accountant(s), and audit fees. Furthermore, funds are
put aside for a consultant who will he hired to help implement the accounting system at the PIU. A local
firm has been identified which will offer accounting training to the local accountants on IAS.



Page 31
Accounting Software System:
Given the project size and needs ($13.4 million) the accounting software system will be kept
simple yet effective. The accounting system to be designed should have, inter alia, an accounting and
internal control system with the capacity to record and retrieve in a timely manner, all financial
transactions under the project. The system will: (a) reliably record and report all assets, liabilities, and
financial transactions of the project; and (b) provide reliable financial information for managing and
monitoring project activities. The accounting system will be classified by component; it will reflect the
sources of funds, and will be broken down into different types of expenditures for the project. Further, it
will provide information on the receipt and use of funds and will be able to produce financial reports
comparing budget with actual expenditures at any given time. The system will be capable of providing
financial data to measure performance when linked to the outputs of the project. Names of various
software packages were provided to Mr. Alexander Sikharulidze who will share them with the consultant
and accountant when hired.
Financial Reporting:
In the absence of an accountant to discuss financial reporting, meetings were held with the PIU
Head about financial reporting requirements. It was agreed that the disbursements will start using
traditional disbursement methods - Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), reimbursements, direct payment,
etc. After the PIU has gained experience with the financial management system and the reporting under
PMRs, and provided that a financial management expert has reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank,
the Project would move to PMR-based disbursements. The PIU will be responsible for preparing Project
Management Reports (PMR) on a quarterly basis, and furnish to the Bank not later than 45 days after the
end of each calendar quarter. The PMRs will be produced which:
(a) (i) sets forth actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for the
period covered by said report, and projected sources and applications of funds for the project for the six-
month period following the period covered by said report and (ii) shows separately expenditures financed
out of the proceeds of the loan during the period covered by said report and expenditures proposed to be
financed out of the proceeds of the loan during the six-month period following the period covered by said
report;
(b) (i) describes physical progress in project implementation, both cumulatively and for the period
covered by said report, and (ii) explains variances between the actual and previously forecast
implementation targets; and
(c) sets forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under contracts financed out of
the proceeds of the loan, as at the end of the period covered by said report.
Project Operational Manual:
It was agreed that a Project Operational Manual (POM) would be prepared by the accountant that
would include: (a) the financial management system proposed under the project, with special emphasis on
accounting and auditing policies, standards and internal controls; (b) the role of the financial management
systems in project management and implementation; (c) the accounting arrangements required for project
management, the format for and content of project financial reporting; and (d) the auditing arrangements
that will be used during project implementation. It is expected that a final POM, satisfactory to IDA, will
be ready by end December 1999.



Page 32
Auditing:
Meetings were held with the representatives of the auditing firm, Amyot Exco GTI, that has been
given the Bank's "no-objection" (on April 23, 1999) to perform the audit of the PIU audit year ended
December 31, 1998. The same firm is also expected to provide similar services for this project. Auditing
arrangements for the PIU prior to the appointment of this auditor were deemed to have been
unsatisfactory. Since there is no representation of any of the big-five accounting firms in Georgia,
documentation was obtained which shows that this audit firm is a member of IFAC and has been doing
similar work in other countries.
The PIU will be responsible for ensuring that the financial statements, Special Account, and
SOEs are audited by an independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with standards on
auditing that are acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit will be carried out in accordance with the
Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982).
The audit report shall be in a format in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing
promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The audit report will include a
separate opinion for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the
Credit and SOEs which will be included in the audit report accompanying the financial statements.
The audited financial statements of the special accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year,
including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statement of
expenditures, will be sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
The audit of the financial statement will include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting
and internal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and ensure safe
custody of project-financed assets; (b) a determination as to whether the project implementing entities
have maintained adequate documentation on all relevant transactions; and (c) verification that
expenditures submitted to the Bank are eligible for financing, and identification of any ineligible
expenditures.
Adequate budget for auditing has already been allocated. Auditing services would be procured on
a least-cost basis, and packaged as a recurring audit, with no requirement for a new engagement letter,
except in the special circumstances.
Bank FMS staffing and supervision:
It was also agreed that during project life, a financial specialist would take part in supervision
missions to monitor the FM of the PIU and ensure compliance with ongoing FM covenants. It was
further agreed that a financial specialist would have to return prior to effectiveness to monitor
performance on the FM action plan. The FM procedures and assessment of the financial staff would be
included in the PIM.
Special Account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish (by July 19, 1999),
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account, denominated
in US Dollars. The authorized allocation for this Special Account will be US$1.1 million. During the
early stage of the project, the initial allocation on the Special Account would be limited to US$0.4
million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached US$2 million
equivalent, the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$1.1 million by
submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special



Page 33
Account would be submitted monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,
whichever occurs earlier.
Accounting software and assessment of Y2K risks:
Bank database of the financial accounting software packages was provided to Mr. Alexander
Sikharulidze. It was explained that these are typically available off-the-shelf in many countries and range
in cost from around US$800-$15,000. The project size suggests that a figure of around US$2,000 would
be adequate in this instance. It was agreed with Mr. Sikharulidze that once the consultant and accountant
are on board, this list of potential accounting software will be provided to him/lher.
The issue of Y2K risks was also discussed with the Head of the PIU. Assurance was provided
that new hardware and software to be purchased under the project will be Y2K compatible. In this regard,
appropriate contractual provisions will be made to ensure compatibility.
Conclusion:
The project does not currently satisfy the Bank's minimum financial management requirements.
However, an Action Plan is being presented below which requires the PIU to design and implement
satisfactory financial management systems to address the above issues. Once this time-bound Action
Plan is carried out successfully, it is believed that the project will, by then, have developed an accounting
system that will be able to produce the required level of financial management reports in a timely fashion.

payment, etc. After the PIU has gained experience with the financial management system and reporting under of the
PMRs, and provided that the are found to be satisfactory to the Bank, the Borrower and the Bank will consider
moving to PMR-based disbursements.

2.    The Project will be financed from the proceeds of the proposed US$13.40 million Credit from
IDA, the $1.00 million co-financing from EU-TACIS, and the local expenditure contributions from the
Government. The total cost of the Project would be $16.22 million. Procurement activities under the
project will fall under one ofthe following areas: (i) civil works, (ii) goods, and (iii) consulting services.
The procurement of goods and works of the IDA-financed components would be carried out in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January
1995, revised January 1996, August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). For consultants' services
the procurement would follow the Bank's Guidelines for "Selection and Employmient of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers," (January 1997, revised September 1997, and January 1999). The consulting
services financed by EU-TACIS, the co-financier, will be procured following the co-financier's
procedures. The Project components to be financed by the Government, if any, would be procured in
accordance with the national laws and regulations.
3.    A Country Procurement Strategy Paper (CPSP) was prepared by Hifab International of Sweden in
October 1995 (copy available in RPA's office). A full country procurement assessment for Georgia is
scheduled for FY 2001. The procurement administration capability of the Project Implementation Unit of
the implementing agency, Georgia's World Bank Institution Building Project Implementation Unit, has
been assessed. The PIU has two staff members, including, the Head of PIU, knowledgeable on IDA's
competitive procurement rules, and would be capable of administering the Project procurement. The PIU
has so far successfully handled two IDA-financed projects and is presently managing one on-going IDA
project. However, in the initial stage the PIU would need some assistance and on-the-job training in
managing works contracts. An expatriate Procurement Adviser/firm with considerable experience in
IDA's procurement procedures will be recruited for a period of at least six months to provide advice and
on-the-job training for the procurement staff. Bank staff input on procurement advice was provided
during appraisal of the Project. Early in July 1999, a project launch workshop will be undertaken
following Board approval.
4.    PIU's staff that will be responsible for procurement and disbursement will include the PIU
Manager trained in the Bank's advanced-level procurement course, a Procurement Specialist with
experience in the Bank-financed procurement and an expatriate Procurement Adviser/firn to be recruited
and an experienced Disbursement Specialist. The PIU has so far implemented two IDA-financed projects,
Institution Building Project (Cr. 2641-GE) and SATAC I (Cr. 2848-GE) and is currently implementing
the IDA's ongoing SATAC II Project (Cr. 2984-GE). A Senior Procurement/Legal Strategy Specialist
Consultant from the Bank visited Georgia to assess the adequacy of the PIU to hanidle procurement, and
to advise on the training needs to equip the PIU's procurement staff with necessary skills in drafting
bidding documents following Bank's SBDs, in evaluating bids and in administering contracts in a timely
manner. His report was favorable.

5.    The first General Procurement Notice is scheduled to be published in the Development Business
issue dated June 16, 1999. The total value of IDA-participated procurement is estimated at $15.22
million. Of this amount, $2.88 million for computer and Supreme Court equipment would be contracted
through ICB using bidding documents based on the Bank's SBDs. The contracts for completion of
construction and rehabilitation of one building, and rehabilitation of an historic building for housing
appellate courts in Tbilisi and in Kutaisi of value $1.83 and $1.66 million each, which because of the
nature of the works could only be handled by local contractors, will be awarded through NCB. However,
the bidding would be open to international bidders. Other works contracts up to ten district court
buildings of value between $100,000 to $500,000 each in widely dispersed area will be procured through
NCB or through minor works procurement procedures as appropriate. The NCB and Minor Works
documents will be based on the Bank's SBDs (developed by ECA). To the extent practical, items to be
procured will be grouped into major packages to encourage competitive bidding and to ensure
standardization. IDA-financed consultants for technical assistance and training, valued at $3.32 million,
would be selected competitively using appropriate methods among QCBS, Least-Cost Selection, Direct
Contracting, or Individual Consultants Selection (Section V of Guidelines) permitted under IDA's
Guidelines.
6.    The thresholds for procurement types for goods and works will be as follows: ICB -- all contracts
for goods above $200,000, works above $500,000 (with the exception of contracts for rehabilitation or
completion of existing structures that will be awarded through NCB); NCB - all contracts for works
between $100,000 and $500,000 and the two contracts for rehabilitation or completion of existing
structures; International Shopping - $200,000 subject to an aggregate ceiling of $750,000; National
Shopping - $50,000 subject to an aggregate ceiling of $200,000; and Minor Works - $100,000 subject to
an aggregate ceiling of $1,000,000. For goods and works the prior review thresholds shall be as follows:
goods - above $200,000; works - all ICB and the first NCB contract only (because the NCB contract
could be in the Georgian language). For consultant contracting the prior review thresholds will be above
$100,000 for firms and above $50,000 for individuals.

DISBURSEMENT
7.    Table D shows the allocation of credit proceeds by category and the disbursement percentages
proposed in each category. The closing date would be June 30, 2003.
Special Account
8.    In order to facilitate Credit disbursements, the Government of Georgia (GoG) will establish a
Special Account in a major commercial bank on terns and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover IDA's
share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation for the Special Account would be US$1.1 million.
During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to
US$0.4 million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached US$2 million
equivalent, the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$1.1 million by
submitting the relevant Applicationifor Withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account would be submitted monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn,
whichever occurs earlier.
Documentation
9.    Disbursements from the loan for the following types of contracts require full documentation: (i)
goods contracts valued at $200,000 or more; (ii) works contracts valued at $300,000 or more, (iii)
consulting contracts with firms valued at $100,000 or more; and (iv) consulting contracts with individuals
valued at $50,000 or more. The Association may require withdrawals from the Credit Account to be made
on the basis of statements of expenditure for expenditures for: (i) goods under contracts not exceeding
$200,000 equivalent; (ii) works under contracts not exceeding $500,000 equivalent; (iii) services provided
by consulting firms under contracts not exceeding $100,000 equivalent; (iv) services provided by
individual consultants under contracts not exceeding $50,000 equivalent; and (v) training and operating
costs of the PIU, under such terms as the Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower. The
minimum size of applications for direct withdrawals from the Credit and for issuance of Special
Commitments will be twenty percent (20%) of the current amount of the Authorized Allocation.
