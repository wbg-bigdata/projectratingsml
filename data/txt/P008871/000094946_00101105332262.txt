Background and Introduction
The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) and the Montreal
Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) are international
environmental agreements that call for the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that
deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. More than 160 countries have ratified the two conventions.
The MP was amended in 1990 in London to establish a Multilateral fund (MLF) to support



implementation by developing countries. There have been further amendments in 1992 in
Copenhagen, in 1995 in Vienna, and in 1995 in Montreal to plan the phaseout of methyl bromide.
ODS phase-out assistance provided to developing countries is coordinated by the MP
implementing agencies: United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), United nations
Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Development Program (UNIDO), and the Bank.
Turkey ratified the MP in 1991, and-with the assistance of the Bank-prepared an
Action Plan consisting of policies, actions, and investments needed to initiate ODS phaseout. The
Action Plan includes key interventions such as increased use of ODS substitutes, monitoring of
ODS consumption, and programs to raise public and industry awareness. The Action Plan also
identifies demonstration and investment projects that meet the guidelines of the MP Executive
Committee. The project for the Phase-Out of Ozone Depleting Substances (PODS-I) is part of
the Action Plan, and is funded by the MP Multilateral Fund, with the Bank as Trustee. PODS-I
was intended to, and did, lay the technical, political, and policy/regulatory foundation for Turkey
to begin the phaseout of ODS.
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project objective was to assist ODS-using industries in Turkey to efficiently and
effectively phase out ODS usage through adoption of policy, technological, and monitoring
measures. The phase out was to be effected in accordance with the MP, as ratified by Turkey, and
in accordance with the agreed strategy and Action Plan.
The project objective was clear and was plainly relevant and important to Turkey's
obligation under the MP to phase out ODS usage. It was also consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy for Turkey, as well as the Bank's overall goal of fostering
environmentally-sustainable development. It was also important to the country in stimulating
manufactured exports and increasing integration with the European Union (which heavily restricts
imports of ODS-using equipment), major goals of the government. The project goals were
realistic since they comprised a simple, straightforward plan for taking the initial steps needed for
ODS phaseout.
While the project was not complex, it necessarily involved some technical risk, as some of
the activities involved had not previously been undertaken in a developing country. In particular,
the refrigerant recycling and recovery sub-component was risky in that it had not yet been
demonstrated that these functions could be accomplished in an economically feasible manner.
The project was demanding on the Ministry of Environment, as it required the Ministry to:
substantially increase its knowledge of ODS and the means by which they could be phased out;
develop a National Ozone Policy (in close consultation with industry); and coordinate with other
components of government in regulating trade in ODS (Undersecretariat of Treasury,
Undersecretariat Foreign Trade, and Customs Service).
3.2 Revised Objective:
-2 -



The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project was implemented by means of three components:
*     Investment Projects and Technology Transfer for ODS Phaseout--The first
component consisted of investment projects, including technology transfer, that facilitated ODS
phaseout in the refrigeration sector. This was implemented by Arcelik A. S., Turkey's largest
refrigerator manufacturer, which included introduction of ODS-free technology into its
refrigerator production; recovery and recycling of refrigerants in the Istanbul area servicing
centers; and recovery and recycling of refrigerants at refrigerator production facilities of Arcelik.
(The rationale for the selection of Arcelik is discussed below)
*     Preparation of Further ODS Phaseout Projects--The second component-implemented
by the Technology Development Foundation (TDF)-consisted of demonstration projects or
related activities that served to introduce new technologies or alternative products. These
activities often comprised preparation of investment projects that could be eligible for funding
from the MLF.
*     Institutional and Management Strengthening--The third component-implemented by
the Ministry of Environment-comprised institutional and management strengthening, including
establishment of the Ozone Panel; establishment of ODS monitoring systems; public awareness
programs; and establishment of regulatory frameworks for future use of ODS.
Of total project funding, 87%, or US$5.28 million, was allocated to the first component,
implemented by Arcelik, with 65% of the funds provided to Arcelik in the form of a loan and the
balance as a grant; 7% to the second component (TDF); and 6% to the third component (MOE).
Assessment of design
The project design was straightforward and was directly related to assisting Turkish
companies across several ODS sectors and applications (e.g., refrigeration, insulation, aerosols,
foam, fire extinguishing) to phase out ODS use. The project included activities aimed at
facilitating ODS phaseout by large companies, such as Arcelik (which sells more than 50% of the
country's refrigerators designed for home use), as well as those aimed at small and medium
enterprises companies that might lag unless an effort was made to raise their awareness of the
legal requirement and methods by which they could comply. Finally, the project aimed to
strengthen the MOE, and in particular to support its efforts to assemble an Ozone Panel, and
reach a policy consensus with industry.
TDF, one of the implementing agencies, played a key role in an earlier Bank project, the
Technology Development Project. TDF's overall activities are supported by Government,
industry, and the Bank, and the organization had successfully contributed to the promotion of
public-private cooperation in applied research and development. TDF also had extensive
experience in research and development project selection, monitoring, and supervision.
-3 -



Arcelik was selected because (a) it is the largest producer; (b) among companies invited to
submit proposals, its project promised to make the greatest contribution to the overall Action Plan
objectives; (c) it is vertically integrated into compressor and components manufacturing, as well
as research and development; and (d) it has long played a proactive role in ODS phaseout.
Because parts of the project conveyed commercial advantages to Arcelik, 65% of the firm's
funding under the project was provided as a loan, with the balance as a grant.
PODS-I was designed with a Revolving Fund, intended to re-lend funds repaid by Arcelik
to finance projects of other manufacturers pursuing ODS phaseout. PODS-I was the first project
approved under the MP to have the Revolving Fund feature, with funds re-lent by the Revolving
Fund to be on the same terms as the original loan to Arcelik: 0% interest, 2 years grace, and 3
years for repayment. As described later, TDF did not re-lend funds from the Revolving Fund as
planned because the acceptability of any proposals that would have resulted would have been
unclear due to changing MP eligibility criteria. TDF was successful, however, in submitting firms'
proposals to the MLF and securing funding under the follow-on PODS-II project.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry was satisfactory. As noted above, the project was an integral part of the
Government's Action Plan-prepared with the assistance of the Bank-to initiate ODS phaseout.
The project design was straightforward, and was aimed directly at assisting companies to phase
out ozone use, and to helping bolster MOE and support its efforts with the Ozone Panel to reach
a policy consensus with industry. Project risks were reasonable, even including the recovery and
recycling of ODS by Arcelik, which was recognized as a pilot effort under the Project. Due to the
difficulties encountered, Arcelik ended this sub-component after completion of only a fraction of
the activities initially envisioned.
Nearly all the assumptions underlying the project were realistic, except for the estimate of
how long it would take to achieve a consensus between government and industry on the National
Ozone Policy. Although the process was highly effective--with an excellent working consensus
being reached--it took longer than anticipated and resulted in a delay in project completion.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Project outcome is judged as highly satisfactory. Turkey has been very successful in
phasing out ODS. (Phaseout means that imports or production of ODS or ODS-using equipment
are banned. Turkey never produced ODS, so its entire supply was imported. However, continued
operation and servicing of existing ODS-using equipment is permitted.) Turkey's annual
consumption of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) declined from around 4,000 tons in 1996 to
2,600 tons in 1999. A National Ozone Policy was developed and promulgated in 1999, with a
high degree of consensus between government and industry. (The evidence for the success of this
effort is that industry has not voiced any opposition to the Policy.) This measure banned import
of ODS and ODS-using equipment as of January 1, 2000, and also banned use of ODS in
manufacturing and production of ODS-using products. While there is an overall "ban" on ODS
- 4 -



imports, MOF grants a limited number of licenses for ODS imports to service existing equipment
(no ODS are manufactured in Turkey).
Although as an MP Article 5 (developing) country Turkey was legally required to phase
out ODSs by 2010, the country elected to accelerate phase out of certain ODSs, such as
refrigerants, which account for the largest part of ODS consumption. Turkey was the first Article
5 country to promulgate a National Ozone Policy and associated regulations to phase out import
and production of ODS-using products and implement an accelerated phase-out schedule (relative
to the mandate for Article 5 countries under the Montreal Protocol) during the transition to
non-ODS technologies. Turkey was also the first Article 5 country to introduce and demonstrate
the viability of converting ODS domestic refrigeration production to: (1) the zero-ODS
refrigerant HFC-134a; (2) the zero-ODS, low GWP hydrocarbon refrigerant, HC-600a; and (3)
the zero-ODS, low GWP hydrocarbon blowing agent, cyclopentane. And in 1997, Turkey
received an award from the MP as one of the nine most successful Article 5 countries. out of 49,
in implementing the MP.
4.2 Outputs by components:
(1) Investment Projects and Technology Transfer for ODS Phaseout-- Efforts under
the project by Arcelik, A. S. to facilitate ODS phaseout, were largely successful. Arcelik's ODS
consumption declined from 455 tons in 1991 (when the firm began the small-scale phaseout of
ODS on its own) to zero in 1999, at the same time that its annual refrigerator production
increased from 478,000 to an estimated 1,210,000. Hadthere been no phaseout, the company
estimates that its 1999 ODS consumption would have been 1,041 tons. Technical knowledge and
experience gained in the Arcelik effort was shared with the Technology Development Foundation
and with the Bank, and in this way the experience gained was also shared with other interested
Turkish firms.
However, the company's pilot effort to demonstrate the economic viability of ODS
recovery and recycling was not successful. The yield in recovered and re-useable ODS, using the
technology available in 1995 and 1996, was not sufficient to demonstrate this concept, and the
company decided to end this activity after 10 of the planned 60 recovery units were established.
(It is believed that newer technology and recent experience in other Article 5 countries would
currently permit economically feasible recovery efforts)
(2) Preparation of Further ODS Phaseout Projects--Under the project, MOE achieved
a much better knowledge of the profile of ODS-using sectors via the performance of three
surveys. Also, the awareness of firms concerning regulatory requirements for ODS and
technologies available for phaseout was substantially increased by means of 21 demonstration
projects and numerous seminars that attracted the participation of small and medium-sized
enterprises. Finally, many fnrms were assisted in the development of phaseout-related proposals
that were funded under the follow-on project, PODS-II, or which were submitted to the MP
Multilateral Fund.
Repayment by Arcelik to TDF's revolving fund started in 1997. Subsequently, other firms
which were financed from the follow-on PODS-II project also contributed to the revolving fund,
which now has about US$3.5 million in its special account. As provided in the Grant Agreement,
- 5 -



TDF could have re-lent part or all of these funds to other eligible projects, especially those
submitted by small and medium enterprises. Instead, these projects are now being financed by the
MLF through the PODS-II project.
(3) Institutional and Management Strengthening-- The project also resulted in a
substantial increase in MOE knowledge of ODS and potential phaseout approaches. MOE, which
was a new agency at the time that the project was initiated, established the Ozone Panel, and also
developed a comprehensive regulatory framework, although some achievements came later than
originally anticipated. The Ministry conducted a very successful-though lengthy-process of
consensus development with industry, culminating in a ban on ODS imports (1998) and the
National Ozone Policy (1999), both implemented with little or no industry opposition. The
Ministry also substantially strengthened its data-processing capabilities, and its systems were
linked to the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, which aids in tracking ODS imports under the
limited licenses granted. MOE also established a monitoring system to track imports and usage of
ODS. However, achievement of these goals was delayed by frequent changes in the Turkish
Government, the time needed to achieve a policy consensus, an initial lack of familiarity with
World Bank procurement procedures, and the need for MOE to coordinate with the Ministry of
Finance and Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade which is responsible for implementing restrictions
on ODS imports.
An additional project goal was to increase public awareness of the ODS problem, and
press coverage of the industry seminars contributed to that end. However, two RFPs were
promulgated to develop public awareness campaigns, but no firms responded to either RFP,
reportedly due to the very low budget for the task. An individual consultant has prepared a public
awareness campaign strategy, which is planned to be implemented under the PODS-II.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
An NPV/ERR was not calculated for the project. However, a standard measure of
cost-effectiveness, $/kg of ODS phased out, was calculated for component 1, conducted by
Arcelik. While the projected cost in the Project Document was $6.25/kg phased out, the actual
cost was $5.63, approximately 10% less than planned.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a fundamental impact on the country's ability to utilize its human,
financial, and technical resources on ODS phaseout, and consequently it is judged that
Institutional Development Impact was high:
*  From a very low initial level of knowledge, the project helped the government and industry
achieve a substantial understanding of the ODS problem. The Ozone Panel meetings and
additional workshops were very helpful in educating various segments of industry and the
public. And MOE developed substantial knowledge of the profile of firms working in this
sector.
* Arcelik advanced considerably in its technology and know-how in dealing with ODS
- 6 -



phaseout. (This knowledge was shared with other Turkish firms.) This served as a stimulus to
many other companies which had held back until they saw Areclik's substantial achievements.
*  MOE developed substantial technical and policy expertise in this area, and also bolstered its
computer system, which was networked with that of the Ministry of Finance.
* The 1999 promulgation of a National Ozone Policy, in line with best international practice,
was a substantial achievement for a developing country. This policy provided the framework
for the implementation of a regulatory regime supportive of the Government's goals in this
area.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The MP Multilateral Fund policy environment was rapidly evolving during the period of
PODS-I, and this caused delays in the preparation of MLF Executive Committee guidelines and
project eligibility criteria.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Frequent changes of government made it more difficult to implement the policy and trade
aspects of the project. Each time there was a change at the top of each agency, many civil service
staff down through the ranks also changed, requiring a re-education process, resulting in
substantial delays.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
As noted earlier, the implementing agencies - TDF and MOE - demonstrated substantial
competence to handle all aspects of implementation, though MOE was directly affected by
changes in government. TDF did not utilize the Revolving Fund to re-lend funds to assist small
and medium-sized enterprises in ODS phase-out, but instead processed the project proposals for
fnancing by MLF itself.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There were no major cost changes.
The original closing date of the project was December 31, 1996, while the actual closing
date was December 31, 1999-a project duration of approximately six years vs. the planned three
years. The reasons for this were that the project was delayed by: frequent changes in the Turkish
Government; the lengthy (but ultimately highly successful) effort to achieve policy consensus; a
longer-than-expected period required by TDF to develop demonstration projects; an initial lack of
MOE familiarity with World Bank procurement procedures; and the time required for MOE to
coordinate with the Ministries of Treasury and Foreign Trade over implementing a ban on ODS
imports.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is judged to be highly likely:
* The National Ozone Plan contains a schedule for the complete elimination of ODS, and
Turkey is committed to its implementation.
-7 -



* Turkey has banned ODS import or use in manufacturing, and industry has willingly complied.
* The consciousness of manufacturers across all ODS-using sectors has been raised, and there is
considerable interest in new technologies that avoid ODS.
* The country's desire to meet European norms will be a strong factor in stimulating further
progress in this area. (In December, 1999, Turkey was invited to be a candidate for EU
membership.)
* PODS-II and the MP are funding additional projects that will provide an impetus to make
further progress in this area
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Transition to regular operations is facilitated by the existence of PODS-II--effective in
December, 1995--a follow-on project also designed to facilitate ODS phaseout. PODS-II
permitted TDF to continue assisting firms to prepare ODS phaseout proposals which could then
be considered by the MP.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Lending performance was highly satisfactory, with quality at entry highly satisfactory and
a straightforward project design that was very effectively aimed at facilitating ODS phaseout.
GOT participation and commitment were substantial and the capacity of the implementing agency
and all other project participants was excellent.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision overall was satisfactory. Overall progress was substantial: nearly all project
goals were achieved, and the Bank transferred a substantial amount of technical information
regarding ODS to the Government, Turkish companies, and others. During the first several years
of the project, the Bank conducted technical seminars twice a year, which made available
up-to-date technical information on substitutes for ODS, and technologies relating to how they
might be used. The Bank facilitated the process of reaching a government-industry consensus on
ODS phaseout, although as noted above this process took longer than expected.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory, with very good performance in all areas.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in project preparation and appraisal was highly satisfactory, with an
excellent project design and substantial outreach to stakeholders (industry).
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was very good, as the MOE did a thorough and
painstaking job in working with industry to develop the National Ozone Plan (although it took
longer than expected). The evidence for this assertion is that no objections were voiced by
industrv when the plan was promulgated. As described earlier, MOE institutional development
was substantial, and the agency established an effective regulatory regime.
- 8 -



7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of Arcelik was highly satisfactory as borne out by the results achieved. TDF
performance was also very good: working with business and academnic organizations to develop
ODS phaseout proposals consistent with MP criteria; monitoring progress of projects that
received funding; facilitation of public awareness of the need for ODS phaseout. TDF helped raise
the profile of ODS among small and medium-sized enterprises, and broke down traditional
barriers between government and business in Turkey.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance was highly satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Administration of the grant through a local, non-governmental agency was
generally positive-Turkish companies had confidence in TDF, and responded well to TDF
supervision of the fund supporting ODS phaseout. TDF's performance in this regard was very
good.
Reaching a policy consensus, and inter-agency coordination, often takes longer
than anticipated. In PODS-I, the MOE needed to coordinate with the Ministry of Finance
and the Ministry of Foreign Trade. This took longer than expected, as did the
(highly-successful) process of developing a policy consensus with business on the National
Ozone Plan. The funds allocated to public and industry awareness campaigns were inadequate
due to higher media costs than estimated in the Project.
The Project Evaluation Process of the MP Executive Committee is Slow-Many
organizations complained that a very long period elapsed before their proposals were
considered.
MP Proposal Evaluation Guidelines are Incomplete-In some cases the Executive
Committee does not have guidelines by which to evaluate proposals. Delays by the MP
Executive Committee in approving Turkey's pending Refrigeration Plan have meant that
Turkey may need to increase 2000 ODS imports by 56 tons. The delays can also lead to loss
of interest by companies.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Ministry of Enviromnent: The Project was very effective in supporting the activities of the
Ministry, which is the main coordinating and implementing body of the Country Program, and in
developing the sound environmental policy for early phase-out.
Although the project has been satisfactory in meeting the project objectives and supporting the
activities to meet the commitments made, the contradictions in the decisions of ExCom (e.g.
incremental operating cost compensation claims), project deferrals and late or no response to the
needs of early phase-out (e.g. non-approval of commercial refrigeration projects and non adoption
-9-



of refrigerant management plans for high volume ODS consuming countries) had a negative effect
on complete phase-out which was the primary objective pronounced in the policy. This may cause
some components of the policy not to be implemented effectively and thus create a negative effect
on meeting the overall objective of the Montreal Protocol. This may also impede the acceptance
of greater commitments to ODS phase-out by other proactive Article 5 countries.
Technology Development Foundation: Project was highly satisfactorily in meeting the project
objectives and supporting the activities of TDF. As per defined roles in the project, TDF:
* Informed industry about the requirement of phasing out ODS, alternative technologies and
financial assistance through seminars and demonstration projects.
*  Prepared new investment projects and supervise / monitor them for successful phaseout with
an innovative mechanism.
* Acted as a financial intermediary for the disbursement of funds.
Lessons learned:
*  Private sector, including SME's, highly interested with a fund implemented by a
non-governmental organization (NGO)
*  Fund implementation through local executing agency is important for success.
*  NGO type local executing agencies have no red-tape, so that, they can give quick response to
the needs of industry.
*  Very lean organizational structure supported by a large pool of consultants reduces office cost
and service expenditures.
*  Clearly defined role and mechanisms for a local executing agency important for success.
3 Tailor-made products and services is more important working with different sectors. (project
design, support, guidelines, for procurement, monitoring, reporting and certification)
i  Facilitative role of the World Bank team is important for success.
Developing and enhancing partnership and creating new opportunities in environmental areas
would lead to successful results in implementing new programs as per gained experience of
project implementation and established strong structure of TDF.
