THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Kingdom of Swaziland
Amount:              US$11.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace,
at 7.9 percent interest per annum.
Project
Description:       The proposed project will assist the Borrower in
improving transport by constructing and upgrading the
Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road and the Big Bend-Nggwavuma
River Road to two-lane bituminous standard; and by
strengthening the maintenance capacity of the Roads
Branch through the provision of equipment and technical
assistance. The project will also include detailed
engineering of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and the
Mafutseni-Mliba Road. The main beneficiaries will be the
direct road users, but benefits will be widely distributed
among small farmers, traders and consumers.  The project
faces no special risks, although it is possible the
Central Transport Organization will not improve its
operations quickly enough to adequately maintain the
equipment required by the Roads Branch, or that the Roads
Branch's training program will not improve road mainte-
nance operations to the extent originally planned.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
la        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
luai to the Kingdom of Swaziiand for the equivalent of US$11.0 million
to help finance a third highway project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum
on Swaziland" (No. 852a-SW) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
November 24, 1975. An updating economic mission will visit Swaziland in
October/November 1978; meanwhile, recent economic data, collected during
regular Bank missions, have been incorporated in this report. Country data
are shown in Annex I.
3.        Swaziland is one of the smallest countries on the African con-
tinent; located in southern Africa, it is surrounded by the Republic of
South Africa and Mozambique. In 1976, its population was estimated at
slightly more than 500,000, including about 29,000 Swazis who live abroad,
mainly as migrant workers in South Africa. The population has been growing
at a rate of about 3.2 percent per annum. Relative to its size and popula-
tion, the country is well endowed with natural resources and has good
potential for development. It has some mineral deposits and its soil and
climate are favorable to diversified agricultural production.
4.        The economy is highly dualistic and about 40 percent of the land is
owned by foreigners. The modern sector, which is largely foreign owned,
consists of mining (asbestos, coal), large-scale plantations of forestry,
sugar, citrus and pineapples, and associated industries such as pulp, saw-
milling, sugar and fruit processing. The traditional sector, on the other
hand, is based largely on cattle raising and subsistence agriculture (maize,
groundnuts, sorghum); it directly supports about one-half of the population.
5.        This economic dualism is to some extent a reflection of the govern-
ment structure. The King rules the modern Government through an appointed
Cabinet of Ministers who manage the country's normal economic activities
and provide the bulk of services to the people. In traditional matters and
over all activities concerning Swazi Nation land (this term refers to about
60 percent of the territory of Swaziland which is held communally for the
Swazi people by the King), the King relies on the advice of the Swazi
National Council, a group of senior Swazi chiefs and leaders. When the
modern Government becomes involved in developing the Swazi Nation land's
agricultural and mineral resources, considerable deliberations by both
the Cabinet and Council are required. Consequently, economic change has



- 2 -
been slow on ;wazi Nation land in contrast to the modern agricultural sector's
rapid develop-ient.
6.        Ove  the last two decades, the Swazi economy, led by the modern
sector, devel)ped rapidly and real GNP grew at about 6.8 percent a year.
Until recentlr, no major new industries apart from tourism have been estab-
blished; however, expansion of existing enterprises and the government sector,
together with a growing number of smaller enterprises, sustained real growth
in GNP at 9.3 percent a year between 1971/72-1975/76. At current prices, GNP
per capita was estimated at US$580 in 1977. Since 1975, it appears that GNP
growth has been slower due to achievement of full capacity in several key
sectors (sugar, wood pulp), completion of iron ore mining, stagnation in the
subsistence sector, and the effects of the world recession. In the period
through 1985, real GNP should grow at favorable rates due to new investments
in sugar production and expanding export markets for citrus, beef and wood-
based industi Les.
7.        The country's economic growth has been due mainly to private
investment. Since 1968, gross private investment has averaged about 19
percent of GDP and government capital expenditures about 7 percent. As
Swazi entrepreneurship was, and still is, quite limited, almost all modern
activities have been carried out by foreign companies, under foreign manage-
ment, and with foreign capital.  This development pattern has actually
sharpened the dualism in the Swazi society and economy which the Government
inherited at independence. The modern sector now contributes about 80 per-
cent of GDP and wage employment, and 90 percent of direct taxes. The main
sector, agriculture and forestry, accounts for close to 35 percent of GDP
and 40 percent of total wage employment, while manufacturing contributes
15 percent and 12 percent respectively. The traditional rural sector,
which accounts for about 14 percent of GDP, has remained virtually stagnant
over the years. Because wage employment in the modern sector grew at over
ten percent a year during the 1960s, the labor force in traditional agricul-
ture declined from 72 percent in 1960 to about 50 percent in 1974.
8.        Swaziland's Third National Development Plan (1978-82) emphasizes
three main objectives: (1) to create conditions for sustained economic
growth; (2) to achieve a greater measure of self-reliance; and (3) to
provide social justice and stability by spreading economic opportunities
and services more widely in the rural areas. Expressed in constant 1977
prices, the Plan proposes an investment program of E 413 million compared
with E 164 milion during the Second Plan period (1973-77) of which only E 123
million was spent (75 percent). While the proposed Plan represents a sub-
stantial increase over the Second Plan figures, a sizeable amount of the
new investment is already committed for several large projects, including
a US$150 million irrigated estate and sugar mill project in which the IFC
has participated. The Government expects to finance about 60 percent of
the Plan expenditures from domestic revenues and to mobilize the remainder
from external sources. The proposed investment program concentrates on
modern sector investments, and will likely intensify the dualism already



- 3 -
existing in the economy. We have expressed our concern over the Plan's con-
centration on large, modern sector investments, and we will work with the
Government to develop more investment opportunities like the Rural Develop-
ment Area (RDA) Program, which the Bank, through the First Rural Development
Project (Loan 1375-SW), and several other external assistance agencies, are
currently supporting. The RDA Program will benefit 125,000 people living
in rural areas by helping to increase cash incomes through increased agri-
cultural production and improved availability of social services.
9.         Since 1971, owing to the sharp increase in mining wages in the
Republic of South Africa, the number of Swazis recruited for mining employment
doubled. At the same time', there is a shortage of skilled Swazis for the
modern non-agricultural sector and a growing number of school-leavers with
general backgrounds who cannot find employment. The Government's long-term
education policy aims at alleviating this problem through restructuring the
educational system and emphasizing vocational and technical rather than
academic training. Programs assisted by the Bank already are underway to
enlarge technical training institutions and accelerate curriculum reform,
particularly to better serve rural development.
10.       Together with Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa, Swaziland belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union. Under this arrangement, Swaziland
draws customs and excise revenue from a common revenue pool according to the
value of its total imports and production of taxable goods. Swaziland also
belongs, along with Lesotlao and the Republic of South Africa, to the Rand
Monetary Area. In Septem'ber 1974, Swaziland issued its own national currency,
the emalangeni (E) with tlhe same par value as the rand; both currencies
are legal tender in Swaziland. A Monetary Authority manages the country's new
monetary system.  In order to remain in the Rand Monetary Area and be able
to continue drawing on its foreign exchange reserves, Swaziland has agreed
to maintain 100 percent of the value of the emalangeni in circulation in a
rand account with the South African Reserve Bank.
11.       Government finances have improved significantly since 1969 when
the revision of the Customs Union Agreement substantially increased revenues
and eliminated the Government's chronic budget deficits. At the same time,
the Government strengthened the tax administration and introduced new taxes
(in particular, the hotel tax and sugar levy). As a result, recurrent
revenue increased from E 8.5 million in 1967/68 to E 63 million in 1976/77.
Correspondingly, recurrent expenditures grew from E 13 million to E 68 mil-
lion. During this period, the government budget has had several years of
large surpluses due to sizeable increases in revenues from the Southern Africa
Customs Union and imposition of a special sugar levy. Although revenue from
the sugar levy declined with the fall in sugar prices in 1976/77, and is not
expected to be significanLt again until after 1980, the Government will remain
a net creditor to the banking system despite the need to draw down some
balances to finance projected public deficits in the 1976/77-1978/79 period.



- 4 -
12.       Due to its diversified economic base, Swaziland has experienced a
healthy growth in external trade. Exports have increased from US$39 million
in 1968 to about US$187 million in 1976, largely as a result of increased
production and favorable prices on world markets for sugar and forestry
products which account for 60 percent of total export value. At the same
time, imports have increased less rapidly, from US$51 million to US$165
million, with the result that Swaziland has for many years enjoyed a favor-
able balance of merchandise trade. As the country sells about 70 percent
of its exports to Europe, North America and Japan, and imports about 90
percent of its requirements from the Republic of South Africa, it has been
a substantial net earner of foreign exchange for the Rand Monetary Area.
Overall, Swaziland has enjoyed substantial balance of payment surpluses during
most of the Second Plan period (1973-77), despite repatriation of substantial
profits earned by the large, foreign-dominated, agro-industries. Foreign
exchange holdings reached a level of US$80 million in 1977, the equivalent of
approximately five months of imports.
13.       Until 1975, the United Kingdom was the major source of foreign
financial assistance, but during the last few years a number of national
agencies and multilateral lenders have begun to provide funds for project
financing. Because of the slow buildup of absorptive capacity, the utiliza-
tion of foreign assistance following independence in 1968 has been sluggish.
A substantial technical assistance program is now in place, and recent expe-
rience suggests that the country's absorptive capacity is improving, as local
staff benefit from training and experience.
14.       On December 31, 1976, Swaziland's external public debt (disbursed
and outstanding) was US$46.3 million; service obligations on this debt
amounted to US$1.8 million in 1976. Swaziland's future external public debt
(including undisbursed) is expected to increase to some US$250 million by
1985 and annual debt service obligations will be about US$15 million, or less
than five percent of estimated exports in 1985. As the Government is able to
draw on the foreign exchange earnings of the Rand Monetary Area, the debt
service ratio expressed as a percentage of exports is mainly an indicator of
Swaziland's external debt carrying capacity. A more useful indicator of the
Government's current debt service capacity is the ratio of debt service
payments to government revenue. In 1976, servicing of existing public debt
represented three percent of current government revenue; by 1985, we estimate
this would increase to 8-10 percent and should not create an unmanageable
burden on the country's finances.



- 5 -
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
15.       The Bank Group, which began operations in Swaziland in 1962, has
approved seven loans, two credits and one IFC loan for a total of US$46.8
million. These have helped finance two road projects, two power projects,
two education projects, plus projects for rural development, water supply
and sewerage, a development finance company and an irrigated sugar estate
and factory (IFC). A summary statement of Bank Group operations is given
in Annex II, together with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Future Bank Group operations will assist the Government with its
efforts to expand the role of the Swazis in the modern sector, and to raise
the productivity of those Swazis dependent on traditional agriculture. At
the Government's request, the Bank and UNIDO are currently studying the
local construction industry to determine appropriate means of providing
assistance to local contractors. The study is likely to recommend the se-
lection of the National Industrial Development Corporation of Swaziland
(NIDCS) and its subsidiary, the Small Enterprises Development Corporation
(SEDCO), as the vehicles for channeling assistance to the local construc-
tion industry. We are currently supporting NIDCS and SEDCO through a US$5.0
million line of credit approved in 1977, and will propose a second line of
credit as additional resources become necessary. Other proposed operations
under preparation include a third education project to expand primary and
technical education, and a second agriculture project to improve livestock
and fresh produce marketing.
17.       Debt to the Bank as a percentage of total debt (disbursed and
outstanding) is projected to increase from 17 percent in 1975 to about 24
percent in 1985. The Bank's share in total public debt service would in-
crease from 26 percent at present to about 34 percent in 1985. Increases
in the Bank's share of debt and debt service reflect the expectation that
Swaziland would continue to receive a certain amount of its external finan-
cial assistance on grant or near-grant terms. Swaziland's exports and public
revenue prospects remain favorable and the country continues to be credit-
worthy for Bank lending. During the Fourth IDA Replenishment, Swaziland
was a blend country but, due to the favorable growth in Swaziland's econ-
omy in recent years and prospects for a continuation of this trend, we do
not at this time anticipate additional IDA lending in Swaziland.
PART III - TRANSPORT SECTOR
18.       The transport infrastructure comprises about 2,700 km of road,
220 km of railway, a 20 kcm cableway, an international airport and several
airstrips. The road network carries most import traffic. The cableway,
located in the northwest, transports asbestos over rugged terrain from
Havelock to a railhead in South Africa. There are no pipelines or navigable
rivers. Export trade and petroleum product imports are carried by the
railway which traverses central Swaziland and is linked with the Mozambique
railway and the port of Maputo.



- 6 -
19.       Development of transport in Swaziland consists largely of upgrading
existing transport links which generally provide good accessibility, but in
many cases are of poor quality. The need for selective upgrading of roads
and improving road maintenance is recognized by the Government as of high
priority.
20.       The Government's present policy is to facilitate development, par-
ticularly in rural areas, by improving transport services, expanding the
transport network in areas of high economic potential, and reducing transport
costs both within the country and between Swaziland and the neighboring coun-
tries. Investments in the transport sector, of which about 80 percent are
in road improvements, have increased sharply over the past few years from
E 396,000 in FY74 to E 6.7 million in FY77. As nearly all of Swaziland's
exports are transported by rail to Maputo for transfer to ships, the Govern-
ment has become increasingly concerned about the declining efficiency and
reliability of rail and port operations in Mozambique. Consequently, it has
been interested in developing an alternative rail route to the sea through
South Africa, and in 1977 construction of a rail link between Swaziland
Railway and the South African Railway began with government financing. The
link may have greater strategic than economic significance unless it is
accompanied by additional commercial traffic; accordingly, Government is now
exploring the possibility of developing the extensive coal reserves which are
situated in the vicinity of the new rail link. The Government formed the
Royal Swaziland National Airline in 1977 to counter Swaziland's existing
dependence on foreign air carriers and the existing routing of all inter-
national traffic through South African airports. The airline recently
acquired two used aircraft and plans to begin service in 1978 between several
countries in the region.
21.       The Department of Economic Planning and Statistics coordinates
transport planning, reviews all investment proposals and determines relative
priorities. Proposals are put forward by the various ministries, most notably
the Ministry of Works, Power and Communications (MWPC) which includes the
agencies concerned with road, rail and air transport. In order to ensure
economic criteria are applied in selecting infrastructure projects, the
Government has established a planning unit in the MWPC, staffed by a UNDP-
financed advisor. In recent years, the Government has proceeded with one or
two infrastructure projects whose primary justification has been strategic
rather than economic but, overall, its infrastructure program has been
economically justified.
22.       The officially declared highway network totals about 2,700 km of
which about half are earth roads, 40 percent have a gravel surface and eight
percent are paved. About 1,500 km are classified as main roads and the bal-
ance, district roads. Notwithstanding the low quality of much of the net-
work, traffic volumes are considerable and are growing rapidly. Traffic
flows are highest on the Mbabane-Manzini Road which carries a few thousand
vehicles per day (vpd); other main roads carry traffic of 200 to 500 vpd
while district roads support less than 200 vpd. According to recent traf-
fic counts, traffic volumes on the roads show a growth trend of about 12



- 7 -
percent per annum for light vehicles, eight percent for medium trucks and
seven percent for heavy trucks. The motor vehicle fleet more than doubled
between 1969 and 1977, and in the past few years has increased at an annual
rate of about ten percent.
23.       The Roads Branch (RB) under the MWPC is responsible for the plan-
ning, construction and maintenance of all officially designated roads. RB
headquarters in Mbabane handles planning, new construction, and periodic
maintenance; routine maintenance is done locally by three regional district
offices. While maintenance of paved roads is not yet a serious problem
because of their small aggregate length and recent construction, maintenance
of gravel and earth roads is not satisfactory because of inadequate staffing,
lack of training, insufficient and poorly maintained equipment and poor work-
shop facilities. As a result, some parts of the network have deteriorated.
In 1977, consultants financed by the Government carried out a study of RB's
functions, organization, staffing and training needs. Their report recom-
mended a three-year technical assistance and training program (1979-81) to
improve RB operations, particularly road maintenance. The Government has
accepted most of the report's recommendations and proposes to implement them.
Consulting services to irmplement the recommended technical assistance and
training programs for the RB are included in the project (para. 31).
24.       The Central Transport Organization (CTO), also under MWPC, is
responsible for buying, maintaining, and repairing all civilian government
equipment and vehicles, which are earmarked and hired out to user agencies
at established rates. CTO suffers from poor management, inadequately trained
mechanics, as well as ill-equipped and poorly located workshops. A British-
financed technical assistance team is currently undertaking a three-year
program (1977-80) to improve CTO operations. Within the short time it has
been in the country, the team has made progress and equipment availability
has increased slightly.
25.       Faced with an increasing requirement for road transport, the
Government has devoted more public funds to the upgrading of highly traf-
ficked sections of the main road system. The Third National Development
Plan (1978-82) calls for the improvement of an additional ten main road
sections totalling 370 km at an estimated cost of about US$44 million. In
addition, rural roads are being constructed under the Government's RDA Program
(para. 8), and other rural roads are being improved with assistance from
the British Government. The Government historically has financed most of
its highway improvements through loans and grants from external sources,
but in recent years it has allocated more locally-generated resources to
road construction. All recurrent and maintenance expenditures are financed
from budget sources; allocations for this purpose have increased from about
E 825,000 in 1974/75 to E 1.9 million in 1977/78, which we consider ade-
quate. Road users contribute to government revenue through taxes and duties
on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts and through licenses and regis-
tration fees. No specific data are available on total revenues collected
from road users because all customs and sales duties on goods imported into



- 8 -
the Customs Uxrion area are paid into a common revenue pool, and are dis-
bursed according to a complex formula which makes it difficult to determine
the specific ..ources of the revenue. Only the license fees, which are not
paid into the common revenue pool, are set by the Swaziland Government; this
source yieldec about E 550,000 in 1975/76.
26.       The Bank's strategy in the sector is to support programs that
assist the Government in achieving its objectives of lowering transport
costs and improving accessibility. This includes strengthening the Govern-
ment's capabi.ity to maintain its road network and improve its highway admin-
istration. Due to employment opportunities in South Africa, wage rates in
Swaziland are relatively high (E 2.50 per day minimum for unskilled labor)
and unemployment is not a substantial problem. Thus the Government has not
experimented with labor-intensive techniques in implementing its major road
construction and maintenance programs. However, where volunteer labor is
available, at'-empts are being made to construct some rural roads using labor
rather than heavy equipment.
27.       The Bank Group became involved in Swaziland's transport sector
in 1962 when the First Highway Project (Credit 20-SW) helped to finance
construction of the country's main road which extends from Oshoek on the
western border through the economic core of the country to the Mozambique
border. This project was satisfactorily completed at a cost very close to
the Bank estimate. The effect of the project on Swaziland's economy has
been substantial, particularly in lowering transport costs on the most heavily
travelled road in the country. The Second Highway Project, approved in 1975
(Loan 1108-SW), provided for construction of the Helehele-Phuzumoya road
(43 km) and the Tshaneni-Mlaula road (39 km).  During execution of the works,
a devaluation of the emalengeni enabled the Government in 1976, with Bank
approval, to expand the size of the project to include a 24 km section of
road from Phuzumoya to Big Bend, the site of a large sugar mill. The project
was completed in June 1978 at a total cost, including the road extension, of
US$9.9 million, about the same as estimated during appraisal for the original
project (excluding the road extension). In addition to the two highway
projects, a Rural Development Project (Loan 1375-SW) includes assistance
for construction of about 900 km of new access and feeder roads in some
of the more remote areas of the country.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       A study of Swaziland's transport sector, carried out in 1971 by
the University of Natal, recommended an investment program which included im-
provement of the two project roads. Feasibility studies for these and other
roads were undertaken by the same university in 1976-77 and confirmed the
earlier findings. Detailed engineering for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River
Road was carried out in 1977-78. The other project road, from Manzini to
Mhkondvo River, is the northern section of a 110 km road extending from
Manzini to Mahamba on the South African border. Detailed engineering for
the entire road was carried out in 1975 by consultants financed by the



- 9 -
African Development Bank. Because of the high construction cost estimates,
the Government recently requested other consultants to review the earlier
engineering and some economies have been achieved, particularly in road pave-
ment design. The African Development Fund (AfDF) appraised the central and
southern sections of the Manzini-Mahamba road in December 1977, at the same
time as the Bank's appraisal; all three sections of the road were found tech-
nically and economically feasible. The AfDF has approved financing for the
two sections appraised by it.
29.       A report entitled "Kingdom of Swaziland:  Third Highway Project,
Staff Appraisal Report" is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A supplementary project data sheet is given in Annex III. Nego-
tiations were held in Washington, D.C. from June 19 to June 21, 1978. The
Swaziland delegation was led by Mr. V. E. Sikhondze, Acting Permanent Secre-
tary, Ministry of Finance.
Objectives and Description of the Project
30.       The project has two primary objectives:  to assist the Government
in its goal of improving its transport network by constructing two main road
sections to paved standard; and to strengthen RB's maintenance capability
by providing technical assistance, training and equipment.
31.       The project consists of:
(i)  the construction and improvement of the following main
roads to two-lane bituminous standards:
(a)  the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road (32 km); and
(b)  the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road (32 km);
(ii) a program to strengthen road maintenance comprising:
(a) consulting services to provide RB with technical
assistance and training, including training aids and
overseas training for counterparts; and
(b) procurement of maintenance equipment and workshop
equipment and tools; and
(iii) other consulting services for supervision of construc-
tion of (i) above and detailed engineering for the Big
Bend-Nggwavuma River Road (32 km) and the Mafutseni-
Mliba Road (33 km).
32.       The Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road follows a new alignment adjacent
to an existing district road and cuts travel distance by about 4 kms. The Big
Bend-Nggwavuma River Road generally follows the existing alignment. Both
roads will have double bituminous treated surfaces which will be strengthened,
if needed, by an asphaltic concrete layer in a second stage in about ten



- Iu -
years. The roads serve substantial areas of agricultural land and carry cur-
rent traffic of 460 and 350 vehicles per day, respectively. The road design
standards are appropriate for the traffic loads which are expected to grow at
a rate of nine percent per annum.
33.       Maintenance of unpaved roads, about 90 percenr of the road network,
is generally below acceptable standards (para. 23). Periodic maintenance
has been seriously neglected but is improving now that the Government is
providing adequate budgetary allocations for maintenance. RB has a viable
maintenance organization and the project aims at strengthening its operations
by providing technical assistance and training, road maintenance equipment,
and workshop equipment and tools. The training program involves the retrain-
ing of 137 existing RB staff members and training 110 new staff over a three-
year period. A feature of the technical assistance and training program will
be a highway technicians course to be conducted at the Swaziland College of
Technology (SCOT), beginning not later than July 1, 1979 (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.03). About thirty qualified school-leavers wLll be admitted as
technician trainees to the three-year course, with six months of each year
devoted to on-the-job training in various RB sections. SCOT's facilities,
expanded and improved under the First Education Project (Credit 518-SW), are
adequate for the needs of this course. Given the existing numbers of school-
leavers, SCOT should have no difficulty in recruiting 30 qualified candidates
to train as highway technicians.
34.       The existing CTO workshop facilities are inadequate and the main
workshop is not well located to service and repair the expanding fleet of
equipment and vehicles. Under a program to be implemented with the help
of a British-financed technical assistance team (para. 24), the base work-
shop at Mbabane will be replaced by a new one at Manzini, and area work-
shops at Mbabane, Piggs Peak, Siteki and Nhlangano will be improved. The
Government will prepare, by December 31, 1978, a program, satisfactory to the
Bank, for the construction and improvement of the base and area workshops, and
carry out the program by June 30, 1980 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05). Since
there is no provision in the program for the procurement of workshop equipment
and tools which are in short supply, an amount of US$300,000 has been provided
in the project to meet the improved workshop requirements. The project also
will provide for the purchase of supplemental equipment and vehicles to enable
the RB to meet road maintenance requirements.
35.       The technical assistance included in the project will consist of
one training officer, two district engineers to supervise road maintenance
and provide on-the-job training, two clerks of works to work and provide
on-the-job training in the gravel and bitumen units, and one instructor for
equipment operators and drivers. The technical assistance personnel would
strengthen the staffing of RB's maintenance districts as well as the gravel
and bitumen units, and assist RB in implementing the training program de-
scribed in para. 33. They also will conduct seminars and short courses for
supervisors, operators and drivers. Their services will include the estab-
lishment of an RB training unit and the supply and installation of training
aids (films and slides) and equipment (projectors and casette players). In
addition, consultants would be employed to supervise construction of the



- 11 -
project roads and undertake the detailed engineering financed under the
project. Altogether, consulting services will amount to about 405 man-months
of professional staff at an average cost of about US$4,500 per man-month.
Consultants will be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
36.       At present there are no Swazi engineers available to serve as
counterparts to the consultants and therefore counterpart requirements will be
limited to one training officer, who need not be an engineer, and one equip-
ment operator/driver instructor. Government is not expected to have diffi-
culties in recruiting for these two positions. Training of the two counter-
parts will include six months of courses in instruction techniques abroad.
The Government has agreed that, by April 1, 1979, it will (i) establish two
posts of training officer and instructor of equipment operators and drivers
within RB, and (ii) recruit two Swazis to fill these positions (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.04).
Cost Estimates and Financing
37.       Total project cost is estimated at US$15.1 million (excluding
taxes amounting to about US$0.8 million); the foreign exchange component
is US$12.2 million or 81 percent. A detailed breakdown of costs is given
in the Loan and Project Summary. The proposed Bank loan of US$11.0 million
would finance 90 percent of the project's foreign exchange component, and
73 percent of total net project costs. The Government would finance US$1.2
million of foreign exchange costs and all local costs.
Project Execution
38.       RB will have overall responsibility for the execution of the
project; the CTO will assist in the procurement of road maintenance equipment
and workshop equipment and tools. Consultants financed through the project
(para. 35) will assist the RB with project implementation which will extend
over a three-year period beginning in January 1979.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Contracts for equipment and civil works will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. Construction of the two project roads, expected to cost
about US$9 million, will be executed under unit price contracts awarded to
prequalified contractors. Road maintenance equipment and workshop equipment
and tools including spares, amounting to about US$1.9 million, would also be
procured under ICB. Procurement of off-the-shelf items under US$15,000 each
will be allowed under normal government procurement procedures and conditions
which are acceptable to the Bank; the total amount of such purchases would
not exceed US$100,000. Disbursements from the loan account will be made
to meet foreign costs on the basis of: (i) 55 percent of total costs of



- 12 -
civil works; Vii) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures or 90 percent of
local expenditures for equipment, tools and spares; and (iii) 100 percent of
the foreign eypenditures or 90 percent of local expenditures for consult-
ing services. Retroactive financing of up to US$120,000 is recommended
for expenditures incurred after December 1, 1977 for the detailed engineering
of the Big Berd-Nggwavuma River Road (Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
40.       The two roads to be constructed, both major links in the national
road system, are high on the Government's list of road development priorities
and will contribute to Swaziland's principal transport aims of reducing
transport costs and aiding development. The main beneficiaries of the project
will be the direct road users, but benefits will be widely distributed among
consumers, traders and producers, including small farmers. There is substan-
tial competit-§in among operators of commercial vehicles which results in sav-
ings in vehicle operating costs being reflected in lower prices or passenger
fares.
41.       The Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road serves not only the internal
needs of an important area of commercial agriculture but also the needs of
through traffic between the border station at Lavumisa and areas north and
west of Big Bend. Although the new rail link is being built in the general
area (para. 20), the transport of sugarcane by truck is expected to continue.
While the Swaziland Sugar Milling Company in Big Bend (jointly owned by
foreign and local interests) will benefit from improvement of the Big Bend-
Nggwavuma River Road through reduced transport costs, the Government obtains
special revenues through a sugar levy which takes into account reductions in
production costs (including haulage). In addition, increased company revenues
attributable to the project are subject to a government income tax of 37.5
percent. The residual benefits are shared by the domestic and foreign owners
of the sugar company. In the end, foreign beneficiaries will receive only
about ten percent of the total transport cost savings resulting from the
Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road improvement.
42.       The Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road directly serves a productive agri-
cultural district and is also an important link in the transport artery
between the central and southern areas of the country. The northern terminus
of the road, Manzini, is the country's largest and most rapidly growing
urban center with about 30,000 population; it also is the location of the
Matsapha industrial park which contains a variety of industries including a
fertilizer plant, cotton ginnery, brewery and other plants. Sidvokodvo, near
the southern end of the road section proposed for IBRD financing, is a small
marketing and railway center on the Lusutfu River.
43.       Construction costs of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road account
for 31 percent of total costs; the improvements are expected to yield a
23 percent rate of return. Construction costs of the Manzini-Mkhondvo
River Road amount to about 37 percent of total costs, with an expected
economic rate of return of 23 percent. The project component aimed at



- 13 -
strengthening RB's capability to maintain the road network will result in
widespread benefits in terms of savings in transport costs. This component,
about 23 percent of project costs, should yield an economic rate of return
of 32 percent. The project's overall economic rate on quantified components
(90 percent of total costs) would be about 25 percent; the first year return
is 23 percent.
44.       In general, the project is not regarded as subject to unusual risks;
nevertheless, there are risks which could affect the projected economic re-
turns. One of these is the possibility that the performance of CTO in main-
taining equipment for RB may not be adequate to assure reasonable availability
of such equipment for roaLd maintenance activities; another is that the train-
ing objectives may not be fully realized. It is recognized that CTO's per-
formance in the past several years has been poor, and improvements could be
slow in realization; however, the competent, British-financed team of manage-
ment and technical specialists installed in CTO in 1977 has achieved notable
progress in the initial period of their three-year assignment. Therefore,
there is good reason to expect that CTO will be put on a sound operating basis
in the next few years. Another risk to successful project implementation is
the possibility that RB's training program may not improve maintenance oper-
ations to the extent originally planned. In any case, the road maintenance
component has been found to have a high (32 percent) economic return and the
possibility of its falling to an unacceptably low level is remote.
45.       The principal risk relating to the project's civil works component
is that actual construction costs may exceed the estimated costs. Satisfac-
tory cost experience, however, in the nearly completed road construction
financed under the Second Highway Project, provides some basis for assigning a
rather low level of risk to this factor. Nonetheless, if the construction
cost on both roads increased by 25 percent, the economic return on each would
still be 19 percent.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 1058-SW   Water Supply and Sewerage; US$3.5 Million Loan of
December 9, 1974; Effective Date: March 12, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
After earlier delays, project construction is largely complete with
the exception of sewerage extensions at Mbabane which should be completed by
the end of 1978. However, the Water and Sewerage Board's (WSB) liquid posi-
tion has been weak because of poor collection performance caused by WSB's in-
ability to establish a satisfactory accounting system. This has been largely
due to staffing difficulties and the inadequacy of computer services. The
Government has proposed establishing WSB as a parastatal, which would give WSB
wide powers to attract and retain staff. Because of the devaluation of the
rand there will be an estimated loan surplus of US$0.9 million. WSB has
prepared a number of proposals for utilizing the loan surplus, and the Govern-
ment is expected to seek Bank approval of these proposals.
Credit No. 518-SW Education; US$5 Million Credit of December 9, 1974;
Effective Date: March 11, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Implementation of the project is proceeding rapidly and the physical
execution of the project is estimated to be about 18 months ahead of appraisal
schedule. Commitments represent about 90 percent of total project cost. The
project's educational objectives are expected to be fulfilled upon completion
of the project.
Loan No. 1108-SW   Second Highway; US$7 Million Loan of May 5, 1975;
Effect:ive Date: October 13, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
During execution of the works, a devaluation of the rand enabled
the Government, with Bank approval, to expand the size of the project to
include the Phuzumoya-Big Bend road (24 km). All three roads were completed
almost on schedule, the last one in June 1978. The total project cost, in-
cluding the additional road section is estimated at US$9.9 million, about
the same as the appraisal forecast.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Loan No. 1375-SW   Rural Development; US$4 Million Loan of April 6, 1977;
Effective Date: January 27, 1978;
Closing Date: November 30, 1982
The Project became effective on January 27, 1978. However, project
implementation has been slower than anticipated because of a) limited releases
of capital by Government, causing delays in construction of project houses
and buildings, and b) lack of operable heavy equipment for land development,
provided under separate USAID financing. As a result considerable carry-over
from the 1978/79 program has been incorporated in the 1979/80 work program,
discussed during the annual donors meeting in June 1978. Training of Field
Officers at the School of Agriculture and staffing of RDA Management is satis-
factory but too much demand is being made on staff for activities outside the
Project. This and the co-ordination of work between RDA staff and the Central
Cooperative Union (providing farm inputs) needs improvement. Vehicles are
being maintained competently by the Central Transport Organization.
Loan No. 1409-SW   National Industrial Development Corporation of Swaziland
(NIDCS); US$5 Million Loan of May 12, 1977; Effective Date:
July 18, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
As of March 31, 1978, US$1.6 million of this loan had been commit-
ted. NIDCS will play a major role in promoting and financing industrial
projects under Swaziland's Third Five-Year Development Plan (1978-82).
It is expected, therefore, that the loan will be committed on schedule.
Loan No. 1478-SW   Education II:  US$4 Million Loan of August 8, 1977;
Effective Date:  November 7, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Since the loan became effective in November 1977, good progress has
been made by the Project Unit. Design work has been completed, and contracts
for Phase I construction (six schools) were awarded in January 1978. Con-
tracts for Phase II construction (five schools) were awarded in March 1978,
and for Phase III construction (six schools), in May 1978.

IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
The Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation Limited - 388-SW - Sugar Milling
The IFC investment is to help finance the development of a new
sugar complex in northeastern Swaziland to produce some 120,700 metric tons
sugar per annum, virtually all for exports.  The project is proceeding
in a satisfactory manner. The company has awarded land-clearing contracts
and is now in the process of reviewing tenders for the major items of factory
equipment.  Work has already commenced on the Government-owned earthfill
dam.
