THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 387-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Education
Project in Indonesia, for which Credit 387-IND was approved in May 1973 in
the sum of US$13.5 million. The Closing Date was December 31, 1981. The
Credit was fully disbursed.
The PCR and the Highlights resume were prepared by the Bank
Group's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The PCR is based on: (a) a
draft report prepared by the project team; (b) information obtained by a Bank
consultant, who visited Indonesia in June 1982 and met with project officials
and other staff concerned in the Ministry of Education and Culture; and (c)
material in the Bank's files relating to this project, including the Appraisal
Report (112-IND), dated May 4, 1973; the President-s Report (P 1256-IND)
dated May 8, 1973; and the Development Credit Agreement, dated June 1, 1973.
The draft PCR was discussed informally with government officials
in Indonesia in October 1982. Copies of the draft PCR were sent to the
representatives of the Borrower as well as to the co-financier in March 1983.
Comments received from the co-financier (Canadian International Development
Agency) are reproduced as Attachment I. No comments have been received from
the Borrower.
The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

INDONESIA
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 387-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A credit of US$13.5 million equivalent to assist in financing the
Third Education Project in Indonesia was approved in May 1973 and signed in
June 1973. The project wvas estimated to be completed by December 1981 and to
cost US$39.2 million. The project objective was to support the Government-s
strategy to improve the quality of primary education through an integrated
program of textbooks and training courses for teachers and supervisory
personnel. The project wqas to finance the provision of 138 million textbooks,
the in-service training of 350,000 primary teachers, and the upgrading of
2,800 supervisory personnel.    The Canadian Government, through the Canadian
International Development: Agency (CIDA), provided a loan of Can$ll.2 million
to Indonesia to cover the cost of paper for textbook production.
During the course of the project, the focus changed towards
increasing the number of textbooks, in line with the aims of Repelita II to
achieve an 85% enrollmenl: ratio of primary school-age children by 1979. The
final cost of the projecl: was US$104.4 million. The Government financed the
additional amount needed. Disbursements were slow due to delays in textbook
production but the-credit: was fully disbursed as of January 15, 1982 and no
formal extension of the closing date was necessary.
The project has achieved, and in most cases exceeded, the quanti-
tative targets set at appraisal. The qualitative aspects are more difficult
to determine. The final number of books produced was 280 million, as against
an appraisal estimate of 138 million (Table 4.1). However, most of these were
reprints of existing books, with no improvement in book content (para. 4.03).
The number of teachers and supervisory staff upgraded under the project also
exceeded appraisal expectations (para. 4.09, and Table 4.2).
The main problem was that of the limited capacity of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) in terms of qualifications and experience of
personnel in textbook development (para. 4.02). In addition, key staff were
employed only on a part-t:ime basis. The physical standards of books varied.
Technical specifications for printing and binding were not clearly spelled out
in the appraisal report t:herefore quality control of these aspects was diffi-
cult (para. 4.06). There were also problems in distribution. Books sometimes
arrived late and quantities did not always match enrollment figures (para.
4.07). The complexity of the whole book production process was underestimated
at appraisal, although this was perhaps inevitable since the project was the
first of its kind ever undertaken by the Bank.



- iv -
Experience galned under the project reflects the need for:
(a)  a permanent institution, adequately staffed with qualified
personnel, capable of carrying out the integrated activities
of textbook development, production and distribution;
(b)  a strong linkage between curriculum and manuscript develop-
ment; and
(c)  an efficient distribution system.
Lessons learned from the project are useful for other learning aids projects
and have been taken into consideration in the design of the Second Textbook
Project in Indonesia.



SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Project Objectives
1.        The stated main project objective was to support the Government's
program to improve the quality of primary education in Indonesia through an
integrated program of textbooks, teachers' guides, in-service teacher training
courses and special courses to upgrade supervisory personnel. (Achievements
under a parallel INPRES project carried out concurrently with the Third
Education Project are given in Annex 1).
Project Description
2.        The project comprised four main components:
(a) development of existing arrangements for the preparation
and testing of basic texts and related prototype teaching
aids;
(b) planning and financing of the production and distribution
of 138 million textbooks in four subjects (Bahasa Indonesia,
mathematics, science and social studies) for grades I-VI;
(c) in-service training of 350,000 primary teachers in the use
of textbooks and teaching aids and
(d) upgrading of 2,800 supervisory personnel.
The implementation schedule attached to the appraisal report (Annex 2) shows
the phasing of project activities to assist the Borrower "in integrating
existing curriculum development activities, book production and primary
teacher training programs." The project provided for 16 man-years of
technical assistance, and 8 man-years of fellowships in the teaching of modern
mathematics. The Loan Agreement with CIDA set out the conditions for the
procurement of Can$13 million worth of paper for the 138 million books.
Project Outcomes and Lessons Learned
3.        The Government's first priority was to print and distribute
textbooks to primary school pupils so as to meet the Repelita target of an 85%
enrollment ratio by 1978/79. The Government exceeded the original project
targets for production of textbooks, and inservice training of 350,000
teachers and 2,800 supervisors. The proiect produced not less than 280
million textbooks and trained 1.5 million teachers and supervisors. The
performance of the small PIU with limited technical skills in meeting
quantitative targets is impressive. Disbursement delays occurred as a result
of late textbook production schedules. Nevertheless, total disbursements of



US$13.5 million were completed without any need to extend the closing date of
December 31, 1981. The Government met the formal requirements set out in the
covenants of the Development Credit Agreement.
4.         Institution building was not adequately emphasized in -roject
design. Book content suffered because of staffing constraints in the PIU and
the lack of technical knowledge of the book production process. The project
design did not reflect:
(a) the complexity of textbook publishing in terms of
technical skills and time required to plan and manage
textbook development activities;
(b) the need for close and continuous links with curriculum
development in manuscript development;
(c) the need for a permanent government institution with
sufficient professional technical staff; and
(d) the need for an effective national distribution system
that would ensure timely availability of books
throughout Indonesia.
The PIU book production staff became rapidly overstretched in trying tco manage
the procurement of printing and distribution services to ensure availability
of books throughout the islands. It is not surprising that issues in
implementation arose. There were deficiencies in book content, physical
standards of books and the availability of books to pupils and teacher
training courses.
5.        The Government, at an early stage, identified these issues in its
preparation for the Second Textbook Project. The Second Project reflects the
Government's recognition of the need to correct these problems by: (a) esta-
blishing a permanent textbook publishing institution within the Ministry of
Education and Culture (MEC); (b) introducing an improved national distribution
system for textbooks; and (c) strengthening the curriculum development
function to make necessary adjustments in curriculum and provide better
support for the textbook publishing function.
6.        The Second Textbooks Project was approved by the Board on March 16,
1982 and became effective on June 14, 1982.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The PCR is based on draft reports prepared by the Borrower and by
Mr. W.M. Matheson, (Project Administrator). Further information was
supplied by Mr. J. Overton, consultant, who visited Indonesia in June 1982
and met with project officials and other staff concerned in the MEC.
The final report also dratws on the following sources of information:
(a) records, inventories and statistical data available in
the Bank;
(b) Bank supervision reports, project documents and letters from
the early 1970s, including the Development Credit Agreement,
the appraisal report and working papers, and the quarterly
reports prepared by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU);
(c) various studies and evaluations including mission reports and
other periodic reviews of the UNESCO team which assisted the PIU,
reports of other consultants, evaluation in Indonesia of project
performance carried out by joint teams of the PIU and the MEC's
Office of Research and Development (BP3K), evaluations made by
international consultants in conjunction with BP3K; and
(d) reports of, and discussions with, other Indonesian and inter-
national educators either involved or seriously concerned with
project success.
The PCR was reviewed by Mr. Eklund, with assistance from Ms. C. Bayulken.
1.02      The PCR analyzes the performance of the Borrower and the Bank during
project preparation and implementation. The Third Education Project was the
first large textbook project funded jointly by a national government and the
Bank. It is also an early example of co-financing with another government
(Canada). Lessons learned from project experience have been integrated into
the design of the Indonesian Second Textbook Project and are also relevant
for other learning aids projects.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
2.01      The Development Credit Agreement was signed on June 1, 1973 and
became effective on August 29, 1973. At the time of the final supervision
mission by the Bank in November 1981, the project was considered to have been
"virtually completed with success".   The credit amount was fully disbursed
as of January 15, 1982 and there was no need to extend the closing date.
2.02      The Government has formally met the covenants of the Development
Credit Agreement although the evaluation function was not carried out as
planned. All the quantitative objectives of the project were exceeded and
this caused total project cost to rise from US$39.2 million to US$104.4
million.
Credit Effectiveness
2.03      The Credit became effective as planned on August 29, 1973, after
the Borrower had met two special conditions:
(a) The PIU had been established and the Project Director and his
principal staff had been approved by the Bank.
(b) A CIDA Loan had been legally agreed upon between the Indonesian
and Canadian governments for the supply of textbook paper from
Canadian paper mills.
Project Changes
2.04      During implementation, the following changes were made in the design
and execution of the project:
(a) The general teachers' guides in the four subjects and the social
studies atlas for primary schools were excluded.
(b) The annual in-service teacher training was expanded to include
the training of newly appointed INPRES teachers and teachers from
religious schools which were following the same Curriculum 75. The
numbers of mobile tutors and primary school centers were not
correspondingly increased.



- 5 -
(c) The number of textbooks printed increased from a planned 138
million to 280 million, well above appraisal targets because of
high primary school enrollments.
(d) The two-weekly meetings of teachers and mobile tutors, after annual
training in primary school centers, were abolished, partly because
no funds were made available for these activities.
(e) The in-service teacher training proceeded without planned project
textbooks because printing schedules fell two to three
years behind the upgrading program. The project training instead
used trial versions of texts, older unrevised books and revision
notes.
(f) A program evaluator [Credit Agreement Section 3.03(d)] was not
appointed to the team assisting the PIU, instead joint PIU/BP3K
teams evaluated project effectiveness.
(g) In accordancie with ministry regulations, yearly changes were made
in appointments to the main PIU positions.
Project Management
2.05      The Project Director and his principal assistants were appointed as
planned and, in the first 2-3 years, they were assisted by two largely part-
time Executive Directors. In the later years the posts of Project Director
and PIU Director were separated (see Chart 1), leaving a part-time
Director of the PIU to deal with all matters related to the Bank as well as
with his own substantive tasks as Head of the Planning Section of the
Directorate General of Primary and Secondary Education. In practice,
project decisions were taken by the Director in meetings with senior
officials of the Directorate General, with BP3K or with special committees
appointed for specific tasks such as formulating teacher training curricula
or awarding printing contracts. The project lacked middle-level staff with
sufficient seniority and authority to influence activities varying from
manuscript tryouts to textbook distribution and teacher training at the
dissemination stage.
Manuscript Testing and Revisions
2.06      At appraisal, the Borrower's Committee of Eleven /1 was charged with
the responsibility of integrating all curriculum development activities
/1 Committee of Planning Coordination and Supervision of Pilot Projects of
Comprehensive Schools.



- 6 -
including approvals of manuscript testing, formulation of syllabuses arLd
teaching methods. After the Committee was disbanded in the first year of the
project, ad hoc committees were formed, generally under the leadership of
senior officials of BP3K or the Directorate General of Primary and Secondary
Education. Consensus meetings gave final approval for the reviF'ons of
manuscripts.
2.07      The project aimed at improving the quality of book content
through testing and revision of manuscripts. A total of 50 schools were
chosen for tryouts in four areas: Kuningan in West Java, Lampung in Southern
Sumatra, Bone in South Sulawesi and Yogyakarta in Central Java. GuideLines
setting out the schedules for testing both teachers and pupils were drawn up
in consultation with BPP specialists. The tests relied heavily on recall
items in multiple choice questions. With 50 schools x 45 pupils x 4 subjects
x 6 grades x 3 semesters, data quickly accumulated. More than a hundred
thousand items were submitted to statistical significance testing and annual
analyses. In spite of the specially appointed staff in the four regional
areas, results were delayed by poor communication, lack of funds and pressure
of work on PIU staff. Training in testing objectives and methods was given
to 200 try-out teachers from the field for two weeks each year. Writers
teams received scores from the testing before revision meetings, but the
final analyses of results were usually not available to them.
Paper Procurement
2.08      Co-financing with CIDA provided Can$13 million for textbook paper
to be purchased from any of six Canadian paper mills. Approximately US$11.2
million was disbursed and the balance cancelled because of a legal dispute in
Canada related to procurement. Canadian paper was used eventually for only
the grade I-IV textbooks and guides, leaving some grade IV texts and all of
grade V and VI to be printed on paper from Indonesian mills.
2.09      The shift to domestic procurement led to many months delay in book
printing. From late 1977, the project purchased local paper of varying
quality from Letjes, Basuki Rachmat and other paper mills. Negotiations
directly with paper mills and with Indonesian paper merchants were
protracted, because of variation in pricing policies, a November 15, 1978
devaluation of the rupiah and procedural difficulties.
2 10      The paper, both Canadian and local, was ordered in 62 x 86 cm
sheet size. A policy firmly enforced during the life of the project favored
bids of the many smaller printers with offset machines instead of the fewer
larger firms with web-fed machines. No color work was attempted under the
project, although the previous project (PBSD), used limited color in its
language texts.



2.11      The project's procurement officers handled all matters of paper
specifications and bulk ordering. A paper consultant with experience from
the Philippines Third Education Project was employed for a month, but as
late as 1978, which reduced the possible impact of his recommendations. His
two reports advised on more appropriate paper specifications and recommended
some US$5,000 worth of paper testing equipment for the Pusat Grafika
Indonesia (PGI) laboratory.
Textbook Printing and Dlstribution
2.12      Printing contracts, each comprising 800,000 to 1,150,000 copies of
textbooks and guides were tendered to local printers in Jakarta and elsewhere
after their prequalification by the Secretary General of the MEC. Delays,
stemming not from the printers, but from the lengthy revision and clearance
procedures and time-consuming procurement of paper meant that project
textbooks were not printed in time for: (a) the annual upgrading of 1,200
mobile tutors; (b) the subsequent training of primary teachers; and (c) use
in the schools in the following academic year. Printing and distribution
were running 2-3 years behind the yearly teacher upgrading schedules and a
decision was made in the second half of 1977 to proceed with the teacher and
tutor training despite the delayed availability of the books.
2.13      The content of the books became of concern at the project
midpoint. Neither the PIU nor PGI trained or employed any quality control
staff.  A publishing consultant was employed for three months in 1977, but by
this time it was too late to hire publishing experts such as full-time
editors during revisions, art director, and layout specialists. Project
textbook production remained largely book printing rather than educational
publishing. Independent evaluations of manuscripts, rigorous revisions,
editing, consultations with teachers, written contracts for illustrators and
designers, were beyond the abilities of the small PIU Book Production
Section. Revisions were attempted but editorial control was absent.
2.14      Textbooks were distributed as soon as printing contracts were
completed. Distribution at first was the responsibility of the printers;
later, private distribul:ors were employed by the PIU to distribute the books
as far as designated points of delivery in the regencies or in the districts
(Chart 2). Books took one month to reach schools in Java and from 6-12
months to reach schoools in the outlying islands. Private distributors were
reasonably efficient in delivering project books given the logistical
difficulties encountered. Bank supervision missions, PIU specialists and
staff monitored the distribution. Without adequate storage at points of
delivery, book quality suffered, a problem identified during project
monitoring.
Vehicles and Equipment
2.15      The value of signed contracts of equipment and vehicles was
US$2.8 million. The borrower procured vehicles to the total value of



- 8 -
US$1.1 million: 105 minibuses for mobile tutor teams, 21 jeeps for pro-
vincial subunits of 17 out of 27 provinces, a pick-up and van for the PIU and
1,635 motorcycles for supervisors at district level. The districts were
reorganised during the first two years of the project and the number of
administrative units rose from 2,312 to 3,242. This led to a delay in the
consignment of vehicles but all contracted vehicles arrived in Jakarta and
were dispatched to provinces by the end of 1975. The five jeeps and two
boats were not procured since they were provided under a parallel INPRES
project.
2.16      The Borrower procured equipment to a total value of US$1.7 million.
Twenty-nine equipment contracts totalling US$1.16 million were awarded
through ICB. All equipment was distributed by the end of 1976, except for
1,054 microscopes dispatched later. Minor damage and missing items were
reported. The use of equipment varied. The better mobile tutors used the
sets of mathematics and science equipment and they were able to make
equipment from local materials, which was a project objective.
Teacher Training and Mobile Tutor System
2.17      The teacher training system was implemented as planned, except that
almost no two-weekly meetings of upgraded teachers took place in the primary
school centers. The system relied upon the PIU selecting 20-30 core tutors
each year, orienting them to project design and objectives and organising
annual 2-3 week courses for them to train 1,200 mobile tutors. Tutors were
drawn generally from the secondary teachers colleges and universities; mobile
tutors were selected from the staff of primary teacher training schools,
provincial education administrations or, in some provinces, from primary
school headmasters with first degrees. After training, mobile tutors returned
to their provinces. For 6 months of the year, with project minibuses and
equipment, they provided 12-day upgrading courses in the designated primary
school centers of each district. With additional numbers of teachers from
INPRES and religious schools to be trained in the later years of the project,
the number of primary school centers in the provincial networks becamte
insufficient. The class size in teacher training was often as high as 60 or
120, to the detriment of effective learning.
Technical Assistance and Fellowships
2.18      The formal technical assistance requirement was largely fulfilled
(Annex 3). Upon signing in mid-1973, five UNESCO specialists assisting BP3K
were requested to give some of their time to the Third Education Project.
This arrangement lasted till January, 1976 when the Borrower contracted with
UNESCO to recruit and fund three specialist educators. This arrangement



- 9 -
provided for 8 man-years, later extended by 18 months for the
administrator/programmer, and for US$70,000 allocated for fellowships, an
increase of US$30,000 above the appraisal estimate. Three project
administrators went overseas on one-month study tours in the teaching of
modern mathematics in 1978.
2.19      Posts were advertised for four Indonesian consultants to assist
the PIU: an evaluator, a manuscript specialist, a book publisher and a
teacher trainer. The project was able to identify and appoint only the
teacher trainer who was employed for 18 months by direct contract. PIU,
through direct contracts, engaged one international paper consultant for one
month and a publishing consultant for three months in 1978.
Covenants
2.20      All Credit Agreement Covenants were formally met but for minor
details.  Covenants are listed in Annex 4.    Covenant 3.03 asked for an
evaluator whose task was listed as "continuous assessment of project
progress" but his post was not filled. Joint PIU/BP3K teams took over this
task. Covenant 3.04 set out the need for testing both manuscripts and
teacher guides, whereas 3.05 referred to testing only of textbook manuscripts.
This omission may have contributed at the margin to the fact that teacher
guides were not tested, which would have been desirable.
2.21      The project aimed to "enable primary school teachers to make their
own teaching aids" and Covenant 3.07 set out the corresponding procedures.
In hindsight at least, this proved an excessively ambitious task for the
project. Much time was expended on how to develop the prototype teaching
aids kit. Items were evaluated in tryout schools. Meanwhile, BP3K began
on its own to develop a prototype manufactured kit and this hindered devel-
opment of a comprehensive plan for producing and distributing such kits.
Bank Performance
2.22      The Bank discussed possible funding of education projects as early
as January, 1969. Bank participation in project generation was slight, since
the National Assessment of Education team was already actively involved in
planning educational strategy and investments. The project was visited by 14
supervision missions, an average of approximately 10 days per year. The
Bank's Resident Mission in Indonesia kept in more regular contact through its
general educator and other staff.
2.23      The project was the first large-scale textbook project to be funded
by the Bank. It was complex and its quantities exceeded appraisal estimates.
It is not surprising that issues emerged related both to quality and impact of
its publishing and teacher training aspects and that the project became
classified within the Bank as a problem project. The intensity of supervision
follow-up may have been too low at least in the formative stage of the
project. An implicit decision seems to have been taken early on that



- 10 -
institution building issues were too difficult for the Bank to get involved
with and that a different and new departure was necessary. From 1978
onwards, the Bank directed its efforts towards promoting a planned second
textbook project.
III. PROJECT COSTS
Capital Cost
3.01      At appraisal, the project was costed at US$39.2 million to be funded
by the Government of Indonesia, the World Bank, and with a loan from the
Government of Canada for paper consumption. With expanded book production
requirements, the actual project cost reached US$104.4 million and the
appraisal estimate was exceeded by US$65.2 million. The table below shows
that the Government s own contribution increased from US$13.5 million to
US$79.3 million.

3.02      Actual allocations of the proceeds of the US$13.5 million credit
were largely in line with those estimated in the appraisal report. About
US$1.8 million of the unallocated funds were used for book printing and
distribution.

Unit Cost
3.03      The accounting procedures under the project were not organized so as
to obtain readily available data on actual project cost by function and unit
costs for each expenditure category. With few staff and limited technical
skills in the PIU, Bank consultants and supervision missions were unable to
improve accounting procedures and obtain cost performance data. Book sizes
varied considerably with about 70% of production having fewer than 100 pages.
For the purpose of comparison with implicit unit costs estimated at the time
of appraisal, total project cost was divided by quantities of books produced
to yield an average book production unit cost. On this basis, the average
production unit cost becomes US$0.37 as against an implicit appraisal estimate
of US$0.28, which comparison implies a unit cost increase of about 30%. A
precise comparison of textbook costs was made for the appraisal of the Second
Textbook Project and this comparison can be drawn upon. Primary level
textbooks (with a modal size of 212 pages) developed by the Third Education
Project, in December 1981 prices, cost US$0.36 for paper and printing and
US$0.39 when costs of manuscript development and distribution are included.
These costs compare with US$0.38 and US$0.58 respectively, for books to be
developed under the Second Textbook Project. The difference in unit costs of
books between the Third Education Project and the Second Textbook Project
reflects the emphasis in the new project on improving the content and design
of books, through improved writing, supervised tryout, field testing of
manuscripts, printing in more than one color and improved delivery.



- 12 -
Disbursement
3.04      Actual disbursements lagged a year behind appraisal estimates.    The
appraisal report estimated that a quarter of the credit would be withdrawn
before the end of 1975, but significant withdrawals began in 1976. The
disbursement schedule was revised in mid-1978 because major printing contracts
were behind schedule.
IV. OPERATING OUTCOMES
Overview
4.01      The project achieved its quantitative aims, and in certain areas
considerably exceeded the targets indicated in the appraisal report. This is
a considerable achievement since the project was the first of its kind to be
undertaken by both the Indonesian Government and the Bank. The qualitative
aspects of the project are, however, more difficult to determine.
Project Management
4.02      Project implementation suffered because of understaffing and lack of
technical and managerial know-how. The major weakness was the undermanning
of the PIU. Sufficient professional staff were not available to support the
Directors and principal Assistant Directors. The project in any one year was
one of 12 to 15 uncoordinated publishing entities within the MEC. The frag-
mentation unnecessarily taxed already scarce technical staff. PGI provided
some assistance in publishing and in training book production staff, but
although PIU staff were hard working and enthusiastic they were handicapped
because of limited training and an inadequate staffing structure.    Staff were
not available on a full-time basis and additional technical staff or outside
specialists were not hired. The full-time/part-time issue was frequently
discussed among project leaders and advisors both during and between the
six-monthly Bank supervision missions. It was never solved, partly because of
the career structure of the civil service and partly because additional costs
of a realistic or adequate project staffing level were not budgeted for.
Manuscript Development
4.03      The project provided for development of new and revised texts and
reprinting of worn-out books for the primary level (see Table 4.1). The
appraisal report did not specify how many new titles would be produced, which
would have been a more meaningful indicator of the effort expected to improve
book content. Instead targets were expressed in printed number of books

/a Including teachers' guides.
Note: The figures refer to number of books produced not titles.
(Annex 5).  Under the project not less than 98 million new books were planned.
Achievements were far less and only 25 million new books in social studies
represented new titles.   Several factors contributed to the shortfall in
meeting the targets to improve book content: (a) the curriculum imposed
restraints on the writers' teams; (b) training in textbook writing techniques
was not provided to the writers and the writers were not involved in design
and execution of try-outs; and (c) staff with publishing experience was not
available.
4.04      Delays of tryout of printed materials and teaching aids, late
receipt of testing materials and difficult communications between headquarters
and the tryout schools made revisions less efficient than they might have
been./l
Book Production
4.n5      The project was very successful in meeting quantitative targets.
The Government's aim, and particularly that of the MEC, was to get the
books out first and foremost, and this was certainly achieved. Book
production quantities were considerably increased in line with the Second
Five-Year Plan objective to reach an 85% enrollment ratio of primary
/1 Report of the Pre-Investment Study on Textbook Development and Other Book
Projects in Indonesia, by the Working Committee of the Pre-Investment
Study Team on Textbook and Learning Materials under the authority of the
Minister of Education and Culture, November 1978.

school-age children by 1979. Book production under the project was originally
scheduled for 1974/75-1978/79 and comprised 138 million books. Production
actually began in 1975 and ended in December 1981. At project completion, 280
million books had been produced (Table 4.1).
Physical Standards
4.06      Physical standards of books varied.     Technical specifications for
paper, binding, type of wire and quality of adhesive were not clearly spelled
out in the appraisal report. As a result, uncertainty prevailed about- the
standards to be used in monitoring of printing and binding procurement.
Procurement control was also inadequate for the volume of paper involved.
Subcontracting by printers contributed to inferior physical standards. A
paper consultant was hired, hut only five years after the signing of the
Credit Agreement. The consultant advised on the prequalification of paper
mills, procurement procedures, paper specifications, strengthened covers with
a moisture harrier and the need to train quality control personnel. At this
late stage little effective action could be taken. Technical advice early in
the life of the project would have been desirable, but was not included in the
project design.
Distribution
4.07       The project printed and distributed to the schools 280 million
books, which was a considerable achievement. There were some major logistical
problems in a distribution scheme which covered several thousand islands. It
is not surprising, therefore, that books did not always arrive on time and
that numbers of books did not always match enrollment figures. A factor which
further complicated distribution was that project production schedules did not
allow sufficient time for distribution. In some cases, 6-12 months were
required for distribution of books to the remoter areas.
4.08       Project management acted to improve and speed up distribution.     A
separate Assistant Director for Distribution was appointed and responsibility
for distribution was transferred from printers to commercial expeditors.
Early attention to the need for system design, storage facilities and
monitoring and control systems probably would have contributed to more
efficient distribution.
Training of Teachers and Supervisors
4.09      The system for in-service training relied on mobile tutors and
was well implemented. Core tutors employed by the project gave three weeks
upgrading courses to 1,200 tutors annually. Tutors then returned to their
provinces and spent on average six months per year travelling in project vans
from one designated primary school center to another in their region. Every
teacher was required to participate in two or more courses. Teacher training

equipment was provided to 2,200 centers.    Similar equipment was provided to
the primary teacher training school home bases where the tutors had their
regular employment. Later, tutors were increasingly drawn from the ranks of
headmasters, education officers and supervisors rather than regular teaching
staff. In addition to mobile tutors, the project was responsible for
upgrading all supervisors at regency and district level, the headmaster, and
teachers in all provinces. Table 4.2 gives actual achievements in training
and upgrading.
4.10      Technical Assistance.   The Credit Agreement provided for a
five-man technical assistance team to complement the Indonesian staff of the
PIU. Specialists were provided to the project from the UNDP/UNESCO Program
as agreed between the Bank and the Government.    This solution did not prove
entirely satisfactory since the professional background of some of the
specialists assigned through RP3K (para. 2.18) did not meet the requirements.
4.11      The terms-of-reference for the technical assistance team did not
single out book publish:ing as one of the posts to be filled. Subsequently,
the Bank made continued recommendations for a strengthened technical
assistance effort with emphasis on book publishing, but these recommendations
proved largely ineffective.

4.12      Nor was the fellowship program helpful in generating adequiate
skills in publishing. The project included provision for 8 man-years of
fellowships in the teaching of mathematics. No provision was made for
fellowships in other subjects such as book production and manuscript
development. Limited training in the technical aspects of book production
was provided by PGI but this training focused on the printing rather than
publishing aspects.
Evaluation
4.13      The PIU, with assistance from BP3K and visiting Bank supervision
missions, over time satisfactorily monitored progress under the project.
Necessary evaluations of the effectiveness of teacher training, the quality
of hook content, and the utilization of books in schools were more ,lifficult
to organize and execute.
4.14      A professional evaluator was to have been appointed to assess
project progress. The evaluator was to focus on the teacher training aspects,
such as the effectiveness of the mobile teams and participation rates in
training sessions (Credit Agreement, Article III, Section 3.03(d)). The
evaluator was not hired, instead BP3K teams increasingly assumed
responsibility for the evaluation. Reporting procedures were not spelled out
and introduced at the outset. riffuse or inconsistent data complicated the
analysis. The need for a continuous evaluation in regard to the testing of
manuscripts was emphasized at the stage of project design and was reflected in
the appraisal report.   In the first few years of the project, an extensive
program of manuscript testing was undertaken and basic pedagogical and design
problems were revealed.
4.15      The manuscript testing program was followed in the mid-1970s by
national assessments of scholastic achievements by BP3K. These assessments
also focused on the utilization of books in schools. 9ank supervision
missions by 1977 had begun to observe that the process for utilization of
books in schools deserved attention. Teachers did not always give books to
students and it was suggested to the PIU that information campaigns should be
undertaken to encourage demand for books among students and parents.
4.16      Meaningful evaluation activities within a project context presume
that authority and sufficient staff and other resources are availahle to take
corrective action, once deficiencies in project design and implementation are
detected.  The major reason why evaluation reports that became available over
time did not lead to raised standards and effectiveness was probably that
project management was already overtaxed because of the Government-s unfore-
seen demand for additional book production. Additional resources and skills
most probahly would have been available if the complexities of textbook
publishing with emphasis on book content had been adequately understood and
foreseen at the outset and reflected in project design. Wlithout the necessarv
institution building and project design, possibilities for effective action to



- 17 -
improve book content are limited even in the best of circumstances. In
hindsight, the question can be asked, whether Bank supervision missions early
on should have foreseen how limited the capacity was for improving the
qualitative aspects of the project.
Vehicles and Equipment
4.17      Appraisal targets for quantity and expenditures for vehicles and
equipment were met with the exception of those items noted in para. 2.15.
Budgetary provisions for operating costs were made and all vehicles were well
used.
4.18      The equipment was for primary school centers selected by the PIU
training center, the teacher training schools for primary teachers, teacher
home bases and mobile tutor vehicles. The equipment with minor exceptions
appears to have been well used.

Dear Mr. Kupar,
Re: Project Completion Report - Indonesia
Third Education Project (CR. 387-IND)
Reference your letter of 31 March, your report has been reviewed
by several of our Officers who were involved in the planning and
implementation of our component of the project.
The material included in the report related to our component is
accurate except that the amount disbursed should read 11.2 million
amnded   (Cdn.) not (LIS). Unfortunately we find the section lacking in
content and detail, particularly we would like to see some
information on:
For purposes of  1. How many text books were printed with Canadian paper?
evaluation, of  2. Was the paper of suitable quality?
considers these  3. What was the waste factor?
iasues too      4. Was the waste factor reasonable?
rrovw focussed. 5. Did the textbooks stand-up to the intended use?
6. Why we weren't advised sooner about the
dimentional problem?
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the draft
report>,
Youm truly,
Terrv Brown
