INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO,MMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$13.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Education
Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Indonesia is dealt with in paragraphs 2-8 of
the President's Report on the proposed development credit to the Republic
of Indonesia for a Third Highways Project (Report No. P-12500-IND dated
May 2, 1973).   The country data sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's twenty-ninth operation in
Indonesia bringing the total of IDA funds committed to US$374.0 million.
For a review of Bank Group lending in Indonesia, reference is made to paragraphs
9-15 of the President's Report on the proposed Third Highways Project (see
paragraph 2 above).   Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
as of Marsh 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of on going projects.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
4.        Indonesia's education sector, like most of the country's administrative
system, is still recovering from the years of economic and political dislocation
prior to 1966.   Further, the sector has been subjected to considerable strain
as a consequence of the rapid increase in enrollments in recent years.    The
magnitude of the problem is indicated by the expected increase in primary
school enrollments, from 14 million to 19 million, between 1970 and 1979.
The country's teaching force remained frozen at 1968 levels till last year when
the appointment of about 10,000 new teachers relieved some of the pressure
resulting from increased enrollment.
5.        The qualitative deficiencies of the educational system stem in large
part from the fact that its expansion was without reference to a long-term
plan and lacked sufficient regard to the needs of the country.    Primary
education is characterized by untrained teachers imparting routine skills by
rote learning, without the help of even elementary teaching materials.    The
meagre educational attainments of the average primary school leaver in a country
where 40 percent of the population is illiterate, is an important, though not
the sole, factor handicapping education at higher levels. Secondary school
curricula are almost entirely academic and outdated;



vocational education suffers from under--staffing, lack of equipment and the
general tendency to regard it as a poor substitute for general education.
6.        The level of expenditure on formal education illustrates, and
partly explains, its shortcomings.    In 1970/71, the central govermnent spent
about Hp 58 billion ($138 million equivalent) on education and training; this is
slightly above $1.00 per capita which compares with $13.0 (1971) in Korea and
$17.0 (1970) in Malaysia.
7.        The Government is aware of the need to improve the quality of education.
In 1969 it undertook, in collaboration with the Ford Foundation, a comprehensive
ITlational Assessment of Education".  The Assessment, now nearing completion, is
expected to form the basis for an educational development plan which is being
prepared for the 1974-79 period.
3.        Pending the completion and review oi the Assessment, the Bank Group
has attempted to assist in alleviating identifiable manpower shortages and in
upgrading priority areas in the edueation sector, bearing in mind that the
investments should not limit the options for subsequent reforms.    In pursuance
of this objective, the Association has extended: (i) a $4.6 million credit in
1970 for five technical training centers and (ii) a $6.3 million credit in 1972
to improve middle level agricultural training.    Following initial delays in
the appointment of consult-nt architects, both projects are now progressing
satisfactorily.
9.        The Bank Group is in close contact with the Government and the agencies
involved in the preparation of lhe Assessment.    A Sector Survey Mission,
planned for later this year, wiLl discuss the study's findings with a view to
determining the help which the Bank Group could extend in the financing of
further education developments.
10.       The Assessment's preliminary findings in respect of primary education
were made available to the Bank Group prior to the appraisal of the proposed
project.   The Government and the Bank Group agree on the crucial importance
of upgrading the quality of primary education because this is the only form of
education available to most Indonesians.    Also, the establishment of an
efficient and modern secondary school system depends oni raising the level of
achievement of primary school graduates entering the next level.    The Assessment
points out that the present primary system is inadequate to perform its two basic
functions: (a) to equip the majority of its students for direct entry into
employment and (b) to select ancd prepare able students for further education.
11.       The lack of effectiveness of the primary school system in the
fulfillment of these two objectives can be ascribed largely to the present
methods of learning and teaching.    The modernization of the primary school curriculum
in 1968 has been of little benefit because teaching practices continue to stress
rote learning and memorization.   The failure to improve teaching methods is due
to factors such as overcrowding in schools, lack of equipment, and most
import:nitly, a severe shortage cf textbooks.   The Assessment found that, on
average, a class of 35-40 students had only 8 textbooks.    Further, of the
country's 350,000 primary school teachers, less than half have completed a 3-year
post secondary training course.



-3-
12.       The Government has made some progress in increasing the supply of
textbooks.   Since 1969, with assistance from UNICEF and the Canadian
Government, it has carried out a program of textbook preparation and production.
This program is part of a ten-year plan (1969-79) to distribute over 200
million textbooks, enough to provide every primary student with a text in
four basic subjects: Bahasa Indonesia (the national language), mathematics,
social studies and science.   By 1974, about 62 million textbooks will have
been provided under the program.    There is therefore need for a further
138 million books, which will be provided as part of the proposed project.
13.       This investment in textbooks, however, will have limited results until
the teachers are able to use them effectively.    The training of teachers to
master the content of, and techniques for using the textbooks is one of the
Government's main objectives during its Second Five Year DevelopmentPlan (1974-79).
Apart from providing the textbooks, the proposed project aims, as explained in
Part IV below, to improve the quality of teacher training.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
14.       The proposed project consists of:
a) the provision of about 138 million textbooks in four basic
subjects for students in grades 1-6 in Indonesia's secular primary
schools during the 1974-79 period;
b) the in-service training of about 350,000 primary teachers in the
use of the textbooks and other relevant teaching aids, and;
c) the upgrading of about 2,500 supervisory personnel.
Textbook Development. Production and Distribution:
15.       The on-going textbook production program has already been mentioned
in paragraph 12 above.    By May of 1972, 27 million books had been produced and
distributed.   The program, which includes the development of suitable texts,
has been fairly successful but experience proves that testing and evaluation of
new texts prior to distribution is essential.    The proposed proJect envisages
that existing arrangements for the testing and revision of new texts will be
further developed by the Government.



16.        At present, the Government's textbook production program is being
assisted by the Government of Canada who are jointly supplying the paper required.
As for the proposed project, the Canadian Government will continue to supply the
paper needed for the 138 million textbooks included in the proposed project (24
thousand metric tons).  The printing and distribution costs of the textbooks,
amounting to an estimated $7.0 mnillion, will be financed from the proceeds of
the proposed credit.
'Leacher Training
17.       A six-year in-service training program for primary school teachers,
concentrating on improved classroom techniques and the use of the new textbooks,
will be introduced under the proposed project.    It will consist of:
a)   2-4 day training sessions for teachers at centrally located
schools in each of the approximately 2,100 school districts three
times each year, conducted by mobile teams of 2-5 tutors (operating
from selected teacher training institutes);
b)   fortnightly workshops for the teachers who would assemble at selected
central schools to prepare lesson plans under the guidance of the
school district inspector and experienced teachers; and
c)   the production of general teaching guides and other materials
under the direction of the Ministry of Education and their
distribution to primary teachers.
Parts (a) and (b) of the program will be inplemented in 17 of the more
accessible of the 26 provinces covered under the project; some 315,000 teachers
will be trained.   Special arrangements for the nine remaining remote provinces
have been worked out.    The main feature of these arrangements is annual
in-service training courses over a 5-year period at suitable locations.
18.       The cost of this elemen-t of the project is estimated at roughly
$13.7 million.   About $2.5 million will be in foreign exchange - largely for
the purchase of vehicles and equipment.    The local currency costs will include
travel expenses for the mobile teams, the school inspectors and the teachers.
Upgrading of Supervisory Personnel
19.       The mobile teams and the project administration staff at central and
provincial levels would be linked with primary school teachers by school district
inspectors who will need to visit individual primary schools much more frequently
than in the past to check on the availability and use of books and to lead the
fortnightly training sessions at the central schools.    Inspectors will receive
training in teaching methods and the use of textbooks.    To carry out these new
duties as well as their present. responsibilities, inspectors must have means of
transport.   The proposed project envisages the provision of a motorcycle for
each inspector, or outboard motors (for use with locally supplied boats) for about
50 inbpectors responsible for island schools, and the funds required for operation
and maintenance during the life of the project.
0.       The effectiveness of the in-service training of primary teachers requires
the full participation of a number of supervisory personnel at different levels in



-5-
the provincial education structure in addition to the school district
inspectors.   The project would provide for training courses for all such
persons.
21.       Government salaries are low and it is usual for Government staff,
including teachers, to have more than one job.    Tutors, inspectors and selected
central school staff involved will spend the greater part of their working time
on the in-service training scherne, far more than is required of them in their
current jobs where a teacher frequently teaches only 18 hours a week and has a
second or even a third job to provide for his family.    Many government
officials receive allowances for work outside their normal duties to compensate
them for incane foregone in secondary employment.    The project would provide
funds for such supplementary payments to inspectors, mobile tutors, central school
staff and headmasters participating in the training programs.    In addition, it
would provide funds for reasonable subsistence and related expenses during the
training courses.
Technical Assistance
22.       The project would include provision for 16 man-years of services by
five specialists:
a)   an administrator/planner to advise the project director on the
establishment and operation of the administrative machinery and
financial control, particularly in regard to the project sub-units
and participating government officials at the provincial level
(3 man-years);
b)   an educator to advise the project director on the content, phasing
and participation of in-service teacher training (3 man-years);
c)   two specialists to assist in converting the results of experimental
classroom work into training courses and manuals to be used by the
mobile teams (6 man-years);
d)   one program evaluator to assist the administrator in a continuous
assessment of project progress including the effectiveness of mobile
teams and participation at fortnightly training sessions (4 man-years).
Implementation:
23.       A project unit would be established in the Ministry of Education in
Jakarta, which would be responsible for: (a) overall supervision of the project;
(b) coordination of manuscript development and testing; (c) textbook production;
(d) planning of training courses for the administrators, supervisors and tutors
involved in the primary teacher training programs; (e) training and assisting
the provincial project sub-units which will plan the local primary teacher
training schemes; (f) budgeting of all costs for the training programs; and (g)
evaluation of the pedagogical aspects of the training programs.    The unit would
include a full-time project director responsible to the Director General of
Education.   It would also include on a full-time basis (i) two assistants to the
director (an educational planner and a specialist in textbook production); (ii)
two educators/teacher trainers;  and (iii) a finance officer.    A part-time



procurement officer would also be included.    All the full-time project unit
staff would be appointed after consultation with the Association.    The
establishment of the project unit and the appointment of the project director
and his two assistants would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit.
A small evaluation team would be established in the project unit to provide a
continuous assessment of the primary teachers' participation at the fortnightly
meetings, evaluate the effectiveness of the mobile training teams and the role
of the school district inspectors.
2L,.      The project sub-units, which would be established in the provinces,
would be responsible for (a) supervision of the project in the provinces; (b)
planning the bi-weekly training programs and the itineraries of the mobile teams,
and (c) budgets and accounts for the local training programs.
Project Cost Financing
25.       The total project cost is estimated at US$39.2 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$17.9 million (or 46 percent). The
project includes the supply of paper required for school book production, which
will be provided by Canada; in our calculations, the value of this paper
including freight charges has been estimated at US$9.1 million plus a contingency
of US$3.1 million. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has
made an interest-free loan, repayable in 50 years including 10 years' grace, of
up to Canadian $13 million (US$12.9 million equivalent) to cover the supply
of this paper. The proposed IDA credit of US$13.5 million would cover the
foreign exchange requirements other than for paper (US$5.7 million) and contribute
US$7.8 million to the local currency expenditures on the project; US$5.8 million
would be utilized for the printing and distribution of text books. The IDA credit
would thus meet 34 percent of total project cost, and the CIDA loan 31 percent.
The Government of Indonesia will provide the balance of US$13.6 million equivalent
of local currency funds. A breakdown of the project cost by project items is
given in Annex III.
Procurement:
23.       In order to ensure quality work in typesetting through continuous and
close supervision by the script writers and the Ministry of Education designers,
all contracts for type-setting would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding by domestic printers.    Typesetting cost for all books produced under
the project would be only about $35,000.    Contracts for printing and distribution
of textbooks would also be awardced on the basis of competitive bidding by
domestic printers.   It is important that textbooks are delivered to schools by
specific dates to avoid disruption of the training schedule. The current
practice of including the cost of delivery in printing contracts offers the
most effective means of ensuring timely distribution to the proper destinations.
Further, the import of books in Bahasa Indonesia is prohibited by law.    All
contracts for the supply of equipment would be awarded under procedures consistent
with the Association's procurement guidelines.    Preferred domestic manufacturers
of equipment would be accorded a margin of preference equal to the existing rate
of customs duty applicable to competing imports or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price,
whichever is lower.



-7-
Disbursements
27.       The proposed credit is expected to be disbursed over an eight-year
period to meet:
a)   90 percent of the total cost of printing and distribution
of textbooks;
b)   100 percent of c.i.f. costs of vehicles and equipment;
c)   18 percent of the total cost of the teacher training scheme;   and
d)   100 percent of the foreign costs of technical assistance.
Disbursements for teacher training would be made against a certificate of
expenditure, the detailed background. docunentation of which would not be
submitted for review but would be retained by the Government for inspection by
the Association during the course of project supervision missions.
Benefits
27.       The proposed project contains several innovations for the hbrld Bank
Group.   For the first time the Association would finance textbook production,
provide substantial direct assistance to a national primary education system and
support a six-year effort to upgrade the primary teaching force. Such innovations
are well justified in the case of Indonesia.    Improvements in the quality of
primary education have high priority in relation to other types of education
because: (a) primary education is the only formal education which the majority
of Indonesians are likely to receive and at present it is inadequate to provide
the basic skills in calculation and language that are necessary for productive
employment; (b) improvements in primary education are necessary to provide a
base on which to reform secondary education; and (c) improvements at the primary
level now would support, the options for possible reform after the Assessment.
Within the primary system the project would meet the key needs for quality
improvement viz., provision of textbooks, teachers' guides, in-service teacher
training and a course to upgrade supervisory personnel.
28.       Moreover, the manuscript and textbooks evaluation should help to ensure
that textbooks and teaching have a more practical content relevant to the local
situation.   The distribution of standard textbooks throughout the country woulri
tend to equalize as well as raise educational. standards and, by providing free
textbooks, the project would help to overcome one of the serious obstacles to soci6l
mobility, i.e. the inability of most parents in rural areas to meet the costs oi their
children's attendance at primary school.    Improvements in teaching methods and
in the supply of books and teaching materials should help reduce repeater rates
by enabling teachers to give more attention to the individual child and to rely
less on routine lecturing to large groups.    Again, the project would provide the
essential administrative framework at provincial and district levels for the
introduction of further improvements.    It would thus establish the capacity to
implement reforms at other levels more quickly and effectively.



- 8 -
29.       The scheme for textbook production is based on Indonesian experience
during the first three years of implementing the UNICEF-CIDA financed textbook
project.   The addition of classroom trials for all textbooks prior to distribution
should help to ensure that the books can be used by primary teachers.
Supporting services to textbook use, such as in-service training, would be
included to ensure their effective use.    A project monitoring system has been
included to facilitate implementation.    Continuous evaluation by the project
unit will indicate the need for possible changes in project activities, e.g.,
teacher training, to changing zircumstances.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft Agreement conforms to the
normal pattern for credits for education projects.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
32.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.           PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$5.o Million Credit of September 6,
19 6;  Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
This US$5.o million credit was the first for irrigation rehabilitation
in Indonesia. It covers 201,000 ha. All the equiipment supplied under the Credit
is being well utilized and disbursements are 98 percent of estimates made at the
timu of appraisal. The bulk of the cost of the project is being borne by GOI.
Final completion of the project is expected to be delayed by about two years in
order to complete much needed drainage work, which was not included in the original
schedule. The economic rate of return (ERR), which was calculated as 50 percent at
appraisal, has been re-worked to allow for actual schedule and costs; it is 25
percent.
Cr. No. 135 Technical Assistance; US$2.0 Million Credit of December 27, 1968;
Closing Date:  January 31, 197a.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed.   In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies; we have recently agreed to postpone the closing
date    for one year, to January :31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program. :[nitial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement of local funds. The project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estatesi Us$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
This project is about one year behind its original schedule due to
delay in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors. The project
also suffers from weak management and inadequate Government control of the estates
involved. The Government is reviewing the findings of a management survey report
(financed under Credit No. 216) covering all Government agricultural estates,
and as a first step, is introducing improved systems of management control and
cost accounting on the estates.   The Government is discussing with the Association
further steps necessary to improve the management of the estates.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in executiLon, and in particu,lar to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 165   Electricity DLstribution:  US$15 Million Credit of October 29,
1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193   PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion:  US$30 Million Credit of June 15,
1970;' Closing Da-te: December 31, 1975
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than anti-
cipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all the
conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications accep-
table to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all parties.
Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction of an ammonia-urea
fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has
progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus arrangement,
are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II (construction and installation of a
natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line to the fertilizer
complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial users) has
also suffered delays, but the constructiorn contract has been awarded and the
system is now expected to be completed by February 1974, when the fertilizer
plant needs gas for plant testing.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 per-
cent, due to currency revaluatioas and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became known.   Part II
has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
Pertarnina for its refineries and by power plants.    This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in in-
creased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent, including contin-
gencies and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the
facilities ahead of the agreed schedule.    AID and OBCF have agreed to contri-
bute $4.0 million and $44 million respectively to help finance the foreign
exchange cost overrun, and the Association has submitted to its Ececutive
Directors a proposal to increase Credit No. 193-IND from $30.0 m,llion to
$35.0 million.  The Government. will cover the balance required to complete both
parts of the project.
Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more
remunerative.  The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent
and, because of recent market developments a faster build-up of sales and
higher market prices can be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.

Cr. No. 19   Agricultural Estates II:   US$17 Million Credit of June 15, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Comments on the progress of this project are the saine as those
on Credit 155-IND above.  The managerial problems, however, are not so acute.
Cr.. Yo. 195  Irrigation Rehabilitation II:   US;$18.5 3T'illion Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
This US$18.5 million credit is the second irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia. It includes rehabilitation and drainage works for 186,000 ha.
After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender documents and diffi-
culties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now prcceeding somewhat better.
Although problems of quality and progress still exist, if good contractors bid and
win the awards on the last two (and largest) contracts, for which bids will open
shortly, the project could still be completed on schedule. There are no serious
cost overruns in the overall project.   DLsbursemients are picking up but are still
sl.ow and, at December 31, 1972, were only 43 percent of the estimate shown in the
appraisal report.
Cr. No. 210  Teleconmmunications Expansion;  US$12.8 Million Credit of July 13,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 197 .
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project is
now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the tropospheric
scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants retained to study
the telecommunications authority and reconmend remedial measures have completed
their work and have also been retained to implement the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
This project is about 18 months behind the original implementation
schedule and disbursements are low. The principal cause for the delay has
been the unsatisfactory management and engineering assistance. Arrangements
with new engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for improved
management assistance to the project are being considered by the Government.
Prospects for successful project implementation remain good.

Cr. No. 220   Irrigation Rehabilitation III:  Us$l1.5 Million Credit of November 6,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
This US$L4.5 million credit is the third irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia. It covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and re-
introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two in Java
and one in South Sulewesi. Construction is presently behind schedule due to prob-
lems witlh preparation of contract documents, a slow start in civil works contracts,
and the over-extention of the few experienced local contractors brought about by
the large volume of construction work in Indonesia. Some improvements in the rate
of execution are expected, but it is still estimated that the project's completion
date will be between two and three years behind that anticipated at appraisal.
Overall project cost estimates have increased by 15 percent.  The Government has
made arrangements to meet this cost overrun.  Misbursements are 50 percent below
the level estimated at appraisal but are now picking up.   Sensitivity tests run
at the time of appraisal showed that with a two-year delay in the project and a
15 percent overall cost overrun the eccnomic rate of return (ERR) would drop from
25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246   Seeds:  US.$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;  Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the pro-
vision of funds by the Government and by slow procurement of equipment. The
last supervision mission reported that these problems are being overcome but
that project costs are likely to be higher than appraisal report estimates due
to delays in execution and international exchange rate adjustments.  This matter
is currently being discussed with the Government and will be reviewed in detail
by a supervision mission scheduled for early summer, when cost information will
be more complete.
