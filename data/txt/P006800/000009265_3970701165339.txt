RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV)
Guarantor:     Republic of Colombia
Amount:        US$62 million equivalent
Terms:         17 years, including four years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project        The project objectives are to:  (i) support the Government's
Description    efforts on agricultural development, diversification and
and Benefits:  export promotion, and to integrate less developed areas into
the mainstresm economy; (ii) improve efficiency and reduce
costs of rural transport; (iii) upgrade FNCV's institutional
performance; and (iv) develop, or a pilot basis, more
efficient conditions for small-scale water transportation in a
selected coastal area. The project consists of a subsector
operation to support FNCV'a 1986-1992 Investment and
Maintenance Program (FNCV's Program) and comprises
construction, deferred and periodic maintenance of rural
roads, imnprovement of minor waterways, equipment procurement
and. technical assistance for institutional upgrading and
preparation of a study on departmental road maintenance.
Specific work programs for financing under the loan would be
selected annually out of FNCV's Program, in accordance with
agreed criteria. Major benefits are expected from value added
to. agricultural production and lower rural transport costs.
Direct beneficiaries would be: (i) small farmers, for whom
access to markets would be improved and modernized; and
(ii) the isolated communities in the Pacific coastal region,
for which small scale water transportation would be made safer
and cost effective.
Risks:         The project faces no major technical risks.  Other risks are
related to FNCV's relative inexperience with construction and
rehabilitation of minor waterways, the possibility of slow
implementation of measures to improve the institutional
efficiency of FNCV and timely availability of counterpart
funds. Strict monitoring of the waterways and Technical
Assistance components are deemed sufficient to keep the first
two risks at acceptable levels. Timely availability of
counterpart funding, which had been a recurrent problem in the
previous project with FNCV, is being dealt with in this loan
through specific arrangements to ensure consistent release of
counterpart funds through a Project Account.

Costs and      The total cost of FNCV's Program is estimated at US$362 million
Financing:     equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$182 million
equivalent. The proposed loan of US$62 million would finance 17Z of
the total Program and 34Z of its foreign exchange component.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND RURAL TRANSPORT
A. Characteristics
2.01      Colombia's advantage of having coast lines on both the Pacific
Ocean and the Caribbean Sea is largely offset by the difficulty of movement
between the coasts and the interior. The three massive ranges of the Andean
Mountains running the length of two-thirds of the country present formidable
obstacles to comunication among its main population centers, which, until
recently, developed as separate and somewhat isolated regions. The Magdalena
River, until the mid-century, provided the only overland route between the
Central region and the Caribbean coast and, even so, with serious navigation-
al problems during the dry season. In the 1950s, however, under a drive
toward integration and modernization, the transport system began to evolve
into a national network. The developmaent of the country's railways, trunk
highways and civil aviation has greatly improved inter-regional coiunication
and national integration but rural transport remins relatively
underdeveloped.
2.02     The effort to establish the basic transport infrastructure absorbed
a considerable proportion of the country's public investment. Transport
represented about half of the Central Government's investment in the late
19509. More recently, with the basic infrastructure in place, transport's
share has declined, and, since the late 1970s, it has been around 132. In
1984, the transport sector accounted for some 8Z of the GDP, compared to
about 5Z in 1950. In the same year, the country's domestic surface transport
system moved 25.4 billion ton-kI of freight, of which 88S by road, 5Z by
inland navigation, 41 by coastal shipping and 3Z by railways. Roads and
aviation dominate passenger traffic, accounting respectively for 712 and 27Z
of total demand, estimated at 17,250 million passenger/km in 1984.
B. Infrastructure
2.03      Colombia has a road network of about 100,000 km (10,500 km paved),
of which 25,100 km comprise the national highway system, 48,500 km are
departmental roads and 24,400 km are rural roads (Table 2.1). Nearly 2,000
km are private roads used mainly for timber and mining operations. The
planning, construction and maintenance of the national roads network are
performed under the Ministry of Public Works and Trassport (MOPT) through its
National Highway Fund (FVN) and National Rural Roads Fund (FNCV), in charge,
respectively, of the national highways and the rural roads. The departments
construct and maintain their own roads through their Secretariats of Public
Works. In practice, however, departmental road maintenance is generally poor
and varies considerably from department to department.
2.04     The railways system consists of 3,403 km (2,822 km currently in
service) of single track narrow gauge (0.914 meters) lines administered by
the Colombian National Railways (CNR), a semi-autonomous state-owned agency.
The trunk line between the Caribbean port of Santa Marta and Medellin-Bogota
in the central highlands is 1,287 km long and carries over 70S of the total
railway traffic. The Pacific line (187 km) serves only the Department of
Valle, connecting the port of Buenaventura to the city of Cali.
2.05     The Magdalena and Cauca rivers, together with the man-_mde Canal
del Dique (connecting the Caribbean port of Cartagena with the Nagdalena



river), constitute a major transport system totaling 1,366 km of navigable
waterways, which account for almost all inland shipping. The traditional
importance of inland waterway shipping, however, has decreased with the
development of road and rail transport; the remaining river traffic is mainly
hydrocarbons and other bulk commodities, such as cement and fertilizers,
which originates at, or is destined for, the ports of Cartagena and
Barranquilla. River transport moved about 2 million tons of freight in 1984,
roughly the same volume as 30 years ago. Administration and maintenance of
inland waterways are under the jurisdiction of MDPT. Freight services are
privately operated.
2.06      Aviation in Colombia developed early in the 1920s, induced by the
adverse topography and the inherent difficulties of surface transport. Air
traffic is now a major passenger transport mode for both international and
domestic traveling. There are presently -in the Colombian territory 70
airports whose standards vary widely. Seven of the airports in mainland
Colombia and one on the Caribbean Island of San Andres are equipped for
international flights. Aviation is governed by the Administrative Department
of Civil Aeronautics (DAAC), which is directly responsible-to the President
of the Republic. DAAC is financed by the National Aeronautics Fund (FAN),
whose revenues originate mainly from user charges.
2.07      Shipping supports most of Colombia's foreign trade.  Empresa
Puertos de Colombia (COLPUERTOS), the National Port Authority responsible to
MOPT, controls all the public ports, namely Buenaventura and Tumaco on the
Pacific coast, Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta on the Caribbean Coast
and Leticia on the Amazonas River. Total traffic at the public ports
amounted to 9.7 million tons in 1984. Most of Colombia's seaborne trade is,
and will likely remain, with the U.S., the industrialized European countries
and Japan.
C. Transport Planning, Coordination and Investment
2.08      MOPT is responsible for sector planning, including the preparation
of the National Transport Plan, which defines the role of individual trans-
port modes based upon demand projections in each subsector. The National
Transport Plan also outlines investment programs and the corresponding
financing sources ,-or each subsector.  The objectives of the Plan are formu-
lated and updated periodically in accordance with the broader goals
established by the National Planning Department (DNP) in the National
Development Plan. DNP also coordinates with MOPT and the subsector agencies
the programing and budgeting processes for investments in all transport
modes, except pipelines which are the responsibility of the national
petroleum company (ECOPETROL).
2.09      The current sector policies, largely shaped to accommodate the
transport investment needs with the constraints arising from the reduced
inflow of external resources, the tight fiscal situation and the macro-
economic priorities being addressed in the country's economic adjustment pro-
gram, emphasize rehabilitation and maintenance of existing infrastructure and
equipment, motor fuel substitution, transport safety and intermodal coordina-
tion to reduce transport costs and improve efficiency. They also call for
investment policies consistent with supporting productive and external trade
oriented activities and cost-based pricing policies to mobilize resources
through recovery of investments.



:- ~ ~   ~      ~      ~      ~      5
2.10      The overall sector financing has showed, in recent years, a
sonethat stable combination of (a) operating revenues (38Z); (b) earmarked
taxes on oil products (35Z); (c) budgetary contributions (13%); td) domestic
and external credit (71); and (e) other sources (7X). Overall, sector
funding policy emphasizes financial self-sufficiency for each subsector. In
practice, however, the implementation of this policy has been weakened,
particularly in the case of the railways (which have had to resort to
budgetary contributions to finance operating deficits caused by declining
operational efficiency) and the existing cross-subsidies between freight and
passenger tariffs in the railways, user charges on light and heavy vehicles
in the highways and import and export-tariffs in the ports.  These issues are
in the core of the ongoing sector dialogue and are being addressed at the
operational level in the context of the Bank loans for Railways
Rehabilitation (2090-CO), Highway Sector (2121-CO) and Ports Rehabilitation
(2635-CO). Also as part of the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2121-CO), a
comprehensive study of road-user charges is being finalized. That study will
be reviewed with the Government by June 1986 and an action plan to implement
its conclusions will be developed.
D. Fuel Pricing
2611      Colombia has maintained in recent years a policy of annual
increases in fuel prices to reflect corresponding opportunity costs. At the
end of 1984 domestic prices of oil products were in line with the relevant
international levels. However, the accelerated devaluation during 1985 (51%,
compared to a domestic inflation estimated at 22Z in the period) created a
gap that will require two price adjustments during 1986 to realign local
prices to international levels. Following a 20% increase on January 1, 1986,
diesel and regular gasoline were priced at US$0.61 (equivalent) per gallon,
thus about 13% and 20Z, respectively, below equivalent international levels.
If this difference is not offset by the current downward trend in interna-
tional oil prices, a further increase should be expected in the course of
this year. Fuel price developments in Colombia are being monitored through
specific provisions in a Bank loan (2476-CO) to ECOPETROL.
E. Rural Development and Transport
2.12      The expansion of rural transport programs to isolated regions is a
central item of the Government's efforts to extend public services and to
integrate less developed areas into the mainstream economy, increase
agricultural productivity and raise income levels of small farmers. Over
one-third of the 27 million Colombian population lives in rural areas and
depends upon agricultural activities. Agriculture provides about a quarter
of all the employment and accounts for 20% of the GDP and about 67% of the
country's total exports. A number of public agencies are involved in making
agricultural support accessible to rural comounities (Annex 1). Their
aCtivities Are coordinated by DNP at the planning level and by the Ministries
of Agriculture and Public Works and Transport at the implementation level.
Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV) is the public agency responsible
for the rural transport infrastructure.
2.13      Because the large transport programs to expand and modernize the
road infrastructure during the last 30 years gave priority to developing the
trunk highway system, rural transport in Colombia still remains relatively
underdeveloped. Only in the wid-1970s did FNCV start systematic
implementation of rural road programs, and, since then, transport access in



6-
rural areas has increased notably at an annual rate of about 10% (Table 2.2).
Notwithstanding the almost trifold expansion of the rural roads network
during the last decade, the importance of agriculture to the Colombian
economy requires substantial additional efforts to maintain and improve
farm-to-market accesses.
F. Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales (FNCV)
(i) Organization
2.14      FNCV was created in 1960, and, until the early 1970s it functioned
as a secondary entity in MOPT's structure. In 1972, FNCV was reorganized as
an autonomous organization under MOPT and charged with planning,
construction, and rehabilitation of rural roads. It is directed by a
seven-member Board in which the Ninistries of Agriculture and Interior and
the Federation of Coffee Growers are represented under the chairmanship of
the Minister of Public Works and Transport. FNCV is managed by a Director
General appointed by the President of the Republic. FNCV's staff of 2,230
(Table 2.3) includes 100 engineers, several economists and other specialized
professionals. The institution enjoys a reputation for efficiency and sound
management, which is confirmed by the good performance of the ongoing Rural
Roads Project (1966-CO). FNCV has its main office in Bogota and 25 regional
offices, located in each of Colombia's Departments.  FNCV's fiscal audits are
performed by the Controller General of the Republic.
2.15      Most of the existing rural road system has been constructed either
totally or partially by FNCV. The typical road is about 9 km in length,
built to all-weather gravel standard with a riding surface 4.5 m wide. Civil
works are usually contracted to small, local firms which, in general, perform
satisfactorily (Annex 2). The quality of the rural road construction has
been good. Only a minor portion of rural roads are built by force account
using FNCV's relatively old equipment fleet (para. 2.17). Despite ENCV's
overall good performance, insufficient planning and inconsistent availability
of counterpart funds have occasioned interruptions and delays to the
construction schedules in the recent past. FNCV's planning and programing
capacity would be strengthened under the proposed project (para. 3.12).
Chart I presents FNCV's organizational structure.
2.16      FNCV's Sub-Directorate of Engineering is responsible for the
programing and execution of construction and maintenance activities. It is
composed of three divisions: Projects, Procurements and Contracts, and
Construction and Supervision, which directly supervises works executed by the
25 regional directorates. The Sub-Directorate of Administration and Finance
is responsible for administrative (personnel policies, training, staff
assistance, purchases and supplies) and financial matters (budget
implementation, financial management, general accounting). It is composed of
three divisions: Finance, Industrial Relations and Administrative Services.
Among the supporting offices, the most important is the Planning Office,
which is responsible for preparing FNCV's operational plans, coordinating
the budget preparation process, evaluating implementation of plans and
conducting special studies. FNCV has recently created an Organization and
Systems Office to lend support to, and improve the performance of, the
Planning Office and the Engineering Department.

2.17      FNCV's equipment fleet of 711 units (Annex 3) is used for force
account operations to complement the capacity of the construction industry,
particularly in remote regions. It is characterized by the old age of most
units (average 7.5 years) and by the variety of makes and types.
Notwithstanding, FNCV's system of assigning to operators the responsibility
for basic maintenance of the equipment they use and contracting externil
services for major repairs has proved efficient, and its fleet is generally
well kept.
(ii) Rural Roads Activities
(a) Construction
2.18      Since the early 1970s, FNCV has undertaken 10 road construction
programs that have added, to date, about 19,000 km to the rural roads
network. Five of these programs constituted the major part of FNCV's
activities in the period: (a) the Ordinary Program, financed entirely with
local resources, is the largest of FNCV's programs and consists of its
regular and continuous activities of expansion and rehabilitation of the
rural network. It has been gradually losing its relative importance in favor
of other programs with external technical assistance and financing, and was
down to about one-third of FNCV's total investment program in 1984; (b) the
IDB Program, executed during 1970-1978, in which 50 secondary roads were
successfully completed; (c) the Pico y Pala labor-intensive program initiated
in 1972 (Ist phase), partly financed by the US Agency for International
Development, which was extended in 1981 (2nd Ongoing Phase) with support
from IDB; (d) the road component of the ongoing DRI Program (Integrated Rural
Development Program I and II) with joint financing of IDB, the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and Bank (Loans 1352-CO and 2174-CO),
which is expected to have completed about 900 km of rural roads by 1988; and
(e) the ongoing Rural Roads Project (Loan 1966-CO), which will have
constructed about 840 km and rehabilitated about 780 km by its expected
completion in mid-1986.
Cb) Maintenance
2.19      According to its statutes, FNCV's mandate had been to maintain the
roads it constructed only until the time that the roads could be transferred
to Departmental jurisdiction, and, accordingly, FNCV's focus and budget were
oriented mostly to construction. However, because of the additional burden
that rural road maintenance would bring to their limited resources, most
Departments have been reluctant to take jurisdiction over the roads. FNCV
has, therefore, been compelled to assume greater responsibility for
maintenance, but previous budgetary commitments have prevented a faster
deployment of adequate amounts and physical resources to this task. FNCV
estimates that resources made available in 1985 will permit proper routine
maintenance of about 2,500 km of the network (10% of the total) during the
year, but further reorientation of priorities in the context of the proposed
loan should enable FNCV tc catch up in a few more years (para. 3.08).
(iii) Financing and Budgeting
2.20      FNCV's activities are funded through a combination of (a) transfers
from the National budget on account of earmarked taxes on oil products (53.1Z



-8-
of FNCV's 1985 budget), and special budgetary appropriations (14.8% in 1985);
(b) own resources derived from contracts to build roads on behalf of
Departments or other entities (2.71 in 1985), a portion of the tax on beer
consumption (1Z in 1985) and nominal levies on land improvements brought
about by rural roads (0.2% in 1985); and (c) multilateral loans and bilateral
aid (28.2% in 1985). Table 2.4 presents FNCV's financing sources in 1985 and
Table 2.5 shows projections of domestic sources to FNCV's 1986-1990 budget.
2.21      Although the major portion of the transfers from the national
budget to FNCV are binding through earmarking, the actual release of
resources by the Treasury, in recent years, has been inconsistent with the
corresponding budget appropriations (Tables 2.6 to 2.11), which disturbed the
programing of FNCV's investments, particularly the ongoing Rural Roads
Project. The inconsistency between the approved budget and the actual
release of funds for FNCV, largely due to the tight fiscal situation of the
last three years, has hampered FNCV's ability to comply with execution
schedules. The project presented in the next chapter contemplates
disbursement mechanisms for both local and loan funds (Project and Special
Accounts) to minimize the risks of insufficient or untimely project funding.
G. Bank Involvement in the Sector and Lending Strategy
(i) Background
2.22      The Bank has played an important role in the development of
Colombia's transport sector. Its involvement dates back to 1949, when a
transport sector mission reported the transport system to be in an
exceptionally bad condition. Since 1950, the Bank has lent about US$755
million in 26 loans to the sector (Annex 4). These investments supported the
construction of an integrated higbway network and, more recently, have
contributed to the rehabilitation and maintenance of the national network and
to the development of improved highway and rural roads organizations. They
have also contributed to the construction of over 670 km of the main railroad
line, as well as to the rehabilitation of other lines. A domestic aviation
project helped to improve basic aviation infrastructure and subsector
efficiency and planning. A ports rehabilitation project is helping to ensure
adequate productivity and services of existing port infrastructure. The
proposed project would be the second Bank intervention in rural transport.
(iU) Sector Strategy
2.23     The Bank strategy for the transport sector emphasizes policy reform
and institution-building objectives, including: (a) policies targeted at
achieving a more balanced use of existing transport alternatives, through
adequate price signals to consumers and improvements in marketing and
distribution arrangements for key commodities; (b) equitable treatment of the
transport modes, by pursuing cost-based pricing policies; (c) reduction of
total transport costs, by improving modal interfaces and the efficiency of
operations within each mode; (d) funding and expenditure mechanisms to
reflect the costs of use of existing infrastructure and facilities;
(e) investment planning to give adequate priority to export development,
agricultural diversification, and energy conservation and substitution, with



emphasis on maintenance and rehabilitation programs; (f) further integration
of the public planning, budgeting and programing processes and strengthening
of the financial and personnel management practices of sector agencies; and
(g) Institutional and human resources development, through comprehensive
training programs at the upper and middle management and operating levels.
(Mi) Sector Lending
2.24      At the project level, the sector strategy is being implemented
through:
(a) the Rural Roads Project (Loan 1966-C., 1981, US$33.0 million)
for construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of rural
roads; institutional objectives of the project include the
strengthening of FNCV's technical and economic capability for
identifying, programing and implementing rural roads
subprojects;
(b) the Seventh Railway Project (Loan 2090-CO, 1982, US$77.0
million) for rehabilitation and modernization of the railways;
the project supports the implementation of the Colombian
National Railways' (CNR) 1983-1987 investment program and the
improvement of its financial and operational management;
(c)  the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2121-CO, 1982, US$152.3
million) for rehabilitation, paving and maintenance of the
primary road network; the project pursues sectorwide
operational improvement including the development of a
balanced pluriannual highway expenditure program, the
systematic use of economic appraisal methodologies, the
implementation of a pavement management system, training at
the ua- eerial and operational levels and a comprehensive
study of road user charges; and
(d) the Ports Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2635-C0, 1985, US$42.8
million) for reconstruction, repair and raequipping of port
facilities, and substantial institutional and operational
strengthening components; t1b project includes major reforms
to rationalize financial and personnel manag2ment of the Port
Authority.
(iv) Experience with Past Lending
2.25      The performance of these projects so far has been mixed. While the
results with the Rural Roads and B:ghways Projects have been positive and the
respective loans have contributed significantly to sector management
improvements, such as building up of investment appraisal capabilities and
more efficient institutional performance, as well as expansion and better
maintenance of the transport network, activities involving the Railways
subsector have fallen short of expectation. The capacity of CNR to overcome
operational and institutional deficiencie.s arS thus, to recuperate
credibility with users of cargo servicea has not yet materialized. The main
constraints have been lack of firm vvernment commitment to the necessary
institutional reforms, compounded by CNR's poor operational planning and



- 10 -
insufficient Government counterpart funding for critical capital
investments. The fiscal constraints in the last three years have prevented
the Government from making a significant financial contribution to project
investments and have limited its financial support to covering CNR's mounting
pension payments, which are not backed by any funding provision. A
restructuring or cancellation of the Railways Project is presently being
discussed with the Government. The Ports Rehabilitation Project is in its
initial phase of execution.
III.  FNCV'S INVESTMEN1 AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
3.01      The proposed project builds upon the results achieved under the
ongoing Rural Roads Project (Loan 1966-CO). It was prepared by FNCV with
Bank assistance and was appraised in July 1985. The detailed programing for
the road construction, deferred and periodic maintenance components for the
first year of FNCV's Program has been completed. The waterways component is
substantially prepared with minor engineering details being attended to by
FNCV's expert in dredging operations (para. 3.32). Procurement arrangements
were discussed with FNCV and confirmed during negotiations (para. 3.21).
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. on February 10-11, 1986. The
Colombian delegation was headed by Dr. Edgar Urrea Perez, Director General of
FNCV.
B. Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The project objectives are to: (a) support the Government's
agricultural development efforts, diversification and export promotion, and
to integrate less developed areas into the mainstream economy through
reducing the backlog of deferred maintenance and expansion of rural roads;
(b) improve efficiency and reduce costs of rural transport through adequate
maintenance of the rural roads network; (c) upgrade subsector management
through improving the institutional performance of FNCV; and (d) develop, on
a pilot basis, more efficient conditions for small-scale water transportation
in the Pacific coastal region through rehabilitation and construction of
minor canals linking rivers and estuaries in the area.
3.03      The project (para. 3.12) consists of a subsector operation to
support FNCV's 1986-1992 Investment and Maintenance Program (FNCV's
Program). It would finance a slice of FNCV's Program and include
construction, deferred and periodic maintenance of rural roads, improvement
of minor waterways, procurement of equipment, and technical assistance for
institutional strengthening and preparation of a study on departmental road
maintenance. Annex 5 contains a detailed project description and Annex 6
shows details of project execution and physical targets.
3.04      Based on the experience under the ongoing Rural Roads Project,
technical assistance contemplated under the project would, inter alia, assist
FNCV in streamlining the administrative and contracting procedures for
routine maintenance. FNCV would be expected to contract the technical
assistance and provide appropriate counterpart staff in accordance with an
agreed timetable (para. 3.31).



- 11 -
3.05      Since 1982, FNCV has been updating, at irregular intervals, the
inventory of roads under its responsibility. Under the proposed project, the
inventory would be updated regularly, and e rural road maintenance management
system would be implemented to control the deferred maintenance backlog and
to institute a regular cycle of periodic maintenance (para. 3.08).
3.06      The proposed project also provides for a study to define a plan of
action to resolve the serious problem of departmental roads' maintenance.
The study will be financed and executed by the National Fund for Development
Projects (FONADE). A preliminary analysis prepared by a Bank consultant,
based upon a sample of three representative departments, identified key
deficiencies as follows: (a) lack of trained personnel to administer the
operations of the departmental road systems; (b) insufficient funding and
inefficient use of available resources; (c) frequent turnover of key
personnel; and (d) inadequate financial and technical control over the
operations of the departmental roads. Further details on the status of the
departmental roads are presented in Annex 7. It was agreed during
negotiations that the departmental roads maintenance study would be executed
according to terms of reference, schedule and employment of consultants
acceptable to the Bank.
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.07      The Bank's involvement in rural transport in Colombia has focused
on institutional building and upgrading subsector management. The proposed
operation would consolidate the institutional and operational improvements
initiated under the ongoing Rural Roads Project, now in its completion stage
(mid-1986), develop further FNCV's investment planning, programing and
implementation capacity, and deepen FNCV's policy focus upon enhancing
productivity of existing infrastructure (Annex 8) through adequate
maintenance of rural transport infrastructure and preservation of past
investments (para. 3.12).
D. FNCV's Rural Roads Investment and Maintenance Program (1986-1992
3.08      Analysis of FNCV's expenditures from 1981 through 1984 (in constant
1984 prices, Table 3.1), indicates that road investments increased by 8Z
from Col$ 2.77 billion to Col$ 5.09 billion, while recurrent expenditures on
routine maintenance rose fourteen times from Col$ 11 million to Col$ 162
million. Considering that the size of the network increased from 18,177 km
to 22,892 km during the same period, maintenance expenditures per km rose
eight times from about Col$ 610 to Col$ 7,081 (equivalent to about US$70 per
km). Past expenditures on routine maintenance were clearly below
requirements. Mainly to compensate for the results of inadequate routine
maintenance, an estimated 30% of the 1981-1984 investments were oriented to
rehabilitation. Under FNCV's 1986-1992 Program, routine maintenance would be
strengthened, and regular cycles of periodic maintenance would be implemented
to control presature and excessive road degradation. Outlays for maintenance
would improve under FNCV's Program, with maintenance expenditures per km
increasing from the current US$70 to about US$200 by 1992. While the shift
to greater emphasis upon routine maintenance corresponds to sectoral
priorities, FNCV would ensure that the funds for programed routine
maintenance are appropriated to execute the agreed physical targets. In
order to facilitate monitoring of these targets, FNCV agreed during
negotiations to adopt, by December 1986, an adequate system for measuring



- 12 -
progress of civil works, and to update the rural roads inventory accordingly,
by December 1987, and annually thereafter.
3.09      Base cost estimates for FNCV's Program are shown in constant
December 1985 prices in Table 3.2. The table includes expenditures for
administration and debt service, representing, respectively, 13Z and 16S of
the total. This reflects a significant overhead cost reduction as compared
with the 1970s, when administrative expenditures amounted to around 40S of
the annual budgets. Out of about US$271 million programed for construction
and maintenance, about 451 goes to construction of rural roads and waterways
(including engineering and supervision);, about 511 for deferred, periodic and
routine saintenance; less than 41-for equipment procurement and 0.35S for
consulting services. The amounts programed for rural roads construction
would decrease progressively from 451 in 1986 to 41S in 1992. During this
period, vhile expenditures for deferred maintenance would decrease slightly
as the existing backlog is brought under control, expenditures for periodic
and routine maintenance would ore than double in real terms.
3.10      The relationship between the Bank project and FNCV's Program is
detailed In Table 3.3. FNCV's Program foresees, on average, about US$51.7
million equivalent in annual outlays compared to an average of US$47.7
million during the last three years. While the higher average amounts of
annual investments do not represent a dramtic increase, the different
composition of FNCV's Program (Table 3.4)-less emphasis on relatively more
capital intensive construction and a substantial increase in deferred and
periodic maintenance works-will demand significantly more planning,
management and monitoring capacity on the part of FNCV. Based on the
experience under the ongoing Rural Roads Project, FNCV's overall
Institutional capacity has proven satisfactory and demonstrated a sound basis
upon which to develop further its works execution capabilities. The
project's institutional upgrading component (para. 3.12(g)) has been designed
and timed to permit FNCV to develop in the early years of the Program
execution sufficient capacity to carry it through completion. During
negotiations, FNCV: (a) confirmed the composition and amounts of annual
investment and maintenance targets in FNCV's Program; and (b) agreed on the
scope and timing of the semi-annual reviews of the Program, including
achievement of the Program's targets.
E. Costs and Financing
3.11      The total cost of the FNCV'a Program is estimated at US$362
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$182 million. The proposed
loan of US$62 million would represent 17% of the total cost of FNCV's
Program and 34Z of its foreign costs (Table 3.3). The balance of the
foreign costs would be met by the ongoing Bank Loans 1966-CO and 2174-CO (DRI
program) and the IDB Pico y Pala (2nd Phase) loan.  The small remaining
portion (141) of the foreign costs would be met by additional external loans
to be secured in due course during implementation of FNCV's Program. It was
agreed during negotiations to retroactively finance US$0.9 million worth of
urgent works on two roads included in the first year program. These roads
were destroyed during the November 13, 1985 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz
volcano.
3.12      The main components of the proposed project would be:
(a) rural roads construction comprising of engineering, execution and
supervision of about 251 of FNCV's Program to provide access to
isolated agricultural areas;



- 13 -
(b) deferred maintenance comprising of engineering, execution and
supervision of about 24Z of FNCV's Program to restore neglected roads to
nor-al maintenance standards;
(c) periodic maintenance comprising of engineering, execution and
supervision of about 61X of FNCV's Program to bring up the road
maintenance backlog to satisfactory standards;
(d) waterways iuprovements comprising of engineering, execution and
supervision of works to improve efficiency and safety of sa-ll cabotage
operations and coastal navigation in the Pacific coastal region, in two
phases: about 26 km of minor canals in Phase I (Map IBID 19297) in the
Department of Cauca, and depending upon its results, another 34 km in
Phase II to complete a rudimentary network of protected waterways in the
region;
(e)  equipment comprising of about 74% of FNCV's equipment procurement
program and mainly consisting of: equipment units and spare parts to
complete and rationalize the maintenance equipment fleet; a helicop-
ter 1/ for supervision of works and surveys in areas with difficult
access; and units to equip the Planning Office and to implement the
maintenance and management system in the Engineering Department;
'f) departmental roads maintenance study to be financed by FONADE, would
evaluate the uinntenance needs of roads in selected departments 2,
propose a plan of action for organizing the delivery of maintenance
services, together with the quantity and quality controls, financial and
appropriate funding mechanisms (Annex 7); and
(g) institutional upgrading comprising of technical assistance to:
(i) develop technical capacity of the Planning Office; (ii) implement a
rural roads maintenance system in the Engineering Department for
planning, scheduling, executing and costing maintenance operations; an
equipment management system; and strengthen contract administration and
work supervision (Annex 8); and (iii) develop on-the-job training for
FNCV's staff.
For costing purposes, the project components are grouped into: (a) investment;
(b) maintenance; (c) equipment procurement; and (d) consulting services.
3.13      The estimated cost of the Bank project is about US$112.4 million
equivalent, with the local and foreign costs divided into broad categories shown
on the following page.
1/ The inclusion of the helicopter in equipment procurement is based on the
analyses and comparison of the net present values of the various rental vs.
ownership options taking into consideration full ownership costs and the various
feasible helicopter usage projections.
2/ The study would concentrate on the following representative departments:
Atlantico, Boyaca, Cordoba, Cundinamarca and Valle. They reflect the typical
climatic and topographic conditions as well as the range of technical, financial
and institutional characteristic of the departments in the country.

3.14      The foreign exchange component of civil works was estimated considering
the cost of imported equipment, fuel and materials required for the execution of
each type of operation. Because of the upward adjustment in the real exchange
rate during the last two years, the foreign cost in this project is slightly
higher than the one observed in the previous rural roads loan. The estimated cost
of foreidgn goods to be procured under the project reflects the exemption of custom
duties granted to FNCV and the real costs of customs clearances for Government
institutions. The foreign cost of consulting services was estimated at 50S,
taking into account that the income and remittal taxes on foreign consultants'
fees (to be paid by FNCV) amount roughly to 50% of the gross fees.
3.15      Physical contingencies of 1OZ have been considered for all civil works,
engineering, execution and supervision costs of FNCV s Program and the project.
Price contingencies, based on December 1985 prices, were calculated according to
the following projections:
Adjustment Indexes         1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992

- 15 -
3.16      FNCV prepared the cost estimates for civil works based upon current
costs for such operations by force account and by contract. Cost estimates
for equipment and vehicles were prepared based on FNCV-supplied
manufacturers' quotations and real costs of port and customs clearances costs
to be paid by FNCV. The cost for consulting services was estimated based on
market rates for local and foreign consultants. Intended deployment of
consultants is shown in Table 3.5.
F. Execution and Procurement
3.17      Execution of the project would be under direct responsibility of
FNCV, except for the Departmental roads maintenance study, which would be
executed by FONADE. During negotiations, it was agreed that: FONADE would
complete the financial arrangements for the execution of the Departmental
roads maintenance study by June 30, 1986; and (ii) FONADE would mDbilize
consultants to execute the Departmental roads maintenance study by November
1, 1986. Details on project execution are given in Annex 6.
3.18      Procurement of items to be financed under the proposed loan would
be as follows:

(6.7)    (47.8)      (7.5)    (62.0)
1/ Amounts in parentheses show the allocations from the proceeds of the loan.
3.19      Civil works for construction and deferred maintenance of roads and
for construction and rehabilitation of waterways, totaling US$61 million
(including contingencies), would be carried out through about 160 contracts
with an average cost of less than US$400,000 and none of them exceeding US$1
million. Because of the small size and limited scope of these contracts and
their distribution in space and time (unlikely to attract foreign bidders),
they are expected to be let through locally advertised competitive bidding
procedures, on terms satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with the
arrangements in use for the ongoing project with FNCV. About 70% of periodic
maintenance, representing some US$26.7 million would be executed through
about 400 contracts averaging US$70,000 and none of them exceeding
US$150,000. These contracts would be awarded based on competitive local
bidding (without advertising) satisfactory to the Bank, on the basis of
evaluation and comparison of bids invited from a list of at least three
qualified contractors. FNCV would ensure a wide distribution of bidding
opportunities. About 30% of periodic maintenance, representing some US$11.4
million (including contingencies), would be executed by force account,
comprising small works scattered in isolated regions, for which studies have
indicated that force account is more economical than contracting. These
force account works would represent about 10% of the project cost. During



- 16 -
project implementation, FNCV would improve its contracting procedures for
periodic maintenance, and force account operations would not increase in the
future. The efficiency of force account in periodic maintenance operations
would be monitored closely during project supervision (Annex 8).
3.20      Equipment amounting to about US$7.4 million (including
contingencies) would be procured through international competitive biddLng in
accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement subject to prior approval by
the Bank of all contracts exceeding US$50,000. The procurement program for
equipment, indicating lot size and estimated cost, is shown in Table 3.6.
Contracts for laboratory and office support equipment, and parts with an
estimated cost below US$50,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000, would
be procured by locally advertised competitive bidding procedures on terms
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.21      Specific agreements were confirmed during negotiations along the
lines of the recommendations of the recent review of LCB in Colombia: (a)
awards would be to the lowest evaluated bidders; (b) bids for goods would be
evaluated on a CIF basis, with freight costs quoted freely by each bidder;
and (c) procurement of consultant services would be in accordance with the
relevant Bank guidelines and would provide for free and independent
participation of foreign consultants.
3.22      Procurement of components financed exclusively by FNCV would be as
follows: about 15% of construction and 25% of deferred maintenance consisting
of small works scattered in remote areas with difficult access and therefore
difficult to contract, would be executed by force account according to
procedures which, under these conditions, have proven to be more
cost-effective than contracting. Thirty-three percent of the routine
maintenance would be executed by force account and 67% by contract (roadmen
and microenterprises) under procedures which have proved effective under the
ongoing project. These procedures would be improved further and expanded
under the proposed project. Force account routine maintenance would diminish
from 40% to 30% during implementation of FNCV's Program. Some of the
replacement equipment units as well as minor equipment and spare parts would
be procured in dispersed purchases spread over seven years under local
competitive procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
G. Disbursements and Auditing
3.23      The proposed project is expected to be disbursed by December 1992.
The disbursement schedule (Table 3.7) of seven years for the proposed loan is
about 18 months faster than the regional disbursement profiles for highway
projects. It is, however, possible that efficient project implementation
with adequate counterpart financing could reduce the implementation period of
the project from six-and-a-helf to four-and-a-half years, resulting in lower
contingencies and in a r2duction of the project's cost from US$112 million to
US$106 million. In this case, the loan amount required would decrease to
US$58 million, but the required annual provision of local funds would be
US$11.9 million higher corresponding to US$1.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.1 million
equivalent for year 1986 through 1989 respectively.
3.24      Project execution would require disbursements against a large
number of small contracts and against some periodic maintenance works carried
out by force account. Considering FNCV's satisfactory contracting and
disbursement procedures under the ongoing loan 1966-CO, simple and quick
disbursement procedures would be adopted. Withdrawals would be based on
periodic statements of expenditures. The statements would comprise



- 17 -
expenditures for works executed by contract and for periodic maintenance
executed by force account, as vell as expenditures for equipment
procurement. Expenditures on force account works would be determined by
imltiplying the actual physical production by the unit costs for each
operation with the unit costs being updated from time to time. FNCV's
Engineering Department, with consultant assistance provided *.nder the
proposed loan, would prepare the monthly statements of expendiMures and
monitor force account works. These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations. Supporting documentation would not be submitted to the Bank,
but would be retained by FNCV and made available for review during the
project supervision process and audits.
3.25      In order to reduce the interval during which FNCV would finance the
Bank's share of project costs with its own resources, a Special Account
(revolving fund) in US dollars with an authorized allocation of US$4 million
(sufficient for about four months of financeable expenditures) would be
established in Banco de la Republica. FNCV would be entitled to wiake
periodic withdrawals from the Special Account at the exchange rate applicable
on the day the Special Account is debited. The Bank would replenish the
Special Account for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible
expenditures at the request of the Borrower. To ensure consistent
availability of counterpart funds, a Project Account (revolving fund) in
pesos would be established in a local commercial bank, which should maintain
a revolving balance sufficient for three months of project expenditures. The
establishment of the Project Account with an initial deposit equivalent to
US$2.5 million would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.26      Withdrawals from the Special Account would be on the following
bases:
(a)  50X of total expenditures for eligible civil works;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for the procurement of goods and 90Z
of locally procured imported goods; and
(c)  OOZ of foreign expenditures for expatriate consultants and
training fellowships abroad, and 50% of total expenditures for
local consultants and for the training component.
3.27      FNCV's general accounts and the project's Special and Project
Accounts would be audited by the Controller General of the Republic. Audit
reports would be required annually within four months of the closing of the
audited period.
H. Economic Justification
3.28      All the works included in the first year of the work program (1986)
have been subjected to economic evaluation (Table 3.8). The overall economic
rate of return on the road construction, deferred maintenance of roads and
improvements of minor waterways (canals) is estimated at 21%. The ERRs on
individual road components vary from 12Z to over 70%. For the canals, the
ERR is 17% based on distance savings.
3.29      The detailed program for each subsequent year for financing under
the loan will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures and criteria
(Annex 9) confirmed during negotiations and would be required to yield a
minimum 12% ERR. For portions of the annual work programs to be financed
entirely by national resources, at least 85Z of the works would be selected



- 18 -
also based upon the economic and technical criteria confirmed during
negotiations. Of the remaining 15X, works with estimated costs of over
US$200,000 or over 5 km in length would also be selected based on the
foregoing.
3.30      Direct beneficiaries would be: (a) small farmers, for whom access
to uarkets would be improved and modernized; and (b) the isolated communities
In the coastal region of Cauca, for which small scale cabotage operations
would be ade safer and cost effective. Project benefits would accrue from:
(a) the incremental value added derived from increases in agricultural
production and avoidance of crop losses ihich could not be marketed for lack
of reasonable faru-to-market access; (b) reduction in transport costs; and
(c) safer small scale cabotage operations. Agricultural production increases
would arise from inputs of extension services and additional lands brought
under cultivation with the aid of improved, all weather farm-to-market
access. Reduction in transport costs would derive from: (a) improved road
conditions; and (b) shortening of transport distances through the
construction and rehabilitation of minor canals to interconnect protected
waterways in the Pacific coastal region. The rural transport industry being
competitive, the reductions in transport costs are expected to be passed
along to consumers.
I. Assessment of Risks
3.31      The project faces no abnormal technical risks. 'Other risks are
related to the possibility of slow implementation of measures to improve
FNCV's institutional efficiency, FNCV8s relative inexperience with the
construction and rehabilitation of minor waterways as provided for in the
pilot waterways component, and tilely availability of counterpart funds to
the project. To minimize delays in implementing institutional efficiency
messures and enhance project sustainability, FNCV agreed during negotiations
to: (a) contract the technical assistance and provide the appropriate
counterpart staff to strengthen the Planning Office and the Engineering
Department by November 1, 1986; (b) complete the design phases of the systems
for rural road maintenance management, management of the equipment fleet and
the module to improve contract management, including administration and
supervision of works, by September 30, 1987; and, (c) start implementing the
systeim in (b) preceding by March 31, 1988.
3.32      To ensure smooth implementation of the pilot waterways component
and the use of appropriate construction technology in order to, interalia,
minimize adverse environmental impact, FNCV has set up an ad hoc office in
the Engineering Department for supervision, monitoring and control of
progress of works under phase I. An engineer experienced in dredging
operations heads the office. A part-time marine ecologist is to be recruited
shortly to assist the engineer, and experienced resident dredge operators
would control the onsite field operations. This arrangement was confirmed
during negotiations. Execution of phase II would be contingent upon
satisfactory experience under phase I and the incorporation of the
arrangements for the supervision and monitoring of works into the Engineering
Department.
3.33      To ensure timely availability of counterpart funds to the project,
which had been a recurrent problem in past years of implementation of the
ongoing Rural Roads Project, the following measures would be implemented:
(a) FNCV's investment program would be reviewed semi-annually; (b) Bank
agreement on the annual program would be contingent upon evidence of
sufficient budget appropriation of local funds for expenditures during the



- 19 -
year; and (c) sufficient counterpart funds to meet three months worth of
approved works are to be maintained, on a continuing basis, in the Project
Account (revolving fund) referred to in paragraph 3.25.
IV. RECONMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations, the following were agreed upon:
(a) (i) the departmental roads maintenance study to be executed in
accordance with the terms of reference, schedule and employment of
consultants acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.06); (ii) FONADE to
complete the financial arrangements for the execution of the
preceding by June 30, 1986; and (iii) FONADE to uoDilize
consultants to execute the study by November 1, 1986 (pars. 3.17);
(b) adoption, by December 31, 1986, of an adequate system for measuring
progress of civil works and updating of the rural roads inventory
accordingly by December 31, 1987, and annually thereafter
(para. 3.08);
(c) the scope and timing of the semi-annual reviews of FNCV's 1986-1992
Program including achievement of the Program's targets
(para. 3.10); and
Cd) (i) contracting of the technical assistance and provision of
appropriate counterpart staff to strengthen FNCV's Planning Office
and the Engineering Department by November 1, 1986; (ii) completion
of the design phases of the systems for rural road maintenance
management, management of the equipment fleet and the module to
improve contract management including administration and
supervision of works, by September 30, 1987; and (iii) implemen-
tation of rural road maintenance management, management of
equipment fleet and improvement of contract management to start by
March 31, 1988 (para. 3.31).
4.02      During negotiations, the following were confirmed:  (a) the
composition and amounts of annual investment and maintenance targets in the
1986-1992 program (para. 3.10); (b) local competitive bidding procedures
(para. 3.21); (c) arrangements for disbursements, updating of force account
maintenance unit costs, preparation of monthly statement of expenditures and
monitoring of force account works (para. 3.24); (d) economic and technical
criteria for the appraisal of annual work programs (para. 3.29); and (e) the
arrangements for supervision, monitoring and control of vorks for the pilot
waterways component (para. 3.32).
4.03      Suitable agreements and assurances having been reached on the
substance of paragraphs 4.01 and 4.02, the proposed project is recommended
for a Bank loan in the amount of US$62 million on standard terms and
conditions at variable rates including retroactive financing for urgent works
not to exceed US$0.9 million in total (para. 3.11).
4.04      Loan effectiveness would be contingent upon FNCV's opening of a
Project Account (para. 3.25) with an initial deposit of US$2.5 million
equivalent.

COLOMBIA
RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Main Agencies Involved in Rural Development and Transport
1.        A special unit of DNP adinisters a comprehensive, Bank-assisted
integrated rural development program (DRI) and coordinates supply of credit
to farmers, extension services, reforestation, rural electrification, health
and education, and feeder roads. DRI is in its second phase and, as under
the first phase, is funded by The Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), IBRD (Loans 1352-CO and 2174-CO), IDB and the National Budget.
Feeder roads are a minor part of DRI, and their construction is executed by
FNCV. By end 1984, about 700 km of roads had been coDstructed under the
first DRI and 400 km under the second DRI.
2.        The major extension and research organization officially involved
in rural developments is the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), which
is responsible for agriculture and livestock deveLopment. ICA participates
in DRI, but its agronomic advice has not always reflected the economic
factors. There are, nevertheless, numerous Government-certified agents in
Colombia who provide basic extension services.
3.        The main agricultural credit institution in Colombia is the Caja de
Credito Agrario Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria), a mixed enterprise with
GIC as the major shareholder. Caja Agraria's services to small farmers
include credit, extension and distribution of agricultural inputs; it
implements the credit component of DRI.
4.        Other agencies concerned with rural development and, to a limited
extent, with rural roads include the Instituto Colombiano de Ridrologia,
Metereologia y Adecuacion de Tierras (HIMAT), the Instituto Colombiano de la
Reforma Agraria (INCORA) and the well managed Federacion Nacional de
Cafeteres (FEDECAFE). ERMAT's rural road activities are minor and are
confined to small, designated areas. INCORA also plays an ancillary note in
rural roads in support of its land reform beneficiaries. INCORA has been
focusing upon the Departments of Caceta and Meta, where it has been titling
public lands in designated colonization areas. FEDECAFE, for the benefit of
its members in the coffee-growing areas, contracts rural road construction
with private contractors or FNCV. The foregoing agencies play a mainly ad
hoc role in rural roads. Rural roads being ancillary to their mandates, the
plans and programs of these agencies address liited needs. To incorporate
the broader national perspective in systematically addressing rural transport
needs, GRC has been developing FNCV since 1960.

RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Small Domestic Construction Industry
1.        There were 1,765 contractors registered with FNCV as of July 1985
who can bid for rural road construction contracts. Contractors are
classified by their financial and equipment capability into four classes:
45% of the contractors fall into Class I, capable of handling small works up
to Col$ 20 million in value, compared with another 45% falling into Classes
II and III, capable of handling works varying between Col$ 20 and Col$ 100
million. The remaining contractors are capable of handling large works worth
over Col$ 100 million, as indicated by the following figure:
over Cal$ 100 dllion
Ca1l 40-100
IUon C23. lsUp to ColS 20 -lIUon
(451)
Co1l 20-40 Mlilo(
2.        Although data are not up to date, FNCV estimates that the average
contractor owns approximately US$200,000 worth of equipment and is capable of
building about 5 to 10 km of rural roads per year. It is estimated that the
overall capability of the small contracting industry is equivalent to about
3,000 to 4,000 km per year, and that about 50% of this potential is presently
idle. It is also estimated that about 95Z of the construction actually
carried out by these contractors is financed equally by FNCV and by the
departments, with the remaining 5S undertaken by the private sector, e.g.,
FEDECAFE. Because of their small size, the contractors are dependent upon
regular payments. Otherwise, they suffer a financial burden which may result
in insolvency and disruption of construction.

3.        The small contractors are not evenly distributed around the
country; it is estimated that the majority of them are located in a radius of
100 km from Bogota. These contractors have little mobility, which produces
an unbalanced situation where any bidding for works to be executed in the
Bogota area attracts about 20 proposals against an average of three to five
for similar projects in the rest of the country. This situation my produce
bottlenecks for an ambitious construction program :n all the country.  For
this reason, FNCV has considered complementary alternatives, such as (a) the
pico y pala program, which would be used for works located in mountainous
terrain with soft material and when there is an abundance of unemployed
labor, and which would represent about 25Z of the 1981-1984 construction
program and (b) force account construction in remote areas where contractors
are not available. FNCV's 1986-1992 program would encourage small
contractors to work in new regions of the country, through better programing
and regular payments. Under the proposed project, FNCV would be assisted in
improving the programing of works. Periodic maintenance financed under the
project would be done 701 on contract.

RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
FNCV Equipment Manageament
A. Equipment Fleet
1.        FICV's equipment fleet of 711 units (Table 1 of this annex) is
assigned to the Regional Directorates for the execution of force account
operations for construction, deferred, periodic, routine and emergency
maintengnce of rural roads in their respective areas. These force account
operations complemnt the capacity of the construction industry, and are
carried out particularly in remote regions. The equipment fleet is
characterized by the old age and the variety of makes and types because over
the years, FNCV bas acquired equipment in a haphazard way (a) by taking over
batches of equipment financed by other agricultural or rural development
institutions and departmental or mnicipal governments and (b) by coffee
barter agreements, mainly with east Buropean Governments. Only in the last
three years has INCV been in a position to procure 290 units of equipment
through ICB under the ongoing Bank loan.  Of the total fleet, 197 units (282)
are in satisfactory operating condition, 234 (33Z) are under repair and 280
(39Z) should be scrapped, as well as some very old units in good condition or
under repair that demand extremely expensive maintenance. The scrapping
program for 304 units is shown in the bottom of Table 1.
D.  Liuipmsnt Administration
2.        The ezisting structure for equipment administration is minimal.
There is only one mechanical engineer or technician and a few mechanics in
each regional directorate, physical facilities are scarce or non-existent,
and lnveantory and control of spare parts is poor. Beyond the simple, routine
requirements, FNCV has no facillities to do any major equipment repairs. The
arrangements agreed under the ongoing loan for execution of major repair of
FNCV's equipment in NDPT's workshops have not been satisfactory because
MOPT's facilities are inadequate even for repair of its own equipment.
3.        Despite these bleak circumstances, FNCV's equlpment is surprisingly
well kept and performs far beyond average useful life because of the
following: (a) each equipment unit is assigned to a specific operator who is
fully responsible for its operatLon and maintenance; (b) the ingenuity and
dedication of PNCVY' personnel have been able to overcome many of the
negative circumstances described above; and (c) uost of the equlpment repair
is done efficiently and at low coat by contract mecanLics under arrangements
in which FNCY provides the spare parts and supplies, and the contract
mechanic provides his labor for speciflc tasks and guarantLes the quality of

his labor. This repair contracting systes has the additional advantages of
preventing the expansion of YNCV staff bound by rigid regulations of the
Colombian trade union and to allow each specific task to be contracted with a
mechanic specialized In the corresponding skill. The repair contracting
system would be further expanded and strengthened under the proposed project.

RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
1.        This annex explains the context of the components included in the
Bank project and listed in paragraph 3.08 of the SAR.
2.        The context of components in the Bank project design is as follows:
(a) Rural Road Construction - The proposed project provides for the
construction of about 800 km of roads in support of the Government's rural
and agricultural development efforts. Access to markets remains difficult
and costly for numerous communities.  The project roads would link some of
these farming comunities to markets and consuming centers.
(b) Deferred Maintenance of Rural Roads - About 800 km of roads from a
larger FNCV program would be rehabilitated under the proposed project.
Rehabilitation is a necessity because, in the past, FNCV concentrated upon
construction while maintenance received insufficient attention. This
happened because FNCV was to band over the roads after completion of
construction to the departments (States) and, hence, did not develop
.uufficient maintenance capacity. With the exception of a few of the more
developed departments, the handover of the roads has not occurred. The
departments generally do not have the capacity or the resources to mintain
these roads. FNCV's charter, on the other hand, did not, until recently,
oblige it to maintain the roads that it could not hand over to the
departments. Under the ongoing project, some progress has been made in
reducing the backlog of maintenance. Under the proposed project, a rural
roads maintenance system would be implemented. Nevertheless, before the
roads can be maintained on a regular basis, they have to be brought up to a
maintainable standard which would entail minor improvements, construction or
completion of adequate drainage systems, deep patching and shaping, and
regraveling of surfaces. Improved programing and execution of remedial works
should bring the volume of deferred maintenance under control.
(c) Periodic Maintenance - To keep user costs at acceptable levels and
to maximize use of the existing roads over their normal lives, FNCV needs to
institute a cycle of periodic maintenance by executing minor additional
drainage works and by reshaping and regraveling surfaces as needed.
Depending upon such factors as climate and terrain, a five- to eight-year
interval between regravelings is an acceptable target for FNCV.  This
implies that, ideally, between 3,000 km and 5,000 km should be regraveled a
year. Under the proposed project, regraveling of about 5,000 km would be
financed, while PNCV regravels about 2,200 km on its own and develops a
capacity to manage regraveling of larger volumes in the future. The use of
private contractors for regraveling is being encouraged under the project.
About 3,500 km are proposed to be regraveled by contractors and the remaining
1,500 km by force account. Although a detailed breakdown of costs is not



- 47 -
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 4
available, it is likely that regraveling on contract would be more
cost-effective than regraveling through force account.
(d) Waterway Improvements - There is scope for developing efficient
transportation on minor waterways in areas where road building is costly and
water transport is used traditionally as a means of communications and moving
freight. Under the proposed project, a pilot program to improve the use of
existing waterways will be tested in line with the sector objective of
encouraging optimim utilization of existing facilities. The pilot program
will improve cabotage and navigation safety in the Cauca Region by enabling
small seafaring craft to make fuller use of protected waters over smaller
transport distances (instead of venturing out to the often rough open seas).
The program will rehabilitate existing canals and provide for construction of
a few additional ones to allow passage through protected waters. Local
communities in the region have, in the past, dug a number of such canals on
an artisanal scale; these are in use but need to be scoured and rehabilitated
to modest engineering standards. The program will be implemented in two
phases. Phase 1 will be monitored closely to assess the conditions and the
costs under which phase 2 could be executed to complete a rudimentary system
of canals and to assess the feasibility of implementing similar schemes in
other parts of the country, particularly in the Choco or the Amazon regions.
The works proposed under the pilot program are well within FNZV's
capacity to supervise/execute. Consultant services are provided to reinforce
FNCV's Engineering Department in implementing and monitoring this component.
Beyond the aceptable risks associated with the excavation and disposal of
waterlogged materials in brackish waters, no adverse environmental impacts
are expected. The ecological system is not expected to be traumatized by the
modest scale of works under the program. Preparation of this component is
taking into account the possible environmental implications. Additionally,
FNCV has created an ad hoc office headed by an engineer experienced in
dredging operations. A part-time marine ecologist would assist the
engineer. Field operations are to be supervised by experienced resident
dredge operators.
(e) Departmental Roads Maintenance Study - In theory, the departments
do their own maintenance through their Secretariats of Public Works. In
reality, overall maintenance of departmental roads is deficient. Many of the
departments lack the resources and capacity to maintain the departmental
roads. MOPT was expected to review the responsibilities for, and the
adequacy of, the maintenance organization of departmental roads, but MOPT
appears reluctant in assuming leadership to assist the departments to
preserve the infrastructure assets and minimize user costs on the sizable
system of departmental roads. MOPT's reluctance seems to be based upon the
political sensitivities and the varying levels of technical and
administrative maturity of the departments.
(f) Procurement of Maintenance and Data Processing Equipment - To
complete and rationalize the maintenance fleet; procure a helicopter to
permit timely supervision of works; rationalize the parts inventory and
implement the maintenance and management systems in FNCV's Engineering
Department and equip the Planning Office; and

(g) Institutional Efficiency Improvements - FNCV's responsibilities
have grown significantly and become more complex over the years. These now
include the more abstract tasks of planning and programing investments in
rural transport infrastructure and its maintenance. However, investment
planning and programing have not received sufficient attention.
Additionally, since 1983, FNCV has been formally responsible for the
maintenance of the rural roads. While the volume of work has grown (and will
continue to grow in amount and complexity), it is unlikely that FNCV's
resources will grow much in the foreseeable future. In an environment
constrained by the need to increase output with correspondingly fewer
resources, FNCV ' management strategy has to rely upon improving
institutional efficiency and increasing productivity. Improved planning,
programing and effective supervision are essential in this context:
(i) to improve its general administration and planning capacity, FNCV
would carry out the recommendations of the mnagement consultants
under the ongoing loan and hire additional staff. The proposed
project would provide for consultant service., to assist FNCV in
implementing improved 4investment planning, p.ograming and
budgeting procedures in FNCV'a Planning Office and strengthening
its management information system.
*ii)  to improve programing, engineering, contracting and supervision of
civil works, FNCV is in the process of restructuring and expanding
its Engineering Sub-Directorate; this process would be strengthened
further under the proposed loan and would benefit from the improved
information system above. The Programing Division is being
organized into separate groups to be specifically responsible for
each one of FNCV's civil works programs under a strong leadership
to ensure satisfactory coordination. The Technical Divisionls
present achievements in preparing simplified guidelines for
engineering of works and streamlining (in coordination with the
Bidding Committee, the Legal Office and the Financial Division) the
bidding, contracting and payment procedures for civil works would
be further tested and refined under the proposed project. The
Supervision and Control Division is being reorganized into seven
zones, each one responsible for three to five regiona offices.
Satisfactory provisions are being made and and would be further
strengthened under the proposed project to streamline the line of
command and responsibilities to make works supervision expeditious
and effective.  Additionally, under the proposed project, FNCV
would substantially increase the contracting of consulting firms
for the supervision of works.
(iii) Administration and execution of maintenance would be strengthened
under the project by FNCV with consultants' assistance through
several steps: utilization of the information system to be
established under the project to provide basic information for
efficient programing, monitoring and costing of maintenance

operations, and for satisfactory equipment management; expansion of
FNCV's improved capability for administration of civil works
preceding the administration of maintenance; improvement of the
efficiency of periodic and routine force account operations through
training of FNCV's field personnel and participation of FNCV's
equipment operators and mechanics in the training courses being
organized by MOPT and SENA; expansion and improvement of the
contracting and supervision of the execution of periodic
maintenance by contracting firms and of routine maintenance by
roadmen and micro-enterprises; and streamlining of equipment
administration.
(iv) FNCV's equipment management information system is based upon
partially applied recommendations prepared in the late 1970s by a
United Nations team for NOPT. However, this system is not applied
uniformly in all Regional Directorates, and, therefore, countrywide
information is not consistent. The master equipment registry is
satisfactory, however, monthly equipment control reports are
incomplete and vary from region to region, information on equipment
availability and utilization is unreliable, and spare parts
inventory and cost accounting are extremely deficient. The
technical assistance to be provided under the loan would assist
FNCV to strengthen its equipment management system according to
terms of reference described in Annex 10.

RURAL TI NSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
ProJect Execution, Auditing and Monitoring
1.        Execution of the project would be the responsibility of FNCV,
with the exception of the 'Departmental Roads Maintenance Study,' for which
FONADE would be responsible. This latter study would be carried out
according to term of reference agreed during negotiations and shown in
Annez 7. FNCV would execute its 1986-1992 Program according to the
individual progrm  agread with the corresponding international lending
institutions Involved and complying at least with the physical targets shown
in Table 1 of this annex. These programs and their execution would be
reviewed semi-annually with the Bank. Particular attention will be glven to
the compliance with annual targets for routine and periodic maintenance,
which have been set considering the gradual increase of FNCV'a capability,
and, in the future, gradual transfer of responsibilities for maintenance of
feeder roads from FNCV to the secretariats of Public Works in the
departments. The corresponding annual budgets will be monitored on the basis
of figures indicated in Table 3.2 of this SAR.
2.        As a condition of the approval of the relevant components of PNCV's
Program to be financed under the proposed loan, FNCV would submit to the Bank
annual programs based upon agreed economic and technical criteria. Once a
program has been declared eligible, FNCV would tender and award contracts
subject to ex-post review by the Bank. The time allowed for preparation of
bids would be 30 days for tenders having an estimated contract amount above
US$0.2 million and 15 days for smaller contracts. A copy of each contract,
together with the tender evaluation indicating the award decision, would be
filed by FNCV, to be made available for random review by project supervision
missions. If this review would show that, in a specific case, agreed tender
procedures were not followed, the Bank would have the right to reject the
contract and to cancel the corresponding amount.
3.        For project monitoring, FNCV would prepare quarterly reports for
the Bank providing information on its umintenance and investment budget,
including a breakdown by category of expenditures, and by force account and
contract. Force account expenditures should be further broken down by their
cost components; unit costs by force account and by contract would be
compared; productivity of force account operations would be assessed; length.
of roads being saintained and level of maintenance would be documented, and
compliance with agreed project implementation targets, status of selection
and execution of deferred maintenance, and general evaluations of the
condition of the network would be reviewed in the quarterly reports. The
disbursement schedule also would be reviewed and recommendations made for
eventual modifications of the programs and as needed, of the reporting
requirements.
4.        In order to monitor progress of the sector project's objectives,
FNCV would, at least semi-annually, meet with representatives of the Bari to
discuss and reach pertinent agreements on the following:

RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Departmental Rural Roads Study
and Terms of Reference
A.  General
1.        Responsibility for the maintenance of departmental (state) roads in
Colombia devolves upon the Secretariats of Public Works (SPW) In each of the
23 departments. The SPWs, organized along sisilar lines as the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport (MOPT), are also responsible for the planning,
construction and administration of the departmental roads. HDPT is obliged
to furnish the departments with technical advice and also transfers a part of
the proceeds from the Fondo Vial - the National Highway Trust Fund - to the
departments. The Yondo Vial 's source of revenues is the earmarked tax on
motor fuels. Maintenance of the departmental roads varies with the adminis-
trative and financial development of the departments, but is generally poor.
2.        A consultant's study of three departments, carried out in July of
1985, sbows wide disparities in their organizational, financial and technical
capabilities for maintaining the roads under their responsibility
effectively. With the exception of three or four developed departments, they
are generally deficient in organization and financial and technical
capability. This was recognized by the appraisal mission for the ongoing
Rural Roads Project (Loan 1966-CO), and the Loan Agreement for the project
included provisions for MOPT to review the organization and adequacy of the
departments to handle maintenance of the roads under their charge. NOPT' s
review has not tackled the problem adequately on possible grounds of
political sensitivities and the varying degrees of administrative maturity of
the departments. In the meantime, the inadequacy of maintenance of the
departmental roads appears to have assumed greater dieansion considering the
over 4X annual growth in the network for which the departments are
responsible and the tight domestic finances. The departmental road network,
which totaled some 3,200 km in 1975, is about 48,500 km at present.
3.        Under the proposed project, The National Fund for Development
Projects (FONADE) would finance a study to tasess the feasibility of
assisting selected departments to organize maintenance of their roads
efftectively. The selected departuents are: Atlantico, Boyaca, Cordoba,
Cundinsaarca and Valle.
B.  ObJectives
4.        The objectives of the study are to:
(a) diagnose and propose solutions to the administrative, financial and
technical deficiencies of selected SPWs to execute road
(b)  review the legislation and organizat'onal structure of the
departments vis-a-vis other Governmental agencies for maintaining
departmental roae'.;

(c) evaluate the human, financial and managerial resources needed to
strengthen the selected departments;
(d) assess the equipment requirements of the selected departments to
maintain their roads;
(e) determine the economically optimal ex.tent of the departmental road
network which should be maintained; and
(f) prepare, based upon in-depth technical and economic feasibility
studies, an action plan to implement cost-effective maintenance
strategies in the departments.
C.  Executing Agency
5.        PONADE would finalize the financial arrangesents for executing the
study by June 30, 1986. PONADE also will be responsible for executing the
study and oobilize qualified consultants on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank by November 1, 1986. DNP and the Bank will supervise execution
of the study.
D.   Staf fing
6.  The estimated professional staff requirements are as follows:
Foreign   Local
Economist, experienced in evaluation of road
construction rehabilitation and maintenance works.       4        8
Highway Engineers, experienced in design,
costing, construction and maintenance of secondary
and feeder roads (two locals).                           4       12
Mechanical engineer, experienced in assessment
of construction equipment and organization.              -        4
Public Administrator, experienced in assessment
of road administration organizations.                    -        6
8       30
E.   Reporting
7.        Four months after FONADE gives the order to proceed, consultants
will produce an interim report in Spanish for the lank's and PONADE's
review. Within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the interil report, the
Bank and PONADE will provide their commentary to the consultants. Within one
month from the receipt of the Bank's and FONADE's comments, the consultants
will produce a final report in Spanish upon their findings. FONADE will
forward three copies of the final report to the Bank within three weeks after
the consultants produce the final report.

COLOKBIA
RURAL TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
Outlined Methodology for Economic Evaluation
1. *       NCV has compiled a list of long term rural road construction and
deferred maintenance nees in a draft Plan Vial; the estimated cost is about
Col$ 77.9 billion. This annex describes the selection and evaluation
procedures for the roads, which will be grouped into ennual work programs.
FNCV would select the contents of the annual work program for the following
year and present it for Sank approval at the time of the semi-annual review
during the second semester of each year. The selection and evaluation
criteria described below will be incorporated in FNCV's manual 'Ietodologia y
Criterios para la Seleccion de Caminos, Document O.P. No. 031 dated
September 1980.
Selection of Roads
2.        Roads included for construction in the draft Plan Vial satisfy at
least one of the following conditions:
(a) link two existing roads;
(b)  link two population centers;
(c) link a population center to a commuoity; and
(d) link a rural road to another transport mode.
3.       Uased upon the petitions of the comunnities, roads to be included
In the annual work program would be selected from the list in the Plan
Vial.* Etimated costs in the Plan Vial for each of the roads would be
updated and the roads subjected to an Initial screening by the Planning
Office of FYCY. Roads that pass the initial screening test (minimum economic
rate of return of 12Z) would be retained in the tentative work program. For
roads which do not pass the first stage screening (based upon minival benefit
assumptions), a more detailed analysis would be conducted. Because of its
comprehensive geographic coverage, the types of benefits to be generated by
the project would vary, depending upon the particular needs of the
comunities to be served. For sost of the roads, the benefits from lower
transport costs, sore reliability, and better access to services, technical
assistance and farm inputs would be realized through the following:
(a) losses avoided in present production of cash crops which cannot be
coimercialized because of transport constraints;
(b) Increase of yield and/or area planted in present crops;
(c) shifte, where appropriate, in production patterns toward truck
farlng, i.ee., more perishable crops, notably fruit and
vegetables;



*59-
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 3
(d) increased commercial exploitation of livestock resaurces, notably
dairy products; and
(e) transport cost savings to non-freight and "through traffic.
4.        The first stage screening methodology involves the calculation of
benefits of the net value of production in the zone of Influence 1/ through
reduced production losses and increased new production. Benefits would be
calculated for the first year and held corstant for the evaluation perlod of
10 years. If the estimated rate of return, using the economic construction,
maintenance and rehabilitation costs for the period, is over 122, the
estimated opportunity cost of capital, the works would be considered
eligible, and no further economic evaluation would be made. The roads which
pass on this simplified methodology would generally be In areas with
substantial existing production and/or would have relatively low construction
costs. It is reasonable to assume that agricultural output would expand in
these areas when access IS improved. Adequate supplies of fertilizer would
be avallable, and the input distribution and marketing system would be
responsive. As the results of the socio-econouic impact study carried out to
assess the development impact of 28 roads totaling 250 km under the ongoing
Rural Roads Project (see Table 1 of this annex) Indicatv, credit and
extension services are available, and there appears to be no major cultural
constraint upon delivery of such services to farmers.
5.        The second-stage screening methodology requires more detail on the
specific potential benefits in terms of increased yields and cultivated
hectares for current types of grops as well as improved livestock output.
Estimates are made for each subproject's zone of influence, and the
incremental net value of production is calculated for year 10, when the
potential is expected to be reached. The investment costs include road
costs, as well as agricultural development costs. If the estimated economic
rate of return 2/ is greater than 12%, no further evaluation is made, and the
road is considered eligible for inclusion in the work program.
Size of the Annual Work Programs
6. It is likely that more roads would yield the minimal 12S economic rate
of return than could be financed under the program each year because of the
limitations on the amount of counterpart funds which are likely to be
available. Therefore, the selection committee - composed of representatives
from MOPT, FNCV and the Departments - would observe the following In
selecting the roads to be included in the work program  submitted for Bank
approval at the tine of the semi-annual reviews:
1/ Five km along the roadside, but may be shorter depending upon the local
terrain conditions.
2/ Calculated by applying Method lItI from Economic Appraisal of Rural
Roads: Simplified Operational Procedures for Screening and Appraisal,
Beenhakker and Lago, SWi 610, October 1983.

(a) within the limitation of available counterpart funds, no more than
a maximum of IOX of each year's lnvestwent program would be.
concentrated in any one department in line with the guiZelines set
by DNP - the National Planning Department; and
(b)  only those roads with the highest economic rates of return would be
included In the work program.
The priorities for periodic maintenance would be established based upon
technical criteria set out in the attachment to this annex. They include the
physical deterioration of the road, the traffic and the population served by
the road, as shown in Attachment I of this annex.
7.        All roads financed under the project loan would be selected based
upon their economic and technical feasibility. Technical criteria developed
by FNCV in 1980 in association with the Bank and IDB are satisfactory and
will apply to works financed under the project (Attachment 2 of this annex).
Additionally, since FNCV's 1986-1992 program also includes financing from
douestic resources and other multilateral sources:
(a) at least 85Z of investments financed from domestic resources would
be selected based on the foregoing procedures;
(b) of the remaining 15X, all works 5 km or over in length, or with an
estimated cost of US$200,000 equivalent or bigher, financed under
(a) preceding would be selected based upon foregoing evaluation
procedures; and
Cc) works financed through other multilateral resources would be
evaluated based upon criteria acceptable to the Bank.
Data Requirements
8.        Standard.  The physical condition of the roads would be updated
regularly as part of the inventory updating which FNCV would perform once
every year. Included in the inventory would be the physical features such as
culverts, ditches, erosion, the riding surface, et al, which need to be
maintained.
