I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   General
1.01      Colombia has coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Carib-
bean Sea, but this advantage of having two coastlines is offset by the dif-
ficulty of movement between the coasts and the interior. The three mas-
sive ranges of the Andes Mountains which run from south to north present
formidable barriers to communication between the main areas of population,
which, until recently, developed as separate and almost isolated communities.
Transport investment policy over the past 20 years has been aimed at national
integration and at overcoming the situation imposed by topography.
1.02      It was not until the early 1950s that Colombia's largely regionally
oriented ground transport system began to evolve into a national system. For
a long time, the Magdalena River was the only workable transport route between
the central region and the Atlantic coast. Since 1961, the Atlantic Railroad,
which was constructed with Bank assistance, has provided an all-weather
connection to the north to the port of Santa Marta. Colombia was developing
its trunk highway system at the same time.  By the early 1960s, construction
and upgrading of the Western Trunk Road (Cartagena-Medellin-Cali-Pasto), the
Eastern Trunk Road (Santa Marta-Bucaramanga-Bogota-Neiva) and the two main
transverse roads that connect the eastern and western trunk roads in the
central regicn were substantially complete. The highway system has since been
a catalyst of national integration.
1.03      In the early 1950s, roads accounted for about 43% of total freight
movements; inL the mid-1960s, that share had risen to about 53%, and, in 1976,
although no a6dequate statistics exist, the share was estimated to be close to
70% of all irLterregional and international traffic (60% of domestic traffic).
River transpcrt and coastal shipping account for about 30% and railways for
another 9% of domestic freight traffic.
1.04      Ovetrall total domestic freight traffic has grown in the last decade
at rates close to that of GDP, 6% to 7% p.a. While rail traffic has grown
very little, and inland shipping has grown at about 4% p.a., road traffic has
been growing faster than the average, around 8% p.a.
1.05      The role of the aviation system (discussed in more detail in Chapter II)
has traditiorLally been that of long distance passenger transport, and, prior to
the construction of the major highway and rail links, air services provided
the only reliable regular connections between many centers. The table on the
next page shows available data on the modal distribution of intercity passenger
and freight transport. Historical data are given in Table 1.1.

1.06      Over the last 10 years, rail passenger traffic has fluctuated
widely and has now regained the mid-1960s level, but only the Magdalena
route has offered significant competition to air transport. Strictly
comparable data are not readily available, and the recorded rail distances are
affected by terrain; however, a broad picture of air and rail passenger
traffic on different parts of the network is indicated on the next page.
Comparable data for road passenger traffic are not available although recent
figures suggest that it would be the predominant mode.

Passenger transport on the Magdalena river has also shown wide fluctuations,
but its volume is small (15,000 passengers in 1974); it is predominantly
a short-haul mode, with Magangue and smaller ports accounting for most of the
traffic generation.
B.   Railways
1.07      The railway system in service consists of about 2,912 km of single-
track narrow gauge (0.914 meters) Government-owned lines. The most important
routes are those between Santa Marta-Bogota and Santa Marta-Medellin -- the
Atlantic Lines -- which carry over 70Z of the total railway traffic. The
Pacific Line, which formerly connected Buenaventura and Cali with the Atlantic
Lines via Medellin, is now cut just south of Medellin for about 140 km and is
not planned to be reconnected.
1.08      After the Bank's appraisal of the Sixth Railway Project in 1972, the
Colombian NaLtional Railways (CNR) started showing improvements. Freight traffic
increased from 1.2 billion ton-km in 1972 to 1.4 billion in 1974, and passenger
traffic increased from 398 million pass-km to 482 million pass-km for the same
period. The working and operating ratios were even better than appraisal
targets, ancL, instead of the Col$ 120 million operating deficit in the appraisal
forecast for 1974, CNR produced a Col$ 10 million surplus. However, after
1974, CNR encountered technical, financial and management difficulties which
caused the railways' performance to deteriorate in 1975/76. Freight ton-km
decreased to 1.2 billion in 1976 because of a countrywide economic slowdown
and Government restrictions on imports of wheat and fertilizer which had been
transported by CNR. The poor availability of diesel locomotives due to
mechanical failure also presented a serious problem. The high incidence of



- 4 -
deraiiments and accidents, the increase in staff costs and the decrease in
freight traffic created serious financial difficulties in 1975/76. Government
interest in the railways also appears to have weakened during this period.
1.09      In 1977, however, improvements were noted in several areas.  CNR's
management, which had been weak between mid-1974 and mid-1977, improved under
the guidance of a newly appointed General Manager. Freight traffic, which is
the major source of income, increased 15% in the first 10 months of 1977 over
the corresponding period in 1976. Technical and financial performance also
improved. Tariffs were increased substantially in 1977 (freight 52%,
passengers 22%), and the total staff was reduced by about 9%. Further action
is being taken on these matters in 1978. The Government took certain steps
in favor of the railways; the Economic Committee of the Cabinet (CONPES)
approved recommendations by the National Planning Department to provide
adequate financial assistance to CNR to meet substantial operating deficits
and investment requirements, including planning and design for the proposed
Saboya-Carare rail link. The main purpose of this link would be to serve coal
exports expected to be mined in the vicinity of Saboya; it would also provide
an improved connection between Bogota and Santa Marta. The Ministry of Public
Works and Transportation (MOPT) is currently carrying out studies leading to
the preparation of a National Transport Plan. The studies, to be completed in
the latter part of 1978, would define the future role of the railways. The
Government generally is of the opinion that the railways have an important
role to play in transporting bulk commodities over long hauls.
C.   Inland Waterways
1.10      Although the traditional importance of inland shipping has decreased
because of the development of rail and of road transport, it is still signifi-
cant. Both the Magdalena and the Cauca rivers are navigable, and they account
for almost all inland shipping. The Magdalena river carries over 95% of the
traffic and, although of difficult navigation, is quite dependable in all
seasons to Gamarra (about 470 km from the Barranquilla river-sea terminal);
beyond there to Salgar (930 km from Barranquilla), navigation is only season-
ally possible. Bulk goods, especially petroleum and fertilizer products,
constitute the main freight movement, but there is still competition for this
traffic from other modes. Total traffic in 1976 was about 3.3 million tons,
of which 74% was petroleum products. Passenger traffic on the river is
negligible. Inland shipping has complemented rail traffic to some extent,
particularly for goods originating from and destined to the port of Cartagena,
which is connected to the Magdalena river by a man-made canal (Canal del Dique).
Transshipments to both rail and road can be effected at Cienaga and a number of
river ports further upstream; yet, the comparative advantage of road transport
vis-a-vis the combined river-rail or river-road movements makes these combina-
tions viable for just a few products.
D.   Highways
1.11      Colombia has a road network totaling about 51,000 km, of which
21,000 km are national highways under the jurisdiction of MOPT. Almost all
the remainder (27,500 km) are the responsibility of the departments. Only
about one-third of the national system and about 3% of the departmental roads



- 5 -
are paved; the rest are gravel or unsurfaced roads. The national highway
system includes the trunk road network which connects the main economic
centers and ports as well as secondary roads linking smaller towns to the
trunk roads. The two major transport corridors run north-south along the
Cauca and Magdalena valleys and are connected by two paved roads in the
central region, one via Ibague-Armenia and the other via Honda-Manizales.
1.12      There are about 500,000 motor vehicles in Colombia, of which roughly
three-quarters are passenger vehicles, mainly automobiles, and the rest are
freight trucks. The fleet has grown at a rate of about 9% per annum over the
five years 1970-1975.  The number of trucks has been lucreasing faster than
the number oE automobiles (12% per annum compared with 7% per annum for
automobiles). There are no reliable statistics on the composition of the
fleet, but a survey carried out in 1973 by the Transport Finance Corporation,
a Government agency, showed that 60% of the truck fleet has a payload capacity
of less than 7 tons, 30% of between 7 and 10 tons and only 10% of over 10 tons.
About 90% of the trucks are single rear axle vehicles, and overloaded vehicles
are common on the roads. Colombia instituted vehicle weight control regula-
tions in 1955, but they have been enforced sparingly. Under the Loan Agree-
ment for the Seventh Highway Project (1471-CO), the Government has undertaken
to develop and implement a plan of action acceptable to the Bank to control
vehicle weights. The proposed plan of action is now being prepared and would
be ready for review by October 31, 1978.
1.13      Traffic on the main trunk network of the country has been growing at
an average rate of 8% per annum. Traffic volumes on most paved roads are in
the 1,000 to 2,000 vehicles-per-day range, except around the major urban
centers of Bogota, Cali and Medellin, where they amount to about 4,000 to
6,000 vehicles per day. The average composition of traffic is about 30% to
40% automobiles, 10% to 20% buses and 20% to 40% trucks. Road transport
is heavily regulated in Colombia; entry into the industry is regulated
by the provisions of the National Transport Statute, and supply, measured by
the number of trucks that can be licensed every year, is tightly controlled by
the National Transport Institute (INTRA), the regulatory arm of MOPT. These
rather stringent controls on the supply of trucking capacity have created a
situation in which prices, which are not controlled, have increased to
comparatively high levels, vis-a-vis other modes of transport and the costs of
generating the services involved. The Government is considering measures to
facilitate entry into the industry; it is likely that this will be a slow
process.
E.   Ports
1.14      The principal seaports of Colombia are Cartagena, Barranquilla and
Santa Marta on the Atlantic coast and Buenaventura on the Pacific coast.
Between 1966 and 1976, the traffic in the four main ports (about two-thirds
imports and one-third exports) increased from 2.1 million tons to 3.0 million
tons. With the improvements of the transit storage and cargo-handling facili-
ties carried out with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing, the
four main pcrts are now able to handle over 4 million tons of general cargo
per year. Consequently, there should be no overall capacity problem in the



-6-
foreseeable future. Bottlenecks may occur for certain products requiring
specialized handling and storing facilities, e.g., in Cartagena for the
handling of fertilizer, Santa Marta for bulk grain and Buenaventura for
coffee.
F.   Investments, Regulation and Coordination
1.15      The effort to complete the basic transport network has required a
considerable proportion of the country's total investment. Transport repre-
sented between 10% and 15% of domestic investment and about half the Central
Government's investment in the late 1950s.  When the trunk highway system and
the Atlantic Railways were being completed, that proportion rose to more than
60% of Central Government investment. More recently, however, the proportion
has been declining; in the late 1960s, it was about 35%, and, since 1970, it
has been about 25% of total public investment. In 1975, Col$ 3,200 million
were invested in the transportation sector (around US$107 million); of this,
about 60% went to road transport, 18% to rail transport, 11% to aviation, 8%
to ports and marine transportation and 3% to shipping and inland waterways
(see table below). On the whole, this distribution reflects the present
economic importance of the different modes of transport.   -

1.16      Several studies, the last of which was the "Magdalena River Basin
Transport Study" (Netherlands Economic Institute, 1974), have not had a sig-
nificant impact on creating a framework for improved transport coordination.



-7-
Until 1966, when Decree 3160 attempted to tie in the various entities
responsible Eor transportation with the Ministry of Public Works (MOP), no
form of central coordination was imposed. Before that, responsibility for the
administration of the transport system was divided among a number of agencies
and decentraLized organizations, the largest being MOP itself. Decree 3160
made the MinLster of Public Works an ex-officio member of the boards of all
these agencies. Yet Ministerial control remained limited, and the lack of
central coordination of the different modes persisted.
1.17      More recently, however, coordination of the modes has been tightened
up considerably. Decree 154 of January 27, 1976 restructured MOP and turned
it into MOPT. The objectives, functions and structure of many of the
Departments, Divisions and Offices within MOPT and some of the decentralized
institutions were redefined. Article 12 of the Decree refers specifically to
the planning and coordinating functions of the restructured Planning Office in
MOPT and assigns to it all functions necessary to effect intermodal planning
and coordinaltion for the transport sector as a whole. Moreover, expanded
Ministerial powers now include approval of the annual budget and investment
programs for all modes except aviation.
1.18      Experience with the new MOPT organization has been short, and no
assessment of its effectiveness can yet be made; however, there is now a
reasonable expectation that improvements in intermodal planning would come
about in the future. An example of this is the proposed intermodal development
study which ithe Planning Office of MOPT is preparing to undertake, with its
own staff, during the fall of 1978, of the Llanos area. This study would
compare the requirements of roads, inland waterways and aviation and determine
in a general way which mode should be developed to serve which points.
1.19      Since June 1976, the Government of the Netherlands has been pro-
viding technical help in MOPT's Planning Office: in defining its activities,
in on-the-job staff training and in initiating the preparation of a National
Transport Plian, which should provide the base for proper planning.
G.   Bank Involvement in the Transport Sector
1.20      The Bank has played an important role in the development of Colombia's
transport sector. Since 1950, it has lent a total of US$345.1 million. Bank
Group financing for the Colombian transport sector is shown in Table 1.2.
Over the period 1953-1977, Bank disbursements accounted for about 10% of total
investment for highways and 30% for railways. The Bank started financing
transport investments as a result of the findings of the 1949 General Survey
Mission, which found the transport system in exceptionally bad condition. The
Bank has made 12 loans and one IDA credit to the sector. Seven loans and one
IDA credit totaling US$225.6 million have assisted construction and upgrading
of the trunk highway network. Two loans for US$40.9 million financed the
construction of the Atlantic Railroad, from La Dorada, near Bogota, to
Fundacion, n,ear the port of Santa Marta, a distance of 672 km. Four loans
totaling US$78.7 million supported a railway rehabilitation program, which
helped to provide rolling stock for the new Atlantic Railroad and to rehab-
ilitate many sections of track.



-8-
1.21      The early highway projects, although beset with delays and cost
overruns, resulted in the reconstruction or upgrading of 3,200 km of trunk
roads a.d co.aLributed to the development of a unified trunk road system and to
the emergence of road transport as the main means of freight transportation.
The later highway projects were also delayed in execution because of a general
economic slowdown which resulted in delayed provision of local funds, poor
contract management and insufficient supervision and coordination by MOP.
Nevertheless, the Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects, despite their short-
comings, have made important contributions to the trunk road system and
assisted in the establishment of better engineering practices and improved
contractual procedures. Furthermore, they contributed to the development of
the local consulting and construction industries.
1.22      The latest Bank loan (Loan 926-CO) also helped in the rehabilitation
of the Colombian Railways. The ongoing project had some difficulties mainly
due to changes in the management; however, significant improvements have been
noted recently (para 1.09), and the Government is now considering long term
arrangements for the development of the Railways.
1.23      A transport sector mission visited Colombia between March 27 and
April 14, 1978 to review recent developments and future requirements of the
sector and to outline areas suitable for future involvement of the Bank.
II. THE AVIATION SUBSECTOR
A.   Subsector Characteristics
2.01      In recognition of the major problems caused by the topography to
surface transportation, Colombia very early turned to aviation for at least a
partial solution and, in 1919, established what is now the second oldest
continuously operated airline in the world, Avianca (Aerovias Nacionales de
Colombia, S.A.), which serves international and domestic points. Two other
Colombian firms are currently engaged in international service, Aerocondor
(Aerovias Condor de Colombia, S.A.) and SAM (Sociedad Aeronautica de Medellin
Consolidada, S.A.). Eleven foreign airlines serve Colombia, and there are 10
additional scheduled domestic airlines. Supporting these scheduled carriers
are many charter and non-scheduled foreign airlines plus a domestic fleet of
about 800 non-scheduled commercial, general aviation and private aircraft.
2.02      Air transport in Colombia is a major passenger transport mode for
both international and inter-city travel (para 1.05), and, while air freight
represents only a very small proportion of the total transport operations, air
exports are among the fastest growing (para 2.08).
B.   The Aviation Network and Traffic Growth
2.03      One-third of domestic air passengers travel between the principal
cities and Bogota; the four largest airports -- Bogota, Medellin, Cali and



- 9 -
Barranquilla -- together handle two-thirds of all traffic. Traffic flows and
airport traffic data are shown in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. The domestic air
passenge& iiarket is dominated by business travel; surveys put the propor-
tion between 50% and 65% on the major routes. Long term growth in the
domestic passenger market has averaged 4% p.a. over 1967-1976 compared with a
2.7% p.a. growth in GNP per capita, and 2.8% p.a. in population. Domestic
passenger traffic has grown by 13% p.a. on average since 1974.
2.04      Domestic freight tonnage has declined in recent years although, in
terms of ton-km, the volume has remained stable.  Most noticeable has been the
decline in freight handled at Bogota, reflecting the decline in the volume of
engine parts carried between Bogota and Medellin, following improvements in
road conditions. A further contributing factor has been the spread of direct
international flights, which avoid domestic transshipment of air exports and
imports.
2.05      International passenger and freight flows are similarly concentrated
over a few imnportant routes as shown in the following table:

2.06      Foreign tourism has grown at an annual rate of 19% since the late
1960s, with Venezuelan and Ecuadorian travel (mostly by road) showing partic-
ularly high growth since 1973. European and North American travel to Colombia
(by air) is averaging 11-12% annual growth. Unlike the domestic air market,
foreign air travel to Colombia is mostly for recreation (62%), with only 15%
for business. The remaining 23% of travel takes place for health, education
and family visits. International passenger traffic accounts for 12% of total
passenger movements.
2.07      Air freight exports (Table 2.1) have grown at over 20% p.a. since
1966, and air trade with North America has grown at nearly 30% p.a. Around
80% of all export freight uses Bogota airport, and most of that consists of
perishable items such as cut flowers and tropical fish. Colombia has a well
established major market in the United States and now supplies 6% of the fresh
flower imports of Western Europe. Small but rapidly growing industries
relying on air freight have also sprung up around Medellin and Cali (see table
following).

2.08      Air freight imports are about 10% less than exports and have been
growing at a slightly higher rate (22%) and include, predominantly,
manufactured goods and specialized items. About half of the air freight --
domestic and international -- is carried in all cargo aircraft.
2.09      East of the Andes in the Llanos and Amazonas regions, air services
provide the only year-round connections for many centers. Air services are
provided by Satena -- a military airline set up to provide services in remote
areas -- and a number of smaller airlines serving the more profitable routes.
Overall traffic levels in the region are low, about 4% of total domestic
passengers and 6% of freight. About 60%, by weight, of the traffic in these
regions is freight, chiefly imports to these regions of food, seeds, drugs
and tools. An overall transport strategy for this region is to be studied
(para 1.18).
C.   Regulation and Planning
2.10      The Departamento Administrativo de Aeronautica Civil (DAAC) formulates
and then administers Government policies for the aviation subsector in addition
to planning, operating and maintaining the airport and air navigation facility
network and setting and enforcing standards through personnel licensing,
aircraft registration and specification of procedures. Chapter III examines
the operations of DAAC in more detail, and the following paragraphs discuss
those functions particularly relevant to airline performance.
2.11      DAAC is advised on policy and regulatory matters by the Superior
Council of Civil Aeronautics, which includes representatives of other relevant
public bodies such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Public Works
and Transportation, Department of National Planning and the Colombian Air
Force. At its regular weekly meetings, this Council receives submissions
and representations from the airlines and other interested parties on
matters such as fares, routes, fleets and user charges. The Director of
DAAC, however, has final responsibility for formulating and implementing
policies for the orderly development of aviation. Under its general mission
to "direct, regulate, coordinate and control" aviation activity in Colombia,
DAAC has specific regulatory authority only in the matters of setting both
user charges and airline tariffs. However, under its general direction, and



- 11 -
through its responsibilities to provide and operate airport and airways
facilities, DAAC exerts a wide ranging influence on commercial aviation
activities.
2.12      The combination of responsibilities for infrastructure and those
affecting traffic development potentially provide the opportunity for the
preparation of coordinated plans reflecting traffic requirements and the broad
scale of resources available. However, until recently, the DAAC Planning
Department played only a minor role in investment planning, and the use of
economic and. financial, as well as technical, tests of facility requirements
was not widely practiced. As a result, insufficient consideration has been
given to the priority of projects, and past investment programs have exceeded
the funds available (Chapter III and paragraph 5.33). Also, there has been
no regular review, through the planning process, of the effects of regulatory
practices On the aviation system and its costs (paras 2.15-2.17).
2.13      Over the past 18 months, the Planning Department developed a central
role in investment planning and consequently became overburdened by these new
responsibiliLties. However, with the reorganization of DAAC approved in 1977
(para 3.06) and the technical assistance in planning envisaged in the project
(para 4.39). a strong planning and research group would be organized, consoli-
dating improvements already made.
D.   The Coimmercial Airlines
2.14      The airlines in Colombia are all privately owned and, in general,
efficiently managed. The three trunk airlines, Avianca, SAM and Aerocondor,
serve the major domestic and international routes, while the ten smaller
airlines operate supplementary services. The main inter-city passenger
services are provided by Boeing 727-100 or Boeing 720-B aircraft; other
services are offered by Fokker F-27, De-Havilland DHC-6 and a variety of
older aircraft.
2.15      Unlike the situation in many countries, the domestic airlines offer
different fares over the same route sectors and hence compete, within the
regulated environment, in terms of both fares and frequencies. Domestic air
fares in Colombia are very low--both in relation to costs and by comparison
with other countries (Table 2.3). Two of the major airlines have submitted
applications to DAAC for fare increases averaging 50% over the next six months
to cover increased operating costs. The last fare increase (approved in 1977)
of around ].4% was in response to cumulative cost increases from 1974.
2.16      The policy of maintaining low domestic fares and tariffs to facilitate
aviation development seems now to be counterproductive. Low fares, combined
with rising financing rates, make new domestic capital ventures unattractive
to investors and financing of new aircraft for internal services uneconomical
for the airlines. Maintenance costs are particularly high because of a
combination of high import and sales duties on spare parts, and, because of a
relatively inefficient labor force, much of Avianca's formerly growing business
in providing maintenance and overhaul services for foreign airlines has now
been lost. The three major carriers are maintaining profitability through
intensive equipment use with high rates of aircraft utilization and load
factors of about 70%. The difficulty in raising capital or financing on
suitable terms was a major factor in poor aircraft choices for three airlines:
SAM, which retired its Electra fleet in favor of ex-Avianca B720s; and Aerotal



- 12 -
and TAC, which purchased ex-LAN Chile Caravelles. All the airlines, however,
are constrained in their ability to replace older, costlier aircraft with more
efficient types. It is estimated that fare levels on major services are now
some 6-25% below the economic costs to the airlines and should be increased,
both to maintain efficiency in current service levels and to provide a base
for future expansion. The environment in Colombia tends to ensure efficiency
in domestic operations and high equipment use factors.
2.17      Since the continued development of the industry depends upon adequate
pricing of its services, a review of current tariff policies is necessary.
This matter was discussed with DAAC at the time of negotiations. The Bank
received assurances that DAAC would, with technical assistance to be provided
to its Planning Department under the project (para 4.39), undertake a review of
its tariff-setting procedures and establish improved guidelines for approving
fare adjustments. It was agreed during negotiations that the review of the
guidelines would be submitted to the Bank for comments by January 1, 1980
and that the agreed results would be established by June 30, 1980.
2.18      The same factors are not so restricting on the main international
services. Both Avianca and Aerocondor have recently introduced wide-body
aircraft in response to competitive pressure, and both are planning additional
aircraft within a few years. On the major routes, Colombian airlines have
adopted a common fare structure with other carriers, and, overall, achieve a
50% market share in passenger traffic and almost 70% of the freight traffic.
E.   Demand and Market Aspects
2.19      Passenger demand on the main domestic routes has been largely
unaffected by the development of the primary road system, and growth is much
more closely aligned with population and income trends. For the shorter
services, however, there is some indirect evidence that road transport opera-
tions have become relatively more important, with air services tending more
and more to concentrate their primary role upon long distance operations.
Similar trends are observable in domestic air freight flows. These trends are
indicated in the following table:

2.20      Passenger growth on the main routes has been substantially above the
overall national trend. For Colombia as a whole, traffic is increasing at

around 13% per year after a relatively stable period between 1970 and 1974,
which is reflected in the table on the preceding page. Passenger traffic
between BogotaL and the three next largest cities has grown at a long term
annual rate of over 7% and at 18% p.a. since 1974; traffic among the three
cities themse].ves shows a long term growth of 6% with increases of 13% per
year since 1974. Cartagena, a relatively small city in the Colombian setting,
generates a disproportionately high demand for air travel because of its
attractiveness to domestic holiday-makers and has exhibited a long term growth
trend of around 9% with recent increases of around 16% p.a.  Traffic on minor
routes shows slide fluctuations from year to year and, particularly on the

F.   Traffic Projections
2.21      Forecasts for domestic air passenger traffic at the project airports
(see table beLow), prepared by the consultants (Restrepo y Uribe Ltda. for
Bogota and Cartagena and Compania de Estudios e Interventorias, CEI Ltda., for
Medellin) and modified during appraisal, are based on separate analyses of
growth trends, relationships between traffic, income and population growth,
and the overall share of each airport in Colombian air traffic. The adopted
forecasts are a blend of five different projection methods and most nearly
reflect the average between the upper and lower ranges. The effect of this
forecasting method is to even out the very high growth rates since 1974, and,
for the next two to three years, traffic would probably exceed the forecast
trend. For Colombia as a whole, forecasts are based on estimates for other
airports which, together with Cartagena, Bogota and Medellin, handled 70%
of all passenger traffic in 1976.

2.22      Domestic cargo projections are made difficult by the changing market
patterns, and forecasts have been based on an assessment of trends for
different city pairs with, for individual airports, an allowance for the
increasing volume of transshipped cargo. While, on many routes, cargo traffic
is still declining, the decline appears to have been arrested on others.
Particularly for Cali, Bucaramanga, Cucuta and San Andres, volumes for major
flows have been increasing steadily over the past three to four years. On



- 14 -
this basis, it could be expected that, within the next few years, other routes
would also reach a basic level reflecting wholly domestic air transport
requirements, from which an overall but slow growth would occur. For the
project airports and Cali, projections were made for each major cargo flow,
and forecasts for Colombia as a whole are built from the overall trends in
main flows for these and other airports.
2.23      Forecasts of domestic aircraft traffic (see table below) are based
on airline plans and projected fleet composition in key years of the forecast
period, which, with assumed load factors, lead to a trend in average passengers
per aircraft. In forecasting aircraft traffic, allowances are made both for
the availability of capacity on domestic sectors of international services
and for freight carried in the holds of passenger aircraft.

2.24      Forecasts for international traffic were made in a similar way,
adjusting trend projections for each city for its share in the overall inter-
national market, and basing aircraft movement forecasts on projections of
fleet composition and average loads. For Cartagena, forecasts of international
charter traffic were made using a conservative 3% growth, consistent with
accommodation levels that would be available in 1980 (Table 2.4), and assuming
that the DC-8 and B707 aircraft to be used on these services are fully occupied.
The official forecasts of the Corporacion Nacional de Turismo (CNT), used as
a check against the adopted forecast, project foreign tourism to all destina-
tions in Colombia at an average growth of 14% p.a. up to 1985, and, to Bogota,
Cartagena and Medellin, at 11.1% p.a., 29.6% p.a. and 26.5% p.a. over the next
three years respectively. On this basis, it is expected that charter traffic
would represent 60% of all foreign visitors to Cartagena in 1980 compared with
75% in 1977.
2.25      Traffic forecasts are summarized in the following table, and further
details of the forecasts for project airports are given in Table 2.5.

2.26      The lowest of the projection methods, reflecting arithmetic traffic
growth trends between 1966 and 1976, was used to test the sensitivity of the
economic analysis to traffic projections. The average annual compound growth
rates implied in this projection are 4% for domestic passengers and 8% for
international passengers, compared with the best estimates of 7% for domestic
passengers and 10% for international passengers.
G.   Aviation Infrastructure
2.27      Because of the wide variation in temperature, rainfall, elevation,,
soil condition and traffic, the 70-odd airports in Colombia vary widely in
their development and condition. In general, those in the western half of
the country (within and west of the mountains) are more fully developed
than those in the east (in the Llanos and Amazonas).
2.28      At present, there are seven airports in mainland Colombia, with one
additional on the island of San Andres in the Caribbean Sea, which are primarily
domestic airports but also serve international flights. Of these, in accordance
with the National Plan for Airports, Cali, San Andres, Barranquilla, Leticia
and Bucaramalnga are relatively new or expanded, but the airports at Bogota
and Cartagena need moderate improvements, and Medellin requires a replacement
airport. All eight airports are paved and can accept, either readily or with
some degree of restriction, modern jet aircraft.



- 16 -
2.29      The rest of the airports in Colombia range from semi-improved gravel
strips to cleared areas on relatively ungraded fields. These latter are
typical ot the airports in the Llanos and Amazonas areas where air service
is the most nearly continuous mode of transportation since it operates through-
out the year except for periods of extended rain, when the dirt runways become
soft. Traffic at these airports is light, and the aircraft used are generally
the smaller and older piston engine transports.
2.30      Air navigational aids and communication systems in Colombia are
minimal and, at present, exist only at the major airports. Regional air
traffic control is handled by Bogota, but each of the major airports has its
own control tower for area traffic. Many of the newer minor airports
throughout the country have been provided with control towers, but they are
not operated because of lack of staff. Three radar systems, which will
provide coverage for most of the country, are in the process of being installed,
but this system will not be fully operational for another five years. The
navigational aids that do exist are rarely calibrated and, as a result, are
not fully reliable (paras 4.34-4.40).
III. THE EXECUTING AGENCIES
A.   Aviation Administration
3.01      Aviation in Colombia is governed by DAAC, a governmental agency
directly responsible to the President of the Republic, which was established
by Decreto Ley 3140 of December 26, 1968. This law also established the Fondo
Aeronautico Nacional (FAN), which functioned as the financial and investment
entity in support of DAAC. During the ensuing years, it was found that the
organization set forth in Law 3140 was not adequate because the administrative
divisions between DAAC and FAN were not well defined, and a new law was passed
which corrected these shortcomings (Law 3, January 21, 1977).
3.02      DAAC's primary areas of responsibility are the setting of aeronauti-
cal policy, control of aeronautical communications, execution of studies and
works (with financing through FAN), administration and operation of airports
and aeronautical installations, ensuring safety and efficiency in the air
transportation industry, and establishing the level and structure of airport
user charges, passenger fares and freight rates. These functions are performed
by a total staff of about 3,000 employees, of whom 800 are in the headquarters
in Bogota and 2,200 work throughout the system at the regional airports. The
technical staff (professionals, technical aviation inspectors, instructors,
air traffic controllers, communicators, meteorologists, flight inspectors,
pilots, engineers and technicians) consists of 1,135 people, of whom 335 are
located in Bogota and 800 are at the outlying airports. All of these areas of
expertise require improvement to meet the increasing demands placed on DAAC by
the growing civil aviation industry. This need has been recognized by DAAC,
and training for key technical staff is under way, but limited because of
financial constraints. Funds for additional training are provided in the
project (para 4.40).



- 17 -
3.03      FAN is an autonomous public entity with legal personality, which func-
tions in the same manner as the National Highway Fund of the Ministry of
Public Works and Transportation, with the exception that FAN may not contract
with individuals. It is essentially a bank account for DAAC, with all FAN
personnel requirements being met by DAAC staff. The Director of DAAC, who is
appointed by the President of the Republic, is the legal representative of FAN
and also its administrator. FAN's primary function is the provision of funds
for studies, construction, maintenance, improvements, operations, supervision
of construction and acquisition of movable and fixed assets in accordance with
the established needs of DAAC. However, before any project may be undertaken
by DAAC, FAN must satisfy the Ministry of Finance, after a review by the
National Planning Department (DNP), that adequate financing would be available
to ensure an orderly progress and completion of the project. Law 3 provides
the following sources for funds for FAN: (a) from the national budget,
(b) sale of property, (c) financing through local or foreign debt (which may
be guaranteed by the Government), and (d) revenues from operation of DAAC.
The primary source of funds is the collection of revenues for services provided
by DAAC, of which the most important are the airport passenger fees and landing
fees, representing 86% of total revenues in 1977. A more detailed explanation
of the relal:ionship of DAAC and FAN is given in Chapter VI.
3.04      Law 3 provides for the transfer of land owned or to be acquired by
DAAC to the National Government without charge. This was an administrative
move only to avoid local taxes. However, DAAC is still responsible for
administering this land, and , if no longer required for aeronautical purposes,
FAN would receive the proceeds of the sale of such land in accordance with
Articles 8 and 13 of Law 3.
3.05      In the past, DAAC/FAN suffered from poor financial management which
resulted in heavy investment in navigational aids and communications equipment
when the associated debt service for this equipment could not be covered by
its own revenues. Contracts were also let to construct terminal buildings at
Cartagena and Barranquilla. Construction of the terminals was only partially
completed when the funds were exhausted. In 1976 and 1977, the Government
provided additional budget funds to pay for the debts incurred and payable
during this period. As a result, after a long delay, installation of the
equipment and construction of the buildings are proceeding.
3.06      An important provision of Law 3 empowered the President of the
Republic to make the following changes:
(a) Reorganization of DAAC, which, after considerable time and effort,
hbas been accomplished and has already improved the performance of
DAAC. The new organization is shown on Chart 18901.
(b) Establishment of a career program for technical personnel, with
a special emphasis on selection and salary review; this program
is under way and will make for a stronger technical group by
keeping compensation in line with job responsibilities.
(c) IReview, and changes as required, for the compensation of employees.
This has been carried out; Col$ 70 million were allocated for
l-his purpose for 1978.



- 18 -
B.   Financial Management
3.07      DAAC/FAN operates under budgetary systems whereby a general budget
of anticipated revenues, borrowings, maintenance, investment and debt service
is developed and submitted to DNP for approval. Once the budget is approved
by DNP, it is presented to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The annual
budget for DAAC/FAN for salaries and miscellaneous expenses must be reviewed
and approved by the Ministry of Finance only. Any unusual expenditures
outside the budgets which might arise during the year must receive prior
approval from DNP and the Ministry of Finance as appropriate.
3.08      Under present arrangements, FAN receives all revenues generated
from services provided by DAAC. DAAC does not have any direct revenues. FAN
transfers up to, and not more than, 10% of its estimated total annual revenues
to the Ministry of Finance, which, in turn, provides FAN with resources to
cover salary requirements and miscellaneous expenses (utilities, office
supplies and cleaning materials) of DAAC. The balance of the FAN revenues
is used to meet the maintenance, investment and debt service requirements
of DAAC. Capital items, both current payments and debt service, are normally
paid by revenues collected by FAN. When FAN is not able to cover all of
its financial obligations, the Ministry of Finance provides budget allocations
to DAAC/FAN to make up the difference. Any excess revenues for the fiscal
year remain with FAN.
3.09      Because of inadequate collection procedures, it is estimated at the
present time that possible revenues for the passenger departure fees are being
only 80% realized for domestic and 90% for international fees (para 6.08).
Additionally, no revenues are collected for services provided at approximately
50 of the 80 airports under DAAC administration. This situation exists
because DAAC feels that the level of services currently provided does not
justify charges, and that the lack of charges at these airports will help to
stimulate air transport in the remote regions of Colombia and provide an
important social service. Such an approach is considered reasonable at
certain airports since this is the only practical mode of transportation for
most of the Llanos, Amazonas and Pacific coast regions.
C.   Accounting
3.10      DAAC has recently brought its financial statements up to date
through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1976. The new balance sheets
reflect a revaluation of assets. The financial statements for the fiscal year
1977 have been completed and were approved by the Government in June 1978.
However, the statements have not been received by the Bank and a proforma
balance sheet for 1977 was obtained and is shown in Table 6.3. This is the
first time in the history of DAAC that this task has been accomplished in a
timely manner.
3.11      In an effort to strengthen the accounting capability, DAAC is
preparing to undertake a study of its accounting system and, at the same time,
to determine if the volume of activity warrants computerization. This study
would be conducted by a consultant with a loan from Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo
(FONADE). During negotiations, the Government confirmed that this study would
be completed by July 1, 1979, that the Bank would be consulted about the
implementation of the recommendations of the study and that the recommenda-
tions accepted would be implemented by December 31, 1979.



- 19 -
D.   Aviation Planning
3.12      DIAC has been operating on a ten-year National Plan for Airports
1970-1979 (IPA), which was substantially modified in 1973 by the National Plan
for Air Navigation 1973-1983 (NPAN). The NPAN recommended a first phase
development (1973-1976) which would provide a navaid system approximately five
times larger than the navigational aids and communications component of the
orginal NPA.. Contracts were entered into without determining where the funds
for payment or installation would come from. Later, DAAC engaged foreign
consultants to establish priorities for the optimal installation and utili-
zation of the equipment. Their report is now being studied by DAAC to deter-
mine how installation can proceed within funds available. Since this high-
lighted the weaknesses within the Planning Department of DAAC, the project
provides for the strengthening of this department further described in
paragraph 4.39.
3.13      Coordination of aviation plans with other Government programs is
maintained through review by DNP, and, for proposals in the Llanos/Amazonas
regions, by joint planning efforts with the Department of National Territories
(DAINCO), which is responsible for coordinating all public programs in these
areas. Informal contact is maintained with the Sectoral Planning Office of
MOPT, and these ties would be strengthened during the forthcoming transport
study for the Llanos area (para 1.18). The Sectoral Planning Office has no
formal authority to review aviation budgets, and there seems to be no advantage
in altering the present arrangements.
3.14      DAAC's overall investment program to 1983 was reviewed by the mission
and adjusted, by agreement, in the light of projected cash requirements.
Overall, the program includes expenditures of Col$ 9,243.4 million, of which
the project accounts for 63%. Non-project investments (Table 3.1) contain
complementary improvements at other domestic airports, including completion of
the terminal buildings at Cartagena and Barranquilla and the provision of
facilities for domestic services of other airports. Overall, civil works
amount to 51% of the planned non-project items, with the installation program
for navigational aids accounting for an additional 40%. The program reflects
the implementation of the national plans for airports and air navigation, and
investments in 1978 and 1979 are largely the completions under existing
contracts. New projects included in the 1980-1983 period are justified in
the light of expected traffic growth and changes in service patterns.
3.15      It was agreed during negotiations that the non-project investment
plan would be reviewed annually by DAAC and the Government,in consultation
with the Bank, until the closing date of the project.
E.   System Engineering
3.16      TChe electronic and airport engineering sections of DAAC are suitable
for small projects but require assistance when large projects are attempted.
To solve their inadequacies, DAAC customarily engages consultants. However,
for very large projects, DAAC engineers would be unable to provide the necessary
supervision of the consultants (para 3.21).



- 20 -
F.   System Maintenance
3.17      With the rapid growth of the system, DAAC is unable to maintain its
navigational aids and communication equipment adequately. In some instances,
equipment is installed but has never been placed in operation, a situation
which could cause early deterioration due to corrosion. With the introduction
of new equipment types, staff hiring and training has become a large problem
(para 3.21).
3.18      Airport maintenance is also neglected (para 3.21).  Funds are seldom
forthcoming to provide proper preventive or corrective maintenance in a timely
manner. To help solve this problem, funds have been included in the financial
projection to provide adequate maintenance (para 3.21 and Table 6.5). It was
agreed during negotiations that adequate maintenance in accordance with
accepted practices and good engineering concepts would be provided at all
facilities of DAAC/FAN.
G.   System Operation
3.19      There are not enough personnel engaged in air traffic control.
Generally, those at the major airports are properly trained, but outlying
airports lack trained personnel. Even the personnel at the major airports are
in need of refresher courses in modern jet aircraft procedures and in the use
of new types of navigational aid equipment (para 3.21).
3.20      The enlargement of the airports is also causing a problem because
of the lack of adequate airport operational and management personnel.
3.21      These problems (paras 3.16 through 3.20) would be addressed in the
proposed project through the provision of technical assistance experts and
training (paras 4.39 and 4.40).
IV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A.  Objectives
4.01      The project, consisting of the highest priority items with major
foreign exchange components in the five-year investment plan (para 3.14 and
Table 3.1), is designed to improve the flow of air traffic within Colombia.
To do so, it would remove the constraints to air traffic growth at the airports
of Medellin, Cartagena and Bogota, provide flight calibration equipment for
use on the airways throughout the country and strengthen the administration,
planning and financing procedures of DAAC.
B.   General Description
4.02      The project, to be implemented by DAAC over a five-year period,
would consist of: (a) lengthening and strengthening the runway at Cartagena,
enlarging the aircraft apron, improving landside access, providing automobile
parking areas, improving the drainage and providing navaids and communications;
(b) strengthening taxiways and existing aircraft aprons at Bogota, enlarging
the international and domestic passenger terminal fingers, improving the cargo
facilities, enlarging the passenger terminal aprons (including the necessary
relocation of the access road to the military aircraft area), enlarging the
automobile parking area and providing additional navaids; (c) providing a
complete new airport at Rionegro as a replacement for the existing Medellin



- 21 -
airport, to consist of a 3,000 m runway with parallel taxiway, terminal
building and tower crash, fire and rescue (CFR) building and equipment,
general aviation and cargo areas, automobile parking areas, access road and
navaids and communication equipment; (d) providing technical assistance and
training for DAAC and consultants for financial, airport planning and customs
assistance; and (e) providing flight and ground air navigational calibration
equipment (Map IBRD 13569).
C.   Cost Estimate
4.03      The total estimated project cost, including contingencies, is
US$97.8 million. The foreign exchange component is US$61.3 million, or
about 63% of the total project cost. The local component includes import
taxes and duties.
4.04      The cost estimate shown below (in prices expected at the end of June
1978) is categorized by type. A detailed itemization of the project components
is given in Table 4.1.

4.05      The cost estimates for the construction portions of the project were
developed by the consultants, based on nearly complete final engineering; they
are considered reasonable and reflect recently awarded contracts for similar
work. They were updated to the end of June 1978 during appraisal. The
estimates for the other components of the project were developed after
verifying costs with the industry. Construction at Cartagena and Bogota would
take place on land already owned by DAAC with the exception of the automobile
parking areas at Cartagena. This land is now in the process of being acquired.
Most of the land at Rionegro has been acquired by DAAC, and the rest is now in
process of acquisition. Land acquisition is not expected to delay the project.
4.06      Physical contingencies amounting to 10% of all items have been
included in the cost estimates.
4.07      Price contingencies were estimated separately for the local and
foreign components. The annual rate of price increase for the local component
was estimated at 26% in 1978 and declining to 12% in 1981 and subsequent
years. The annual rate of price increase for the foreign component was
estimated at 7.5% in 1978 and 6.5% in 1980 and thereafter. It was also
estimated that the relationship between the US$ and Col$ would be US$1 equals
Col$ 37.6 in 1977 and increase to Col$ 75.4 in 1983.
D.   The Project Components
4.08      The project would consist of the following eight components.
(i) Medellin - Rionegro Airport (Map IBRD 13570)
4.09      Background and Preparation - The existing airport, Olaya Herrera
(elevation 1,506 m), is in a narrow valley over 1,000 m below the adjacent
mountains. There is a hill at the south end of the single north-south, 2,500 m
runway which forces all heavy aircraft operations to land from the north and
take off to the north. This greatly reduces the capacity of the runway. In
addition, the city is located at the north end of the runway, and all low
level turns required during landing or takeoff operations occur over heavily
built-up and populated areas; operations are forbidden when winds above
10 knots blow from the north, when a cloud base is less than 1,847 m above
the runway surface (less than 3,353 m elevation), when visibility is less than
9.65 km, or during the hours of darkness.
4.10      Because of the significant operating restrictions which result from
these terrain and weather conditions, DAAC engaged a local consulting firm
(whose foreign partner was an aviation expert) to select a site for a new
airport which would have an unrestricted 3,500 m runway capability. A new
site was chosen in a high valley about 23 km to the east of the existing airport
near the community of Rionegro at an elevation of about 2,200 m. With the
aircraft in the present commercial air fleet in Colombia and the temperatures,
expected runway gradient and elevation, the new site, while designed for
domestic operations, would allow unrestricted non-stop operations from Medellin
to New York for all but the smallest aircraft in the fleet. Such operations
are expected within the forecast period.
4.11      The consultant is now in the process of preparing final engineering
drawings and contract documents for the proposed new airport.



- 23 -
4.12      Proposed Development - The airport would consist of a 3,000 m
runway with parallel taxiway constructed with a flexible pavement. There
would be a 20,000 m2 passenger terminal building with an aircraft apron
capable of holding six large commercial passenger aircraft. In addition,
there would be the following supporting facilities: a general aviation area
with apron, a cargo shed with apron, a CFR building with equipment, a control
tower with equipment, automobile parking areas, air navigational aids,
approach and airfield lighting and all necessary ancillary works such as
drainage, fencing, public services and internal access roads (Map IBRD 13571).
4.13      Future Use of Existing Airport - Since the existing airport, Olaya
Herrera, is so poorly located for aviation purposes and is occupying much
needed land for the expansion of the City of Medellin, an agreement was
reached during negotiations that Olaya Herrera Airport would be closed upon
completion of the new airport at Rionegro, the land sold, the proceeds of the
sale turned over to FAN, and that, prior to the sale of the land, a study of
potential uses of the site would be made by the Government or its consultants,
in consultation with the Bank, by the beginning of 1981.
4.14      Access Road - A portion (about 33 km) of the Bank--financed highway
between Medellin and Santuario would be used for access to the general airport
area. A 10-km airport access road would be constructed as part of the project
from this highway to the airport site. During negotiations, the Government
confirmed that the portion of the airport access road outside of the airport
property line would be turned over to MOPT for ownership and maintenance.
(ii) Cartagena - Crespo Airport
4.15      Background and Preparation - Since 1974, hotel capacity in Cartagena
has trebled. A new 600-bed hotel is due to open in 1979, largely catering
to and dependent upon air charter traffic from the U.S. midwest and Canada.
Avianca has recently opened an office in Vancouver to promote tourism from
the west coast of North America, and traffic rights for scheduled services to
the eastern region of Canada are being negotiated. The short (2,245 m) and
understrengtb runway increases operating costs for these aircraft by requiring
enroute stops for fuel that cannot be lifted at Cartagena. The small and weak
aircraft apron also increases costs because of increased turnaround times
necessitated by remote aircraft positioning.
4.16      Proposed Development - The runway would be strengthened by means of
an overlay and lengthened by 355 meters. Since there is no parallel taxiway,
a turnaround loop would be constructed at the south threshold of the runway
both to facilitate the turning of aircraft proceeding to the end of the runway
for takeoff and to act as a holding apron for aircraft waiting for other aircraft
to land so that they might take off. The existing aircraft apron in front of
the terminal building would be removed and replaced with a stronger and larger
apron suitable for the aircraft types expected. Although the existing terminal
is now being replaced by a modern building (the domestic section is complete
and in use), no provision has been made for landside access or for automobile
parking. The project would improve the access and provide automobile parking
areas. It would also provide a standby electrical plant, runway lighting,
drainage syst:em improvement and a CFR building (Map IBRD 13572).



- 24 -
4.17      Future Development - The location of Crespo Airport relative to
the city of Cartagena and its development is not suitable for the long range
developrent of aviation in the area. The airport hinders further development
of the residential areas and restricts access to the villages along the beach
to the northeast. Terrain near the airport penetrates the standard flight
clearance air space, and flight paths cross over heavy industrial and residen-
tial areas at low levels. Ground access to the airport is constrained because
of its location at the end of a narrow peninsula. Further expansion of the
runway or even construction of a parallel taxiway would be very expensive
because it would require filling ocean and lagoon areas. A 1972 study by
Dutch consultants identified potential sites for a new airport.
4.18      While the construction proposed at this time is needed now, it
should be considered as an interim solution only and no further construction
should be considered at this site. The economic studies have shown that,
while the proposed construction is economically justified within the 10-year
life projected, the construction of an entirely new airport is not justified
at this time, but would be in the early 1990s.
4.19      Since future development of Cartagena and nearby tourism facilities
would require expansion of portions of the airport in about ten years to serve
their needs and since the Crespo Airport is not technically suitable for
further expansion, agreement was reached during negotiations that no additional
works other than the proposed project and other investments in the approved plan
would be carried out at Crespo and that, in consultation with the Bank, DAAC
would prepare an aviation master plan for the Cartagena area through the year
2000 and present it to the Bank for review by June 30, 1980.
(iii) Bogota - Eldorado International Airport
4.20      Background and Preparation - Eldorado is the most important airport
in Colombia in terms of passenger, cargo and aircraft movements. It is also a
very important domestic terminal as indicated by the fact that 78% of its
traffic is domestic. The taxiways and aprons are under-strength for the type
of aircraft now using the airport. This causes aircraft operational delays
when these areas are closed for repairs. The passenger terminal building and
its aprons are now operated at full capacity during peak periods of traffic.
Much of the air cargo handled at this airport is either received from or bound
to international points. Its quantity has overwhelmed the capacity of the
cargo facilities. Huge amounts of cargo now stand on the open apron awaiting
clearances or shipment and sustain weather damage as a result.
4.21      To rectify these problems, DAAC has adopted a system of pavement
strengthening consisting of grouting the base materials with Portland cement
and sand and overlaying the pavement with hot mix asphaltic concrete. The
architects within DAAC have also designed improvements to the terminal and
cargo building with the assistance of IATA. These designs are expected to be
ready for advertising by October 1978.
4.22      Proposed Development (Map IBRD 13573) - The project would consist of
strengthening the taxiways and passenger terminal aprons, relocating the
access road to the Colombian Air Force facility so that the passenger terminal
aprons may be enlarged, enlarging the cargo facility, and improving drainage
of the aircraft operating areas. The duty-free shops in the international
finger would be relocated to a new area to be constructed above the existing
employees' cafeteria. The released area would be enlarged to provide nine



- 25 -
international holding rooms and gate positions (ten more aircraft positions
would be available on the expanded international apron). The existing arriving
baggage and customs area would be enlarged to accommodate 50% more traffic.
The domestic finger would be enlarged to provide eight waiting rooms and gate
positions (eight more aircraft positions would be available on the expanded
domestic apron). The arriving domestic baggage area would also be enlarged by
50%. In addition to the physical improvement of the existing facilities, new
air navigational facilities would be installed for approaches to Runway 30
(paras 4.27 and 4.30). These improvements would provide adequate capacity for
the projected passenger and aircraft traffic until the early 1990s.
(iv) Bogota - Second Runway
4.23      Background and Preparation - While the 75,000 annual aircraft
movements now occurring at Eldorado could be handled relatively easily by a
single runway under normal circumstances, conditions at Bogota are complicated
by the elevation of the airport (2,546 m), the high surrounding terrain (2,800
to 3,300 m) and poor visibility generally during early morning hours, which
combine to cause aircraft delays both on the ground and in the air. There
are air navigational aids and an instrument procedure for approaches to and
landings on Runway 12, but landings on Runway 30 (the same runway with approach
from the opposite direction) must use the approach aids for Runway 12 to
descend from altitude through clouds, which flight path would also be utilized
by aircraft taking off from Runway 30 in the opposite direction. Thus, the
capacity of Runway 30 is limited by this conflict and the time necessary to
clear each aircraft either arriving or departing, which, in effect, limits the
annual capacity of the airport.
4.24      DAAC has had several studies made over the years to find a solution
to this problem. The last, a study of airport capacity, was initiated at the
suggestion of the Bank.
4.25      Air Traffic Delays - The latest capacity study determined the
amount of aircraft time lost because of the opposite directions necessary on
the approach/departure paths of Runway 30. In addition, the capacity of the
airport under existing conditions was determined.
4.26      Second Runway Solution - The long-term solution to the problem,
undoubtedly, is to construct a second runway along with its associated navaids.
The second runway in itself is only part of the overall problem; the ultimate
capacity of the airport must also be considered. This necessitates including
the study of a third runway and its location within the second runway site
selection study. Various proposals have now been narrowed down to the three
shown on Map IBRD 13574.
4.27      Adlitional Air Navigational Aids - Interim Solution - While it is
acknowledged that a second runway would ultimately be required to increase the
capacity of the airport, an interim solution which would solve the problem of
approaches to Runway 30 would delay the need for such construction until after
1993. The aiLrport capacity study (para 4.24) proposed the installation of new
navaids which would provide an approach path parallel to that for Runway 12
and guidance to Runway 30. This solution, while partially acceptable, would
require aircraft to descend toward high terrain before turning toward the
ru-nway. Since this is not a fail-safe procedure, a counter proposal was made



- 26 -
during appraisal to install a navaid to the northeast of the airport. By
locating it in this position, a descent path parallel to the high terrain
could be established. This alternative procedure is still being studied by
DAAC, but has been delayed because the flight test aircraft is grounded for
maintenance. The acceptability of such a solution will be verified as soon
as the aircraft is able to fly again. In the meantime, no further site selec-
tion can be done. Although this facility would be useful now, its immediate
need is still a year or more away.
4.28      Proposed Master Plan - Zoning restrictions now applied over a wide
area surrounding the Eldorado International Airport pending resolution of the
location and orientation of a second runway must be reviewed. Although, in
light of the airport capacity study, the second runway would probably not be
justified before the early 1990s, a review by consultants of the existing
master plan and other planning studies would permit a selection to be made
among the three proposals and appropriate acquisition and zoning policies to
be adopted.
4.29      To settle the question of the future development for the Bogota
airport, the project would provide funds for consultants' services to
review and update the existing master plan for the airport.
4.30      Proposed Development - The project would provide the navaids deter-
mined to be necessary for an acceptable independenit approach to Runway 30.
This would involve direct4onal as well as position-locating equipment.
(v) Bogota - Customs Facilitation
4.31      Background and Preparation - Although additional air cargo terminal
and warehouse space as well as apron area is needed, at the same time institu-
tional improvements in customs procedures would reduce part of the problem and
are urgently required. Under financing provided by UNDP (US$70,000), a study
of customs procedures is being made by FALPRO, a unit of UNCTAD in Geneva.
This study constitutes about one man-year's work. It would first identify the
problem areas and make recommendations for their elimination and then provide
the technical assistance necessary to implement the recommendations.
4.32      Terms of reference have been prepared by FALPRO and reviewed by the
Government. The Government has requested UNDP to initiate the study. UNDP
is now in the process of selecting consultants.
4.33      Proposed Development - It was agreed during negotiations that the
Government would carry out this study and implement the recommendations of the
study agreed between the Government and the Bank before June 30, 1979.
(vi) Flight Facility Inspection (FFI) Aircraft
4.34      Background and Preparation - Periodic inspection of the various aids
to air navigation is recognized internationally as a vital requirement for the
safe operation of aircraft. This involves precision flying near each radio
navigational aid and measurement of the signal received by the FFI aircraft.



- 27 -
If the signal is not within prescribed limits, ground adjustments must be made
and the navaid. tested again. In addition to the radio aids, approach and air
field lighting, runway marking or painting and radar accuracy must be inspected.
4.35      At the present time, DAAC owns and operates a Douglas DC-3 FFI
aircraft. Because of the size of Colombia and the relatively slow speed of the
DC-3, it is unable to perform all of the flight inspections necessary to keep
the increasing number of navigational aid facilities properly calibrated in
accordance with the accepted standards.
4.36      Cost: estimates for budgetary purposes have been received from
several aircralft and electronic equipment manufacturers. Operational speci-
fications have been prepared as well as a method for procurement evaluation.
4.37      Prop)osed Procurement - The project would include the purchase of
a suitable aircraft for FFI equipped with a flight inspection console. There
would be a second console to replace the aging unit in the existing DC-3.
Ground equipment for the calibration of these units and for the ground tech-
nicians during flight inspections would be provided.  Conversion training for
the flight and electronic technicians on this aircraft, as well as new equip-
ment, would aLso be provided.
(vii) Teclnical Assistance and Training
4.38      Tec]hnical Assistance - DAAC's electronic engineering and maintenance
staff need upgrading training in order to service adequately the additional
navigational aids and communications equipment now being installed. Air Traffic
Control procedures need updating to handle the increasing numbers of jet air-
craft and the increased traffic. Together with the airport expansion included
in the project, additional airport engineering assistance is required. Enlarge-
ment of the terminal buildings would require trained staff and management.
Increased size of facilities would necessitate new concession contracts and air-
port user charges. Technical assistance for these purposes would be necessary.
4.39      The project would include 13 man-years of technical assistance for
DAAC. The areas to be covered would be: air traffic control (1 year),
electronic engineering or maintenance (2 years), spares procurement and
warehousing (2 years), airport and terminal building management and operation
(3 years), airport accounting (3 years) and planning (2 years). This assis-,
tance very likely would be provided by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) or other suitable entity. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that all advisory personnel assigned to this project would be
selected in consultation with the Bank. Outline job descriptions are shown in
Annex 1.
4.40      Training - Although DAAC has been attempting to maintain a level of
competent staff commensurate with its responsibilities through the means of
its existing training procedures, demands of a rapidly changing industry and
increasing numbers of infrastructural units have combined to throw DAAC far
behind its requirements. A detailed study of training requirements done by
ICAO in 1975 (Annex 2) for DAAC indicated a need for about 950 new personnel
in various categories over the next five years. All of these would require
some type of training as well as upgrade training for about 325 of the residual
personnel. Since that time, DAAC has been training some of the personnel but



- 28 -
requires financial assistance to train them as fast they are needed. To
assist D)AAC, the project would include funds for about 100 man-years of train-
ing, which would reach approximately 400 of the remaining untrained technical
and professional staff through two-, four- and six-month training courses at
appropriate schools. DAAC would be able to cover the rest. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached that a training plan would be prepared by DAAC,
with suitable assistance and in consultation with the Bank, by January 1, 1979.
It would be a condition of disbursement on the training and technical assis-
tance components of the loan that contracts agreeable to the Bank, between
a suitable entity and DAAC, covering such training and technical assistance,
would have been entered into by that entity and DAAC.
(viii) Financial Consultants
4.41      Background - In order to strengthen its accounting capability, DAAC
is preparing to undertake a study of its accounting system and, at the same
time, to determine if the volume of activity warrants computerization
(para 3.11). Consultants funded through an approved loan from FONADE would
carry out the study. In addition, DAAC's user charges, rental charges,
concessionaries' contracts and revaluation of assets need to be updated
(paras 6.12 and 6.21).
4.42      Proposed Assistance - The project would include consultants' services
to review DAAC's user charges, rental charges and contracts, to recommend
revisions, to assist DAAC in implementing the reconimendations and improving
its cost accounting system and to assist FAN in revaluing its assets. During
negotiations, it was agreed that the consultants' final report would be
completed by January 1, 1980 and that DAAC would implement those recommenda-
tions agreed upon in consultation with the Bank.
E.   Execution
4.43      The Government would be the borrower but FAN would carry the foreign
exchange risk. The proceeds of the loan would be transferred to FAN through a
Subsidiary Agreement satisfactory to the Bank, execution of which would be a
condition of loan effectiveness. The project would be executed by DAAC with
the assistance of consultants (para 4.49). The first civil works contracts
are expected to be awarded by the end of 1978. The construction is expected to
take about one-and-one-half years at Cartagerna, three years at Bogota and four
years at Medellin. About 150 men would be employed at Cartagena, 500 at Bogota
and 1,500 at Medellin. Cartagena is expected to be completed in June 1980,
Bogota in December 1981 and Medellin in December 1982.
4.44      Navaids and communication equipment would be purchased and installed
by DAAC in Cartagena and Bogota and by the lighting contractor in Medellin.
4.45      DAAC would administer the 13 man-year technical assistance portion
of the loan and also the 100 man-year training component. DMAC would also
administer the contracts of the construction supervision and financial
consultants.
4.46      It is expected that the contract for the FFI aircraft and the FFI
equipment and training would be awarded by March 19a79 and that the aircraft
and equipment would be delivered by June 1980.



- 29 -
4.47      During negotiations, the project implementation schedule (Chart 18893)
was agreed.
F.   Procurement
4.48      Contracts for civil works (earthworks, paving, drainage, water and
electrical supply and distribution, sewerage, buildings, etc.) and visual
aids, navaid and communication equipment and installation would be awarded
after international competitive bidding by prequalified contractors. Each of
these is expected to be separate contracts at Medellin. All work at Cartagena
is expected to be issued as one contract and, at Bogota, as two (paving and
buildings). Foreign contractors are expected to compete at Medellin and local
at Cartagena and Bogota. The contract for the FFI aircraft and associated
equipment would also be awarded after international competitive bidding.
Since aircraft are not produced locally, no local suppliers are expected to
bid on this Ltem. On all other equipment contracts, local bidders would be
granted a margin of preference of 15% of the CIF value of foreign bids or the
applicable customs duties, whichever is lower.
4.49      An agreement for 13 man-years at an estimated US$5,000 per man-month
would be executed by DAAC for the provision of the technical assistance per-
sonnel through ICAO/UNDP or other suitable entities. Training would also be
arranged through ICAO/UNDP or other suitable entities at rates not exceeding
approximately US$4,000 per year per candidate. The master planning contract
would involve about 75 man-months at US$8,000 per month, the financial
consultant contract about 50 man-months at US$7,500 per month, the FALPRO
contract about 12 man-months at US$6,000 per month and the construction super-
vision contracts about 625 man-months at US$7,000 per month.
G.   Financing and Disbursement
4.50      Apart from the UNDP-financed customs facilitation study (para 4.31),
the proposed. Bank loan would furnish the funds to cover the foreign exchange
component (para 6.15). FAN would furnish the remainder from internally
generated funds.
4.51      Disbursement of funds from the loan would be on the following basis:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures for equipment and its installation;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance and training;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consultant services and
50% of total expenditures for local consultants; and
(d)  59% of total expenditures for civil works.
A schedule showing the estimated rate of disbursement is given in Table 4.2.
Disbursement is expected to run through June 1984. The closing date should be
December 31, 1984.
H.   Ecology
4.52      The ecological and environmental effects of the development of the
project airports were taken into account during the siting and preliminary
design studies for the new Rionegro Airport at Medellin and the expansion of



- 30 -
Crespo Airport at Cartagena and would be a major factor to be considered
during the evaluation of the second runway site for Eldorado and the revised
Master Plan.
4.53      Closing the existing airport at Medellin would eliminate the aircraft
noise problem there. The release of the existing airport land at Medellin
would place much needed land back in the hands of the city for urban develop-
ment. This land could support 8,000 to 10,000 families if used for residential
purposes. The new airport would take 580 hectares out of agricultural pro-
duction and would displace about 100 families. The new site does not contain
any historical sites or other areas needing preservation, and no wildlife
of significance would be affected.
4.54      The expansion of the Crespo terminal building would require acquisi-
tion of about 30 low value houses. The expansion of the runway would take
place on unproductive land already impacted by low flying aircraft.
4.55      The proposed development at Eldorado would occur on airport land and
would not affect the environment except for a possible increase of activity as
time goes on.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The project would result in significant savings in costs for Colombian
domestic and international air transport through more efficient use of aircraft
and improvements in the reliability of services. The improvements would
provide facilities to cope with the increasing volume of air traffic and
remove significant restrictions now imposed at Medellin and Bogota in order
to maintain acceptable safety standards. Both the costs and designs for the
facilities proposed were reviewed during appraisal to assure that the minimum
cost solutions would be adopted. Benefits and costs for each major project
component are discussed in the following section.
A.   Medellin
5.02      At Medellin, the need for a new airport, and the principal justifi-
cation for the project, stems from the inability of the present airport to
cope with traffic demand in the foreseeable future and the dependence of the
city on air services for business and personal contacts with other cities in
Colombia. It is estimated that, from around 1983, airspace limitation would
impose increasing traffic congestion, and, even with allowances for improved
aircraft handling techniques, limits to the volume of traffic that could be
accommodated would be reached by about 1988. The new site at Rionegro
provides a viable solution for maintaining accessibility to Medellin and, at
the same time, provides opportunities for improved services by removing
operating restrictions.
5.03      One of the aviation-oriented industries particularly favored by the
new airport is the small but rapidly growing flower farming centered at
Rionegro itself. Just as export flower growing has spread from the Bogota
savannah to neighboring Cundinamarca, so these activities have sprung up



- 31 -
around other international airports at Cali and Medellin. At Medellin, the
new site would remove restrictions imposed by the closure of the airport at
sunset on the time available for harvesting, and the avoidance of flight
cancellations in poor visibility would tend to improve average prices received
for the flowers by assuring prompt delivery.
5.04      Closure of the present airport also has important economic  -nefits
for the city of Medellin through the potential urban uses of the land. Urban
population growth, at 4.2% p.a., is among the highest in Colombia, while land
within the Valle de Aburra suitable for urban uses is becoming increasingly
scarce and expensive to develop. It is estimated that the airport site could
accommodate one to two years growth for the city, allowing suitable areas for
commercial, residential and recreation uses, with significant savings in the
costs of utilities and services, and in urban transport for residents and
workers.
5.05      Calculation of the rate of return for the new airport takes into
account the net savings in aircraft and passenger time costs through the avoid-
ance of delays and congestion, an estimate of the benefits for the additional
passenger capacity of the new airport, the net effect on freight shippers from
the under-avaLilability of freight services, and savings in urban development
costs through the redevelopment of the existing airport. Costs include con-
struction of the new airport, its access link and maintenance and operating
costs for the new site. Capital costs otherwise necessary at the present
airport have been deducted.
5.06      Vehicle costs, obtained from the airlines and estimated by the
consultants, were adjusted for the taxes and duties on imported equipment and
spare parts, and to reflect the landed rather than market price of petroleum.
For ground public transport vehicles, 67% of salary costs were used to reflect
the shadow price of unskilled labor. The overall estimates were then adjusted
to reflect the expected relative price changes between local and foreign
elements of operating costs. Table 5.1 shows average cost by vehicle type
used in the evaluations.
5.07      Domestic time values are based on passenger survey data for 1972 and
1977, showing journey purpose and household income for air passengers. Air
passenger income levels from the 1972 survey were updated to 1977 on the basis
of general trends in income levels. These estimates are shown in Table 5.2.,
No time values are applied in cost or benefit streams for international
travelers.
(i) Betnefits Involving Time Savings
(a) Weather Delays
5.08      Delays due to early morning cloud and other weather conditions at
Olaya Herrera were compared with estimates for Rionegro based on a comparison
of airline schedules and meteorological data for the new site for 1976 and
1977. From the resulting estimate of net additional delays per aircraft,
passenger delays were estimated by applying average passengers per aircraft
for each type, and allowing for the double delay to departing passengers for
both the late arrival of the aircraft and the departure delay itself. Thus



- 32 -
the average delay saving of around 650 aircraft hours for 1976/77 is equiv-
alent to around 85,300 passenger hours. Costs were estimated using the time
and vehicle cost values given above and were projected, making allowance for
the change in aircraft mix. Benefits from savings in weather delays are held
constant after 1988 when it is estimated that physical saturation of the
existing airport would occur.
(b) Flight Cancellations
5.09      Flight cancellations at Olaya Herrera affect mainly afternoon
flights when meteorological conditions force early closure of the airport.
Since night flights are not permitted, passengers are delayed overnight,
either in Medellin or elsewhere. At Rionegro, on the other hand, the airport
would be fully equipped for instrument and night flying, and such cancellations
would be very rare. Since it seems reasonable to presume that passengers at
this time of day would be completing rather than starting journeys, the
passenger cost has been estimated at 12 hours at the leisure rates. The
number of passengers affected for 1977 is projected, making allowance for the
changing aircraft mix up to 1988, and thereafter held constant. No allowance
is made for accommodations or other costs. Aircraft costs for the domestic
fleet have been estimated at two hours, being the average difference between
the sunset and the normal cessation of service.
(c) Capacity Delays
5.10      In 1983, it is projected that traffic at Medellin would reach the
practical capacity of Olaya Herrera, estimated from air traffic control
records and other data at 30 movements per hour or 65,000 movements per year.
This is well below the 48-55 movement rate that would be expected with two-way
instrument runway operations, and, hence, the move to Rionegro would avoid
significant delays during good weather periods due to traffic congestion.
Forecasts of congestion delays at Olaya Herrera and Rionegro are based on
standard techniques developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration 1/,
and the difference is converted to passenger time savings using average
passengers per aircraft for the different type groups. Because the limitation
at Olaya Herrera is one of airspace rather than ground facilities, airspace
saturation would be reached fairly quickly, so that not even by increasing
delays would the amount of air traffic be increased. It has been estimated
that this physical limit would be approximately 20% above the practical
capacity or 78,000 movements per year and would be reached in 1988.
(d) Shorter Flight Time
5.11      The new site of Rionegro is located close to the flight paths for
the existing airport and in the locality of the VOR beacon at Santa Helena.
All aircraft using instrument navigation and all those flying visual flight
rules except on north-south routes pass over this aid enroute to Olaya
Herrera (approximately 90% of all flights). Shorter flight distances and
times are therefore involved at Rionegro for air traffic to and from Medellin --
averaging between 5 and 12 minutes per movement, depending on the aircraft.
Cost savings were estimated taking into account the changing aircraft mix in
the forecast years.

- 33 -
(e) Ground Access
5.12      Access to Rionegro involves, on average, an additional 27-km surface
journey.  Costs involved were calculated assuming a 50% split for domestic
business travelers between private automobiles and taxis, with all other
domestic passengers traveling by bus. International passengers were split
50-50 between cars and buses. The calculation of vehicle costs takes account
of the effects of different types of terrain and the projected domestic
passenger time costs, considering the average speed achievable under different
road conditions. The vehicle flow projection of 50 vehicles per hour in 1983
increases to 113 vehicles per hour in 2000 - both well within the estimated
capacity of the existing main highway; therefore, no allowance has been made
for upgrading or expansion of this highway in the future. An allowance of
Col$ 3 million per year has been included in the economic cost stream to
reflect additional maintenance requirements.
(f) Overall Time Savings
5.13      Overall, the time savings result in net discounted vehicle cost
savings of :ol$ 6,569 million and estimated additional passenger time costs of
Col$ 915 million (Table 5.3).
(ii) O)ther Benefits
5.14      Other benefits included in the analysis are discussed in para-
graphs 5.15 through 5.19.
(a) Oversaturation
5.15      After 1988, the amount of traffic that could not be handled at
Olaya Herrera quickly becomes very significant. By 1995, it represents over
one-quarter of the domestic aircraft movements. Because this represents a
much more than marginal change in travel patterns, it is reasonable to presume
that some passengers would undertake journeys on the next best alternative.
As a proxy for the economic benefits of the additional traffic handling
capacity at Rionegro, calculations have been made of the additional user costs
involved in transporting the "denied" passengers by surface modes. The
calculations are based on a unique demand curve for travel, covering all trip
purposes and modes.
5.16      Estimation of the volume of traffic using alternative transport
after 1988 is made under the assumptions that diverted traffic has the same
general characteristics as the peak hour flow and that all international
flights are: completed. Both assumptions lead to a lower overall estimate of
alternative transport costs. For each origin and destination and for each
journey purpose, costs per passenger for bus and taxi modes were calculated
and the lower compared with the corresponding air journey cost, calculated on
a city center to center basis. In neither case was the effect on infrastruc-
ture costs included. The resulting benefit stream, reflecting the lower
economic net costs in air transport for passengers, rises from Col$ 73 million
in 1990 to Col$ 1,329 million in 2000.



- 34 -
(b) Urban Uses of the Existing Site
5.17      Benefits from the use of the existing airport site were calculated
by comparing alternative proposals for its urban use with costs of providing
an equivalent development in typical fringe areas around Medellin. The
alternatives for the Olaya Herrera site are consistent with the parameters
used in the redevelopment of the airport site at Bucaramanga, based c the
concept of an integrated medium/high density development, while fringe devel-
opment around Medellin is much more dispersed, usually with no provision for
employment or industrial areas. Development of the site is estimated to
result in savings in the costs of providing roads and basic services of
between Col$ 360 and Col$ 570 million, approximately Col$ 170 million per year
in urban transport costs of residents of the new area, and Col$ 12-23 million
in general congestion of major access links in the city. It is estimated that
the redevelopment could be accomplished within five years after the closure of
the airport.
(c) Air Freight
5.18      Air exports and imports at Medellin have been growing at an average
rate well over 30% p.a. for the last ten years, which is considerably above
passenger growth. A significant portion of this freight travels via domestic
services to other gateway airports and is expected to continue to do so
throughout the forecast period. At Rionegro, this traffic could be easily
accommodated, given the very high load factor (70%) of belly-hold cargo space
in Colombia. At Olaya Herrera, however, the capacity limit would lead to a
reduction in the volumes that could be carried, beginning at around 2,000 tons
each for imports and exports in 1990 and rising rapidly thereafter. For
imports, the costs so imposed have been estimated as an additional day's
stockholdings on the assumption that, in such circumstances, some form of
express land transport would be available to make connections at other inter-
national airports. The stockholding cost is estimated at 12% of the average
capital cost for one day's imports susceptible to air freight. Since most of
the air exports are expected to be perishables (flowers, vegetables), costs
have been estimated at the value of lost production to Colombia. For non-
perishable air exports (e.g., fashion goods), additional transport costs
exceed value added, and it is assumed that these would also be suppressed.
The benefit stream for Rionegro increases from about Col$ 13 million in 1990
to about Col$ 100 million by the turn of the century.
5.19      Overall, the majority of the net benefits for the new airport at
Rionegro accrue to domestic airlines and passengers, with most of the rest
going to residents of the area. Discounted at 12%, the net benefits to air-
lines and passengers are Col$ 5,300 million and for the general public are
Col$ 1,400 million, not including benefits from reduced noise and pollution in
the city. Table 5.3 illustrates the composition of the benefit flows. The
rate of return on the new airport is 24%, reducing to 14% for the low traffic
forecast. Excluding time values, the project shows a 27% return, since
overall time savings are negative. Table 5.4 shows details.



- 35 -
B.   Bogota
5.20      Bogota is the principal focus of air traffic in Colombia, and con-
ditions there affect the efficiency and reliability of services throughout
the network. Expansion of the loading areas, aircraft parking and improvements
in passenger traffic flow and baggage claim would shorten the time required for
aircraft loading and unloading and, hence, improve fleet utilization. The
mainline domestic fleet aircraft in Colombia are in service for 13-14 hours
per day, including about 7-1/2 flying hours. For aircraft based at Bogota and
flying an average of six hub and spoke flights per day, the savings in turn-
around time would accumulate to the equivalent of an additional flight per
day. Provision of additional positions at the international finger (which
also copes with domestic overflow) would avoid aircraft delays while waiting
to unload, arising from both the increasing traffic and the greater use of
large-capacity aircraft. Strengthening the taxiway at Bogota would also
avoid the imposition of weight/range limitations on these larger aircraft
which would otherwise negate the economies which they offer.
5.21      Benefits are calculated on the savings to the domestic fleet through
faster turnaround of aircraft, reduced delays to Colombian aircraft in inter-
national operations and the avoidance of the weight penalties on Colombian
wide-bodied, aircraft. The terminal expansion is expected to provide adequate
capacity until the early 1990s while the normal life for the taxiway strengthen-
ing is seve!n years. Unquantified benefits include unobstructed passenger flows,
particularly for arrivals, greater efficiency and security in baggage claims
and improved facilities for handling freight carried on passenger aircraft.
5.22      Ihe rate of return on the improvements is 20%, reducing to 16% for
the low traffic forecast.
C.   Cartagena
5.23      At Cartagena, the airport works are part of a general expansion of
tourism facilities. In the past three years, bed capacity has trebled, and
when the 600-bed Cartagena Hilton opens in 1979, there will 8,600 beds avail-
able, including apartment and guest house accommodations. Improvements are
being made to water supply and sewerage systems, and the city has embarked on
a scheme to redevelop the old market site and nearby waterfront as a convention
center and yacht marina.
5.24      Although foreign tourism is very visible in the city, domestic
tourism represents the majority of visitors and facilities. Less than a
quarter of the accommodations in the city are of the standard typically used
by foreign tourists. The average length of stay for non-charter traffic is
three nights. Because of the preponderance of domestic tourists in the
overall traffic, improvements in the terminal area would provide benefits
mostly to them.
5.25      The majority of foreign tourists arrive from North America by
charter flight, arranged by three large tour operators. Avianca has recently
opened a sales office in Vancouver, and Colombia is negotiating scheduled
traffic rights to eastern Canada. The main tourist season is between November
and March, with a minor domestic peak during July and August.



- 36 -
5.26      Lengthening and strengthening the runway at Cartagena would allow
aircraft to fly non-stop to Canada and the midwest of the United States,
significantly reducing the costs of flights and improving Cartagena's relative
attractiveness while opening new potential markets. The apron expansion,
access roads and carparks are complementary to the new terminal buildings
being constructed. Together, the new facilities would be sufficient for
normal traffic requirements until the early 1990s.
5.27      The promotion of Cartagena as a tourist destination began in 1974
when Colombian rules governing charter operations were relaxed, and it has
coincided with a general slackening in Caribbean tourism. However, with the
apparent revival at many well established destinations during the 1978 season,
it is not certain that Cartagena could retain its present market position,
taking into account the relatively higher costs for tour operators and the
wide range of alternative destinations. Nevertheless, Cartagena has an
interest in the tour visitors, anticipating the prospects for developing a
wider range of regular air connections for the city and its industries.
5.28      Since the airport improvements are part of a wider tourism infra-
structure program, it is difficult to separate precisely the benefits attri-
butable to them. The approach has therefore been taken of including, for
international traffic, only payments made by tour operators and passengers for
the use of airport facilities and gross margins on spending related to exist-
ing hotel capacity. For domestic traffic, benefits include savings in apron
delays and unquantified savings in road and carpark congestion. The return on
the project is 14%, rising to 17% for the low traffic forecast because of the
increased useful life of the facilities to be provided and the greater influence
of the rapidly rising benefits to domestic traffic.
D.   FFI Aircraft
5.29      Between 1972 and 1979, when the current installation program is
completed, the number of enroute and terminal area navigation aids in service
in Colombia will have doubled. These aids will provide safe and reliable
navigation on the major domestic routes of the country and, for the first time,
in the Llanos and Amazonas areas. The task of inspecting, calibrating and,
when necessary, recalibrating these aids is now beyond the capabilities of
the existing DC3 FFI aircraft. First, the number of test hours required has
more than doubled from 1,320 hours in 1972 to 2,760 hours in 1979 plus about
150 additional ferry hours; and, second, the older equipment now installed in
the DC3 requires recalibration between test flights in the higher, cooler
areas and those on the coast. Additionally, the aircraft does not have the
speed or altitude capabilities necessary to provide reliable enroute checks
for jet aircraft aids.
5.30      The proposal to purchase a second aircraft to perform flight checks
on main route navigation equipment and to re-fit the existing aircraft for
permanent duty in coastal and other low altitude areas was tested against the
alternative of hiring a suitable test aircraft from a neighboring civil
aviation administration, at the going rate of US$700 per hour. Based on the
proposed flight plan for the two aircraft (Table 5.5), the options would be:



- 37 -
Annual Cost US$
(million)
(a) hire aircraft for all checking and
testing                                               2
(b) use the DC3 in coastal areas (1,010 hrs)
and hire aircraft for main routes (1,750 hrs)         1.5
(c) hire aircraft for coastal areas (1,010 hrs)
and purchase a new aircraft for major
routes (1,750 hrs)                                    1.2
(d)  uEe the DC3 for coastal areas (1,010 hrs)
and purchase a new aircraft for major
routes (1,750 hrs), as proposed                      0.7
5.31      Option (a) is the highest cost solution and is rejected; option
(c) has a lower cost than (b) but does not avoid the purchase of a new
aircraft. The benefits of the proposal, option (d), are therefore taken as
the cost savings of approximately US$775,000 per year by comparison with
option (b). At an estimated capital cost of US$4.5 million, including the
necessary training, the rate of return is 15%, independent of traffic fore-
casts.
E.   Overall Proiect Returns and Benefit Distribution
5.32      The economic return is estimated at 24% for Medellin, 20% for Bogota,
14% for Cartagena and 15% for the flight inspection aircraft. Overall, the
project has a return of 22%, reducing to 13% for the low traffic forecasts.
Benefits considered accrue initially to Colombian airlines and passengers,
mainly on business journeys (Table 5.3). The efficiencies for the airlines,
and resulting lowering in future real travel costs, would assist in easing
constraints on long distance passenger travel and in facilitating the expan-
sion of business activity depending on air freight. The direct savings for
airlines arLd users over the period are the equivalent of a reduction of
5-6% in reall domestic fares and freight rates over the first ten years of
the project. Although it is difficult to determine precisely which activities
would be most favorably affected by the project, the principal users of both
passenger and freight services are the manufacturing sector and perishable
export producers, while agricultural processing industries and the commercial
sector are proportionately important users. Apart from the tourism and re-
lated industries in all three cities, the principal non-user benefits from
the projeci: accrue to the residents of Medellin, both through the more
efficient use of land within the Valle de Aburra and through the provision
of an employment pole at Rionegro. Studies are to be made to determine the
most appropriate means of achieving these last benefits.
F.   Project Risks
5.33      Two types of risk affect the project.  First, the need to seek
financing for some project items arose in part from poor planning coordination



- 38 -
within DAAC and the implementation of a large equipment purchase and instal-
lation program in 1974 which exhausted funds originally allocated to ongoing
civil works. Since then, subsequent administrations in DAAC have taken a
variety of corrective measures (paras 3.07 to 3.11), and the DAAC Planning
Department now plays a central role in setting priorities and the preparation
of forward investment plans (para 2.13). Additionally, the preparation of a
comprehensive financing plan covering DAAC's entire investment program
(Chapter VI), coupled with improved planning and carefully prepared implemen-
tation arrangements (Chapter IV), would tend to ensure that the risk of poor
performance is minimal.
5.34      The second type of risk, related to possible variations in traffic
levels and project costs, would affect the econo'mic return. As noted above, the
project has an acceptable return (13%) under the low traffic forecast, which
averages 4% for domestic traffic and 8% for international traffic. In other
sensitivity tests, project costs were increased by 20%, leading to returns of
16%, 20%, and 10% for Bogota, Medellin and Cartagena respectively, with an
overall return of 19% (Table 5.3).
5.35      Since the viability of the project for a new airport for Medellin is
not solely tied to potential savings in aircraft operating costs but is
crucially linked to the willingness of all passengers to triavel an additional
40-50 minutes to a more distant site in order to avoid delays to some passen-
gers because of operating restriction at Olaya Herrera, domestic passenger
time has been included in the central rate of return estimate. Overall, net
time savings for passengers are negative, and, if excluded entirely, the
return on the Medellin project would be 27%. If Olaya Herrera Airport were
not closed but remained open for light aircraft traffic, the rate of return
would drop to 16%.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  Existing Situation
6.01      For the period 1970 to 1977, DAAC/FAN has been able to maintain
its working expenses at a reasonable level considering the increases in
volume of traffic and prices. For this period, the average annual increase
was 36%. These increases in working expenses were more than offset by
DAAC/FAN-generated operating revenues, which also experienced annual average
increases of 36%. These increases in revenue were caused by substantial
traffic growth supplemented by tariff increases beginning January 1, 1976.
6.02      In every year, revenues generated by DAAC/FAN were sufficient to
cover working expenses and debt service and make a contribution to investment
except in 1976. During this period, DAAC/FAN made significant improvements
in covering its total cash requirements from FAN-generated revenues for each
year. The contributions toward total cash requirements increased from 47% to
70% through the years 1970 to 1977. The Government made budget transfers as
necessary which covered approximately 90% of DAAC/FAN investments in this
period and 40% of debt service in 1976. However, as the financial performance
of DAAC/FAN improved, the percent of total cash requirements received from the
Government was reduced substantially from 67% to 17% through the years 1970 to
1977. The amounts of Government inputs equivalent to equity and their percent-
ages of working expenses, investment and debt service covered are as follows:

1971                     115.0                              44.6
1972                     135.9                              46.8
1973                      84.6                              23.7
1974                     189.4                              24.5
1975                      56.7                               5.9
1976                     206.7                              26.9
1977                     185.1                              16.9
The Government inputs are shown in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
6.03      Ia 1974 and 1975, a relatively large investment program was
undertaken in civil works, navigational aids and communications equipment.
This investment, which should have been phased in over a period of several
years, unfortunately incurred external debts for DAAC/FAN for the navigational
aids and communications equipment for 1974 and 1975, amounting to Col$ 202.8
and Col$ 414.6 million respectively. In 1976, when the first large debt
service payments were due, DAAC/FAN did not have sufficient funds available
to meet this obligation, and great difficulties were encountered trying to
install the navigational aids and communications equipment. As a result, the
Government made a large input in 1976 to cover the shortfall (Tables 6.1 and 6.2).
6.04      ]n the latter part of 1976, a new Director took charge of DAAC/FAN.
Since then, there have been improvements. Approximately 90% of the naviga-
tional aids and communications equipment have been installed. A reasonable
five-year civil aviation investment plan has been prepared for the whole of
Colombia, and Law 3 of 1977 has been enacted, which permits a better adminis-
trative reLationship between DAAC and FAN, wherein the head of DAAC is also
the legal head of FAN. The new head of DAAC gave full support to the
financial aspects of FAN and, as a result of much effort, was able to bring
the financial statements up to date.
6.05      Accounting records of the revenue and expenditure items are kept at
DAAC/FAN headquarters. The records are maintained so that revenues and expenses
are identified for principal airports, but expenses are not allocated by type
of service (para 6.12). A reasonable breakdown of revenues and expenses for
the project airports for 1976 was obtained. A review of the financial state-
ments shows that increasing delays have occurred in the collection of revenues.
If this condition continues, DAAC/FAN would encounter difficulties in meeting
its cash requirements (para 6.13).
6.06      Accounts are currently subject to review by a Government comptroller
who works with DAAC/FAN. With his assistance, DAAC/FAN has been able to
produce current financial statements through 1977. The assets of DAAC/FAN
have been revalued, and this is reflected in the balance sheets for 1976 and
1977 (TabLe 6.3). Although the comptroller performs some of the functions of
an auditor in his review, the financial operations of an entity the size of
DAAC/FAN should be reviewed by an independent external auditor (para 6.14).

B.   Financial Obiectives
6.07      Government policy has been to maintain DAAC/FAN domestic tariffs at
a low level in order to encourage aviation development. The domestic passenger
tax is 15% of the amount charged to international passengers, and the domestic
landing fees are 28% of those charged for international landings. The current
level of tariffs would not permit DAAC/FAN to cover its maintenance, investment
and debt service requirements for the planned development program (1978-1983).
DAAC/FAN should develop a rational plan for covering all working expenses,
including salaries and miscellaneous expenses, in order that the Government
would no longer need to cover these expenditures, as at present. However,
during the period 1978-1982, even with the tariff increases provided for
(para 6.09), Government inputs equivalent to equity are necessary. The
Government proposes to provide these inputs by continuing to help DAAC/FAN
meet its salaries and miscellaneous expenses. The net amounts of these
estimated inputs (National Budget Allocation, less 10% transfer of revenues
from FAN to the Ministry of Finance), which are specifically designated for
payment of DAAC salaries and miscellaneous expenses, in accordance with
Law 3, and their percentage of working expenses, investment and debt service,
are as follows:
% of Total Cash Requirements
for Operations, Investment and
Year    Net Government Inputs                 Debt Service
(Col$ in millions)
(current prices)
1978               514                             34.1
1979               659                             20.9
1980               779                             23.8
1981               897                             22.9
1982            1,036                              23.6
Total    3,885
These percentages are approximately the same as those experienced by the
Government in the period 1970-1977 (para 6.02).  While this arrangement
is different from those experienced in other countries, it is the only way
in which the Government can contribute equity toward the investments of FAN
under existing law. It is a common practice in the developing countries for
Governments to make equity inputs to the aviation authorities. It is important
to note that the Government inputs are not required for the project but would
permit DAAC/FAN to carry out the non-project investment program.
6.08      The current leakage of FAN revenues should be corrected in such a
manner that DAAC/FAN would receive compensation for services rendered to
passengers (para 3.09). It was agreed during negotiations that DAAC/FAN
would make the necessary arrangements to collect all revenues in accordance
with the current tariff regulations.



- 41 -
6.09      WhiLe it would be desirable for DAAC/FAN to cover all of its oper-
ations, maintenance, investment and debt service requirements during the
period (1978-1982), this is not possible with the proposed level of investments.
The Ministry of Finance would need to continue to cover all salaries and
miscellaneous expenses of DAAC/FAN during these years (para 6.07). It was
agreed during negotiations that tariffs and other charges would be main-
tained to keep them constant in real terms at their 1977 year end level for
the period 1979 through 1982. It was also agreed during negotiations that
the Government would make available to DAAC/FAN, annually, sufficient funds
to cover its salaries and miscellaneous expenses for the period 1978-1982.
The financial projections reflect these agreements.
6.10      Even with these increases, in 1984 and thereafter DAAC/FAN would not
be able to cover total working expenses (including salaries and miscellaneous
expenses), investment and debt service without further tariff increases.
Therefore, in. the projections, total revenues have again been adjusted in 1984
to reflect inflation in the year 1983. As a result of these tariff increases,
DAAC/FAN would be financially self-sufficient and would not require budget
transfers from the Ministry of Finance in 1983 or thereafter (Tables 6.4 and
6.5). It was agreed during negotiations that such adjustments to tariffs as
are necessary would be applied to produce sufficient revenues to allow
DAAC/FAN to cover all working expenses, investment and debt service after 1982
and to achieve a return on annually revalued net fixed assets of no less than
6% in 1980, 7% in 1981 and 8% in 1982 and thereafter. It was also agreed during
negotiations that the project airports would meet the following individual
financial goals: operating ratios would be no greater than 85 at Medellin, 45 at
Bogota and 45 at Cartagena by 1983 and gradually decline thereafter (Annex 3).
Because of the tariff increases necessary in 1979 through 1984 for DAAC/FAN to
meet its operating, investment and debt service requirements, satisfactory
rates of return on net fixed assets are possible in the years following the
physical completion of the project.
6.11      Since DAAC/FAN may finance new investments through debt, it was
agreed durinig negotiations that FAN would not incur any long-term debt unless
its net revenues for the fiscal year next preceding such incurrence or for a
later twelve-month period ended prior to such incurrence, whichever amount is
greater, shall not be less than 1.5 times the maximum long-term debt service
requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all long-term debt, including
long-term debt proposed to be incurred. Debt service coverage indicators are
shown in Annex 3.
6.12      The accounting system is inadequate and should be redesigned to
supply information for each individual airport and by classifications necessary
to formulate and review user charges. Following these improvements, the
structure and level of airport tariffs should be reviewed. The accounting
system should also include provision for the proper valuation and disposal of
assets. DAAC/FAN realizes these deficiencies and needs assistance for improve-
ment in this area. The assistance for the redesign of the accounting system
would be provided by consultants funded through a loan which has been obtained



- 42 -
from FONADE. In addition, the project would provide funds for a consultant to
review and make recommendations on the structure and level of user charges
(para 4.42). Agreement on implementation of this study was reached during
negotiations. Also, during negotiations, it was agreed that, after implemen-
tation of the new accounting system and review of user charges, an improved
structure of airport user charges would be set and collected at all airports,
where feasible, and that the tariff study would be sent to the Bank for comment
by January 1, 1980 with implementation by June 30, 1980.
6.13      At the time of negotiations, it was agreed that receivables and
payables would not be more than 25% (which approximates 90 days receipts
and payments from the date of billing) of operating revenues and working
expenses respectively (para 6.05).
6.14      During negotiations, an agreement was reached with DAAC/FAN that
certified copies of the audited annual accounts by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank would be furnished to the Bank not later than four
months after the end of each calendar year.
C.   Financial Plan
6.15      The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$97.76 million,
of which approximately 62% would be in the form of a Bank loan to the Govern-
ment, the proceeds of which would be transferred to FAN. Except for UNDP
financing for the customs facilitation study (US$70,000), the balance would
be provided by FAN from its revenue generation:
1978-1983
Col$ Million     US$ Million
(a)  Bank loan                            3,893.8            61.00
(b)  FAN                                  2,160.0            36.76
6,053.8            97.76
6.16      Since it is expected that providing these funds would exhaust
DAAC/FAN internally generated revenues, it was agreed during negotiations
that DAAC/FAN would consult with the Bank on, and not undertake, any invest-
ment above US$1.0 million at any one airport until the closing date (except
for investments in the approved five-year plan), unless it is economically
and technically justified, and FAN has obtained financing which will not
adversely affect its financial condition, or the carrying out of the project.
It was also agreed that FAN would obtain the concurrence of the Bank before
committing itself to any other capital expenditure which would be greater than
20% of planned investments in the agreed development program in any given year.
D.   Financial ProJections
(i) Operating Results
6.17      DAAC/FAN operating revenues by category for 1978 and projected
through 1990 are set out in Table 6.4, and the projected operating statements
are given in Table 6.5. The financial assumptions on which these are based
are listed in Annex 4. Summarized forecast results for 1978, 1980, 1985 and
1990 are as follows:

1/   Assumes that the Government would cover salaries and miscellaneous
expenses, which are included, through 1982, which would permit DAAC/FAN
to cover its maintenance, investment and debt service requirements.
DAAC/FAN would cover these expenditures and discontinue the 10% transfer
of revenues to the Ministry of Finance in 1983 and thereafter.
6.18      In every year throughout the projection period except 1978, FAN
revenues cover all working expenses, including depreciation or debt service,
whichever is greater. The budget allocation by the Government is required for
salaries and miscellaneous expenses from 1978 through 1982 so that FAN may
cover its maintenance, investment and debt service. Therefore, the financial
objectives could be met in all years of the project (para 6.10).
6.19      The projected operating statements for the project airports are set
out in Tables 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8. All of the existing project airports develop
sufficient traffic to generate revenues greater than operating expenses
beginning in. 1978 through the project period and thereafter. The working
surplus from these major domestic airports would make a contribution toward
covering the local funds required for investments and associated debt service
of the project.
(ii) CaLsh Flow
6.20      A projected cash flow for DAAC/FAN, based on the assumptions
contained in paragraph 6.09, is shown in Table 6.9. Provision has been made
for the rep]acement of assets included in the project, when required. A
summary of the cash flow for the construction period is set out below:

are included in Table 6.10. Since it is not certain that the current asset base
has been adequately revalued or what the actual future price increases will be,
it was agreed during negotiations that a study would be carried out by a
consultant who would provide for the valuation and revaluation of assets in
subsequent years. A provision for this study is included in the loan (paras 4.42
and 6.12). The final report should be completed by January 1, 1980, and DAAC
should implement the recommendations agreed upon in consultation with the Bank.
Rates of return for DAAC/FAN (para 6.10) would be reviewed in light of the results
of this study. Agreement on these points was reached during negotiations.



- 45 -
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
regarding the following:
(a)  that DAAC would, with technical assistance to be provided under
the project, undertake a review of its tariff-setting procedures,
provide such review to the Bank for comments by January 1, 1980
and establish improved guidelines for approving fare adjustments
by June 30, 1980 (para 2.17);
(b) that a study of DAAC's accounting system and a determination of
whether its volume of activity warrants computerization would be
conducted by a consultant with a loan from FONADE and completed by
July 1, 1979, that the Bank would be consulted about the implementa-
tion of the recommendations of the study and that the recommenda-
tions accepted would be implemented by December 31, 1979 (para 3.11);

good engineering concepts would be provided at all facilities of
DAAC/FAN (para 3.18);
(e) t.hat Olaya Herrera Airport would be closed upon completion of the
new airport at Rionegro, the land sold, and the proceeds of the sale
t:urned over to FAN and that, prior to the sale of the land, a study
of potential uses of the site would be made by the Government or its
consultants, in consultation with the Bank, by the beginning of 1981
(para 4.13);
(f) t:hat the portion of the new Medellin airport access road outside of
t:he airport property line would be turned over to the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport for ownership and maintenance (para 4.14);
(g)  that no additional works other than the proposed project and other
investments in the approved plan would be carried out at Crespo and
that, in consultation with the Bank, DAAC would prepare an aviation
master plan for the Cartagena area through the year 2000 and present
it to the Bank for review by June 30, 1980 (para 4.19);
(h) that a study of customs procedures would be made by FALPRO and that
the recommendations of the study would be implemented as agreed
between the Government and the Bank before June 30, 1979 (para 4.33);

January 1, 1980 and that DAAC would implement those recommendations
agreed upon in consultation with the Bank (paras 4.42 and 6.21);
(1) that DAAC/FAN would make the necessary arrangements to collect all
revenues in accordance with current tariff regulations (para 6.08);



- 46 -
(m) that tariffs and other charges would be maintained to keep them
constant in real terms at their 1977 year end level for the
period 1979 through 1982 (para 6.09);
(n) that the Government would make available to DAAC/FAN, annually,
sufficient funds to cover its salaries and miscellaneous expenses
for the period 1978-1982 (para 6.09);
(o) that such adjustments to tariffs as are necessary would be applied
to produce sufficient revenues to allow DAAC/FAN to cover all
operating expenses, investment and debt service after 1982 and to
achieve a return on annually revalued net fixed assets of no less than
6% in 1980, 7% in 1981 and 8% in 1982 and thereafter (para 6.10);
(p) that the project airports would meet the following individual
financial goals: operating ratios would be no greater than 85 at
Medellin, 45 at Bogota and 45 at Cartagena by 1983 and gradually
decline thereafter (para 6.10);
(q) that FAN would not incur any long-term debt unless its net revenues
for the fiscal year next preceding such incurrence or for a later
twelve-month period ended prior to such incurrence, whichever amount
is greater, shall not be less than 1.5 times the maximum long-term
debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year on all long-
term debt, including long-term debt proposed to be incurred (para 6.11);
(r) that the new accounting system would be implemented and a review of
user charges completed by a consultant and sent to the Bank for
comment by January 1, 1980 followed by preparation of an improved
structure of airport user charges by June 30, 1980 (para 6.12);
(s) that receivables and payables would not exceed 25% of operating
revenues and working expenses respectively (para 6.13);
(t) that DAAC/FAN would furnish to the Bank certified copies of the
audited annual accounts by independent auditors satisfactory

calendar year (para 6.14); and
(u) that, except for investments already in the approved five-year plan,
FAN would consult the Bank on any investment above US$1.0 million at
any one airport until the closing date and that FAN would obtain the
concurrence of the Bank before committing itself to any other capital
expenditures which would be greater than 20% of planned investments
in the agreed development program in any given year (para 6.16).
7.02      It would be a condition of disbursement on the training and technical
assistance components of the loan that contracts, agreeable to the Bank,
between a suitable entity and DAAC, covering such training and technical assis-
tance, would have been entered into by that entity and DAAC (para 4.40).
7.03      It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that a Subsidiary
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank, between the Government and FAN, would have
been executed and delivered (para 4.43).
7.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$61.0 million to the Republic of Colombia for transfer to FAN. The terms
would be 17 years, including a grace period of four years.

DOMESTIC AVIATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Financial Assumptions
1.   Revenues:
a)   All revenues have been increased by traffic growth at tariffs held
constant in real terms at their 1977 year end level to reflect
inflation in the years 1978 through 1983. Adjustments have been made
based on estimates developed by the Country Economist of the Bank. I'
b)   It is estimated that 20% of Domestic Passenger Tax and 10% of
International Passenger Tax is not collected. In 1979 it is assumed
that these revenues will be collected from all passengers.
2.   Expenses:
a)   Salaries and other category of expenses:
increased at 2% per year to allow for increased requirements
resulting from greater traffic.
1)   It is assumed that the Government will not allow any loss
in real terms for salaries. Salaries and other category
of expenses have b,een increased by the estimated effect of
price increases.! A provision has already been made for
salary increases in 1978 of 20%, and the budgeted amount for
miscellaneous expenses is fixed by budget.
b)   Maintenance
1)   Civil works after 1979 - 1% of Replacement cost per year.
2)   Aviation, ground maintenance equipment, fire fighting equip-
ment and FFI aircraft - 5% of replacement cost per year.
3)   In 1978 the budgeted expense.
c)   Depreciation employed is in accordance with the depreciation policy
established by the Government.
1)   Civil works (runways, buildings, access roads, fences) - 5%
commencing when the facilities are expected to be in use.
2)   Aviation equipment (communications, navigational aids, lights,
ground maintenance equipment) - 10% commencing when the equip-
ment is received in use.



-85-                           ANNEX 4
Page 2
3)   FFI aircraft - 12.5% commencing when the equipment is received
in use, with 20% residual value.
4)   Assets already in use have been depreciated in the following
manner:
- Civil works - 10% of net fixed in use
- Aviation equipment - 20% of net fixed in use
3.   Sale of Land at Medellin Airport
Increased from 1977 prices of pesos 384 million by the estimate
rate of price increase in the same manner as salaries. 1/
4.   World Bank Disbursements
The estimated effect of devaluation of the peso has been applied
to disbursements based on estimates developed by the country
Economist of the Bank. 1/
5.   Investment
a)   The project items have been escalated for foreign and local
components in accordance with guidelines established by the
Bank. 1/
b)   The foreign components of the project have been treated for
devaluation in the same manner as World Bank Disbursements. _/
c)   It is assumed that the nonproject items will be primarily
accomplished by Colombian firms. They have been escalated
in accordance with the guidelines established for Colombia
(local) by the Bank, and held constant from 1986-1990. 1/
6.   Debt Service
The estimated effect of devaluation of the peso, as established
by the Bank, has been applied to the principal and interest of
the Bank loan and other external debt, and held constant from
1986-1990. 1/
1/ Assurmptions for local price increases and the estimated effect of
devaluation of the peso are contained in C.4. of the Project File.
