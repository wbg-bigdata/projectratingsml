MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THB INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION aND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE gOVERNMENT cF TURREY
FOR AN EARTHQUARE REHABILITATIOr AND RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Turkey for US$285 million equivalent is submitted for approval
in support of the Government *  earthquake reconstruction efforts. The
proposed loan will have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate. Proceeds from the loan will be provided
to the Housing Development Administration (HDA) under a Minister of State in
the Prime Minister's office.
2.       Backround.  (Background rn the Economy and the status of Bank Group
operations in Turkey are provided in Annex I and Schedule D respectively).
The earthquake experienced by Turkey on March 13, 1992 caused extensive damage
to Erzincan city and its surrounding area in northeast Turkey (details in
Annex II).  The tremor had a magnitude of 6 8 on the Richter scale.  Its
epicenter was located about 3km southeast of the city (Maps IBRD 23895, 23896,
23900, and 23901 are attached). On March 15, a 6.1 magnitude aftershock
occurred in nearby Pulumur in the adjoining Province of Tunceli. The most
serious damage affected a 400m-wide band on both sides of Ersincan's main
street. The central business district was destroyed. Municipal buildings,
markets, schools and housing were severely damaged. At least 500 people died,
700 were injured, and more than 6,500 houses were destroyed.
3.       Turkey has been so seismically active that between 1903 and 1990
there were 48 major destructive earthquakes. Since 1900 over 90% of the land
area has experienced at least one earthquake of a magnitude in excess of 6.0
on the Richter scale; the average annual number of deaths caused by
earthquakes has been 8001 the average annual number of injuries has been
1,400; and collapsed or heavily damaged buildings average 4,700 annually. In
1939, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Erzincan caused 32,000 casualties. In
1983 a 5 5 magnitude tremor caused no casualtles but the damage to buildings
was heavy. Some of the buildings that collapsed in the recent event had been
damaged in 1983.
4.       Recovery Strategv.  In response to the recent Ersincan earthquake,
the Government of Turkey (GOT) with assistance from the Bank has identified an
r xthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program with an estimated total
cost of US$650 million. To expedite execution, the implementation
'esponsibility for the construction components has been allocated as follows,
under the overall coordination of a Minister of State: (i) HDAs US$285
million funded by the World Bank, comprising primarily cooperative and
government housing units, hospitals and infrastructure; and (ii) Ministry of
Public Works and Settlement (MPWS)s US$190 million funded by a GOT loan from
the Social Development Fund - Council of Rurope, primarily for single-family
housing units and schools. The remainder of the program amounting to an
estimated US$175 million represents temporary housing and other smaller
components whose cost will be borne by the GOT and the local community. The
Bank component of the program is referred to hereafter as the 2r2jiect,



- 2 -
5.       To cope with the disaster, the Government formulated a three-stage
strategy. The Government began rescue and relief op, ations immediately after
the earthquake under the Central Coordinating Commit    Oor Disasters, Civil
Defense and the Red Crescent at the central Government *vel, and the Province
Rescue and Aid Committee at the local Government level (Organizational Charts
I and II). The very cold temperatures compounded the impact of the
earthquake, and tents and emergency supplies had to be distribated to the
disaster victims. Temiporarv renovation began soon after relief started.
Heavy equipment from several ministries began to clear rubble from fallen
buildings and main roads throughout the city center so that the victims could
begin to provide themselves with shelter and makeshift business space.
Rehabilitation and reconstruction is the last stage and will be executed as
outlined in para. 4 above. Most of the works will be carried out by the
private sector.
6.       Bank ADDroach and Proiect Preparation.  In response to the GOT's
request for reconstruction assistance after the earthquake, the Bank
immediately began preparing a possible reconstruction loan. After a detailed
review of all existing projects, it was agreed with the GOT that it was not
possible to reallocate uncommitted funds from existing loans to provide
immediate financial assi. tance to the area, either because the Bank had no
projects in the affected sectors (e.g., housing), or because all funds under
existing loans had already been committed. The Bank's damage
assessment/appraisal mission commenced on April 7, 1992 to assess the
situation and gather information for a possible reconstruction loan and to
identify and appraise the proposed project together with staff from the
relevant GOT ministries. A timetable of key project processing events is
given in Schedule C. Negotiations for the loan were conducted in Washington
from June 22-26, 1992.
7.       Proiect Obiectives and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project
is part of the GOT's reconstruction program, and will include sectors in which
the Bank has previous experience and therefore a comparative advantage in
implementation. Care has been taken to ensure: (i) that reconstruction plans
are compatible with the GOT's policy in each sector; and (ii) to ensure that
the proposed project takes into account the lessons which the Bank has learned
in similar reconstruction efforts in other countries. The objective of the
proposed multisectoral project is to reconstruct essential housing,
infrastructure and other facilities to promptly restore economic activity in
the affected area. Bank involvement will help to prevent the recurrence of
similar earthquake damage in the future by providing technical training for
the construction industry, identifying existing public buildings which can be
structurally reinforced through retrofitting, and upgrading the institutional
and financial arrangements which deal with disasters in Turkey. Land use
mapping based on microzoning will enable vulnerable municipalities to provide
themselves with a safer environment through the identification of unstable
soil and highly unstable geological areas.
8.       Proiect Descriotion.  The proposed Bank project will finance
demolition, reconstruction, rehabilitation and repair activities in the urban
and rural areas including: (a) cooperative and government housing, hospitals,
office and shop buildings and key infrastructure; (b) procurement of critical



- 3 -
commodities including livestock; and (c) training and studiee to reduce
earthquake vulnerability. A detailed description of the Bank-funded project
components is presented in Annex IV.
9.       Estimated Costs. Disbursements and Procurement.  A summary of
project costs and financing is presented in Schedule A, and more detailed cost
tables are given in Annex IIl. Retroactive financing amounting to US$6
million has been included for the removal of debris and the preparation of new
designs already underway for reconstruction and rehabilitation of buildings.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B.
10.      Implementation.  The project will be implemented over a period of
about three and one half years, although the major part of the work will be
completed in the first two years. A Minister of State is responsible for the
overall coordination of the program, and he will chair a Steering Committee
(Organization Chart III) created to bring together the various GOT agencies
involved in the implementation of program components in the Erzincan area.
All Ministries/Agencies in the project will procure their respective goods and
equILment under the direction of the HDA. These Minist -ies/Agencies are
familiar and experienced with the Bank procedures. All (except the Mayor's
office in Erzincan) have worked in the past and are currently working with
ongoing Bank projects. The municipal infrastructure repair component to be
implemented through the Mayor's office is relatively small and will be
prepared and executed with Iller Bank and HDA assistance.
I1.      The Bank will review land use and zoning plans for project
components, and will ensure that clear titles exist before beginning works to
be financed from the proposed loan. Cost recovery measures are outlined in
Disaster Law No. 7269 (a translation of the relevant articles is shown in
Annex V). All building construction work in the Erzincan area will be in
accordance with building standards satisfactory to the Bank. Designs will be
approved by a panel of experts acceptable to the Bank, from Middle East
Technical University (METU) and Istanbul Technical University (ITU). These
universities will also assure that supervision of the works including quality
control of workmanship and materials is satisfactory. The design and
supervision for all building construction works in the Zrzincan area,
regardless of the source of financing or implementing agency, will adhere to
seismic-resistant standards. For the purpose of O.D. 4.01 on environmental
considerations, the project is classed as category 'C." Further details on
the environmental impact of the project are found in Annex II.
12.      The Bank has learned some valuable lessons in its 30 years
supporting emergency recovery efforts. The government's commitment is
critical to project success. Cooperation and communication between the
Dorrower and the Bank are also critical, as are an appropriate institutional
framework, streamlined and consolidated procurement and disbursement
procedures, uncomplicated project designs, and simplified land acquisition
procedures. All the above lessons have been incorporated in the proposed
project. The rapid preparation of this project is a strong indicator of the
cooperative and flexible arrangements already established between the GOT and
the Bank to address the earthquake disaster.



- 4 -
13.      Acreements Reached.  During negotiations, agreement was reached ons
a) the criteria for the evaluation of project components; b) the
identification of the physical works to be designed and constructed according
to the seismic-resistant building standards; c) the mechanism which the Bank
will use for reviewing building designs prior to tender; d) the procedures to
be used for reviewing bidding documents by the Bank prior to issuance of
tenders; e) the audit of project accounts to be done by auditors acceptable to
the Bank; and f) the timetable for the studies. At negotiations, agreement
was reached that: (i) confirmation of the appointment of the managers for the
-roject Coordinating Unit (PCU) and the Erzincan Managemeat Unit (RMU) under
EDA by GOT; and (ii) receipt by the Bank of the Government-approved protocols
(between the Turkish universities and MPWS) for the design and technical
supervision of the MPWS building construction works, will be conditions of
loan effectiveness.
14.      Benefits.  The project will assist in the rehabilitation/
reconstruction of damaged or destroyed physical assets and institutional
strengthening. The immediate benefits of this project are the reconstruction
of shelter and other physical assets affecting a combined urban and rural
population of about 200,000. Additionally, by reconstructing businesses and
farm structures and replacing critical inputs and infrastructure, the proposed
project will aid farmers and businessmen with the restoration of production,
employment and income. Under the project the operating agencies will gain
experience in planning, managing and implementing reconstruction activities.
This experience will strengthen the country's ability to cope with future
earthquake emergencies when they occur. The training and studies provided for
under the project will have medium and long-term positive impacts.
Recommendations will emerge from the studies that will propose strengthened
mitigation measures, will enhance the country's emergency preparedness
capability, suggest improvements to legislation which will enable the GOT to
handle pre-disaster and post-disaster emergencies, and recommend ways to
strengthen the financial sustainability of disaster-related schemes
(insurance, effective financing mechanisms, cost-recovery measures, incentives
to construct according to building codes/standards and enforcement
guidelines). By identifying public buildings in large urban centers, which
could be economically retrofitted to better withstand seismic forces, the
project will demonstrate on a pilot basis how to minimize damage from future
earthquakes throughout the rest of the country.
15.      Risks. The proposed project will involve a large number of
reconstruction activities which will have to be carried out simultaneously.
Furthermore, because of the pressure to start the project quickly and
implement it rapidly, the level of preparation of some of the proposed
activities may be insufficient. The risk of delay in project execution that
these factors imply has been reduced in the project design bys (i) relying
primarily on existing institutions of proven capacity; (ii) making a Minister
of State fully responsible for the direction and coordination of the project;



- 5 -
and (iii) escuring full funding for the project from the start of project
execution. Sufficient flexibility has been provided both on the part of the
GOT and the Bank to help resolve implementation problems rapidly as they
arise.
16.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.

EARTHOJAKE -RHABILITATION AND REC0UST1TC?ION PROJECT
THE ECONOMY
1.       A Country Economic Memorandum entitled "Turkey: Towards Sustainable
Growth" (7378-TU) was distributed to the Executive Directors in November 1988
and a report entitled "Turkey: Debt Management and Borrowings Strategy Under
Macroeconomic Adjustment" (7732-TU) was distributed in February 1990.
Backaround
2.       Turkey's population of about 56 million, with a per capita income of
$1,640 in 1990, has grown at an average rate of about 2.3% per annum during the
1980s. Population density is low and about 60% of the population lives in urban
centers. Unemployment has remained slightly above 10% through most of the past
decade. There is little absolute poverty but income inequality is high, with
considerable differences in income between regions and between rural and urban
communities. Data for 1987 indicate that only 4% of income accrues to the lowest
20% of households, while 55% goes to the richest 20% of households. Educational
enrollment at the primary level has become practically universal. Most health
indicators, including infant mortality rates, have shown substantial improvement
over the past two decades, but here too, regional disparities remain significant.
3.       Turkey's economic performance between 1980 and 1986 compared favorably
with that of other middle-income developing countries confronted by external
financing difficulties. Economic growth averaged about St per year, inflation
was reduced to 25%, and as a result of an outward-oriented strategy, exports as
a share of GDP increased threefold, substantially improving Turkey'a
creditworthiness. After 1986, economic liberalization continued but there was
a sharp difference between domestic and external performance. On the external
front, the current account shifted into su-plus in 1988-89, aided by growing
revenues from tourism and workers' remittances and continued export growth.
Foreign direct investment also surged and Turkey was able to diversify its
sources of foreign financing while repaying the last of its IMF and rescheduled
commercial debt. On the domestic front, expansionary fiscal policies in the
period leading to the 1987 elections brought the fiscal deficit to about the ame
level as in 1980. Although in 1988, the deficit was reduced through cuts in
public investment, the effort was not sustained, and in 1988-89, in spite of a
sharp drop in output growth, wholesale price inflation accelerated to about 70%
per year.
Recent Economic Develorments
4.       In 1990, a combination of tight monetary policy, expansionary fiscal
stance and significant external inflows resulted in high growth and a temporary
deceleration in inflation. GNP increased by about 9%, as the growth in aggregate
demand was fueled by public wage increases and large subsidies to agrLculture
that pushed the PSBR above 10% of GNPP. Crowded out from the domestic financial
markets by increased public borrowing, the private sector borrowed abroad mainly
on a short-term basis. High interest rates and inflows of foreign capital led
to a real appreciation of the Turkish lira, which contributed to a slowing of
inflation. The policy mix was not viable and did not survive the Gulf Crisis and
the subsequent tightening in the world capital markets. As domestic interest



- 12 -
Annex I
Page 2 of 5
rates rose sharply and the pace of nominal depreciation accelerated, consumption
and output growth slowed down.
5.       The slowdown in economic activity continued into 1991. As uncertainty
over the Gulf War was replaced by uncertainty over the election outcome, the
sharp decline in investment cortributed to a modest 1.5% growth rate.
Nevertheless, inflation increased to 71%, fueled by a growing fiscal deficit
which reached about 15% of GNP. Although the causes of the deterioration of the
fisoal deficit in recent years are primarily structural, namely the poor
performance of the state enterprises that has led to their rising dependence on
budgetary transfers, an important reason for the increase in the deficit in 1991
was the pre-election surge in spending, particularly the high wage increases in
the public sector.
6.       Despite Gulf Crisis-related grants equivalent to 1.8% of GNP, the
deficit was difficult to finance. As interest rates on three-month Treasury
bills rose from about 68% in December 1990 to about 96% in May 1992, in part
reflecting adverse inflationary expectations, the maximum limit of Central Bank
advances to the Treasury was raised creating the conditions for a substantial
monetary financing of the deficit.  Although the Central Bank attempted to
aterilize the impact of these flows through open market operations and by
tightening credit to the banking sector, the monetary expansion contributed,
nevertheless, to fuel inflation.
Balance of Payments and External Debt
7.       In 1990, domestic policies and the Gulf Crisis led to a marked
deterioration in the external accounts. The real exchange rate appreciation
weakened the competitiveness of domestic goods and combined with strong domestic
growth, contributed to a 43% increase in merchandise imports measured in US
dollars, while exports increased by 10.2%. The current account deficit reached
US$2.6 billion, while the trade deficit more than doubled in relation to 1989.
This deterioration is in part explained by the effects of the Gulf Crisis, during
which Turkey closed the Iraqi pipeline (which provided Turkey with royalties of
approximately $1 million a day) and adopted UN trade sanctions. The Government
introduced measures to mitigate the impact of the Gulf Crisis, raising domestic
oil prices and adjusting VAT rates. The immediate impact on the current account
was not easily absorbed. Financing was adequate, however; indeed, official
reserves (including gold) at end-year increased to US$7.3 billion (approximately
four months of imports).
S.       The slowdown in output growth in 1991 contributed to reducing the trade
deficit and improving the current account. While exports continued to grow,
imports declined slightly due to sluggish economic activity coupled with a real
depreciation of the domestic currency. Disbursements from the Gulf Crisis-
related grants compensated for the decline in revenues from tourism and workers,
remittances as well as the increase in interest payments. As a result, the
current account of the balance of payments registered a US$272 million surplus,
a significant shift from the US$2. 6 billion deficit registered in 1990. Capital
account developments were less favorable.  Portfolio and direct investment
declined relative to the 1988-89 levels, and withdrawals from Dresdner Bank



- 13 -
Annex I
Page 3 of 5
deposits1/, coupled with an outflow of short-term capital, contributed to a
deficit in the overall balance of payments of about US$1 billion financed by an
equivalent decline in foreign exchange reserves.
9.       Turkey's external debt at the end of 1991 was estimated at USS50.3
billion. Notwithstanding the slight increase in debt, which was largely due to
exchange rate variations between the tTS dollar and other currencies,
creditworthiness indicators continued to improve. The debt service ratio fell
from an average of 35.1% during 1988-89 to 30.6% during 1990-91, while the debt-
to-GDP ratio declined from 55% to 45%. Similarly, the debt-to-exports ratio
declined from 198% during 1988-89 to 194% in 1990-91. The falling share of
official and multilateral financing, however, has been accompanied by a reduction
in the average maturity of long-term debt. Reflecting recent increases in short-
term debt, particularly by the private sector, its share of total debt increased
from 14% in 1988-89 to 19% in 1990-91.
Develonment Issues
10.     The Sixth Five-Year Plan, which covers the 1990-94 period, supports the
continued outward orientation of the economy with an enhanced role for the
private sector, backed by a more efficient public sector. Another objective is
to reduce inter-regional disparities. In recent years, as a result of fiscal and
balance of payments constraints, insufficient attention was paid to developing
the human resource base. Continued export growth and technological advancement
is also dependent upon an adequate supply of skilled technical manpower. In the
current Five-Year Plan, the Government has accorded high priority to upgrading
education and health services.
11.     High inflation is a major macroeconomic issue facing Turkey which
threatens the achievements of the last decade. The fiscal deficit is its major
cause. In early 1992, the new government announced an economic program whose
stated objectives are the reduction of inflation and the resumption of growth.
The intended elements of the program are a tight fiscal budget combined with a
restrictive monetary policy. The program projects a 5.7% of GNP cut in the
primary deficit that is expected to reduce the PSBR from 15% of GNP in 1991 to
9.7% in 1992.   This adjustment is projected to be achieved through an
acceleration of tax collection coupled with a partial tax amnesty, implementation
of a centralized cash management scheme for the Extra Budgetary Funds, an
acceleration of privatization and improvements in the financial performance of
State-Owned Enterprises due to price increases and efforts to raise the
enterprises' efficiency.
12.      If fully implemented, the 1992 program will take an important step in
the right direction. Particularly important for fiscal management are measures
such as those targeted at establishing control over the Extra Budgetary Funds.
However, delays in implementing some of the measures in the program could
threaten the achievement of its targets.   The program will need to be

strengthened with further measures, particularly to sustain the fiscal effort in
the coming years. Successful implementation will be crucial to facilitate the
recovery of private investment and to achieve the productivity increases which
are essential to maintain external competitiveness and achieve sustained growth.
Bank Strategy and Ooerations
13.      The  Bank's  assistance  program  during  the  1980. supported  the
Government's objectives of restructuring the economy by placing greater reliance
on market forces and adopting a more outward-oriented development strategy. A
series of SALs approved during the 1980-1984 period were followed by sectoral
adjustment operations approved during 1985-1988, the latter to support reforms
in the agricultural, energy, and financial sectors. Commitments totalled about
US$1 billion annually during fiscal years 1986-88.   Commitments in FY89-92
averaged about US$600 million annually.
14.      The level and composition of Bank lending over the next two to three
years will be affected by Turkey's macroeconomic performance and financing
requirements. The Bank's program envisages a continuing technical and advisory
role for the Bank on macroeconomic issues, while focusing Bank lending on
improvements at the sectoral level. A key objective for the short term is to
support the Government's efforts to reduce inflation and the fiscal deficit. The
Bank's economic work includes continued monitoring of short-term developments,
together with the IMF, and analysis of alternative policies. For the medium
term, the program emphasizes institutional and policy improvements, especially
in education and health, to alleviate poverty and develop Turkey's human capital
base. The program also addresses equity issues, environmental concerns, and the
need to improve public sector management.   Also important is support for
increased private sector involvement in infrastructure and energy investments,
the streamlining of the regulatory framework for private investors, and measures
to ensure that investments in the social and economic infrastructure are
sustained.
15.      The  Government  attaches  high  priority  to  developing  social
infrastructure and services and alleviatina poverty. In the education sector,
the Bank is supporting the Government's efforts to upgrade the formal education
system as well as non-formal vocational training. Future operations envisage
support to help increase the absorption of unemployed workers into the labor
force and promote the productive employment of women; and to upgrade the quality
of and access to primary and secondary education, while improving regional
equity.   Similarly, in health, the principal challenge is to expand basic
services and reduce inequalities in the health status, especially between the
western and eastern regions.  Projects under preparation aim to expand to
additional provinces support for ongoing improvements in equity, quality and
access to primary health care.
16.      Sizeable efforts are underway to tackle the massive backlog in the
provision of priority infrastructure.   These offorts are also central to
addressing Turkey's environmental concerns.   The Bank is supporting the
Government's transport sector strategy aimed at maintaining an adequate level of
investment in the sector to avoid infrastructural bottlenecks, increase foreign
exchange earnings through transit and international traffic, and minimize
transport costs. Having assisted in the establishment of semi-autonomous water
supply and sewerage agencies in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir under ongoing

Annex I
Page S of 5
c'erations, the Bank is helping with the preparation of additional projects to
provide adequate water and sanitation for Bursa and in selected area. of the
Southwest  Coast.    The  latter will  also  support the objectives  of the
Environmental Program for the Mediterranean.
17.      The Bank's environmental assistance would support the adoption of
appropriate environmental policies and regulations, improve monitoring and
enforcement  of  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  institutional
strengthening to ensure effective management of envi.ronmental issues. The Bank's
program also envisages assistance to the municipalities to protect the
environment from the adverse impact of urbanization, and for environmentally
beneficial projects in the energy and agriculture sectors.
18.      Working within the constraints imposed by the Government's policies, and
while seeking the reforms needed, the Bank would support efforts to strengthen
agricultural support services, in particular for smallholders, and to increase
productivity. Future Bank operations are expected to focus on technological
development; improved irrigation sector efficiency; and on environmental and land
nagement issues including soil conservation and reforestation.
19.      The Government's strategy for the energy sector is to close the gap
between energy demand and domestic supply through careful demand management and
development of indigenous supply sources, particularly hydroelectricity, as well
as by using environment-friendly imported gas. Dank assistance for enerov would
support the Government's strategy to increase the role of the private sector,
including foreign investors and lenders; to decentralize and eventually privatize
the management of power and gas distribution; and to reduce pollution.
20.      Over the medium term, Turkey's industrial sector will need to be able
to operate in an increasingly competitive market environment, and to exploit
strategic market opportunities as they emerge. Further success in promoting
private sector investment will require consistent implementation of macroeconomic
measures aimed at reducing inflation and the fiscal deficit and a continuation
of the ongoing outward-oriented trade policies. In this policy context, future
Bank operations would support continued emphasis on broadening and strengthening
the private sector, including the restructuring and privatization of state-owned
enterprises; the development of capital markets, creating increasingly fine-tuned
instruments   for   corporate   finance   and   complementing   the   private
sector/privatization focus; and the development of the technology infrastructure,
thus promoting faster productivity growth and international competitiveness in
industry.
21.      The proposed project has been framed in the context of the economic
development of the country. By restoring productive assets and infrastructure,
the project would facilitate rapid creation of jobs and thereby help to contain
the high unemployment particularly in the Erzincan region faces. Rehabilitation
and reconstruction of schools and hospitals under the project are in line with
the high priority awarded by the GOT to these sectors. The focus on low and
middle income dwellings in the eastern part of the country addresses both the
income inequality and regional disparity issues which concern the GOT.

ETHOURKE REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
RECOVERY STRATEGY
A. BACKGROUND
The Karthruake Emeroencv
1.       On March 13, 1992, at 7:42 pm, the city of Erzincan with a population
of about 100,000 and its surrounding region were hit by an earthquake measuring
6.8 on the Richter Scale. The epicenter was about 3km east-southeast of the
city. On March 15, a 6.1 magnitude aftershock occurred in nearby Pulumur. There
were about 500 fatallties from the collapsed buildings and about 700 persons were
seriously injured. The loss of life would almost certainly have been in the
thousands if the earthquake had occurred during the work and school hours.
2.       In the city, the heaviest damage occurred in some 110 structures of four
stories or more that either collapsed or were severely affected. The damage was
concentrated in a 400m-wide band that ran along the main street. Out of a total
stock of 40,000 dwellings in Erzincan and Pulumur, over half were affected of
which: 6,500 dwellings were destroyed or so severely damaged that they will have
to be rebuilt; 7,200 need to be rehabilitated; while 9,200 need minor repairs.
The hospital loss was in excess of 650 beds and the hospital staff lost about 500
dwellings. The school buildings in the city and rural area were also severely
damaged. Fourteen primary/secondary/vocational schools were so severely damaged
that they must be rebuilt. There is a shortage of about 500 classrooms affecting
over 10,000 students who are now attending schools in shifts until facilities are
reconstructed. In addition, 45 schools with about 1,000 classrooms have been
damaged and need to be rehabilitated.  Along with the schools, about 500
teachers' housing units must be replaced. Many municipal and public buildings
collapsed (Map No. 23901).   The electric, water, sewage and road networks
suffered a large number of ruptures.
3.       The economic life of the city was brought to a halt when the commercial
banks, hotels and over 1,200 shops and offices in the 2-4 story buildings in the
central business district of Erzincan city were destroyed or so badly damaged
that they must be replaced. Aside from buildings, private sector direct and
indirect losses in the commercial center includes US$10 million in equipment;
US$10 million in consignments; and US$5.S million in bank letters of credit
opened by retailers in the commercial banks (for which goods were received but
repayment cannot be made since the earthquake destroyed both the purchasers'
goods and their collateral). About 2,400 offices and shops are in need of major
repair. About 2,000 employees lost their jobs as a result of disaster-related
closures. Foregone sales in commercial enterprises closed by the earthquake have
been accumulating at the rate of US$0.8 million/day. Two major industries, the
cotton mill and the sugar refinery, were damaged and will require substantial
repairs before reopening.

4.       In the rural areas, 110 villages were affected by the earthquake.
Damage affected homes, farm buildings, and cattle sheds. Some 4,100 cattle barns
and storAge buildings were reported destroyed. The falling barns, most of them
with heavy earthen roofs and walls, killed thousands of farm animals, severely
reducing rural incomes. Essential rural infrastructure including small earthen
dams and canals, and feeder roads suffered from structural failures and
landslides. About 2,200 rural dwellings were destroyed or so severely damaged
that they have to be demolished; 2,500 need to rehabilitated, while 4,400 will
require minor repairs. About 9,100 houses were affected out of the total rural
stock of about 40,000.
Earthauake Vulnerability in the Erzincan Reaion/Turkey
S.       Turkey has been so seismically active that between 1903 and 1990 there
were 48 major destructive earthquakes. Earthquake statistics for Turkey are as
follows:  since 1900 over 90% of the land area has experienced at least one
earthquake of a magnitude in excess of 6.0 on the llichter scale; the average
annual number of deaths caused by earthquakes has been 800; the average annual
number of injuries has been 1,400; and collapsed or heavily damaged buildings
average 4,700 annually. In 1939, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Ersincan caused
32,000 casualties. In 1983 a 5.5 magnitude tremor caused no casualties but the
damage to buildings was heavy.  Sme of the buildings that collapsed in the
recent event had been damaged in 1983.
6.       Damage problems in the recent earthquake were due tos  (i) lack of
enforcement of existing building codes in construction; (ii) the use of designs
suitable for more stable tectonic conditions in an earthquake-prone area; and
(iii) poor construction quality.   The damage pattern includes multistory
engineer-designed  buildings  and  rural  homes  built  by  owners  without
specifications.   Turkey presents a special case to implement and enforce
earthquake reduction measures both in terms of new construction and retrofitting
of existing strategic building stock (e.g. hospital and schools) across the
earthquake damage prone areas (See Maps 23895, 23896, 23900).  No reliable
figures exist for indirect and secondary damages but in the Erzincan case, these
indirect costs are thought to be at least US$200 million. This perspective
confirms that virtually any measure for reducing earthquake damage would provide
important economic benefits. In addition to the Erzincan earthquake disaster,
in 1992 major losses were caused by a mine explosion and several large
landslides.
7.       Other earthquake-prone nations have found that micro-zoning is essential
to reducing the vulnerability of engineered structures to earthquakes. A major
deficiency which needs to be addressed in Turkey is that no national micro-zoning
maps exist. Engineers and architects often find it impossible to obtain the
information which they require to evaluate the earthquake hazards represented by
a particular urban building site. Even in cities where micro-zoning maps exist,
there is a generally prevalent attitude in local municipal administrations to
overlook this component. This tendency removes the incentives necessary for a
widespread upgrading of major urban constructions. Other problem areas which
need to be addressed within the area of urban vulnerability include the

Page 3 of 11
establishment of an effective building supervision system, and a study of a
feasible earthquake insurance scheme. These matters are being addressed under
the project.
Resoonae to the Emergency and Recovery Strategy
8.       To cope with the disaster, the Government has formulated a three-stage
strategy. The Government began rescue and relief operations immediately after
the earthquake under the Central Coordinating Committee for Disasters and the
Province Rescue and Aid Committee (Organizational Charts I and II respectively).
The very cold temperatures compounded the impact of the earthquake, and tents and
emergency supplies had to be distributed to the disaster victims. Coordination
between the international agencies in Ankara was achieved relatively rapidly and
between the international and national agencies (e.g. Red Crescent) coordination
was satisfactory. Information was shared on relief needs assessments and on
goods or services supplied or available.   The response to the earthquake
indicates a need to strengthen the capacity for preparedness and surveys of
losses and relief needs, particularly in the rural areas. These issues are being
examined under studies funded by the project. TemMorarv rehabilitation began
soon after relief started. Heavy equipment from several ministries began to
clear rubble from fallen buildings and main roads throughout the city center so
that the victims could begin to provide themselves with shelter and makeshift
office space. The Government requires that all cities have an emergency plan in
place. Although there was some confusion during the immediate post-earthquake
phase, the response at the local level was rapid.   Reconstruction and
rehabilitation will be executed as follows: In response to the recent Erzincan
earthquake, the Government of Turkey (GOT) with assistance from the Bank has
identified an Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program with an
estimated  total  cost  of  US$650  million.    To  expedite  execution,  the
implementation responsibility for the construction components has been allocated
as follows, under the overall coordination of a Minister of State: (i) HDA:
US$285 million funded by the World Bank, comprising primarily cooperative and
government housing units, hospitals and infrastructure; and (ii) Ministry of
Public Works and Settlenent (MPWS): US$190 million funded by a GOT loan from the
Social Development Fund - Council of Europe, primarily for single-family housing
units and schools. The remainder of the program amounting to an estimated US$175
million represents temporary housing and other smaller components whose cost will
be borne by the GO-l and the local community. The Bank component of the program
is referred to hereafter as the nroiect.
9.       The procedure which has been adopted by the GOT to assure designs and
supervision work meet acceptable seismic resistant standards is that a panel of
university experts in Turkey, acceptable to the Bank, will approve all designs
regardless of whether MPWS or HDA is executing the works. On supervision, GOT
has confirmed that in addition to the regular supervision of works done by MPWS,
a separate team of Turkish university experts will be placed in Erzincan to act
as advisors on technical matters to MPWS. In this role they would complement
supervision done by MPWS.   HDA's supervision, using private engineering
consulting firms, will be reinforced through the direct employment of experts
from the universities in Turkey. on design standards and supervision of works,



- 19 -
Annex II
Page 4 of 11
the Bank,s expert report (on mitigation measurea) is on staff working papers file
and a copy has been provided to METU and STU panel of university experts. Most
of the works will be carried out by the private sector. The reconstruction of
permanent housing has already begun.
Stratega for Bank Assistance
10.      The Bank strategy calls for the provision of funds to meet the urgent
needs of the rehabilitation and reconstruction works, and assistance to the
Government in handling reconstruction management, planning, financing, and other
issues stemming from the catastrophe. The proposed project was identified after
assessing the most urgent needs based on a first-hand observation of the
earthquake damage, reviewing priorities with the Government, consulting with
other international agencies concerning availability and possible application of
external funds from non-Bank sources, and analyzing institutional absorptive
capacity (i.e. the capability in the various sectors to implement components and
sub-components of the rehabilitation/reconstruction project). The Bank strategy
will enable Erzincan to restore critical productive assets in the city and
surrounding areas.
11.      Reallocation of funds from other ongoing World Bank projects was
considered.   The housing component constitutes the largest portion of the
proposed project and the Bank has no lending operations in the housing sector in
Turkey. For the road component, the possibility of reallocation from the State
and Provincial Roads Project (Loan 3324-TU) was investigated.  Reallocation
turned out not to be feasible, however, because the loan amount was already
committed. For the municipal services component which will be implemented by the
Mayor's Office in Erzincan and Illr Dank, the Bank has no lending operations.
For the balance of the project components, the individual amounts were small and
reallocation would have been time-consuming because of the involvement of a large
number of agencies with which to negotiatet the Ministries of Agriculture,
Education, Health and Snergy and Natural Resources. Since time is of the essence
for this emergency project, and the total amount which could have been
reallocated given the time constraints was relatively small, it was thought
preferable to finance all components affecting the earthquake under the proposed
project.
B. PROJECT APPROACH
Protect Pre2aration
12.      The proposed project was prepared by the Minister of State (KOS), the
Housing Development Administration (HDA under MOS), General Directorate of
Disaster Affairs (GDDA) under the MPWS, the Ministries of Education, Health,
Agriculture and Interior and the General Directorate of Highways (KGK), Iller
Dank and the Turkish Blectric Authority (TSR).  At the local level, for
activities under municipal jurisdiction, the project components were prepared by
the municipality. All project components were prepared under the general policy
guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee for Disasters (Organization

Chart I). Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in Washington from June
22-26, 1992. The Turkish delegation was headed by Mr. Mahfi Egilmez, Chief
Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of Turkey, including
representatives from the Treasury and the Housing Development Adminintration.
Pro1ect DeicriDtion
13.      The proposed Bank project will finance demolition, reconstruction,
rehabilitation and repair activities in the urban and riural areas includings (a)
cooperative and government housing, hospitals, office and shop buildings and key
infrastructure; (b) procurement of critical commodities including livestock; and
(c) training and studies to reduce earthquake vulnerability.   A detailed
description of the Bank-funded project components is presented in Annex IV.
Project Obiectives and Rationale for Sank Involvement
14.      The project is part of GOT's reconstruction program and wll include
sectors in which the Bank has previous experience and therefore a comparative
advantage  in implementation.    Care has been taken to ensures  (i) that
reconstruction plans are compatible with the GOT's policy in each sector, and
(Ui) to ensure that the proposed project takes into account the lessons which the
Bank has learned in similar reconstruction efforts in other countries.  The
objective of the proposed multisectoral project is to reconstruct essential
infrastructure and other facilities to promptly restore economic activity in the
affected area.  Bank involvement will help to prevent the recurrence of similar
earthquake damage in the future by providing technical training for the
construction industry, identifying existing public buildings which can be
structurally reinforced through retrofitting, and upgrading the institutional and
financial arrangements which deal with disasters in Turkey. Land use mapping
based on microzoning will enable vulnerable municipalities to provide themselves
with a safer environment through the identification of unstable soil and highly
unstable geological areas.
Snecific Criteria for Eliaibilitv and Approval of Proiect Comoonentg.
15.      A detailed description of project components is presented in Annex IV.
Eliaibilitv. All project components must meet the following general
criteria:
(a)      are part of the 1992-95 reconstruction program for the
Erzincan earthquake;
(b)      are part of an annual investment plan approved by the Bank;
(c)      have no alternative source of funds, or sufficient financing
is unavailable;
(d)      have cost-effective design standards and represent least cost
solutions;



- 21 -
annex II
Page 6 of 11
(e)      are likely to be implemonted by the executing agency in a
timely mannerl
(f)     physical works must have started after March 13, 1992;
(g)     works are to be implemented under controlled and sound
construction practices, and utilize appropriate seismic-
resistant design which protect against seismic risks;
(h)     aim at restoring a service previously existing; and
(i)     the investments and services must comply with sound financial,
technical and environmental standards.
C.  INSTITUTIONAL- ARANGEMENTS
Leaal Framework
16.      Turkey's Natural Disaster Law No. 7269 dated May 25, 1959 (modified by
detailed Prime Ministerial directives which clarify the specific responsibilities
of the GOT's Ministries which will be involved in implementation) defines what
needs to be done in the case of the Ersincan natural disaster, both for relief
and reconstruction measures. Law No. 7269 needs to be revised to make relief and
reconstruction measures sustainable: it currently provides financing for the
reconstruction af almost every earthquake damaged building within a disaster
area. The GOT would find it difficult to cover the costs of a disaster if an
earthquake struck a major city under current legal requirements. While changes
to the law cannot be expected to be made now, an in-depth study has been included
in the project.
17.      Under the existing institutional setup, a Central Coordinating Committee
for Disasters (Organizational Chart I) is activated for each disaster. This
Committee has direct access to the Prime Minister. It guides and initiates policy
based on the nature and extent of the disasters. At the provincial level a
coordinating committee (Organizational Chart II) under the Chairmanship of the
Governor exists, which has the role of coordinating relief and reconstruction
programs at the local level.
18.      The GOT has decided that in the interest of expeditious implementation
the reconstruction program should be executed as outlined in para. 8 above. The
construction components to be implemented by the HDA and the MPWS is shown in
Organizational Chart III. The professional staff of the two agencies include
engineers, urban planners, and seismologiets.
Preliminary Protect Activities
19.      Because of the emergency nature of the proposed project, many of the
works are already in progress.   Demolition and removal of debris is well
advanced.  bor housing, public announcements through newspapera, radio and TV



- 22 -
Annex II
Page 7 of 11
have requested the residents of Ersincan province, who have been affected by the
earthquake to register their claims within 60 days of the earthquake date. A
final list of housing claims was completed by May 15, 1992.  Most of the
Government buildings surveys have been completed, and they forr. the basis for
decisions regarding the rehabilitation or demolition of the individual buildings.
Where complete reconstruction of housing structures is required, designs will be
revised. All building constructions undertaken under the project by HDA and MPWS
will conform to the seismic-resistant building code standards and will be
approved by a panel of university professors of METU and ITU. This was agreed
at negotiations.
Project ImDlementation
20.      The HDA will execute the construction of the:  (i) cooperative and
government housing; (ii) hospitals; (iii) offices/shopsl (iv) municipal and
public buildings; and (v) will arrange for the necessary demolition and debris
removal for items (i) to (iv).  In addition, HDA will coordinate the work on
components to be executed by the Ministry of Agriculture (cattle and storage
barns, procurement of livestock and equipment, etc.); Ministry of Health
(equipment and furniture procurement for hospitals); Ministry of Education
(equipment and furniture for schools); Turkish Electricity Authority (TER);
Highways Construction Authority (KGM); Iller Bank; and the Municipality of
Erzincan.
21.      The HDA President will report to a Steering Committee on a monthly basis
(Organization Chart III). The PCU will have the overall responsibility for the
recruitment of advisory services. In addition, the PCU will recruit qualified
consultants acceptable to the Bank, to assist in the detailed design and
supervision  and  procurement  of  works.    This  design  work  is  ongoing.
Prequalification of contractors and preparation of bidding documents will be
carried out concurrently with the preparation of the building designs in order
to call for bids and award contracts as soon as possible. Designs and sample
bidding documents will be presented to the Bank for review prior to award of
contracts. At negotiations, agreement was reached that bidding documents will
be submitted to the Bank for review prior to issuance of tenders.
22.      The PCV will coordinate the other project-related activities of the
Ministries/Agencies listed above.   Each Ministry/Agency will procure their
respective goods and equipment under its direct jurisdiction and will prepare
work programs, budgets and accounts and monitor the works and expenditures.
These Ministries/Agencies are familiar and experienced with the Bank procedures.
All have worked in the past and are currently working with ongoing Bank projects
(except the Mayor's Office in Erzincan). The municipal infrastructure repair
component for the Erzincan Mayor's Office is relatively small and the Mayor will
be assisted by Iller Bank and the EMU in the preparation and implementation.
23.      The PCU/EMU under the HDA, will be responsible for the day-to-day
implementation of the project and for the administration of the contractorsI and
consultants' contracts. The EMU will also coordinate closely with the Governor
and the Mayor of Ersincan and the other regional Governmental Ministries/Agencies



- 23 -
Annex XI
Page 8 of 11
at the provincial level (in Erzincan). The PCU will be responsible for the sole
operation of the project special account (to be opened at the Central Bank), and
the OMU will be responsible for the payment of all invoices, and the maintenance
of consolidated project accounts. The project accounts will be audited on a
yearly basis by independent auditors which was agreed to at negotiations.
Finally, the ZMU will prepare a monthly report on all the activities of the
project, which will be submitted to the PCU and copied to the World Bank.
24.      The project will be implemented over a period of about three and one
half years, although the major part of the work will be completed in the first
two years.   Outlined below are the specific levels of responsibility and
reporting obligations between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in Ankara under
the HDA and the Erzincan Management Unit (SWU) in Erzincan, under the HDA to
ensure timely implementation of tho projecr.  The following activities are
stipulated below.
-     coordination;
PCU/Ankara        -     designs;
-     procurement including contract awards; and
-     maintenance of Special Account.
-     disbursements;
-     maintenance of project accounts;
EMU/Erzincan      -     reporting of monthly project activities;
-     audit; and
-     supervision of works and certification of work progress.
25.      other components of the project will be implemented in coordination and
agreement with the PCU/HDA  by the respective Ministries/Agencies.   The
disbursements will be done through the E3U.
Proiect Costs
26.      The  total  cost  of  the  project,  including  physical  and  p.ice
contingencies Is estimated at US$285 million equ!.valent, with a foreign exchange
component of about US$1ll million (see Schedule A). Physical contingencies
(US$20.7 million) amount to 8.2% of total base costs; and 7.3% of total project
costs. Base costs are estimated, in US$ terms, as of the end of December 1991
and price contingencies are based on Bank guidelines and allow for price
escalation as follows: 2.8% in 1992, 3.9% in 1993, 3.9% in 1994, and 3.8% in
1995. Price contingencies (US$10.7 million) amount to 4.2% of total base costs;
and 3.8% of total project costs.
Flow of Funds
27.      GOT will channel funds to the HDA, which will handle all disbursements
under the loan. The other Ministries/Agencies will submit complete documentation
on procurement of project expenditures to the EU/HDA.   The EMU will approve



- 24 -
Annx II
Page 9 of 11
reimbursement of project expenditures by reviewing the works performed by the
executing Ministries/Agencies and authorizing payments from the project account.
Cost Recovery
28.      The Disaster Law No. 7269 requires that financing of homes both rural
and urban be through non-interest bearing loans with 20-30 years repayment
period, including a 2 year grace period. Loans to the commercial sector are
charged an interest rate of 5% p.a. and are to be repaid over 5 to 15 year
period. Also the cost of reconstructing infrastructure is to be borne by the GOT
under the Disaster Law (Annex V). The technical assistance component of the
proposed project will review the Disaster Law No. 7269 and recommend changes to
the Law for handling future disasters more effectively and recommend more
sustainable financial assistance programs.   At negotiations, agreement was
reached on the timetables for the studies to be conducted under the technical
assistance component of the proposed project.
29.      The Disaster Law No.7269 provisions will be applied under the proposed
loan for cost recovery and construction of dwellings and business premises. Where
provision for cost recovery for project components is not covered under Law No.
7269, then the existing cost recovery mechanism applied by the GOT would be used
by the respective Ministries/Agencies.
Procurement
30.      Because of the emergency and the scattered distribution of rebuilding
sites in the Drzincan area, contracts for civil works (US$142.9 million) are
expected to be procured under Local Competitive Bidding (LCD) procedures.
Foreign bidders who express interest will be eligible to participate in the LCB
procedures. Prequalification criteria for selection of contractors will be in
accordance with the document agreed to under the State and Provincial Roads
Project (Loan 3324-TU) to be executed by RGM. The civil works components to be
procured under LCB would be packaged into lots which will be attractive to large
and reputable contractors (about US$10 million).
31.      Part of the civil works (US$24.6 million) for the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of infrastructure will be executed either by force account or
local shopping by KGM and the Municipality of Nrzincan.  The demolition of
buildings and the removal of debris in urban and rural areas (US$6.8 million)
will be carried out by force account by RDA, RGM, MOA and the Mayor's Office in
Urzincan. Repair of rural irrigation and water supply networks (US$2.0 million)
will be executed by force account by MOA or by small contractors identified
through local shopping. The repair of the sugar factory (US$0.8 million) will
be executed by small contractors through local shopping.
32.      Furniture and equipment for hospitals, and state and provincial road
maintenance, each with a value above US$200,000 will be procured under ICB for
a total of about US$20.7 million.  Additional furniture and equipment for
hospitals, schools; municipal, provincial and state road maintenance; cattle and
storage barns, and other rural development will be procured under LCB for a total



- 25 -
Annex 1I
Page 10 of 11
amount of about USS40.9 million. To cover small items, local shopping for an
amount US$3.6 million will be accepted (includinj animals). a preference limited
to 15 of the c.i.f. bid price or the actual duty applicable to non-exempt
importers, whichever is lower, will be extended to qualified manufacturers in the
bid evaluation.
33.      Consultants for training and studies (US$4.3 million) and for design,
supervision and project management (US$38.4 million) will be appointed in
accordance with Bank guidelines for consultants.   This was confirmed at
negotiations. Terms of Reference (TOR) and request for proposals for consultant
services will have the prior approval of the Bank. For design and supervision
services, proposals will be made from an agreed shortlist of qualified consulting
firms, in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines.
34.      During project supervision, the first two packages and all contracts
above a threshold of US$2.0 million relating to civil works will be subject to
Bank prior review.   The first two ICB contracts of goods, equipment and
construction material (above US$200,000) will also be subject to prior review by
the Bank. Other contracts will be subject to selective post-award review.
35.      The Ministries/Agencies involved in the implementation of the project
are familiar and experienced with the Bank procurement procedures. Procurement
information will be collected and recorded, and monthly reports will be prepared
by the EMU. The reports will indicate revised cost of estimates for individual
contracts and the total project; timing of procurement actions including
advertising, bidding, contract award and contract completion date. This report
will be prepared by the EMU for the PCU, GOT and the World Bank. Bank financing
of project elements will be carried out as shown in Schedule B.
Disbursements
36.      Disbursement of the Bank loan will be made against eligible cost.
Disbursements to be made under Statement of Expenditure for individual contracts
to cost less than an equivalent of US$200,000 will be certified by the respective
Ministries and Agencies with documentation retained by the ENn. All other
disbursements will be fully documented.   Retroactive financing of up to
US$6 million is recommended to cover eligible expenditures incurred after March
13, 1992.  The project will be completed by December 31, 1995 and the loan
closing date will be June 30, 1996.
37.      In order to accelerate project implementation and loan disbursements,
a special account will be established with the Project Coordination Unit (in
Ankara) -- HDA with an _.nitial deposit of US$30.0 million. The Unit will forward
disbursement applications to the Bank for replenishment of the special account.
This account will be audited annually.
Accounts. Audit and Relortina Reauirements
38.      The EMU will maintain a separate account to adequately reflect project



- 26 -
Annex II
Page 11 of 11
expenditures.   Similarly, other Ministries/Agencies will maintain separate
accounts for each of the components they are executing. These accounts and the
Special Account will be audited annually by independent auditors, acceptable to
the Bank.  The audit reports will contain a separate opinion on the use of
statement of expenditures. Audit reports in English will be forwarded to the
Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The EMU will
provide monthly reports on progress of implementation in a format satisfactory
to the Bank. A Project Completion Report will be prepared by the Borrower within
six months following the completion of the Project. Understandings were reached
at negotiations on reporting requirements.
Environmental Considerations
39.      Environmental  degradation  represents  a  significant  component  of
Erzincan's vulnerability to disaster. By providing permanent housing rapidly,
the project will address the additional burdens placed upon the local environment
through the loss of shelter and the need to burn wood and fossil fuel to keep
warm in chilly tents and makeshift shelters. The reconstruction of hospitals and
homes will reduce the risks of disease, especially among the children and the
elderly who have the most difficulty coping with outdoor living in the extreme
climatic conditions of Erzincan.   Additionally, by expeditiously restoring
dwelling units with their sanitary facilities, the project will reduce the
contamination of surface and subterranean bodies of water which is the inevitable
result of living in temporary shelter. The project will restore the water supply
and bring it to acceptable drinking water standards. The solidwaste landfill
site and sanitary sewage t.eatment plant that will be provided under the project
will reduce the threat to agricultural land and the aquifer of unregulated
dumping on porous soils. Turkey's major cities are already at the limit of their
environmental carrying capacity. By restoring peoples' livelihoods as rapidly
as possible, the negative environmental and socio-economic consequences of mass
migration from the Erzincan region to environmentally vulnerable Ankara and
Istanbul will also be avoided. The project design is sensitive to the need to
establish institutions and procedures which will minimize damage from future
disasters and increase the preparedness of Government agencies. For the purposes
of O.D. 4.01 on environmental considerations, the project is classed as
category nC."

EARTHUAXE REHABLITATION AND ERCONSTtUCTr-ON PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PROJEC¢ COMPONENTS
1.       The proposed Bank project will finance demolition, reconstruction,
rehabilitation and repair activities in the urban and rural areas including: a)
cooperative and government housing, hospitals, office and shop buildings and key
infrastructure; b) procurement of critical construction materials and commodities
including livestock; and c) training and studies to reduce earthquake
vulnerability.
Housing tUSS68.2 million)
2.      The housing component consists of reconstruction, rehabilitation and
repairs of dwellings in the provinces of Erzincan and Tunceli. The area has 110
days a year with temperatures below freezing. Ideally, these tasks must be
completed before the winter starts. The housing sub-component will reconstruct
and rehabilitate the unfinished cooperative, government/hospital staff/teachers
housing.
Reconstarution
3.      Some 940 cooperative apartments will also be rebuilt by the HDA using
contractors to replace the standard 100 m2 apartment in 3-story buildings.
Construction contracts will be grouped into lots of about 150 apartment units.
For Government employees the HDA will rebuild 260 apartments of an average 80 m2
on the same sites along with apartments for 500 hospital staff and 300 teachers'
housing units.
Rehabilitation
4.      The structural frame of columns, spandrels, and beams will be reinforced
by contractors, and where appropriate, shear walls will be added along with roof
repairs.   Some 1,800 cooperative apartments in 4-story buildings will be
rehabilitated by HDA. The work will be grouped into contract lots of about 150
apartments.
Minor Repairs
5.      A large portion of the housing stock suffered only minor damage such as
non-structural wall cracks, loss of roof tiles, smoke stack, broken windows and
exterior plaster finishes. some 900 cooperative apartments will be repaired by
HDA using contractors. Contract lots of 400 to 500 apartments will be prepared
under the PCV and supervised by the ENU.

Sghools (USS9.4 millioni
6.       Equipment and furniture will be provided for 1,410 classrooms.  The
Directorate of Planning and Development (DPD) of the Ministry of Education will
be responsible for the procurement of the equipment and furniture of the schools.
Health Care Wacilities (USS32.7 millionl
7.       The proposed project will provide for the replacement of the three
hospitals destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake. The State Maternity
Hospital of 275 beds, and two hospitals of 100 beds each will be rebuilt on their
respective sites by HDA.   Each hospital will provide out-patient care and
maintain ambulance service for accidents and emergencies. The Ministry of Health
will coordinate with other Ministries and prepare the reconstruction/
rehabilitation program, and HDA will prepare the designs in conformity to the
seismic-resistant standards and will contract out the construction and the EMU
will supervise the construction. The Directorate of Planning and Development
(DPD) of the Ministry of Health will be responsible for the procurement of
furniture and equipment (US$16.2 million).   The hospitals plans need to be
redesigned to bring them to seismic-resistant standards.   At negotiations,
agreement was reached that HDA with the assistance of engineering/architectural
consulting firms, will prepare new designs and get them approved by a panel of
university professors, acceptable to the Bank (METU and ITU) prior to review by
the Bank.
Shop*/Businesses (USS34.7 millionl
8.       The project will finance the reconstruction and the rehabilitation of
about 3,700 retail shops and offices in three-story buildings that have no major
structural damage. No alternative site in the area would be less earthquake
prone. As an interim measure to provide the small shop keeper some form of
immediate shelter, the project will provide two or more large tent structures.
The Chamber of Commerce, the shop keepers and the Municipality would manage and
maintain the structures.
Public Buildings (USS8.8 million)
9.       HDA will reconstruct in situ 400 government offices. The 100 municipal
offices, bus terminal, the workshops, and the sports arena that were destroyed
will be rebuilt under the project by RDA. At negotiations, agreoment was reached
that HDA, with assistance from engineering/architectural consulting firms, will
prepare the modified designs and get them approved by a panel of university
professors from METU and ITU acceptable to the Bank, prior to review of the
drawings by the Bank.

Infrastructure (USSSS.0 million)
State and Provincial Roads (USS33.1 million)
10.      The project will repair, improve and/or rehabilitate roads damaged by
the earthquake and relief operated by the General Directorate of Highways (KGM).
RGM participated in the emergency effort with 149 staff from its nine divisions.
This personnel was involved in search and rescue operations, debris clearance,
and in the repair of the road damage in the disaster area. The components to be
financed under the proposed project will: (a) cover equipment and manpower costs
of the rescue teams and the removal of debris from collapsed buildings; (b)
repair of roads damaged by the earthquake along 100 km of roads in Erzincan and
the adjoining provinces; (c) procure equipment needed for the emergency; and (d)
repair and construct about 10 units respectively of residential facilities. The
works will be executed on force account by R6M under the overall coordination of
HDA.
Nunicinal Infra_tructure andaZlectric Network IUSS21.9 millionl
11.      As agreed with the Bank, the joint Iller-Bank/Nunicipality program wills
(a) repair about 650 leaks on the water supply network; (b) repair about 1,200m
of damaged pipes in 60 different locations and reconstruct about 1,300 inspection
chambers and house connections; (c) resurface about 20 km of urban streets; (d)
procure equipment and materials for maintenance of water and sewage networks; (e)
construct a head-ditch at the foot of the northern mountains to intercept surface
running water; (f) identify a site and implement a solid waste sanitary landfill;
(g) complete the section of the storm drainage already built on the North-South
main commercial street of Ersincan; (h) construct a primary sewage treatment
plant to improve the conditions of the environment of the Firat river, which
flows across the east part of the country and to Iraq; and (i) rehabilitate the
traffic light system.  The works will be executed by the Mayor of Erzincan
Off ice/Iller Bank either through force account or mostly by contractors under the
overall coordination of HDA.
12.      The distribution network, transformer stations, and administrative
buildings were particularly damaged. The proposed program, for which most of the
works will be done on force account by the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)
would: (a) repair about 5 km of medium (NV) and low (LV) overhead distribution
line and 1.5 km of NV and LV underground cables; (b) replace about 33
distribution transformers (6.3/0.4 kv) and insulators; (c) reconstruct two
transformer stations and repair one transformer station building (31.5/6.3 kv),
repair the 25 NVA step-down substation supplying Erzincan and the switchgear
building (154/31.5 kv)1 (d) improve the existing network to meet the demand of
the foreseen construction; and (e) reconstruct the headquarter building in
Erzincan and repair the four office buildings in each of the 4 subdivisions of
Erzincan province.   The works will be executed by TEX under the overall
coordination of HDA.

Demolition and Debris Removal (U8S6.8 million)
13.     The earthquake destroyed or severely damaged 60 large buildings and some
fifty smaller commercial and office buildings in the center of the city. These
must be demolished along with the three hospitals and the fifteen urban schools
including those in Pulumur. About 3,700 dwellings, 30 large buildings and about
300 smaller buildings have been or soon will be demolished. This makes a total
of about 360,000m2 of construction that had been demolished which generated about
625,000m3 of debris that has to be trucked to dump sites.   The HDA will
coordinate these activities.
Rural DeveloDment (USS2S.4 millionl
14.       In addition to the loss of their homes, rural families lost their
barns, grain storage buildings and livestock. Cattle, sheep and draft animals
died in the collapsing barns. The rural reconstruction component consists of:
a) repair of rural roads and repair of irrigation and water supply networks; b)
replacement of about 10,900 livestock; c) replacement of about 4,100 cattle and
storage barnsl and d) replacement of some MOA heavy equipment. The components
will be implemented by MOA under the overall coordination of the BDA.
Sucar Factory/Civil Defence (U8S1.6 million)
15.     Under this component, the factory chimney will be rehabilitated as well
as minor repairs will be do-e to the sugar factory. In addition, materials and
eVuipment will be procured for the civil defence department.
Pxiect Management Automation IUSS2.1 millions
16.     Under this component, the existing information system of IPWS will be
reviewed and necessary computers, training and technical assistance will be
provided.
Trainino and Studies (USS2.1 million)
17.     This component would carry out a seismic risk prevention and mitigation
program consisting of technical training and studies to (i) develop, at the
national level, appropriate loos reduction measures and standardised seismic-
resistant designs for public buildings; (ii) assist the executing builders and
contractors to upgrade their construction skills; (iii) train self-help rural
builders on how to construct earthquake-resistant rural home; and (iv) help
increase community awareness regarding earthquakes and likelihood of their
reoccurrence. Timetables for the various studies were agreed to at negotiations.
Several studies have been already identified or. are under preparation. They
include the following:
i)    Loss Reduction Study
18.      The loss reduction study will consist of four componenD-. The first
would examine the OT's financial exposure under Disaster Law 7269 and suggest

Page S of 6
sustainable revisions. The second'will study the existing building code and
suggest improvements. The third will develop a microzoning plan for Erzincan.
The fourth will provide a comprehensive program of inspection, assessment and if
necessary rehabilitation of Government and public buildings in the earthquake-
prone provinces of Turkey. This component of the study will also investigate
various aspects of risks which buildings and population centers are subject to,
including landslide and snow avalanche mapping. Prioritization among provinces
and classes of buildings will be made as followss
Prgylnges               Bulldinas Use
Erzurum                 Hospitals
Van                     Schools
mug                     Dormitories
Bingol                  Fire fighting units
Agri                    Security buildings
Tunceli                 Government centers
Kars
Diyarbakir
The steps of the study aret
a.    hazard assessment, largely from existing sources of information;
b.    vulnerability assessment, based on building inventories, surveys
on plan and structural typologies, studies of observed
vulnerabilities, damage/intensity model studies, experimental
verifications; and
c.    risk  assessment  and  reduction, based on  loss  estimates,
strengthening  methodologies,   screening  techniques,   and
laboratory verifications of proposed solutions.
ii)   Trainina for the Construction Industry
19.      Xn the view of most observers, the March 13, 1992 earthquake was as
much a tecimological disiter as it was a natural one.  Perhaps the most
important factor which con. Lbuted to the widespread failure of steel-reinforced
concrete buildings in the Ersincan area was the lack of attention to proper
building practices in the use of steel and the quality of the concrete. Multi-
story buildings collapsed because steel rods were improperly placed and tied,
aggregate was contaminated with soil and organic matter, and the concrete was
improperly mixed.   A technical assistance subcomponent will dissominate
appropriate seismic-resistant designs and techniques through the provision of on-
the-job training and short demonstrations to project supervisors, contractors and
masons. Urban contractors and rural self-help builders will have their skills
upgraded in the essential techniques for the safe use of concrete, aggregate and
steel in highly seismic areas.

iii)  The Earthanake Insurance Industry
20.      Insurance only covered approximately it of the total private sector
lose.  A study which examines the ability of the Turkish insurance industry to
provide the private sector with higher levels of disaster insurance would also
be undertaken. The extremely high levels of uninsured business losses warrant
exploration of a number of policy options with both insurers and local
businessmen.  The feasibility schemes of policy options other than private
insurance schemeo will also be explored as well as how to increase incentives for
vulnerable communities to pay for insurance or other financial loss mitigation
schemes.
ivy   Urban Vulnerability
21.      As part of the UN sponsored International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction, a UNDP/World Bank/Habitat study is already under way. This study
"Disaster Prevention and Mitigation in Metropolitan Areas" is examining the
combined phenomena of urban vulnerability and environmental degradation in three
countries. Turkey has been included in the study. The effort aims at improving
both the environment and hazard resistance in densely populated areas, the Bank
has engaged local consultants to study ways of strengthening prevention and
mitigation response capabilities in Erzincan, Izmir, Istanbul and Ankara. The
result of the ongoing study should make a substantial contribution to knowledge
in these areas, and the leasons learned would be replicated in other countries.
v)    Emeraency Preparedneqj
22.      A study of the national Civil Defense structure is needed.  More and
more, countries are becoming convinced that successful emergency response depends
on establishing channels of coordination and oparational capacities at the local
level. Emergency preparedness training will be provided for local emergency
personnel under the project. The recent earthquake emergency demonstrated the
need for improved local first aid, search and rescue, and emergency response
capabilities. Local police, fire and Civil Defense personnel as well as Red
Crescent and other NGO staff need to be professionally trained to deal with a
range of natural and technological hazards.
Project Management IUSS38.4 million)
23.      The project will cover the personnel and administrative costs of the
EW in Erzincan as well as the expenses incurred by the PCU which will be in
charge of the procurement of contractor and consultant services. A significant
cost component involves engineering and architectural designs by consultants and
universities.   Consultancies will also be required for supervision of the
construction in Erzincan.

FOR CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS
1.       There is no Ersincan Disaster Fund. There is a special bank account for
Ersincan Disastsr, the funds which are accumulated in this account are credited
to a general fund called the Disaster Fund.
2.       The Disaster Fund is managed by the Ministry of Public Works and
Settlements (MPWS) and/or by other Ministries/Agencies as designated by the GOT.
Uses   of   these   funds   are   decided   by   the   GOT   for   disaster
rehabilitation/reconstruction programs. The Disaster Fund is crediteo with 3%
of the z;knial net income of the State Economic Enterprises (S833) and with a
portion of the sales revenues accruing to the state monopolies from the sale of
liquor and cigarettes. Also miscellaneous donations and transfers from the
Mining Fund and the Mass Housing Fund are made on an ad hoc basis. The account
is maintained in the state-owned EMLAX Bank. The Disaster Fund sums are used for
investment expenditures and support services arising out of 4isasters. EMLAK
Bank is responsible for securing and collecting the loans issued following
disasteras There are three categories of damages: i) heavy; ii) medium and iii)
light. Each home and building is visited by UPWS/Government agencies assessors
and an assessment sheet Prepared. Also persons who lost their dwelling or whose
dwellings were damaged can submit claims within 2 months of the date of the
disaster. Xf a building cannot be repaired at all, and it has to be rebuilt,
then this is classified as heavy damage. if a building can be repaired for 30%
of its total reconstruction cost then it is classified as a medium damage. If
a building can be repaired for 5S of its total reconstruction cost, it is
classified as a light damage.
3.       In accordance with the Disaster Law "No. 7269 the loans for housing
purposes in case of heavy damage (reconstructed) are to be repaid over 20 to 30
years with no interest. For the reconstruction of business buildings, the loans
are to be repaid over 5 to 15 years with 5% p.a. interest. In the cases of
medium and light damage, the GOT/MPWS decides on the teoms and coaditLons based
on the severity of the devastation. EWAX Bank handles all loan transactions
based on information provided by the MPWS/Government agencies.
Cost Recovery on other Comlonents
4.       Necessary infrastructure in the area struck by an earthquake is to be
built by the Government at no cost to the residents in accordance with the
Disaster Law No. 7269.  On other components of the project which would be
implemented by other Ministries/Agencies (e.g. GM for highway, TER for electric
network, Iller Bank/Municipality for municipal infrastructure, MOE for equipment
and supplies for schools, KOH for equipment and supplies for hospitals, MOA for
livestock and other inputs to the farmers, etc.), the existing Government's
