MEMORANDUM AND RECOMYNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND APPLIED RESEARCH PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommenda.:ion on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Turkey for US$63.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, including a five-
year grace period, and the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would
help finance a Second Agricultural Extension and Applied Research Project.
2.        Background.  Turkish agriculture's share of total GDP has declined
from 34% in 19C5 to about 17% in 1988 due mainly to rapid industrialization.
Nevertheless it still generates over 20% of export earnings while providinv
about 50% of civilian employment. While official statistics show agricultural
GDP growth averaging 3.1% per year during 1980-1987, opportunities to increase
income and exports of the sector have not been fully exploited. Thus,
agric,ilture has managed to keep pace with population growth, but, crop yield
growth rates are declining, especially for wheat and barley. Such continued
declines could clearly affect Turkey's competitiveness in the production of
various agricultural commodities and reduce its ability to exploit its present
comparative advantage in producing these commodities. Inadequate farmer
technical know-how has been noted particularly as a contributing factor to
limiting the benefits from completed irrigation projects, where farmers need
to adopt new farming techniques and revised cropping patterns to take full
advantage of water availability. As the Government of Turkey (GOT) has
increased its irrigated area by 240,000 ha over the last five years, and
proposes to increase it by about a further 675,000 ha over the next five to
eight years, it is most important that farmers adopt cropping practices and
patterns which maximize the returns from these investments. Turkey's
livestock industry, which contributes about 33% of total Agricultural Gross
Domestic Product, is characterized by low productivity with milk yields and
beef carcass weights considerably below those of East European countries of
similar income levels. Increasing population densities and intensity of land
use have considerably degraeed Turkey's agricultural resource base. Cropping
of steep slopes, excessive grazing of natural pastures and overcutting of
forests has damaged soil resources and led to massive erosion. Excessive use
of fertilizers and pesticides has polluted water supplies and contaminated
food production. Future productivity gains will become increasingly dependent
on improved technical support services such as applied research, extension,
veterinary and plant protection to boost yields per unit area. Improved
extension and research are also necessary to formulate and implement
sustainable solutions to reducing and eventually reversing the considerable
degradation of Turkey's agricultural resource base.
3.        In 1984, under the Agricultural Extension and Applied Research
Project (AEARP) (Loan 2405-TU), GOT initiated in 18 provinces (out of 71) its
progrem for upgrading provincial extension services nationwide. This project
would be the second phase of the program and would introduce improved
extension services to an additional 19 provinces. Despite a slow start
because of a major reorganization in MAFRA during 1984 to 1986, AEARP is
having a major impact in improving production methods and farmer knowledge of
improved technology.

4.        Rtionalg for Bank l.olvemt,  The project forms an integral part
of the Bank'" agricultural sector development strategy and expandg the ongoing
program of Ammistance to agricultural extension and othe'r eochnioal supDort
services. BAsed in part upon the succeos of the improved extension
methodology adopted under the Corum-Cankiri Rural Development Project (Loan
1130.TU), GOT decided to adopt similar iiothodology on a phased basin
nationwide, starting with 18 provinces under AEARP. In the Bank's experionce
upgrading extension services taken considerable time, and up to 15 years of
financial, technical and supervisory support may be required. Given the alose
collaboration between GOT and the Bank in the design of improvements in
extension methodology, continued Bank asisteance is desirable to support and
eventually help bring to fruition the institutional changes required so that
the extension servicea can effectively assist farmers in upgrading their
technology throtughout the country.
5,        Prolect Oblectives.  The project's objectives are to: (a) foster
increased productivity and agricul.tural incomes in the project area by
improving the flow of information concerning their needs and problems from
farmers to MAFRA's extension/research services, and the transmission of
improved, appropriate technology which is economically and environmentally
sustainable through the extension services to farmers; (b) contributo to
institution building and strengthening of MAYRA's extension/research services,
including hiring extension workers to meet the needs of women engaged in
agriculture; and (c) test on a pilot basis use of mobile veterinary clinics to
improve animal heaith services.
6.        Prolect Descriptio.n The project would strengthen the extension
services in 19 provinces, support 14 research institutes which would backstop
the project area extension services, initiate pilot programs to train women
engaged in agriculture and introduce mobile veterinary clinics to improve the
availability of animal health services in the villages. To improve extension
services and initiate the pilot training program for women, the project would
provide:
(a) staff houuing, offices and training halls in the villages and county
towns to foster increased personal contact between extension staff
and farmers;
(b) vehicles and motorcycles, audio-visual, office, demonstration and
pest surveillance equipment, and scientific books and journals to
mobilize extension staff and assist them in their work;
(c) additional agricultural engineers to provide expertise in
agricultural economics and extension methodology/training, female
extension workers to provide training to women farmers, and drivers
to chauffeur the additional vehicles;
(d) training (overseas and local) and technical assistance for extension
staff, farmer study tours, and annual funds for incremental staff
salaries and allowances, vehicle and equipment operation and
maintenance, and new construction upkeep.
To support the research institutes the project would provide:



- 3 -
(a) training facilities and minor renovations to increase the
institutes' training capabilities;
(b) vehicles, and audio-visual, office, laboratory and field equipment
plus scientific books and journals; and
(c) additional research specialists, overseas and local training !or
research staff, and annual funds for incremental staff salaries and
allowances, vehicle and equipment operation (including drivers) and
maintenance, and new construction upkeep.
To initiate the pilot program to improve the availability of animal health
services in the villages, the project would provide and suitably equip
vehicles to be used as mobile veterinary clinics and provide veterinary
supplies, additional drivers and annual funds for operating and maintenance
costs. The project would also provide funds to prepare the next phase of
GOT's program to upgrade provincial extension services.
7.        During implementation the project would develop strong linkages
between extension, research and farmers; formulate responses to the needs of
homogeneous categories of farmers; and monitor farmers' uptake and reactions
to extension recommendations. Research-based recommindations communicated to
the farmers through the extension service would also help reduce the
degradation of Turkey's environment and agricultural resources. The project,
to be carried out over seven years, has an estimated total cost of US$145.4
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$75.1 million
(52%). The Bank loan of US$63 million would finance 43% of project costs, or
84% of foreign exchange costs. Schedule A shows a breakdown of costs and the
financing plan, while Schedule B shows amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule. Schedules C and D
respectively, give a timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Turkey. A map is also attached, as well as the
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8192-TU dated February 22, 1990.
8.        Agreed Actions.  At negotiations agreement was reached with GOT on
the following: (a) MAFRA would engage internationally recruited consultants to
assist in preparing the next phase of GOT's program to upgrade provincial
extension services; (b) MAFRA would engage local economic institutes or
agricultural universities to evaluate the project's long-term impact; (d) by
October 31, 1990, MAFRA's General Directorate of Rural Services (GDRS) would
appoint a full-time architect engineer to assist in supervising the civil
works which GDRS staff would visit regularly; (d) by October 31, 199 , for
each region in the project area, MAFRA would establish a Regional Coordinating
Committee; (e) MAFRA and the Bank would jointly assess project 4mfiplementation
towards the end of the project's first two implementation years; and (g) MAFRA
and the Bank wouid jointly undertake a mid-term review of the project some
three and a half years after the start of project implementation. The signing
of contracts between MAFRA and consultant firms for the supply of technical
assistance to help implement the project including providing training services
would be a condition of disbursement exceeding $5.0 million equivalent for
vehicles, equipment, and civil works (including $4.0 million from the Special
Account).

9.        Aenefits.  The project would upgrade and strengthen the provincial
extension senrice's capabilities to diagnose farmers' productivity problems
and to extend improved, appropriate technology to solve them. This would
result in: (a) increased crop and livestock production and improved
utilization of irrigation investments; (b) improved quality and health of
crops and livestock; (c) expanded agricultural exports, especially from
Mediterranean provinces; and (d) reduced spraying costs in cotton and
horticultural crops. The project would emphasize economically and
environmentally sustainable technology which would help to renew and preserve
Turkey's agricultural resource base, and reduce contamination of food and
pollution of water. It would also evaluate methods of training women in
improved methods of agricultural production which would eventually lead to
larger programs in this important area and contribute considerably to
productivity increases.
10.       Risks.  Main risks include farmers possibly not adopting improved
technology, budgetary shortfalls, inadequate training, slow vehicle
procurement and civil works construction, and ineffective project management.
Diagnostic studies should result in a better appreciation of farmers' needs
and problems so that the research/extension recommendations are more readily
acceptable to them. Funding constraints would be lessened by limiting new
staff recruitment and, through detailed extension program planning, promoting
a more efficient utilization of available staff. A skillgap analysis should
result in the designing of more suitable training programs. Early preparation
of bidding documents should speed procurement. Project manEgement is to be
strengthened by appropriate staff training, supplemented by consultants, and
coordination committees which would assist project management.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
