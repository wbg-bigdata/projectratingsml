TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Cyprus
3eneficiary:       Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW)
Amount:            US$35.0 million
Terms:             Fifteen years including three years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Obiectives:         .ne program has as its principal objectives:
(a)  increasing efficiency in tranaport sector operating
systems;
(b) strengthening the financial basis of transport
sector operations;
(c) improving the quality of. transport planning and
project implementation; and
(d)  upgrading priority areas of the transport
infrastructure and industry.
Project
Description:       The proposed project which covers the 1988-91 Transport
Investment Program (except for these components already
being financed under the ongoing Third and Fourth
Highway Projects) would include (i) construction of the
23 km Dhekelia-Aridhippou-Larnaca International Airport
(LIA) road; (ii) other road improvement schemes to be
selected from the 1988-1991 investment program ; (iii)
pavement strengthening; (iv) improvements to the
passenger and freight handling facilities at LIA; (v)
improving cargo handling facilities, especially for
containers, at Limassol port; (vi) equipping and setting
up new regional bus companies; (vii) technical
assistance to undertake feasibility studies, special
studies and support in project supervision; (viii) a
training program for the Roads Branch of the Public
Works Department, Ministry of Communications and Works
(MCW) and the Civil Aviation Department, MCW, including
buildings and equipment, training specialists and
overseas fellowships; and (ix) construction and
equipment for a new central materials laboratory and

(ii)
equipment for highway management. The Bank loan will
provide financing for (i) road construction, improvement
and pavement strengthening; (ii) technical assistance
and studies; (iii) the new central materials laboratory
and associated equipment; at.. (iv) training facilities
and fellowships. The total cost of the four-year
program (less those items already being financed under
the Third and Fourth Highway Projects) is estimated at
US$121.0 million equivalent.
Benefits:          Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (i) savings in vehicle operating costs
and road accident reduction following road improvements;
(ii) greater efficiency in the operation of ports and,
in particular. improved international competitiveness in
the lucrative transit traffic in containers; (iii)
improved operations and development of a regional hub at
Larnaca International Airport; (iv) increased efficiency
in rural bus transport; and (v) improved productivity
among transport sector personnel. The economic rate of
return is estimated at more than 302.
Risks:             The proposed project is not subject to any unusual
risks. The two areas where problems may arise are: (i)
the institutional reform of container handling at
Limassol port where, due to issues involving private and
public sector interests, delays may still occur;
however, agreement in principle on a port operating
company has already been reached and a September 1988
target date is believed to be realistic for the company
to be operational; and (ii) due to the complex
procedures, procurement can be slow. Government is
aware of this problem which will be addressed under the
proposed project. The project schedule allows for some
delay.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Introduction
Background
1.01     The period of Bank involvement in supporting the development of
the transport sector spans a period of considerable change in Cyprus'
society and economy. The period extends from the time when the recognized
Government controlled the majority of the island, with Famagusta the main
port, and the international airport in Nicosia, to the post-1974 situation
when alternative ports to Famagusta had to be developed, a new
international airport had to be built at Larnaca, and a large proportion of
the population, who had become refugees, had to be resettled in rural and
urban areas creating considerable social and economic pressures. The
economy had to adapt to these changes and, despite some ongoing fiscal
difficulties, it has responded very well and a firm base for future growth
has been established.
1.02     The reorientation of the economy following the events of 1974
required much investment in the transport infrastructure. At first, these
were emergency operations, such as the development of Larnaca International
Airpcrt (LIA), followed by longer-term investments as the new balance in
the economy became established. The longer term investments included
improvement of port facilities, construction of the new Nicosia-Limassol
road and a rural road improvement program. Parallel to this development of
the infrastructure, important advances have been made in institutional
reforms within the Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) and the
Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA). These have led to greater in-house
capability to plan and implement works. An essential part of these actions
has been the allocation of more finance to the maintenance of the existing
road network and the initiation of a modern road maintenance management
system.
B. The Role of Transport
1.03     Cyprus has limited domestic resources which have to support a
population with a relatively high density of about 100 people per km' in
that part of the country administered by the Government and, hence, these
resources have to be managed efficiently. The economic activity is based
upon: (i) the production of high value agricultural produce such as wine
and citrus fruit, much of which is perishable and requires both a good
rural road network and export transport facilities to maintain quality and
to benefit from early markets in North Europe; although direct agricultural
production now accounts for only 82 of the GDP, it provides 202 of all
employment and supplies nearly 252 of exports; (ii) the tourist industry,



that requires both air communications and internal road transport of an
acceptable service level: tourism receipts in recent years have amounted to
about US$ 800 per head of the population; (iii) the highly competitive east
Mediterranean entrepot trade, and a growing importance as an international
centre for both sea and air transport; and (iv) an export orientated
manufacturing industry concentrating vn cement, clothing, footwear and
processed agricultural products with its main markets in the Middle-East -
this sector employs about 20% of the workforce.
1.04     While adopting a prudent fiscal strategy, the Government's
transport investment policy, which is under the overall direction of the
Ministry of Co=mmnications and Works (Chart) is to assist in the
encouragement of the development of these export related activities which
are largely Lianaged privately, at the same time not overstraining the
country's environmental base. Consequently, careful attention is being
paid to the way in which individual development projects, including
transport, contribute towards economic growth and environmental
protection. Through the implementation of previous and ongoing Bank
financed projects the Government is paying increasing attention to
institutional reforms and addressing policy issues to promote greater
efficiency in the transport sector and, thus, reduce the financial support
required from public funds. This policy will be actively pursued during
implementation of the proposed project, including the operation of a
transport sector planning unit (para. 1.08); the rationalization of
procurement procedures (para. 2.27), rural bus services (para. 1.32),
Limassol port operations (paras. 1.38), port tariff structure (para. 1.39),
civil aviation charges (para. 1.45); and a training program (para. 2.04)
all with schedules and target dates in an Action Plan (Annex 2). During
negotiations, the Action Plan was discussed and agreed with Government
(para. 4.02(a)).
1.05     The transport sector, comprising roads and road transport, ports
and civil aviation together with that element of the contracting industry
concerned with transport contributes approximately 112 of Cyprus' Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and is growing at a faster rate than overall GDP.
The sector employs an estimated 111 of the non-agricultural workforce.
Details of individual sub-sectors are given in paragraphs 1.12 through 1.46.
1.06     Transport operations generally run smoothly and provide adequate
passenger and freight services for both domestic and international demand.
However, traffic on some of the infrastructure has reached or exceeded
capacity and the facilities require upgrading or replacement if bottlenecks
are not to hamper the effective performance of socio-economic activity and
lead to damaging effects on the environment. This particularly applies to
main road links, urban roads and to passenger handling facilities at
Larnaca International Airport (LIA). The land-side infrastructure and
equipment at Limassol port also needs to be upgraded if full advantage is
to be taken of Cyprus' competitive position in the east Mediterranean
container transit trade. These constraints, as well as operational, policy
and institutional issues are addressed under the proposed project.

C. Transport Planning Policy
1.07     The Planning Bureau, which is directly responsible to the
Presidency, in association with the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for
the preparation and monitoring of the Economic Deyelopment Plans in
accordance with guidelines prepared by the Council of Ministers. Plans are
drawn up for a five year period with the current plan cowering the years
1987-91. The recently completed 1982-86 Fourth Emergency Economic Action
Plan represented a transition from earlier remedial measures dealing with
pressing short-term needs, to the develoment of a longer-term strategy.
1.08     In Cyprus, economic evaluation and detailed preparation of
projects is undertaken on an annual basis. Thus the transport component of
the 1987-91 Five Year Development Plan is indicative giving broad targets
and setting total and annual expenditure limits. The targets are discussed
in Chapter III. During preparation of the 1987-91 Plan and given that the
sector accounts for over 20% of public investment and is critical to other
productive activities, the authorities recognized that a longer term and
broader based planning framework was required for the transport sector.
The MCW has therefore taken two initiatives to improve the planning
process. First, the ongoing Fourth Highway Project includes provision for
preparing a Transport Sector Master Plan and, second, in parallel with this
plan preparation, a Transport Sector Planning and Project Monitoring Unit
has been established in the MCW (Annex 12). The Unit will, inter alia, be
responsible for (i) coordinating the sub-sector activities under the
proposed project; (ii) improving and standardizing project and sector
analysis; (iii) introducing systematized project monitoring; (iv)
maintaining updated transport sector data base; and (v) integrating
individual agencies' planning activities within Planning Bureau
guidelines. The unit chief and three other staff between them covering
statistics, transport economics and engineering have been appointed.
During negotiations, the appointment by May 31, 1988 of technical
assistance personnel to be supplied by the Transport Sector Master Plan
consultants was discussed and agreed (para. 4.02(b)) under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank. Target dates for unit activities are
included in the Action Plan (Annex 2).
1.09     Public capital investment in the transport sector during the
1982-86 plan is given in the following table.

In a small country such as Cyprus, since additioti or completion of one
major project will cause large changes in overall figures, trends are
difficult to define. However, there has been a general levelling off in
transport sector investment expenditure sine' 1984 and, allowing for price
inflation up to 1988 and the devaluation of the United States dollar in
1986/87, a firm control of expenditure is being retained.
1.10     During the 1987-91 period investment is expected to rise
significantly to about US$40 million per annum as is showr. in the following
table.

1/ Current prices
The increase in investment is due to the planned start of further major
road improvements including the new Larnaca-Nicosia road and the Kophinou
road improvement, financed under the Fourth Highway Project by the Kuwait
Fund, the Dhsekelia-Aridhippou-Larnaca International Airport road included
under the proposed project, the development of Larnaca International
Airport, and modernization of container terminal operations at Limassol
port. The increased level of expenditure is needed as demonstrated by this
projects high ERR and is reasonable in relation to economic needs,
financing sources and technical capacity. Such investments are not made at
the expense of maintenance. The Government recognizes the need to allocate
adequate maintenance funds as demonstrated by increase of funds allocated
to road maintenance (para. 1.22).
1.11     The authorities who manage the transport sector have shown a
willingness to take the Bank's views into account during project
preparation and this will continue. The Bank will be given the opportunity
to review the proposed transport sector plan on an annual basis. The
sector-wide annual review will cover the proposed recurrent and development
budget for the following year with components supported by feasibility
studies in accordance with Guidelines for Project Evaluation (Annex 10).
Following this annual review the Government will take the Bank's views into
account in finalizing the budget which will permit the program to be
continuously updated as evaluation of individual projects is refined and

progress on ongoing works is monitored. During negotiations the following
was discussed and agreed: that by October 31 of each year until completion
of the project, the Government will furnish annually to the Bank for review
and comment, the proposed Recurrent and Development Transport Sector Budget
(para. 4.02(c)).
D. Roads and Road Transport
The Road Network
1.12     Cyprus has about 10,600 kms of roads, of which about 4,600 kms are
bitumen surfaced (Annex 3). The principal routes run from Nicosla south to
the coast, then along the southern coastline. Main routes and those
carrying high traffic volumes, about 2,100 kms are paved. The remainder of
the network is made up of district, forestry or municipal roads, many of
them gravel surfaced and carrying only small amounts of traffic. The high
proportion of total road expenditure devoted to new construction over
recent years (Table 1.3) has been due to the need to reorientate parts of
the network after the de facto division of the Island in 1974. The Bank
and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development have assisted or are
assisting in this reorientation process with the construction of the
Nicosia-Limassol road and the Limassol bypass under the Second and Third
Highway Projects, and the Larnacca-Nicosia road under the Fourth Highway
Project. The proposed project plans to continue this policy with
assistance for construction of the Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road (para. 2.04,
Annex 5 and Map IBRD 19932). This construction program should complete tJhe
main network and further constiuction is likely to be confined to
improvement of existing links.
T'he Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
1.13     The road vehicle fleet, excluding motorcycles, has been increasing
at the rate of about 8% per annum over the past five years, and now amounts
to about 182,000 vehicles of which 71% are cars. Including motor cycles
the fleet amounts to 226,000. There is thus a high density of vehicles on
the road network and, at about 4.5 persons per car, the present level of
vehicle ownership is significantly higher than in other countries in the
region and is comparable to many countries in western Europe. Details of
the fleet are given in Annex 4.
1.14     A comprehensive program of traffic counting is carried out on a
statistically designed census framework. Modern automatic counting
equipment is used supplemented by manual classified counts. Overall, the
rate of growth in traffic is about the same rate as the increase in the
vehicle fleet. After allowing for the trend towards more fuel efficient
vehicles this rate is similar to the rate of increase in petrol and diesel
con&umption (Table 1.5). On the northern section of the new
Nicosia-Limassol road, present traffic flows of about 18,000 vehicles/day
are almost twice those forecast in 1978 and traffic increases of 20 % per
annum or more are being recorded on some rural roads in the Paphos area
whilst traffic is growing at about 13% between Nicosia and Larnaca. Traffic
congestion has become a serious problem in and around the major towns.
Traffic studies, completed under previous Bank highway projects, have



-6-
supported the design of some remedial measures which, including the
completion of the Limassol By-Pass, traffic management schemes in Limassol
and planned construction of the Larnaca-Nicosia road, will ease the
situation. Studies on road safety and regional traffic control included in
the Fourth Highway project will also lead to corrective measures being
taken and, under the proposed project, construction of the
Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road will do much to divert traffic away from the
built-up industrial, commercial and tourist areas around Larnaca.
Axle LoadinR
1.15     Government is now taking action to enforce axle load legislation
and in 1986 11,693 vehicles were weighed which led to 263 prosecutions or
2.21 of the vehicles weighed, compared with 4.3% in 1985 indicating tnat
the enforcement program is having some effect. Moreover, in 1986 the
average level of fine was also increased. Nonetheless, it is still
necessary to extend the program to cover the entire network. Government
agreement was obtained under the Fourth Highway Project to institute and
maintain an effective axle load control sytem including two permanent
weighbridges serving the Nicosia-Limassol Highway and the use of portable
electronic weighbridges. Also the installation of a permanent weighbridge
on the new Larnaca-Nicosia road by December 31, 1989 as part of the civil
works contract was agreed. Procurement of weighing equipment and formation
and training of operating units is now in hand. All pavement design
carried out during the project will take account of the actual axle load
spectrum.
PWD Administration and Staff
1.16     Responsibility for the highway network is vested in the PWD for
main through routes, the District Administration (DA) in the Ministry of
the Interior for minor, district and village roads, the Forestry Department
of the Ministry of Agriculture for forest development and timber extraction
roads, and municipalities for local streets and roads entirely within
municipal areas. The lengths of the network administered by these
authorities are shown in Annex 3. As roads are widened and improved within
the DA part of the network, they are usually handed over to PWD for
maintenance.
1.17     PWD with a professional staff of 75 and about 250 technicians
(Annex 6 - Manpower Development) operates under a Director of Public Works
with a Roads and Airports Branch managed by a Chief Engineer, and a
Buildings Branch managed by a Chief Architect. The Chief Engineer is
responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads and
has a number o. technical sections to assist in this task.
Administratively, Cyprus is divided into the five Districts of Nicosia,
Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos with headquarters at these towns, and
Famagusta which has its headquarters at Larnaca. Each District has a
District Engineer who controls all PWD operations within the district.  The
District Engineer reports to the Director, although having technical
responsibility to the Chief Engineer for airport and highway work, and to
the Chief Architect for buildings. Salaries and conditions for PWD
supervisory and management staff compare well with those in the private



sector for similar posts and the quality and capability of staff is
generally good although in some areas of work, such as contract
supervision, the younger engineers require more experience and training and
at most levels there is a need for periodic refresher courses. For some
years there has been a very strict control on recruitment of extra staff
into the civil service and this has placed some strain on PWD's resources.
Moreover, the very lengthy procurement procedures, inter alia, are wasteful
in senior professional staff time. Under the proposed project an
Inter-Ministerial Committee has been established to address this issue
(par. 2.27).
Construction Industry
1.18     The Cyprus construction industry is large and well organized with
over 400 companies. These range from small companies, primarily concerned
with small structures and capable of undertaking contracts of up to
C£50,000, to large international companies capable of undertaking
multi-million pound complex civil works contracts. All companies are
classified by the PWD according to their capacity, experience and skills.
The performance of local contractors on Bank financed projects has
generally been good and rates and contract prices are competitive.
Engineering
1.19     Within the PWD, the Design Office under the Chief Engineer carries
out survey and design work for small and medium sized road construction or
improvement projects. Consultants are employed for large construction
projects such as the Nicosia-Limassol road and the Limassol By-Pass. The
central PWD materials laboratory has a reasonable range of equipment in
generally good condition, but the premises of the laboratory are cramped
and inconvenient. Furthermore, being situated within the PWD headquarters
buildings, the noise and dust pollution of a major testing program
adversely affects surrounding activities. There are plans (Annex 1 B9) for
the resiting and upgrading of the laboratory under the proposed project
(para. 2.04). District engineers have small materials testing labcratories
for qualit) control on works, and both these and the headquarters
laboratory appear to be adequately staffed and competently operated within
their limitations. Testing standards are generally based on British or
German practice modified in some cases to meet Cyprus' special conditions.
Construction
1.20     Small improvements and construction works are carried out by
District Engineers by force account. Major road construction work is done
by contractors, supervised either by District Engineers' staff or by PWD
headquarters through a special supervision team. Bituminous material for
about 30 kms of road overlays per annum is supplied and transported to site
by contractors, but laid by PWD.
1.21     With the exception of those few who have been engaged on
supervision of major contract conitruction, PWD staff have limited
experience in the supervision and control of contractors, and are not
always familiar with the use of contract documents and specifications. The



- 8 -
"on the job" training of PWD engineers especially relating to the
supervision and control of contractors is taking place under the Fourth
Highway Project and will continue under the proposed project supplemented
by formal training at the Nicosia Higher Technical Institute (para. 2.04
and Annex 6). The employment of consultants to provide advice to PWD in
supervising highway works, including the Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road is
included under the project (para. 2.28).
Maintenance
1.22     For some years now, the Government, awate of the need for adequate
maintenance, has been improving its assessment of maintenance needs and at
the same time increasing maintenance allocations. In 1987 prices, from a
low of about £C1.l m in 1980, the routine and periodic maintenance
allocation has risen to £C2.5 m in 1987 with £C3.0 m proposed for 1988.  In
part this has been assisted by annual Bank reviews of the maintenance
funding proposals as covenanted under both the Third and Fourth Highway
Projects. The focus of the Fourth Highway Project is on maintenance and
the initial stages of a program to eliminate the maintenance backlog before
1996. At the same time, a pavement management system is being developed by
consultants under the Third Highway Project with both a detailed assessmen.
of needs and a dynamic monitoring system to be in liace, by mid 1988.
Meanwhile, for the 1988 budget, PWD has prepared a maintenance program
based on the Fourth Highway Project's tentative projections and the
consultants ongoing needs assessment. During negotiations, in compliance
with the Third Highway Loan Agreement, this program was reviewed by the
Bank and found to be in line with Fourth Highway Project's projections.
The 1989 proposals will be based on the more accurate pavement management
system.
1.23     All routine and some periodic maintenance is carried out by PWD
force account and the quality of work is generally good. Larger periodic
maintenance operations (e.g. pavement strengthening) are carried out by
contract and studies under the Third Highway Project are investigating the
physical and economic feasibility of extending contract maintenance to
cover nearly all periodic maintenance and also to undertake selected
routine maintenance programs: the results of this study will be available
in early 1988. However, the PWD will continue to keep capability to carry
out maintenance operations and has sufficient equipment to do this: the
equipment is mainta5aed to a high standard by the Electrical and Mechanical
Services Department of the MCW.
Financing
1.24     Funds for highway construction and major improvements are
allocated annually from the Capital 'Development Budget and those for
highway maintenance and minor improvements are allocated annually from the
Recurrent Budget. Recent expenditures are set out in the following table:

1/ At constant 1986 prices.
The Bank's assistance in the highway sector in Cyprus has aimed at reaching
a compromise between Government's needs for budgeting adjustments to match
overall economic policy and undertaking construction projects in the most
efficient way (i.e. not spreading them over too long a period) and not
using road maintenance allocations as a budget adjusting mechanism. This
policy thrust will be continued in the proposed project.
1.25     The country's history of highway expenditure has reflected a
cautious approach to investments with strict control over proposed
construction and improvement works. Since the Bank first became involved
in the sector, all investments have been subjected to careful study and
evaluation in the context of Cy1prus economic needs and the Bank has
consequently been able to support the proposed programs. Moreover, the
authorities have been willing to consider the Bank's views in developing or
modifying the road investment program, and this will continue under the
proposed project. During project preparation and at appraisal the proposed
1988-91 program of road works has been reviewed by the Bank and is
considered to be in keeping with the country's needs and resources. The
annual road investment program will be submitted to the Bank for review and
components will be selected for Bank financing (para. 2.03).
1.26     Revenue from road user charges is not specifically earmarked for
highway purposes but goes into the general revenue. However, these
revenues are more than adequate to covei 'aighway maintenance and capital
investment. Nevertheless, the Government has decided to take steps to
ensure a more equitable levying of road user charges and the Transport
Sector Master Plan Study, financed under the Fourth Highway Project, will
include a review of road user charges. Government agreement was obtained
under the Fourth Highway Project to furnish to the Bank for review and
comment its proposed measures for the restructuring of its road user
charges system by March 31, 1988, and to put these measures into effect not
later than December 31, 1988.

1.27     Most fuel is refined in Cyprus from imported crude oil and retail
prices are at or higher than border prices. Approximately 96S of petrol
but only 282 of diesel is consumed by the road transport industry.

The June 1987 retail prices per US gallon are, petrol US$2.12, and diesel
US$0.72.
Although diesel is no longer subsidized neither is it taxed, and the entire
burden of fuel tax falls upon petrol engined vehicles. Tax on petrol is
approximately 302 of the retail price. However, it is unlikely that this
has led, except in the case of taxis, to an exceptional trend towards
diesel trucks and buses, if only because it has been rather diff'cult for
many years now to obtain petrol engined buses and trucks. For equivalent
sized vehicles the annual license fee for the diesel version is nearly 432
greater than for the petrol powered version. A large diesel truck will pay
CE500 (US$ 1000) p.a. and CE850 (US$ 1,700) for the initial registration
fee compared with the average private cars annual license fee of CE45
(US$90) and initial registration fee of CE140 (US$280). Even so, it seems
highly probable that trucks do not pay adequately for the road wear and
tear that they cause. The appropriate level of charges for all road users
is currently being reviewed during the preparation of the Transport Sector
Master Plan (para. 1.26).
Road Safety
1.28     The fatal accident rate (comparing vehicle ownership rates with



- 11 -
accidents) in Cyprus is about three times that of the United Kingdom. The
injury rate is also high - and could be higher as research indicates that
up to 302 of accidents, particularly those involving children and young
cyclists, are not reported. Damage only accidents do not have to be
reported to the police and are thus under reported. The following table
gives official statistics for injury accidents in Cyprus.

Source: Department of Statistics
The figures show that the numbers of road accidents reported are increasing
at a similar rate to vehicle traffic and the same was true of fatalities
until 1986. However, it is encouraging to note that during the last two
years the number of injuries has declined and in 1986 fatalities also
fell: the compulsory wearing of seatbelts has been introduced in 1987.
Studies which formed part of the Larnaca-Nicosia road feasibility study
examined the problem and have evaluated its very significant cost to the
economy (Annex lBl). The Fourth Highway project includes a component to
further study road safety and to make and implement recommendations to
tackle the more serious problems which will be identified as a result of
this study.
Training
1.29     Some specialist skills in the PWD are lacking - especially
concerning civil works supervision, operation of pavement management
systems, road maintenance techniques and bituminous materials and mix
control. There is also a clear need to upgrade the skills of PWD
technicians. An outline manpower development plan (Annex 6) covering
training needs has been proposed, most of which will be met by the Nicosia
Higher Technical Institute . The Government has already appointed a
Training Officer within PWD to oversee the manpower development plan.
During negotiations a training program based on the manpower development
plan was confirmed (para. 4.01(e)).
Organization and Regulation of Road Transport
1.30     Road transport in Cyprus is mostly privately controlled.  The
3,385 commercial trucks are operated mainly by individual owner operators
but with a few companies operating small fleets of up to ten vehicles.
There are about 500 operating licenses. A successful private company
operates about 130 buses in Nicosia and there are also two relatively new



- 12 -
but less successful government promoted bus companies in Limassol and
Paphos.  One bus line operates between Nicosia, Limassol and Paphts.  There
are also eight-passenger taxis which ply between cities.
1.31     A traditional system of about 800 owner operated buses serves the
outlying villages with each bus owned by a local inhabitant and based in
the village it serves. A study financed under the Third Highway Project
(Annex 1,B4) has shown that the traditional village bus system no longer
meets the needs of the developing rural society providing a service that is
slow, infrequent and uncomfortable: this has increased pressure for either
more expensive personal transport or for migration to the towns. In
addition buses are aging, there is considerable over-capacity and
operators, loathe to give up their licences which, in the past, were given
to them in perpetuity, try to continue but augment their income in second
jobs. Clearly there is a need to improve the overall efficiency of the
system - a view shared by passengers and bus operators. For example, there
is a need to cut down on the number of buses and, instead of the
traditional daily one round trip from the village to the town and back, to
institute more flexible services. Operating through the Road Transport
Department (RDT) of MCW the Government has started a phased program for
rationalizing the rural bus services beginning with a pilot operation in
the Nicosia region. With the cooperation of the village bus operators this
involves the creation of a private company with appropriately sized buses.
The pilot rural bus company will be a private operation with shareholders
composed of existing local village bus operators who wish to join. Others
will be bought out by the new company.
1.32     Given the need to provide low cost transportation to these often
remote villages, the companies will receive some modest initial financial
support in the form of loans at 2% under commercial rate and accelerated
write off of the buses. This support, which is estimated at between 2-52
of operating costs, is not confined to the newly formed bus companies but
is available to other enterprises and is part of a national policy to
encourage investment in Cyprus. This rationalization is in its initial
stage and with the tradition bound nature of the current system, change
must be introduced slowly and with due process. The project will include
financing: (i) from Governnent to buy out those existing bus operators who
do not wish to become shareholders in the new companies; (ii) "m
Government as loans to procure the new equipment; and (iii) i         "e
proposed loan to provide technical assistance to the RTD of the MCW, inter
alia, to advise the new bus companies on operating and management
procedures. The rationalization program aind technical assistance timing is
set out in the Action Plan (Annex 2).
1.33     Government regulation of road transport is modest.  The RDT
reviews requests for changes in passenger fares and controls the number of
bus and truck operating licenses. The number of bus licenses of all types
is about 1,750 and of these about 800 are for village buses mentioned above
which either remain within the operator's family or, with the sanction of
the RDT may be transferred. Requests for changes in passenger fares must
be accompanied by disclosure of costs by the bus company and are first
discussed in the transport committee of the RDT. The Director General of



- 13 -
RDT then makes a recommendation to the Price Commissior. (within the
Ministry of Commerce) which approves or rejects the increase. Fare
increases have taken place over the last five years roughly in line with
local inflation.
1.34     The freight transport industry is largely self regulating with
nearly all  mner operators belonging to one of two unions or associations
which support their members' interests. Representatives of these
associations sit or a committee chaired by the Director of RDT to discuss a
wide range of transport matters.  While there would be a possibility that
these associations might act as cartels and, indeed, some informal
allocation of routes exists, except for the movement of grapes where prices
are fixed by RTD, tariffs are traditionally subject to bargaining. Hence,
although entry into the transport business is controlled, competition is
keen, prices are dictated by the market place and the industry is
responsive to customers' needs.
E. Ports and Shipping Sub-Sector
Port Fazilities and Traffic
1.35     Limassol and Larnaca, situated on the south coast of the island,
are the maujor Cyprus multipurpose ports serving both containerised, bulk
and break bulk cargo for Cyprus national and transit trade. In addition,
there are a number of special oil terminals serving the import of
petroleum, as well as an industrial port at Vasiliko. The new ports of
Limassol and Larnaca were built in the mid 1970s with assistance from the
Bank under the First and Second Port Projects (Loan 628 and 1540-CY) to
replace Famagusta and outdated facilities. As a result of continuous
development, the ports now offer good facilities. A container terminal is
available in the Limassol port, which can handle up to 200,000 twenty-foot
containers annually. The total general and bulk cargo handled in the
Cyprus ports in 1986 was around 5.0 million tonnes (Table 1.7). The number
of vessels which called was 4,700.  The strategic position and the minimal
custom formalities for transhipments in both ports are helping Cyprus
become a transit centre of increasing importance in the Middle East area.
Furthermore, one of the "round-the-world" container operators uses Limassol
as one of its main transhipmeuit ports. Approximately 140,000 TEU were
handled in transit in 1986. The ports maintain satisfactory turnaround
times which average from 1 day for container vessels to 2-3 days for
conventional ships.
1.36     Limassol port handles over 701 of general cargo, 601 of the
passengers and 802 of the container traffic, but Larnaca container traffic
is showing a strong growth due to very active marketing by the local
shipping agents and by expansion plans of a major container shipping
company. The following table shows the main port traffic in Cyprus.

Note: Domestic container traffic statistics are available only in numbers
of boxes.
Transit traffic may fluctuate as the political and security situation in
Beirut changes (as can be seen by the 1984 figures) and as other ports in
the region are developed. Transit traffic is also a highly competitive
business and, with developments in other ports of the region, Cyprus will
have to upgrade the operations at Limassol and Larnaca ports to improve or
to maintain its share of this traffic. Nonetheless, latest estimates for
1987 show a likely increase of 25S in container transshipment traffic.
Wvhile prospects look good, the tariff structure and system of calculation
is not appropriate to modern shipping operations, i.e. tariffs based on
weight rather than on value. Thus income has not kept pace with traffic
and the need for investments in new facilties. The rapid growth in
passenger traffic is the result of passer.ger ferries from Larnaca now
serving Beirut in the absence of air services.
Operations and Financial Position
1.37     All ports are administered by the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA)
which has jurisdiction in matters of general policy. Port operations are
generally carried out by private and public companies under licence to the
CPA. Although Limassol port has absorbed increased traffic, the
combination of a large number of organizations involved, vested interests
which are not development orientated, and rather outmoded operating methods
a-d equipment, have at times caused difficulties and could prejudice
de1v-lopment. In particular, the landside container handling system has not
been fully developed due: (a) to differences of opinion as to the relative
merits of straddle carriers currently being used compared with rubber tyred
gantries for which the container yard has been prepared but which have not
yet been procured; and (b) the type and ownership of a company to operate
the container yard.
1.38     In order to address problems of operation in Cyprus ports,
especially in the important container business, the Government in
consultation with the Bank has agreed that modernization of operations must
be accompanied by institutional reforms relating to port operation and port
charges. With, as a consultant, a former Chief of Operations of a major



- 15 -
European port, the Bank has been assisting the CPA in encouraging the
formation of a private operating company incorporating those with a
current financial stake in the movement of containers. These efforts are
bearing fruit and the Government's Council of Ministers is shortly expected
to reach a policy decision that a private company, incorporating the
shipping agents and licensed porters, should be allowed to operate the
container terminal under licence from the CPA. The company would become
operational by September 30, 1988, and, in agreement with the CPA, would
procure and introduce the additional container handling equipment needed to
both handle containers efficiently and back up CPAs and shipping agents'
marketing strategy of consolidating and further expanding transit trade at
Limassol. The draft company structure and equipment specifications will be
submitted for review and comment by the Bank in accordance with the Action
Plan (Annex 2).
1.39     The CPA operates the ports on a commercial basis and has pursued a
prudent financial policy. This is demonstrated by the Summary Financial
Results over the past five-years shown in the table below - Annex 7
contains the details.
Table 1.8: Summary Financial Results in CE (000's)

There has been an operating surplus each year - after providing adequate
sums for depreciation.  The rate of return of 8% covenanted under the
Second Port Project is largely being met. The covenant remains in force.
Tariffs are proposed by CPA and approved by the government but with the
change it. the type of trade and size of vessels the pattern of port charges
may no longer be appropriate. CPA is therefore preparing draft proposals
to restructure port charge tariffs which are currently being discussed with
port users and operators. When agreement in principle is reached the Bank
will review the recommended new structure. It is proposed to introduce the
restructured tariff by January 31, 1989. The activities for tariff
restructuring and the target dates are included in the Action Plan (Annex
2).
1.40     The basic strength of CPA's financial structure is not in doubt.
Annex 7 shows the Profit and Loss Accounts for 1986 and 1985 (summarized
above in Table 1.8) together with the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. With a
debt equity ratio of 56:44 and e. rate of return of 8S CPA should have no
problem both in raising funds for operationa'. improvements and servicing
any related debt.



- 16 -
Shipping
1.41     The low shipping registration fees, the complete tax exemption to
all profits and dividends arising from shipping operations and the easy
availability of the Cyprus flag to foreign operators through the
establishment of a local companty have made it increasingly attractive to
shipping companies. Consequently, the Cyprus merchant marine is
considerably larger than would be expected for a country of this size. The
total number of ships as of June 30, 1986, was 1,549 with a total gross
tonnage of almost 11 million. Since December 1978, the Government has
taken a number of strict measures to upgrade the quality of vessels sailing
under the Cyprus flag including limitations on the age of vessels and crew
terms of employment.
F. Civil Aviation
Airports and Traffic
1.42     Following the closure of Nicosia International Airport in 1974,
Larnaca International Airport was developed rapidly as a replacemeut.
Whilst some improvements have been undertaken in accordance with a master
plan prepared in 1978, about 70% of the buildings are still temporary.
Although aircraft parking areas and the single 2,750 meter runway are
adequate for the foreseeable future and a parallel taxiway is under
const,uction, other facilities have not kept pace with the traffic increase
and there are, consequently, severe passenger airport capacity problems.
These problems are likely to increase as several large international
carriers have proposed to transfer their hub operations from Beirut to
Larnaca. Table 1.9 shows the recent growth in air traffic: the future
estimates envisage a ceiling of 3 million passengers by the year 2000 but
this will be analysed in detail in the upcoming Development of Larnaca
International Airport (LIA) study (para. 1.45).

Paphos Airport about 150 kms to the west, which opened in late 1983, has
aircraft movement facilities built to international standards but passenger
handling takes place in modified warehouses. Although the traffic is
likely to grow as tourism in the Paphos region increases, it is unlikely to
take much passenger traffic from Larnaca. Paphos has, nonetheless,
attracted agricultural and horticultural air freight from Larnaca as much
of this traffic originates in the Paphos hinterland.

Developments and Finance
1.43     The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) (a department of the MCW)
manages LIA and Paphos Airport. Day to day operations are run at airport
level in cooperation with the airlines (of which there are 26), the police
and customs. Owing to the severe passenger traffic capacity problems at
LIA it is proposed, within the framework of an updated master plan (para.
2.07), to build a new terminal building with supporting services. These
facilities are included in the proposed project as well as the feasibility
study and detailed engineering.
1.44     Investment in airport facilities during the past five years, most
of which was concerned with the development of Paphos airport and the
taxiway at LIA, is given in Table 1.10.

l/ Current prices.
the capital development expenditure during 1987-91 is estimated at about
US$27 million and is made up almost entirely by improvements at LIA
starting in 1990.
1.45     Although the revenue derived from airlines and other airport users
is reported to cover direct operating costs, no account is taken of PWD
maintenance, depreciation, development or expenditures required to provide
an acceptable level of service for existing and future demand. The
Government has decided, therefore, to study, design and implement a
rational system of charges for airport and other civil aviation services
thereby reducing the current level of Government support. This work will
be undertaken as part of the development of LIA study (para. 1.43 and Annex
8) and activities and target dates are included in the Action Plan (Annex
2). During negotiations the terms of reference for the LIA feasibility
study and design were discussed and agreed (para. 4.02(d)).
Cyprus Airways
1.46     Cyprus Airways Ltd. is the national carrier.  The Government is
the largest shareholder with 692 but policy is to encourage increased
private shareholding. The company operates a fleet of 3 Airbus 310's, 3
Boeing 707's and 3 BAC 111's but it is proposed to invest in new aircraft
consisting of 4 Airbus A320's during the period 1988-91 which will permit
the phasing out of the 707's and 111's. In 1985 Cyprus Airways operated
with an average load factor of 71.32 compared with the industry average of
64.3X. After deducting depreciation and interest on loans a loss of



- 18 -
C£983,OOO (US$ 1.96 million) was incurred. However, the 1986 accounts are
expected to show a CE3 million profit after depreciation and interest and
this represents a rate of return on assets of about 32.
G. Previous Bank Experience in the Sector
1.47     Begimning in 1973, the Bank has participated in six projects in
the transport sector - four in highways and two in ports. Highway project
components have ranged from new construction and rural road rehabilitation
to the development of road maintenance systems. With the loss of Famugusta
in 1974, port investment has been concentrated on developing Larnaca and
particularly Limassol ports to serve national requirements and also as
foreign exchange earners by promoting transhipment traffic.
1.48     There have been some project implementation delays and the start
of both the Third and Fourth Highway Projects were delayed by Government
procurement procedures. The Closing Date of the Third Highway Project has
been extended by one year to mid-1988. Although, 75-80% of the
construction work will be completed by that time, some remaining ongoing
works may require a further Closing Date extension. The start-up of the
Fourth Highway Project was also delayed but is now well underway and on a
revised schedule for completion within the project period. The
Inter-Ministerial Committee on Procurement has been recently set up to
address the procurement procedure issues (para. 2.27).
1.49     Notwithstanding some implementation delays, the projects have been
successful not only with their physical achievements but also in
institution building and improved planning. Although, due to institutional
difficulties, certain aspects of the Second Port Project were not fully
achieved, these are now being tackled under this proposed project (para.
1.38). In particular, the Government has: adopted rigorous and technical
project evaluation; recognized the need for adequate road maintenance and
its funding and is adopting a state of the art maintenance management
system; taken steps to carry out a Transport Sector Master Plan including a
review of road user charges; taken steps to improve port operations and
initiate a revision of port tariffs. The proposed project will provide a
means of continuing the Government's policy dialogue with the Bank,
enhancing the quality of policy decisions and further increase the
efficiency of the transport sector.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
2.01     Cyprus' transport industry has been keeping pace with the
community's needs in the difficult period since the events of 1974.
However, as the economy has grown the infrastructure in all transport
sub-sectors has come under increasing strain. Furthermore it has become
clear that operating techniques are falling behind the times and there is a
growing need in some areas to strengthen cost recovery measures, and for
integrated sector planning. Consequently, the proposed project has as its
objectives:



- 19 -
(a) increased efficiency in transport sector operating systems;
(b) improving cost recovery in revenue earning transport sector
operations;
(c) improving the quality of transport planning and project
implementation;
(4) upgrading priority areas of the transport infrastructure; and
(e) increasing the extent and improving the quality of training
provided for staff in the roads, road transport and civil
aviation subsectors.
B. Description
2.02     The proposed project would encompass the Cyprus 1988-91 Transport
Development Plan in the Highways, Road Transport, Civil Aviation (excluding
Cyprus Airways Ltd) and Ports sub-sectors, excluding those elements
amounting to about US$ 56 million for which financing is already being
provided under the ongoing Third and Fourth Highway Projects. The
Development Plan has been reviewed during project preparation and shown to
be appropriate to Cyprus' needs and resources and will be implemented in
concert with a program of transport sector institutional and policy reforms
which would include:
(a) restructuring the operations of Limassol port to improve
efficiency and international competitiveness and to increase
private sector participation;
(b) revision of port tariff structure to make it more responsive
to modern shipping technologies and needs;
(c) changes in airport and civil aviation charges so that the
civil aviation sub-sector will strengthen its financial
position and move towards a self-financing capability;
(d) continued strengthening of highway maintenance procedures;
(e) establishment of a central transport sector planning and
project monitoring unit in the MCW to integrate sector wide
planning and project implemantation; and
(f) improving MCW decision taking procedures especially in so far
as they affect the procurement of goods and services.
2.03     The project components are described in the following paragraphs.
Only those components starting in 1988 are precisely defined. Subsequent
years' components will be selected from the Development Program agreed
anvually by the Bank and the MCW following component evaluation according
to Guidelines for Project Evaluation which are detailed in Annex 10. These
guidelines follow the practice established under the Third Highway Project



- 20 -
- components should have a minimum ERR of 121 and should not be implemented
before the first year rate of return is at least 101. During negotiations
the following was discussed and agreed: (a) the Guidelines for Project
Evaluation; (b) that by July 31 of each year the list of highway components
proposed for Bank financing to commence the following year would be
furmished to the Bank for review and approval; and (c) that this list would
meet the criteria set out in the Guidelines (paras. 4.02(e) and (f)).
Highway Sub-Sector
2.04     The comprehensive four-year program includes road construction,
rohabilitation, a new materials testing laboratory, technical assistance
and training. The following will commence in the program's first year:
(a) Cornstruction of the 23 km Dhekelia-Aridhipou--LIA road which
bypasses the developed tourist and industrial areas in the
Larnaca municipal area and diverts heavy airport traffic away
from the centre of Larnaca (Map IBRD 19932). The road has
been designed as a two lane road, however, it is anticipated
that a second two lanes will be required within ten years
and, hence, land acquisition will allow for this based an
preliminary designs for a four lane road prepared during the
feasibility study. The road is functionally related to the
Nicosia-Larnaca road, to be constructed under the Fourth
Highway Project with Kuwait Fund financing (Annex 5).
(b) Broadening and strengthening of the Nicosia Higher Technical
Institute's (NHI) training program for higher level
technician civil engineers to include (i) bituminous mix
design and use; (ii) principles of traffic engineering and
traffic surveying; (iii) contract management and supervision;
and (iv) pavement management systems in accordance with the
Manpower Development Plan given in Annex 6. The proposed
project includes technical assistance to supplement the
existing teaching staff, equipment and a bituminous materials
teaching laboratory and classroom. During negotiations
Government confirmed the proposed training program including
the assignment appointment of staff to the Nicosia Higher
Technical Institute by June 30, 1988 (para. 4.01(e)). The
training activities and their target dates are included in
the Action Plan (Annex 2).
(c) Technical assistance and training for the Ministry of
Communications and Works which, in addition to some in-house
and on the job training focuses on the operation of a
Transport Sector Planning and Project Monitoring Unit (para.
1.08). (i) reorganization of the vehicle licensing system
(Annex 11); (ii) advice to the rural bus industry (para.
1.32); and (iii) special consultancy services including
assistance in construction supervision (Annex 11); and
(d) Construction of buildings for a new central materials
laboratory and procurement of testing equipment (Annex 1 B9).



- 21 -
2.05     Work commencing in the remaining three years of the four year
highway sub-sector program will comprise:
(a) construction and improvement of about 150 kms of the PWD
administered road system (US$33.9 million);
(b) pavement strengthening of about 150 kms of the PWD
administered road system (US$ 11.5 million); and
(c) small projects and equipment procurement (including equipment
for highway management) comprising about US$ 4.7 million.
Road Transport Sub-Sector
2.06     The components of the program to rationalize rural bus services
are: (a) the buying-out of existing operators who do not wish to join the
new larger companies; (b) procurement of modern buses by the new companies;
and (c) technical assistance through the Road Transport Department of MCW
(para. 2.04(c) and Annex 11).
Civil Aviation Sub-Sector
2.07     A feasibility study will be undertaken by consultants to update
the 1977 master plan (para 1.43) and to analyse alternative improvement
schemes and carry out design leading to construction of a new terminal and
administrative buildings and associated works, and to make recommendations
on cost recovery measures (para. 1.45). In addition the project will
include training in airport management and operations which will take the
form of overseas fellowships for specialist positions and 'ocal training
courses for junior and manual staff (Annex 6). The project also includes
12 man-months of expert services for the counterpart training of a training
officer for civil aviation personnel. The training activities and their
target dates are included in the Action Plan (Annex 2).
Ports Sub-Sector
2.08     The project includes the procurement of 2-3 rubber tyred gantry
cranes, supplementary equipment, civil works, a tug-boat for Limassol port,
and civil works for some repaving and breakwater works. In addition
technical assistance will be provided to advise on management and
operations. The Bank will continue its dialogue with CPA to help in
improving operations and, through the Transport Sector Master Plan Study
(Loan 2684-CY), to assist in developing a medium term investment program.
2.09     During negotiations, the project objectives and description were
discussed and confirmed with the Government (para. 4.01 (a)).

C. Engineering nd Component Preparation
2.10     Highways.  The study and preliminary design of the
Dhekelia-Aridhippou-LIA road was carried out by - 'nsultants with
participation of PWD under the Third Highway Project in accordance with
design standards (Annex 14) which are satisfactory. PWD have since
substantially completed the final design.  Other highway components,
depending on size and complexity, will be studied and designed by PWD
during project implementation and will be reviewed by the Bsnk.
2.11     Civil Aviation.  The feasibility study and design and preparation
of bidding documents for the improvements to Larnaca International Airport
will be carried out by international consultants working within the
framework of an updated Master Plan. Other smaller works will be desigi.ed
either by the PWD Architectural Department or, for civil works, the PWD
working on behalf of the Civil Aviation Department.
2.12     Ports.  No large civil works are envisaged under the proposed
project; the paving work in the container terminal at Limassol port will be
designed by local consultants on behalf of the CPA. Specifications for
major items of equipment have been prepared by the CPA with, in the case of
rubber-tyred gantry cranes, assistance from consultants.
2.13     Road Transport.  The operating characteristics for new buses were
prepared jointly by the new operating companies and the consultants who
carried out the basic study under the Third Highway Project. These are
based upon Cyprus' operating conditions and experience locally with
different types of vehicle and are considered a satisfactory basis for
guiding procurement.
D. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
2.14     The project 1' base cost has been estimated at US$ 104.7 million
of which US$ 60.5 million is foreign exchange; physical and price
contingencies raise these figures to US$121.0 million and US$69.0 million
respectively. The breakdown of these costs is given in Table 4.1.
2.15     Project cost estimates are based on November 1987 price levels.
Civil works and building construction cost estimates are based on estimates
from final engineering design and on unit rates derived from curi nt
construction contracts and from cost factor inputs regarding periodic
maintenance. Equipment costs, including buses, are based on recent
procurement and, in the case of ports equipment, supplemented by special
studies. Technical assistance costs are based on man month rates in
recently awarded contracts for similar work.

2.16      The foreign exchange component of road construction, improvement
and rehabilitation is estimated to be about 452 if executed by a local or
locally based contractor as, considering past experience, this is likely to
be the case. The foreign exchange component for pavement strengthening is
estimated at 552 in view of the higher bitumen content. Building costs are
estimated to have a foreign exchange component of 70S in the case of
buildings such as the materials laboratory with a high content of special
features. Equipment is estimated to have a foreign exchange component of
902 and technical assistance 80X.
2.17      During negotiations, the cost estimates were confirmed with the
Government (pdra. 4.01b).
Financing
2.18      The borrower would be the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
The proposed Bank loan would finance about 502 of the foreign exchange
component or 30S of the total cost. The proposed financing program is
shown in the following table:

At negotiations the Government confirmed that satisfactory arrangements
have been made regarding the provision of sufficient funds by or through
Government to meet the balance of foreign exchange and local costs not
covered by the Bank loan (para 4.01c). The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development has indicated its intention to assist in financing LIA
development.
E. Procurement
Bank-Financed Components
2.19     The two contracts for construction of the Dhekelia-Aridhippou-LIA
road amounting to US$18.1 m would be awarded after International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Construction or improvement of the 150 km of other roads to be included in
the program (estimated at US$33.9 m) would also be undertaken under ICB
with the exception of individual contracts up to $1.0 m and in aggregate
cost exceeding US$5.0 m which would be awarded under Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB). Hence ICB construction contracts would total about
US$47.0 m (financed by US$21.4 m or 602 of the Bank loan). The works would
be geographically grouped in lots to make the contracts attractive to
larger contractors.  Contractors wi1l be prequalified to undertake either
single or several lots.
2.20     The pavement strengthening works amounting to US$11.5 m are
scattered throughout the country, are individually small contracts, and
thus would be most efficiently procured through LCB procedures which permit
foreign contractors to participate and which are satisfactory to the Bank.
2.21     Highway management equipment amounting to about US$900,000 would
be procured through ICB. However, due to its specialized nature,
procurement of equipment for the Central Materials Laboratory, and the
Nicosia Higher Technical Institution totalling $400,000 would be through
international shopping with individual items not exceeding $75,000, up to
an aggregate amount of US$400,000.
2.22     Technical assistance for the various project items would be
provided by qualified consulting firms or individuals as appropriate,
engaged in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.
2.23     All procurement documentation will be reviewed by the Bank before
being issued. However, for pavement strengthening works, this will be
confined to a review of standard bidding documents and of the procurement
programs. All proposed contract awards above $500,000 will be subject to
prior review. Prior review of contracts will cover about 80% of the total
value of works financed under the project. The following table gives a
breakdown of the proposed project by procurement method.

Non-Bank Financed Components
2.24    Non-Bank financed items would be procured either through local
government procedures which permit foreign contractors to bid or will
follow private commercial practice. Buses will be procured by the bus
companies themselves through suppliers credits or direct purchase. The
airport terminal building will be procured through Government international
competitive bidding or, as is possible, following a cofinancier's
procurement regulations. CPA and the new port operating company will
procure two (with an option on a third) rubber tyred gantries, straddle
carriers, mobile cranes and support equipment through suppliers credits.
2.25     During negotiations, the procurement arrangements were discussed
and agreed with Government (para. 4.02(g)). In particular, for Government
and public authority procurement, public bid opening would take place for
contracts above $50,000 and award will be made to the lowest evaluateca
bidder without negotiation of prices was confirmed.
F. Prolect Implementation
2.26     The special project coordinating unit located in the PWD Roads
Department set up originally under the Third Highway Project will continue
to be responsible for highway sector project components. Similar units
will be established in the Road Transport Department to control the rural
bus service component, the Civil Aviation Department to manage the civil
aviation component and in Cyprus Ports Authority to supervise the ports
component. As appropriate these units will call upon the services of other
concerned agencies. Overall coordination of activities will be the
responsibility of the Director General of the MCW working through the level
of the MCW Planning and Project Monitoring Unit led by an already appointed
project coordinator. All these units will submit quarterly progress
reports with a covering report from the Project Planning and Monitoring
Unit starting June 30, 1988 (Annex 12).
2.27     In Cyprus, the process for all types of procurement is lengthy and
beset by bureaucratic procedures leading to additional costs through
delayed project implementation and unnecessary use of staff time; the
uncertainty also makes planning difficult. Coiisequently, following
discussions with the relevant authorities and an exploratory review of the
procedures by a Bank consultant an Inter-Ministerial Committee on
Procurement has been established under the Accountant General, that a
Working Party on Procurement shall be formed to analyse the situation and
make recommendations. Target dates for these activities are included in
the Action Plan (Annex 2).
Highway Sub-Sector
2.28     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 13.  In the
case of the Dhekelia-Aridhipou - LIA road construction, final engineering,
preparation of bid documents and acquisition of right of way are well



- 28 -
advanced. Construction will start in fourth quarter 1988 with a total
construction time of 30 months allowed for completion by early 1991. PWD
will be responsible for construction supervision advised by consultants.
During negotiations the supervision arrang.ments for the
Dhekelia-Aridhippou-LIA road were discussed and agreed with the Government
(pars. 4.02(h)).
2.29     The remaining highway works covering construction, rehabilitation
and strengthening will be the subject of annual work plans, selected from
the total program, submitted to the Bank in June of each year for approval
and prepared according to methodology and criteria (Annex 10) agreed by the
Bank (para 2.03).
2.30     Outline terms of reference for technical assistance to the MCW
(Annex 11) covering (i) the Transport Sector Planning and Monitoring Unit;
(ii) in-house trainiig and course development of Nicosia Higher Technical
Institute;(iii) Road Transport Department; and (iv) specialized consulting
services have been prepared. The timing of the appointment of Cypriot and
foreign experts is covered in the Action Plan (Annex 2).  The component is
continuous and there is no completion date although technical assistance
experts will be expected to complete their assignments within three years
of their appointment. During negotiations, outline terms of reference for
technical assistance to the MCW (Annex 11) were reviewed and agreed (para.
4.02(i)).
2.31     Preliminary designs for the new materials laboratory have been
prepared and equipment specifications and staffing have been discussed and
agreed (Annex 1, Item B9).  The first stage of the new laboratory together
with equipment and staff is scheduled to be operational early in 1990.
Rural Bus Companies and MCW Road Transport Department
2.32     The formation of new rural bus companies, including buying out
existing owner operators and re-equipping companies with new buses, will be
a phased process extending beyond the duration of the proposed project.
The pilot company has already been formed in the Nicosia region.
2.33     The terms of reference for technical assistance to the Road
Transport Department (RTD) of the MCW, which, inter alia, inc >d  -rovision
of advice to the new rural bus companies have been prepared (Annex 11).
The Cypriot counterpart staff will be designated by March 31, 1988, and the
technical assistance advisor has been appointed. Procurement of specialist
equipment for the RTD will take place after preparation of specifications
by the RTD with the help of the technical assistance advisor. Target dates
for rural bus company formation and technical assistance are included in
the Action Plan (Annex 2).
Civil Aviation Sub-Sector
2.34     Feasibility studies and design work for constructing and equipping
a new terminal building at LIA and design of a revised airport charging
system will commence in Jwue 1988.



- 29 -
2.35     After six months for bidding and contract award, implementation of
LIA improvement construction works is scheduled to commence in mid 1990
with a three year construction period.
Ports Sub-Sector
2.36     The procurement of two (with an option on a third) rubber tyred
gantries for container handling and additional straddle carriers and
support equipment will be undertaken by CPA on behalf of the new operating
company. However, delivery of the equipment is expected to take up to 12
months thus it is important that specifications are agreed and invitations
to bid and financing is arranged as soon as possible - with the target date
for this activity being April 1988. The target dates for these activities
is contained in the Action Plan (Annex 2).
2.37     The procurement of other equipment, including mobile cranes,
tugboats (or modifying existing vessels) and technical assistance to advise
on management systems, port operation and pollution control and to
undertake training activities will take place throughout the course of the
project. However, as some of the technical assistance will be related to
the operation of new container handling technology the exact timing of the
assistance will have to be phased with the formation of the new company and
procurement of equipment.
General
2.38     The project is expected to be effective in June 1988 and execution
of the Bank financed components would be completed by mid-1994, a total of
about 6 years. The loan closing date is scheduled for December 31, 1994,
about seven years from Board presentation. The project implementation
schedule and reporting requirements are given in Annex 13. During
negotiations, the project implementation and reporting schedule were
discussed and confirmed (para 4.01d).
G. Disbursements
2.39     With the exception of contracts valued at US$500,000 or less, all
withdrawal applications will be fully documented. Disbursements against
contracts valued at US$500,000 or less would be made on the basis of
statements of expenditure (80). Documentation to support expenditures
financed under SOE would be maintained by the MCW and made available for
review by IBRD representatives upon request in addition to being audited by
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The disbursements are as follows:

TOTAL             35,000,000
2.40     The disbursement schedule (Annex 15) has been developed from the
general implementation schedule (Annex 13). However, only estimated
disbursements for: (i) Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA Road; (ii) technical
assistance; and (iii) training can be considered reasonably firm. The
disbursements against other highway works and the central materials
laboratory, for which annual programs will be agreed, are only indicative,
but ample time has been allowed for completion of the last year's (1991)
program.
2.41     The forecast schedule of complete disbursement within seven years
has been compared with historical experience and is considered realistic.
An examination of other Bank transport projects in Cyprus confirms that
these projects have disbursed more quickly than indicated by the regional
profile. The Third Highway Project is likely to be fully disbursed in less
than seven years. During negotiations disbursement arrangements were
discussed and agreed with Government (para. 4.02(j)).
2.42     A revolving fund for US$2,000,000 corresponding to an average of
four months of expenditure of the Loan would be established by opening a
special account. The special account will be maintained with the Central
Bank of Cyprus for eligible expenditures under the Loan Agreement, in
accordance with IBRD procedures. During negotiations the special account
arrangements were discussed and agreed with Government (4.02(k)).



- 31 -
H. Accounting and Audit
2.43     The system of accounting, financial contr.l and audit is well
established and competently operated in Cyprus. ,he Auditor General is
responsible for the management and supervision of all accounting operations
in Government, and for the receipt and disbursement of revenues, and he has
appropriate powers to delegate his powers and duties. The Auditor General
is entirely independent of Government and outside the civil service,
reporting only to the President. The accounting and audit procedures have
been reviewed and they are acceptable to the Bank for the purposes of
keeping and auditing project accounts. Assurances were obtained from
Goverment during negotiations that separate accounts will be kept for all
project components. In addition an annual statement of project
expenditures including the operation of the Special Account, duly audited,
will be furnished to the Bank not later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year. During negotiations these arrangements were discussed
and agreed with Government (para 4.02(1)).
I. Environmental Considerations
2.44     Road improvement works in Cyprus have generally led to
environmental improvements through, for example, directing traffic away
from the center of towns and villages. However, special attention is now
being paid, commencing with the environmental impact study included in the
Tillyria Access Road Study financed under the Third Highway Project, to the
need to study more carefully environmental factors including protection of
fragile ecosystems, preservation of antiquities and the proper planning of
secondary development. In parallel with the proposed project and at the
Government's request, the Bank, with consultant trust funds, will employ a
consulting firm to conduct an environmental impact study of road and port
development - including the proposed project component - and submit
recommendations to the Government and Bank on what measures should be taken
to conserve and improve the environment affected by road and port
construction and operations. The recommendations will also include actions
to be taken prior to and during project preparation and specific criteria
to assess the environmental impact of a proposed project. After agreement
between the Government and the Bank, recommendations will become operating
procedures which will be incorporated in the regulations of the MCW, its
Department and the CPA. The activity is included in the Action Plan
(Annex 2). The LIA feasibility study terms of reference include specific
tasks to be undertaken by the consultants in relation to the environment
affected by the new terminal building. In addition, MCW standard
conditions of contract for civil works construction include specific
clauses concerning the preservation of antiquities.
III. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Background
3.01     Cyprus' record of economic performance with high growth, low
unemployment, limited inflation and a healthy external balance was only



- 32 -
temporarily affected by the events of 1974 and the world wide economic
problems steming from the major oil price shocks. This record has been
the result of careful economic management on the part of the authorities
and an enthusiastic and hardworking private sector.
3.02     In the past two years, particularly owing to reduced investment in
the Middle East following the decline in oil prices, economic activity has
slowed down with the GDP growth falling to 3.71 p.a. compared with 6.0% in
1978-84 and unemployment has increased from 2.52 in 1981 to about 3.41 in
1986. Although there has been a continued strong growth in tourism and
exports of other services, including transport, this has been insufficient
to match the decline in the export of goods and consequently the current
account remains in deficit (7.1% of GDP in 1985). Whilst this deficit has
been more than covered by inflows of private investment and public
borrowing this has naturally led to a rise in external debt from 251 of GDP
in 1981 to 351 (US$923 million) of GDP in 1985. Preliminary data indicate
that starting in 1986 the external balance is again improving. For some
time a major danger to economic performance was a growing budget deficit
resulting from high recurrent expenditures and low levels of revenue
collection. Government is at last achieving some success in addressing
this issue and the tax revenue/GDP ratio has increased from 15% in 1980 to
221 in 1985. There is swill a need to reduce the budget deficit further
and this is receiving careful attention from Government especially through
control of the amount of the recurrent budget allocated to the support of
the civil service, the numbers of which have now been frozen.
3.03     The Government's development strategy, which is supported by the
Bank, is to continue the encouragement of the private sector, especially in
foreign currency earning areas of trade, tourism and services, through the
provision of the necessary infrastructure and by 'Limiting bureaucratic
procedures. At the same time both recurrent and capital expenditures will
be carefully assessed to ascertain that they are pertinent to the
development strategy and in keeping with resources. Where feasible, the
revenue earning capability of state or quasi-state run operations will be
realized in order to reduce demand on the official budget and to stimulate
cost effective operations.
B. The 1988-91 Development Program
3.04     It is against this economic background, and taking account of
Government economic management strategy that the 1988-91 transport sector
development program has been evolved.    Apart from those major components
scheduled to be implemented starting in 1988 (para. 2.04) and amounting to
about 201 of the program, there is little up-to-date evaluation
documentation. For this reason, the effective functioning of the proposed
Transport Sector Planning and Project Monitoring Unit of the MCW is an
institutional issue of paramount importance and is being addressed
vigorously under the proposed project. During appraisal the preliminary
evaluations of the program were discussed with the executive and planning
agencies and, in principle, the program was found to be pertinent to
current and predicted transport demand, taking account of the present
condition of the infrastructure and services, dnd to be within the
transport agencies' absorptive capacity.



- 33 -
3.05     During 1987/88 earlier studies of Limassol-Paphos road and
Nicosia-Astromeritis road, which indicated rates of return of 322 and 842
respectively, will be updated and the Tillyria Access Road Study and LIA
Improvement Study will be completed. The viability of these potential
components, amounting to about 402 of the total project, will be studied as
part of the joint Cyprus Government/Bank review process (para. 2.03)
starting in 1988. The program, which will be reviewed annually by the Bank
and the Bank's views taken into account in making modifications amounts to
about 22S of the total public sector investment program during the same
period. This is similar to the share of the transport seztor during the
1982-86 plan and is considered to be within the financial and institutional
constraints of the economy. Moreover, most of the proposed investment in
the Road Transport and Ports sub-sectors, comprising about 132 of the
total, will probably be financed by the private sector or from the CPA
internal sources and, thus, will not represent a demand on public funds.
Purthermore, the core of the program consists of only a small number of
projects and there is scope for adjustment in the light of changing
economic circumstances.
Highway Sub-Sector
3.06     In the highway sub-sector only the major component, the
Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road, comprising about 302 of the roads program, has
been subjected to a detailed feasibility study and design (Annex 1 (B1) and
Annex 5). However, other road projects have been identified according to
condition assessment and traffic volumes and will be subjected to detailed
evaluation before inclusion in the firm work program. In the case of
periodic maintenance the program will be prepared according to the highway
maintenance management system introduced under the Third Highway Project
(Annex lB2).
3.07     The primary beneficiaries of the Dhekelia-Aridhippou-LIA road will
be (i) the road users, including commercial traffic between Larnaca,
important agricultural and tourist areas and the rest of Cyprus, and LIA
users especially tourists; (ii) villages on the present road which will be
spared the noise pollution and accident risks that exist at present; and
(iii) the Government which will save the heavy maintenance expenditures
required to preserve the operating standard of the existing weak pavement.
The project is estimated to yield a rate of return over a 15 year analysis
period of about 411. A summary of the feasibility study is given in
Annex 5. Assuming the other components of the Highway sub-sector program,
which will primarily consist of road improvement and strengthening schemes,
only meet the minimum rate of return of 12X, which is very conservative,
the sub-sector overall rate of return will still remain at about 221.
3.08     No economic evaluation has been undertaken for the improvements to
the materials laboratory, training program or technical assistance
amounting to about 41 of the Highway Sector Programme. However, they are
considered to be essential inputs to the development of an effective
highway planning and management system and fully justified.



- 34 -
Road Traneport Sub-Sector
3.09     While urban passenger transport services and links between the
main cities are generally of a good standard in Cyprus, a recent study
(Annex 1 (84)) financed under Loan 2128-CY has shown that public transport
in rural areas is deteriorating.  This deterioration is marked by the
decline in the level of service offered by the traditional village buses.
It is feared that this will lead to a falling off in the quality of rural
life and a shift of the population to the alreaiy strained urban areas
creating growing demands on government and municipal services and a decline
in the important agricultural industry. Consequently, based on the study's
recommendations, it has been decided to replace progressively the old and
rather ineffficient village bus services with new regional bus companies
with modern equipment. No economic analysis has been carried out to
support this program but financial viability is a key factor in company
planning and profit will be a main criterion in formation and opsration of
these new private companies who will be responsible for servicing financial
support. Financial viability will be a condition for company formation and
equipment procurement: The first regional company is already being formed
in the Nicosia region. As part of its annual review of the sector, the
Bank will monitor the program of rationalization in relation to company
financial performance and service levels and advise the Government
accordingly.
Civil Aviation Sub-Sector
3.10     The main investment proposed in the civil aviation sub-sector is
the construction of a new terminal building, other supporting
infrastructure works and improvement of existing buildings at Larnaca
International Airport. This will be undertaken within the framework of the
updated 1978 Master Plan. At present the cost estimates are based on only
a preliminary study carried out in 1985, but a detailed feasibility study
will be completed by early 1989 and this will be supervised and reviewed by
the Bank under the proposed project and the Bank's views will be taken into
account in the subsequent stages of design and construction. Preliminary
reviews by the Bank, however, indicate that the investment is not only
operationally necessary but that it would be economically justified and,
given a revised charging policy, could be financially viable. In this
context the Government has agreed to undertake, as part of the feasibility
study, an analysis of costs and airport charges in order to strengthen the
civil aviation sub-sector's financial position and to consider the option
of Larnaca airport operating as an independent agency.
Ports Sub-Sector
3.11     The major investment proposed for the ports sub-sector is the
rehabilitation of the Limassol container terminal infrastructure and the
procurement of new container handling equipment which amounts to about
US$5.5 million. This development was originally proposed under the Second
Port Project but was not implemented due to institutional problems relating
to port operation and to doubts as to whether traffic would grow fast
enough to warrant the procurement of high capacity equipment. The current



- 35 -
situation as regards the volume of container traffic and the competitive
nature of eastern Mediterranean transit traffic clearly indicates the need
for modern equipment and the institutional problems are on their way to
being resolved (Annex 2). The economic and financial analysis shows an
expected rate of return of about 352 for this particular investment.
3.12     No cost benefit analysis has yet been undertaken for the
procurement of a new tug or upgrading existing vessels but the CPA has
confirmed that a feasibility study and performance analysis will be
undertaken prior to the preparation of specifications and calling for bids.
Overall Rate of Return
3.13     Those investment components commencing in 1988: (i) the
Dhekelia-Aridhipou-LIA road; (ii) construction of a new materials
laboratory; (iii) the procurement of rubber-tyred gantries for Limassol
port; and (iv) new equipment for the regional bus companies, amount to
nearly 25S of total project cost. The overall rate of return on these is
estimated at 40%. Should the reminder of the proposed program, consisting
mainly of highway works, meet only the minimum test rate of return of 121
the project's overall rate of return would be 181. However, based on
recent experience in the highway sector and the results of preliminary
feasibility studies for the Limassol-Paphos and Nicosia Astromeritis roads
it is estimated that the overall rate of return will be in excess of 30%.
C. Project Risk
3.14     The proposed project is not subject to any unusual risks and is
based upon a program of works already agreed in principle between the Bank
and the Government. The first year's program of major works has been
tested against a 201 increase in costs and excluding benefits from
reductions in road accidents and remains viable. On the institutional side
there are other principal areas of risk that may affect project performance:
Port Institutional Reforms. Institutional reform, especially
relating to container operations at Limassol port, involving the private
sector and CPA, has always been a thorny issue and it must be accepted that
considerable problems may yet lie ahead. However, preparation work,
involving detailed and lengthy discussions among the parties directly
involved and with the Bank, aimed at building up a spirit of trust and
cooperation and unbiased evaluation of the financial implications of
different strategies have begun and agreement in principle has been
reached. Thus although delays may still occur, and this could postpone
procurement of equipment and hence loss of benefits, it is expected that
the reforms will be in place by the end of 1988.
Procurement Delays. Due to the complex procedure with its many
checks and counterchecks procurement can be very slow lesding, on
occasions, to severe delays in project execution and postponment of
benefits. However, Government is aware of this problem and, with
assistance from, the Bank, it is to be addressed under both the ongoing
Fourth Highway Project and the proposed project (Annex 2). Furthermore,
based on Bank experience in Cyprus the project implementation schedule has
allowed for long lead times.

TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Dhekelia-Aradhippou-Larnaca
International Airport Link
Summary of Feasibility Study
INTRODUCTION
In their Final Report on the "Improvement of Road Connections
between Larnaca and the New Nicosia-Limassol Highway" submitted in December
1985 by the consultants, consideration was given to the construction of a
Larnaca By-pass and a link to the International Airport.
Because of the restraints imposed by recent urban and suburban
development and the location of housing for people displaced following the
Turkish intervention, two alignments were considered for the by-pass.
(a) Corridor 4 from a junction near Kalokhorio to the
Dhali-Lprnaca road north of Aradhippou and to Dhekelia.
(b) Corridor 5 from the same proposed junction at Kalokhorio to
the Dhali-Larnaca road south of Aradhippou and to Dhekelia.
To divert airport traffic from the central area of Larnaca a road
Link, Corridor 6, was considered from the Kalokhorio junction to the
airport via Meneou.
DESCRIPTION
The selection of alternative corridors for by-passing Larnaca and
providing a road link is constrained by the:
(a) need to avoid infringement of the Salt Lake;
(b) mosque on the western lake shore;
(c) area needed for the airport extension;
(d) urban extension of Larnaca and the villages of Aradhippou and
Levadhia;
(e) refugee settlements;
(f) town plans already in advanced stages of discussion; and
(g) good agricultural land which is at a premium in the area.
Forecast daily traffic flows for the year 2005, excluding some 102
expected to be generated by the improved roads, were for the:

20,700        cars                       22,000
9,500        LCV's                       5,000
4,700        HCV's                       2,400

36,400                                   30,000
The terrain through which the roads pass is flat/rolling made up
mainly of alluvias/terrace deposits. The soils are calcarous, sandy
gravely with some clay and silt mixed with layers of chialk and marls.
Significant rock cutting would be required near Aradhippou but for the rest
of the roads only soft cutting would be necessary. For drainage only one
bridge, some box culverts and pipes would be required but a number of
openings are required to allow farm vehicles and pass under the road.
Revised November 1987 construction costs show no significant
change from the feasibility study and remain at a base cost of US$16
million with a US$7.3 million foreign exchange component. The proposed
project will be bid in two contracts ( Dhekelia-Aradhippou and Aradhippou -
Larnaca International Airport.) but with the option for a contractor to
provide one bid covering both sections.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Corridor 4 by-pass was recommended. A 7 metre road width was
decided upon.  This showed a higher estimated economic internal rate of
return than the southern Corridor 5 and than the 4-lane dual highway
alternative.  At a discount rate of 102 however the 4-lane dual highway
showed a greater net preient value. However, the study recommended that as
a dual carriageway will be required within 10 years the right of way
required for this should be acquired immediately.
The Corridor 4 northern by-pass is more in keeping with the
improvement of the Dhali route from the new Nicosia-Limassol road to
Larnaca, lessens environmental impact on the area, uses less ag-icultural
land and causes less inhibition on the spread of villages and the planned
urban area.
The by-pass could be part of the long term, road strategy forming
part of a main route between Limassol and the west and the east including
Famagusta should a settlement be achieved.
On the basis of vehicle operating cost savings alone, the combined
ER of the Northern bypass and the Airport link is 411. If time savings and
accident costs are included the ER increases to 782.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Manpower Develo ment
A. Ministry of Communications and Works (PWD
Staffing
1.       The PWD is staffed as follows:
Engineers of graduate qualifications            65
Architects and Surveyors                        10
Technicians (including NHI graduates)          252
Clerical and other Administrative staff        115
Manual workers (not civil servants)          1,122
Training Needs
2.   (i)      Engineers:  There is a clear need to update and upgrade the
capabilities of engineers and this should be done in such a
way as to achieve common standards and approaches. The
training should focus on civil works supervision, road
maintenance, bituminous mixes and works, modern design and
survey methods, project evaluation and contract management
and be soundly based on practical operations. For some
senior engineers management training and personnel management
are necessary. Also, to assist in the training of
subordinate staff, at least some key engineers should receive
instruction on training methods. Professional surveyors
should also receive specialized training.
(ii)     Technicians, Foremen. etc:  there is a wide range of
standards in this group although with an increasing
proportion possessing an NHI diploma. Nonetheless most
require additional training and upgrading with site
supervision being a core subject together with specialization
in selected fields especially maintenance planning and
control, bituminous materials and project evaluation and
traffic survey and analysis. Again some on the job training
should be given.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 4
(iii)    Clerical and Other Administrative Staff:  These staff require
refresher courses upgrading in office management and
accounting, data and information systems and modern office
technology.
(iv)     Manual Workers:  No formalized training is envisaged for
manual workers but as far as possible groups of workers
should be kept together in order that on the job team working
may be developed. It may, however, be necessary to provide
training to some manual workers in special maintenance
operations such as patching and pothole repair.
Training Organization and Courses
3.       It is important that a Training Officer post be established as
soon as possible and an officer designated to fill it. This officer should
then participate in a training management course in both general principles
and PWD specific needs. Initially, it is recommended that the Training
Officer (following training) should be assisted by a training specialist
for about six months to analyze training needs in detail and to prepare the
first training program.
4.       In the short to medium term, courses should be provided to cover:
i)    civil works supervision and contract management;
(ii)    road maintenance systems and techniques;
(iii)    materials testing and especially bitumivous mixes;
(iv)    procurement;
(v)    modern survey methods;
(vi)    computer applications in civil engineering and planning; and
(vii)    traffic engineering techniques including road safety.
5.       These courses will be provided through the Nicosia Higher
Technical Institute which will be strengthened under the proposed project.
The courses will probably extend over a 15-week period during the Autumn
and Winter for six hours per week: four hours per week will be devoted to
formal input (including practical work and laboratory work) and two hours
to seminars or tutorials. In addition, there should be about 90 hours of
site training. Two levels of training will be provided according to the
level of knowledge of the trainees.
6.       The estimated number of participants 1988-1992 are as follows:
1988    1989    1990    19s1    1992
Engineers                 50       53      59       49      43
Senior Technicians        15       12       8       10       8
Technicians              105      105      85       85      85
Foremen                   40       40      40       20      20

B.       Improvements Required at NHI
7.            Facilities and staffing at the NHI will have to be enhanced
to carry out this training program including a special bituminous materials
laboratory and instruction room amounting to about 150 m2, equipment and
technical assistance.
8.            The proposed project will provide 12 man months of specialist
(probably overseas expert) services and a special lectureship (Cypriot) in
pavement design, maintenance methods and bituminous materials for 48
months; in addition technical assistance for special subjects amounting to
12 man months.
9.            The project would also finance special overseas training of
the specialist lecturer in bituminous materials (four months) and other
short term overseas fellowships to supplement in-country training and for
the particular needs of middle and senior grade managing personnel (12
months).
10.           The cost of this program in US$ equivalent is estimated at,
Technical Assistance           30 man months at US$ 7,000    US$ 210,000
Fellowships                    12 man months at US$ 4,000    US$  48,000
Special Lecturer               48 man months at US$ 1,500    US$  72,000
Construction Works            150 M2 at US$ 800 m2            US$  45,000
Equipment and Materials                                       US$ 200,000
TOTAL                      US$ 575,000
C. Civil Aviation
11.      The training needs are in two main categories:
(i)    Specialist technical training which, in view of the expense
in operating special courses, it is more cost effective to
carry out through overseas fellowships which could include:
Air Traffic Facility Administration (2)                12 man months
Airport Management (2)                                 12  "    "
Accident Investigation                                  6  "    "
Air Traffic and Air Space Management Procedures        18  "    "
Aviation Economics and Regulation                       6  "     i
Licensing of Aircraft and Personnel                     6  "
Air Traffic Control Instruction (Area and Radar)       12  "     o
The estimated cost of such a programme would be,
Fellowship                   72 months at US$ 4,000  US$288,000
Equipment and Materials                               US$100,000
Total         US$388,000

(ii)    Airport staff training which would best be carried out in
Cyprus. However, as a first step, it would be necessary to
appoint a Training Officer who should receive overseas
training at an airport that operates a training scheme. It
is recommended that such a course should last for 6 months.
At the same time it is recommended that the consultants
appointed to undertake the feasibility study and design of
the new operations facilities at Larnaca International
Airport should define training needs in relation to the
airport design including staff job descriptions. The airport
staff training courses should cover, inter alia, aircraft
cleaners, equipment operators, maintenance personnel and
commercial staff. It is recommended that 12 man months
special technical assistance is provided to assist the
training officer in this programme which would operate on the
basis of two days per week, probably during November each
year, with adequate monitoring and follow-up. The estimated
cost is:
Training Officer training at US$4,000/man month   US$48,000
Specialist Technical Assistance assuming 8 months
expatriate and 4 months Cypriot.                 US$64,000
TOTAL        US$112_000

(1:200), project budget and implementation schedule.
(xvii)    Preliminary designs will be prepared only for work required
for the effective operation of the passenger terminal system
unless requested by the client. Plans for other facilities
such as cargo sheds or a separate control tower will be
developed only to the stage required for the master plan.
(xviii)    Determine the financial resources required for implementation
of the airport master plan.
(xix)    Prepare a comprehensive airport economic and financial
cost/revenue analysis to the year 2010 including a full cost
recovery program for the new investment and cost recovery on
the adjusted replacement value of the existing facilities,
the results of the analyses, which should provide both rate
of return and net present value calculations, should be
subjected to appropriate risk analysis and sensitivity tests;
(xx)    Prepare a benefit/cost analysis to the year 2010 which inter
alia addresses the overall benefits of the airport to the
Cyprus economy (e.g. support of the tourist industry.)
(xxi)    Compare the airport fee structure with those of other
international airports;
(xxii)    Recommend airport fee structure changes necessary to achieve
airport self-financing; and
(xxiii)    Identify other revenue generating opportunities.
(xxiv)    Produce an operational plan and a project implementation
schedule.

TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Previous Bank Experience in the Sector
1.01     The Bank has participated in six previous projects in the
transport sector. These were: First Highway Project (Loan 904-CY), Second
Highway Project (Loan 1344-CY), Third Highway Project (Loan 2128-CY), and
Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2684-CY) which are ongoing and expected to be
completed in June 1987 and June 1992 respectively and the First and Second
Port Projects (Loans 628-CY and 1540-CY). The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED) participated or is participating in parallel
co-financing in the Second, Third and Fourth Highway Projects. The First
Highway Project was amended to take account of the events of 1974 and, with
the exception of part of its studies component, was combined with the
Second Highway Project which included construction of the new
Nicosia-Limassol road and studies which assisted in the preparation of the
Third Highway Project and Second Port Project. A combined Project
Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared for the First and Second Highway
projects, and a PCR for the Second Port Project has also been completed.
The Third Highway Project has the following main objectives the improvement
of about 200 km of rural roads; strengthening the Nicosia-Limassol road;
studies of road maintenance needs and institutions, implementation of a
road maintenance management system; feasibility studies for improved road
links between Nicosia and Larnaca, Larnaca bypass and the Larnaca-Airport
link, the Limassol-Paphos road, traffic management needs in Limassol and
the rationalization of public passenger services. Although contractual
problems delayed the implementation of the Second Highway Project, all the
projects have met or are meeting both physical and institutional objectives.
1.02     Not only have the physical achievements of the projects been
successful, they have also served as a basis for a continuing policy
dialogue and institution building. In particular the Government has:
(a) recognized the advantages of undertaking rigorous technical
and economic evaluations of proposed projects. This is shown
in the routine application of feasibility studies to proposed
highway projects and recent expressions of intent to apply
economic and financial evaluation to ports and airport
projects. This will be developed under the Fourth Highway
project by moving to the next stage of integrating individual
projects into an overall policy oriented Transport Master
Plan and, under the proposed project, the establishment of a
Transport Sector Planning and Project Monitoring Department
in the MCW;

ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 2
(b) accepted the need to review road user charging policies and
implement appropriate legislation;
(c) taken action to establish a sound revenue base for financing
maintenance and development through commercial charging
policies at ports;
(d) adopted a policy of working towards instituting a pavement
management system that will not only lead to lower highway
reconstruction costs but also improve the cost effectiveness
of maintenance and reduce transport costs; and
(e) accepted the advantages of using International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in procuring a wide range of goods and services
and has also adopted more effective procurement evaluation
procedures which reduced the earlier numbers of contractual
delays and difficulties. The proposed project will continue
to support these developments.

Guidelines for Project Evaluation
A. Context of Transport Sector Project Evaluation
1.       Proposed projects of whatever size or location will be studied in
relation to Cyprus' economic and social needs and the availability of
financial, manpower and institutional resources. Thus in addition to
conventional economic justification using, for example, cost savings
special attention will be given to:
(a) the net contribution the project makes to foreign exchange
use or earnings;
(b) the relationship of the project to the macro-economic
conditions and objectives and the transport sector plan;
(c) the net effect on the official recurrent and investment
budgets;
(d) employment effects;
(e) impact upon the environment; and
(f) inter-modal implications.
Whilst some of these areas of interest may not lways be readily
quantifiable, they should be clearly described ind related to the proposed
investment.
B. General Criteria
2.       Indicators.  As far as possible the analysis of projects should
provide economic rates of return, first year returns and net present
values. Furthermore, in the case of revenue earning entities a financial
analysis should also be provided. In some cases when qualitative
considerations are of significant importance a multi-criteria evaluation
may be used. Alternative solutions should be tested using an incremental
cost benefit analysis.
Economic Rate of Return. A minimum acceptable economic rate of
return based on the opportunity cost of capital should be established
annually under the guidance of the Planning Bureau and currently 12% should
be used.

ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 3
Investment Horizons. The choice on time period to be used should
be based on a combination of the expected physical and technical life of
the components and an assessment of likely risk including reliability of
data, and the degree of probability. The choice of time period should be
justified.
Timing of Investments. The timing of investments is of
considerable importance and should be explained regarding the investment
itself and inter-investment and sector linkages. Implementation of an
investment should not commence before the first year rate of return is at
least 102. Where possible and realistic, the effects of changing a
proposed investment scheduling should be estimated and described.
Traffic Estimation. Whenever possible investment specific traffic
estimation should be used. This is particularly important where service or
price competition is important such as would be the case in the ports and
civil aviation sub-sectors. However, in the case of small road projects
(e.g., rural roads) or small urban road projects average traffic trends
based on historical data may be adequate. In each case the choice of
traffic estimate should be clearly justified.
C. Types of Evaluation Study
3.       Depending on the nature and size of the proposed investment the
study methodology will be different. Broadly three types are identified
with approximate values.
(a) large complex projects or projects (above US$3.0 m) which may
have far reaching network, policy or institutional effects,
auch as, for example, the improvement to Larnaca
International Airport, the improvement to the Limassol-Paphos
road or large urban traffic projects (above US$3.0 m), should
be the subject of major consultancy studies based on unique
terms of reference acceptable to major financing agencies;
(b) important but relatively straightforward projects (US$500,000
to US$3.0 m), especially where local knowledge and
institutions are of considerable importance, such as the
Rural Road Improvement Program should be the subject of
feasibility studies carried out by the concerned agency's own
personnel assisted where necessary by consultants and/or
other interested bodies. Special attention should be paid to
this latter point of involving the major interested parties;
and
1/ Described in 3.03(b) of the Loan Agreement as the first year rate of
return of each road section which shall not be less than 101.



- 63 -
ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3
(c)  small and simple investments (up to US$500,000) which
comprise much of any investment program should be given
careful consideration but, for example, periodic highway
maintenance can be evaluated and planned through use of the
standard maintenance management program implemented under the
Third Highway Project and in other cases a simple cost
effectiveness analysis would suffice.
D. Structure of Feasibility Studies
4.       It is to be particularly emphasised that feasibility studies
should be the means of identifying suitable projects and specifying optimum
solutions for subsequent detailed design and implementation. They should
not be merely a medium for rubber stamping already taken technical and
political decisions.
5.       The overall layout of the reports resulting from the study levels
given at 3(a) and 3(b) above should be:
(a) Introduction and Socio-Economic Context;
(b) Engineering, construction, specifications, standards and
costs (including percentage of foreign exchange) and, as
appropriate, all alternatives to be compared;
(c) Traffic estimation, growth rates and forecasts;
(d)  Operating costs including where appropriate financing costs;
(e) Economic and Financial benefits, beneficiaries and include
impact on public sector budgets;
(f) Environmental and employment impact;
(g) Description and display of costs and benefits;
(h) Calculation of results and sensitivity tests;
(i) Financing methods and sources including revenue generation by
the project; and
(j) Recommendation including relation to macro-economic
objectives, transport sector plans and policy, inter-modal
linkages and institutional resources.
The reports should be supported by appropriate technical annexes including
(i) a list of sources consulted; (ii) special surveys carried out; and
(iii) special methodologies used such as calculation of vehicle operating
costs, forecasting passenger traffic passing through an airport or price
elasticity of transport demand.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
TRANSPORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for the Ministry of Communications and Works
Transport Sector Planning, Project Implementation and Monitoring Unit
A. Introduction
1.       The Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) is responsible,
directly or indirectly, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and
Planning Bureau, for the development maintenance and management of the
Cyprus transport sector. From time to time, as the occasion requires,
other ministries and public and private sector organizations are also
brought into the process.
2.       In association with the Fourth Highway Project and proposed First
Transport Project the MCW created a Transport Sector Planning and
Monitoring Unit. This unit is responsible for both coordinating
multi-sector planning exercises and coordinating development planning and
resource management for the entire transport sector including both public
and private sub-sectors. The unit will also be responsible for monitoring
the progress of development and maintenance programs against targets and,
in consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies, will advise on
sector resources needs. Individual transport departments and agencies will
continue, however, to retain full executing management and planning
responsibilities concerning their own sectors.
3.       The unit is responsible directly to the Permanent Undersecretary
of the MCW. There will be a small staff including four professionals who
will be assisted from time to time by designated specialists from other
public and private agencies (e.g. Public Works Department, Cyprus Ports
Authority, Municipal Authorities and Chambers of Commerce).  If deemed
necessary the department may employ specialists and consultants to assist
it in performing its duties.
B. Scope of Work
4.       The department will, inter alia, address the following tasks,
(a) supervise and monitor medium term (less than ten year
horizon) planning studies based upon a review of existing and
proposed transport capacity and forecast demand for transport
by all modes to provide a planning framework for transport
sector investment, maintenance and management policy in both
the public and private sectors: this work shall, in the
first instance, be undertaken in conjunction with the
Transport Sector Master Plan study to be carried out under
the Fourth Highway Project;



- 72 -
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 3
(b) preparation of indicative rolling five year transport
development, maintenance and management plans relating this
closely to resource needs and resource availability including
income from operations, tax revenue, borrowing requirements,
foreign exchange and the status of skills availability;
(c)  integration of sectorlannual budget proposals prepared by
Government transport agencies (e.g. Roads Department, Civil
Aviation) and coordinating these with other agencies such as
The Cyprus Ports Authority, Municipalities and District
Administration for all transport development and maintenance;
(d) undertaking or supervising special studies on transport
related issues and projects which cover more than one sector
including international transport arrangements and
conventions;
(e) overall monitoring of the implementation of development and
maintenance programs for all modes and the reporting of this
on a regular basis; this should include the identification of
problem areas and recommendations regarding remedies; and
(f) the coordination of the design, establishment and operation
of a central data collection, storage and retrieval system
covering all sub-sectors including, but not limited to
traffic, project descriptions and scheduling, expenditures
and revenues, employment, transport costs and prices,
transport enterprises and highway safety.
C. Staffing
5.       The unit will be staffed ab initio by Cypriot personnel, although
for the first two years of operation technical assistance specialists
operating on a full time basis, who may be Cypriot or expatriate, will be
made available. Staff will eventually fall into two groups, four senior
members with support staff and about eight designated officers from other
agencies.
Senior Staff
The expertise of the four members will be in the following fields:
(a)  Unit Head:            experienced in both general development
economics and transport studies and
operations.
(b)  Statistician:         experienced in all aspects of transport
survey work and computer based
information systems.



- 73 -

feasibility studies in both the public
and private sectors.
(d)  Transport Engineer:   experienced in all aspects of civil
engineering works related to transport
but with special knowledge of roads and
traffic engineering.
It is visualized that the technical assistance specialists will correspond
to the above positions and, in addition to working closely with the
full-time senior staff, would have an on the job training function and from
time to time would substitute for the permanent staff should the latter be
absent on training courses for extended periods.
