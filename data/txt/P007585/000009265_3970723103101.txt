MEXICO
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, S.A. (BANOBRAS)
Guarantor:      United Mexican States
Project
Executing
Agency:         Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT)
Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M)
Amount:         US$300 million
Terms:          Repayment in 15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending
Terms:          BANOBRAS would relend the proceeds of the loan to N de M and
the Government (in the case of SCT) in US dollars oTI the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan. N de M and the
Government would assume the foreign exchange risk for their
respective shares of the proposed loan.
Project
Description:   The proposed project provides for investment and operational
and financial improvements to the Mexican railway system
during the period 1985-1988. Investment items supported by
the loan cover both the SCT and N de M investment programs for
the period and include (i) acquisition of rails, track
machinery, workshop equipment, locomotive spare parts and
freight wagon and passenger coach components; (ii) major
construction and realignment of rail lines; (iii) consultant
services; and (iv) training equipment and scholarships. The
project will help to accomplish the following objectives:
(i) improve railway capacity; (ii) continue improvements in
railway operating efficiency; (iii) promote financial
self-sufficiency; (iv) strengthen commercial practices; and
(v) upgrade rail infrastructure planning methods.
Beneficiaries: The railways are the principal transport mode for the movement
of important bulk items which are crucial to the Mexican
economy, such as grain, fertilizer, coal, iron ore and
cement. The incidence of transport costs in the final costs
of these products is significant, and, thus, an efficient rail
operation should benefit the economy as a whole and help to
support the economic recovery. Last, the economy as a whole
sho.ld nenefit from the reduced railway burden on the public
sector deficit if operational and financial targets are met.



Risks:          The project faces three risks:
(i) rail traffic projections are subject to substantial
uncertainty as experienced in railway projects all over the
world. Appropriate measures calling for an annual updating of
traffic forecasts and investment requirements have been
incorporated, and financial projections have been based on
more conservative estimates of traffic to ensure an improved
financial position for N de M despite a possible traffic
shortfall;
(ii) Government counterpart funds may be further restricted
during project implementation, but the proposed sector loan
format - allowing for flexibility in investment priorities -
and the agreed minimum outlays for maintenance-related
activities - would minimize the impact of budget cuts;
(iii) it may become difficult for the Government to continue
acting on its policy of reducing subsidies and raising prices
to reflect the cost of services in the face of potential
political resistance. The Government, up to now, has shown a
serious commitment to its stated pricing policies,
particularly in the transport sector.
Estimated
Cost:           Tne total cost of the SCT and N de M rail investment program
for 1985-1988 is estimated at US$2.35 billion equivalent with
a foreign exchange component of US$849 million equivalent.
The Bank loan represents 13% of the total program and 35% of
the foreign exchange requirements.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Transport Development and the Economy i/
2.01      Mexico has developed an extensive transport network which comprises
over 200,000 km of roads (including 67,000 km of paved and over 80,000 km of
rural roads, with the rest being state and local unpaved roads); about 20,000
km of railways (all except 300 km being standard gauge); some 33 ports, of
which 13 serve international traffic; about 50 airports capable of handling
medium or larger size aircraft; and over 20,000 km of pipelines for crude
oil, refined products and gas. For the 10 years prior to 1982, traffic on
the nation's roads grew by 10% annually, with road traffic representing an
estimated 48% of total traffic in ton-km and over 90% in passenger-km.
Railway freight traffic, representing about 14% of total ton-km, experienced
a growth of 7% annually in that period. Even more significant growth rates
were registered by coastal shipping and pipelines because of increased oil
production, resultinz in estimated shares of 15% and 21% respectively.
After only limited groiwth prior to 1977, the ports registered average annual
increases of almost 17% in cargo tons handled after 1977. In passenger
transport, domestic aviation traffic increased by over 17% annually, with
total passenger-km generally equal to that of the railways.
2.02      During the 1960s and early 1970s, substantial amounts were invested
in transport - particularly roads, railways and aviation - with the transport
sector receiving about 20% of all public investment. With the trunk network
generally in place, emphasis shifted to operatlonal improvements and pricing
and using transport investment to foster the development of outlying areas,
especially through the extensive rural roads construction program of the
mid-1970s. Transport investment declined to 9% of all public investment.
This investment policy, however, proved to be untenable with the surge of
economic activity in the late 1970s, which was accompanied by accelerated
growth in traffic in all modes. Between 1978 and 1981, serious port and rail
bottlenecks emerged, clearly affecting the operation of basic industries and
the conduct of international trade. Consequently, in 1977, the Government
launched an important industrial ports development program and a major track
improvement and modernization plan for the railways. While highways' share
of transport sector investments declined from 68% in 1977 to 44% in 1984,
railways' share grew from 39% to 42% (Table 2.1). Although there were
instances of premature investment and some works suffered from poor
programing, the overall response of the Government to the situation in those
years was appropriate.
1/   The transport sector and, in particular, the highways and ports
subsectors have been treated in more detail in recent Staff Appraisal
Reports for Loans 2428-ME and 2450-ME, both issued in late FY84. Thus,
the discussion of the sector is presented in summary form in this
report.



- 5 -
2.03      With the onset of severe budgetary restrictions from 1982 to the
present, transport investment priorities have shifted again. Transport
investment levels, excluding urban transport, were reduced in 1984, in real
terms, to about US$1.2 billion (roughly equivalent to average 1979-1980
levels), focusing on maintenance, reconstruction of existing infrastructure,
and completion of high priority ongoing works, while deFerring major new
investments. Given the lull in transport demand caused by the recession,
this strategy has been satisfactory for the time being. Rail traffic
declined 12% in 1982; highway traffic, while increasing in 1982, dropped by
10 to 15% in 1983, and several industries, which experienced transport
bottlenecks in the recent past, do not anticipate difficulties in the near
future.
2.04      Projected 1985 transport investment levels stili reflect the
continued restrictive economic situation of the past three years, and no
substantive increases are planned for the sector. As the economy and traffic
begin to recover, however, and many of the major investments initiated before
1982 approach completion, the Government is contemplating new investments in
highways, railways, airports and ports to meet the expected demand. Among
the investments are priority toll road widenings, new rail lines to and along
the Gulf Coast, new railway yards, expanded capacitv for Mexico City airport,
commercial port improvements, and the completion of the industrial port of
Altamira. It remains to be seen whether the economic recovery will be
sufficient and rapid enough to warrant some of these investments. The Bank
sectoral lending program is designed to assist the Government in analyzing
medium- and long-term investments needs through a series of projects in
highways (Loan 2428-ME, FY84), ports (Loan 2450-ME, FY84) and the Railway
Sector Project, the subject of this appraisal report.
2.05      The economic situation has also directed the Government's attention
to pricing and taxation issues which have been of concern to the Bank under
previous projects. In particular, the Government has acted to raise fuel
prices toward international levels; railway tariffs lhave been increased and
costs reduced in real terms, improving the railways' financial position; and
road user tax:es have been increased on the toll road net-,ork.  Further
efforts, however, are still required (para 2.08).
B. Institutional Framework and Planning
2.06      Based on the institutional reforms of the current Administration,
all transport agencies are incorporated under the Secretariat for
Communications and Transport (SCT) (Chart 1). A Subsecretariat For
Infrastructure in SCT handles infrastructure development for almost all
transport, and a Subsecretariat for Operations has responsibility for
operational, regulatory and tariff matters.  A Directorate General for
Planning (DCP), which reports directly to the Secretary, is in charge of
overall planning and budget preparation. Planning units within the various
modal directorates are responsible for identifying and proposing capital
investments and provide the technical details required for the analysis of
such investments. DGP, in turn, has responsibility for carrying out the
economic feasibility analysis and providing a multimodal consistent analytic
framework for the preparation of the medium- and long-term investment
programs. With the recent institutional reorganization of the sector, SCT is
upgrading its planning procedures and criteria, and the Bank is providing



- 6 -
assistance to this effort under various ongoing transport loans. In addition
to SCT, the Secretariat for Programing and Budgeting (SPP) plays an important
role in ensuring consistent modal planning. The Directorate for Public
Infrastructure of SPP must approve the proposed SCT investment and operating
budgets and conducts a serious review of all major investments in the
sector. Although small, this unit has proven effective and capable during
the first years of this Administration.
2.07      To carry out the Government's comprehensive regulation of prices
and operations of the sector, SCT and the Secretariat of Finance (SHCP) share
responsibilities. SCT, through its Directorate General for Tariffs (DGT),
makes the final decision with regard to the pricing of transport services
provided by private operators such as trucking companies and private port
operating firms. For the quasi-public enterprises such as the railways and
public port operating entities, DGT reviews and makes recommendations to the
Pricing Unit of SHCP for final decisions. Other types of regulation of
transport services are carried out by various directorates in SCT under the
Subsecretary of Operations. Although the Bank has expressed concern in the
past over the extensive regulation of transport (including entry, capacity,
route, product and tariff regulation), a recent Bank review of the road
transport industry did not reveal any apparent major distortions and
concluded that, in general, the industry was performing well under the
existing regulatory structure. The review did find that the data base used
by SCT for regulatory decisions was insufficient for the timely
identification of potential transport problems which could require regulatory
change. The Government is now considering the Bank's recommendations and
possible technical assistance under the Second Highway Sector Project to

C. Major Sector Issues
2.08      The major issues in the sector are listed below, and a more
detailed discussion of the issues and the actions being taken is orovided in
Annex 1:
(a) Scope and timing of transport investments. While presently
maintaining a holding strategy on transport investments, the
Government must face major decisions concerning deferred large, new
transport investments. Planning has been complicated by the
uncertainty of the timing, scope and composition of the economic
recovery. Bank lending has been designed to help determine
long-term investment needs, e.g., analytical procedures and
criteria for evaluating investments have been developed and agreed
to under the Second Highway Project (Loan 2428-ME) and under the
proposed Railway Sector Project;
(b)  Diesel prices.  The Government has raised gasoline prices by 247Th,
in real terms, from 1981 to 1985 and diesel prices by 367%. Diesel
prices are now about 77% of international levels (Caribbean FOB
price). The Government continues to move progressively toward
international levels and, in January 1985, established an automatic
monthly increase for diesel prices of 2.5% for the rest of the
year;



(c)   Road user charges for heavy vehicles.  It is apparent  that heavy
vehicles  are not paying sufficiently for the costs they impose upon
the network.   SCT is carrying nuIt the needed studies with  financing
under Loan 2428-ME, and appropriate consultation clauses on this
issue have been agree-d to under that loan;
(d)   Railway financial  situiation.   The  railways have made substantial
progress  in improving their financial situation and have complied
withl financial tairgets under thie Fourth Railway Project (1929-ME);
further measures, however, will be requtired to make the railway a
financially  viable ent-itv as proposed tinder this Sector Project
(Paras 3.144-3.15);
(e)  IPort charsges.  Present port rhlarges do not adequately relate  to
costs and d(i not  re-rover port  infrastructure Investment costs.

specifically cost-related; and an ever-growing debt, 2/ The present project
has taken into account the lessons learned under previous projects.  With
regard to forecasts, in addition to N de M upgrading its forecasting
methodology, a conservative traffic estimate has been applied for the
financial evaluation to determine the ability of N de M to absorb the cost of
a shortfall in expected traffic (para 3.13). Similarly, the sector loan
format will permit an annual re-evaluation of investments and appropriate
adjustments for traffic variations and macro-economic concerns (para 4.05).
Locomotive availability has been evaluated in great detail, and realistic
targets resulting from a comprehensive action plan are proposed (paras 4.19
and 4.26). Finally, substantive action on tariffs has been taken which
confirms the Government's commitment to pricing principles agreed to under
this project (para 3.14).
E. Bank Lending Strategy
2.11      The Bank's role In the transport sector has heen expanded because
of the measures taken bv the Government on issues which have been of concern
to the Bank during its long standing involvement in the sector, particularly
with regard to sector pricing (Annex 1) and institutional reorganization
(para 2.06). The sector lending strategy, in accordance with the Bank's
overall objectives for lending to Mexico, is to develop relatively quick
disbursing loan operations which focus upon short-term investment in
maintenance, rehabilitation and modernization, ai.d upon making prior
investments operational while assisting the Government, through the new
Planning Directorate, in reassessing the medium- and long-term need for major
new investments. Furthermore, a constructive dialogue on sector policies has
been initiated between the Bank and the Government which would be supported
through the hank's lending and sector work program. The Second Highway
Sector Project (Loan 2428-ME) and the Industrial Ports Project (Loan 2450-ME)
have established Bank involvement in the highway and port subsectors. The
proposed Railway Sector Project would complete this comprehensive involvement
by incorporating the railway subsector.
II. THE RAILWAY SUBS.CTOR
A. Organization of the Railwavs
3.01      There are presentlv four Government-owned railways in Mexico, whose
lines are generallv complementary, feeding into one another. N de M Is the
largest of the railways, as shown below (km):
Standard   Narrow
Gauge      Gauge       Total      Z

It operates nearly 80% of the railway network, transporting about 82% of all
freight ton-km and 70% of all passenger-km in 1983, and receives 92% of all
investment (including SCT rail infrastructure).
3.02      In January 1977, a Government decree authorized the integration of
the then five railway enterprises into a single operating unit, and this
process is being accomplished very gradually. The first phase of the
unification has so far been carried out; management has been entrusted to a
single board under the control of a single General Manager. The General
Manager of N de M, thus, nce serves as General Manager of all the railways,
and a management board, comprising representatives of pertinent ministries
and the labor unions, has been established. In 1982, Ferrocarriles Unidos
del Sureste (FUS) was amalgamated with N de M. Furthermore, annual budget
proposals for the four railways are coorainated and prepared by the Planning
Office of N de It. The timing of the amalgariation of the other railways is
uncertain because of the legal implicatio.s, as well as the need to obtain
the approval of the labor unions representing the other railways which
operate under differing work rules and regulations. The Government continues
to proceed cautiously to complete the full amalgamation. The incorporating
of the other railways within N de M should not have a significant impact on
N de M's operations or financial position. It was confirmed at negotiations
that N de M will extend the economic evaluation guidelines agreed to under
the project to the other railways' investment plans as they are incorporated
within N de M. It was also confirmed at negotiations that N de M will
maintain records with respect to project targets (para 4.26) which will
exclude any newly incorporated railways in order to ensure appropriate
monitoring of the project objectives.
3.03      As a state enterprise, the railways are regulated by the
Government, with SCT reviewing annual operating and capital budgets and
controlling tariff changes, the final responsibility being that of the
Secretariat of Finance (SHCP). The main directorates in SCT with regulatory
responsibilities for the railways include the Directorate General of Railway
Operations and the Directorate General of Tariffs (DGT) under the
Subsecretary of Operations (Chart 1). In addition, the construction of new
rail infrastructure, realignments, electrification and yards is handled by
the Directorate General for Railway Infrastructure (DGVF) with financing
provided directly under the SCT budget. The completed works are then turned
over to the railways for operation and maintenance, becoming Go .ernment
equity in the respective railway companies.
B. Management, Staffing and Training
(i) N de M
3.04      In terms of numbers, N de M is adequately staffed (organizational
structure as indicated in Chart 2), wit]. about 64,715 employees (as of
October 1984). As part of the action plans for the previous two railway
projects (Loans 1232-ME and 1929-ME), N de M was encouraged to analyze its
staff requirements and prepare manpower plans which would ensure that, as
traffic increased, essential manpower needs were met, while indiscriminate
additions to staff were avoided. N de M's Plan de Recursos Humanos" has
been reviewed by Bank missions almost every two years since 1978 when it was
first prepared and, during these reviews, there have been detailed
discussions regarding the staff needs of N de M, the requirements of training
and the organizational adjustments necessitated by the increasing demands of



- 10 -
traffic, as well as the progressive modernization of the operations and
technology of N de M. Staff productivity, = measured by traffic units per
employee, improved from 527,000 in 1978 to 641,000 in 1984. The review
conducted during appraisal of the Sector Project forms the basis for the
staff productivity targets included in the Plan of Action (para 4.26).  The
projections for the next five years (Table 3.1) show a modest growth in staff
of about 3%, which, considering the forecast growth in ton-km and
passenger-km over the same -period, implies a 17% growth in efficiency. Staff
productivity is expected to increase to about 750,000 traffic units per
employee by 1988.
3.05      An important element in the effort to improve labor-productivity is
the strategy for training and work rule rationalization agreed to, in
principle, by the Government, N de M and the railway union under the program
for the "Modernization of the National Railway System issued in 1983. The
initial action taken under this program has been the consolidation and
elimination of positions in the railway workshops, some of which dated back
to the days of the steam locomotive and -.lated workshop technology. Along
with this action has been the init'ation of extensive training programs and
an incentive pay arrangement to encourage and upgrade staff. After giving
initial attention to the -srkshops, the modernization program expects to
focus on assessing ways to improve . abor-productivity with regard to line
rehabilitation and maintenance, a- jo renegotiate work rules with regard to
train erews, which will, inter alia, extend the crew operating zones and
lessen the number of crew changes on line, which cause considerable delay and
reduce equipment utilization as well as limit line capacity. These
improvements are taken into consideration in the project Action Plan.
(ii) DGVF
3.06      The Directorate General of Rail Infrastructure (DGVF) of SCT has
had long experience in the design and construction of new railway lines,
major realignments and other infrastructure works. It carries out most of
the engineering and design itself, making use of local firms for some
location, design and drawing work when the voi'me of work warrants it, as
well as specialist contractors for aerial surveys, soils investigations and
material testing.
3.07      For the execution of works, DGVF provides rails, sleepers and
fastenings while the earth works and bridge building works are contracted.
Stone ballast supply and track laying work are also contracted out, either to
the main contractors or to separate contractors, with SCT providing transport
and specialized machinery for ballast handling and track laying. Mexico has
a substantial number of capable contractors who also work on highway
construction. Supervision of the works is carried out by DGVF experts, in
close collaboration with N de M.
C. Achievements in the Railway Subsector
3.08      Substantive improvements in railway operations and finance have
been achieved during the implementation of th_ successive railwav projects
(Table 3.2). In terms of opera:ional efficiency, as mentioned before, labor
productivity has improved such that N de M handled 641,000 units of traffic
per employee in 1984, as compared with 366,C00 in 1970. Annual freight
locomotive-km per locomotive increased from 75,600 to 93,500 during the same
period and passenger locomotive-km from 130,700 to 245,000. Similarly,



- 11 -
average carload increased from 39 to 55 tons per car, and passengers per
coach from 31 to 60. Furthermore, problems which hampered railway efficiency
in the past have been resolved, such as the large number of foreign cars on
line, which reached 27,000 in 1980, straining yard and line capacity; the
number has been reduced to 2,500. Unit trains and direct trains now carry
75% of all ton-km, which, together with the new telecommunications and car
control systems (OCS), helped to reduce car turnaround times from a high of
23 days in 1980 to 17 days in 1984.
3.09      Through these improvements, N de M has been able to serve
increasing traffic (Map IBRD 11844R1).  The railways, despite their low share
in overall traffic (an estimated 14% of all ton-km or 23% of road and rail
ton-km), are crucial to the efficient functioning of several sectors. They
carry about 40% of all beans, about 30% of all sorghum, about 50% of all
wheat and about 10% of all corn produced and imported by Mexico. The
railways are also the principal carriers for iron ore, coke, coal and sugar
and are major carriers for fertilizers, cement and many steel products.
N de M's traffic generally has followed the growth in GDP. From 1970 to
1984, both GDP and railway freight ton-km increased by an average annual rate
of about 5.0%. N de M's freight traffic grew from 39.1 million tons and 18.4
billion ton-km in 1970 to an estimated 61.9 million tons and 37.1 billion
Lon-km by 1984, with ton-km growing faster than tons (5.0% compared with
about 3.0%) as average hauls increased from 470 to about 600 km per ton
during the 1970-1984 period (Table 3.3). In contrast to the worldwide
trend, Mexico's railway traffic has increased steadily, and railway's share
in the transport of its principal commodities has not changed significantly,
except in the case of petroleum and derivatives, for which pipelines have
replaced rail services. Excluding petroleum products, the historic annual
growth for N de M tons and ton-km from 1970 to 1984 is 3.7% and 5.77
respectively.
3.10      On the financial side, after years of inadequate tariff increases,
the Government took action to reduce transport subsidies and raised rail
freight tariffs by 40% from 1980 to 1984 in real terms (Table 3.4). The
higher tariffs, together with the increasing traffic (para 3.09) and reduced
unit costs (due to improved efficiency and real reductions in wages and
materials costs) resulted in working and operating ratios in 1983 (and
apparently similar or better ratios in 1984) of 0.85 and 1.08 respectively,
surpassing financial targets in the Fourth Railway Project 3/. These ratios
compare with working and operating ratios of 1.38 and 1.60 respectively in
1980 (see Annex 2 for more details).
D. Areas of Concern in the Subsector
3.11      The following discussion summarizes the main problem areas
concerning the railways, which have been the main focus of project
preparation efforts and the action plan (paras 4.1>-4.26).
(i) Freight Traffic Forecast and Commercial Practices
3.12      Previous traffic forecasts prepared by N de M, in conjunction with
Bank projects, have proven to be over-optimistic, 7.6-7.8% annual gr^-ith
projections compared with 3.8-4.6% actual, mainly due to two factors which
make railway freight forecasting difficult in Mexico. The first is the
3/   Including Government specific compensation for passenger services and
reimbursement for pension payments as N de M revenue.



- 12 -
volatility of the Mexican economy. Both the Third and Fourth Railway
Projects covered periods of severe economic recession in 1976 and 1982. The
second factor is the uncertainty regarding grain imports. The railways carry
a high percentage of grain imports so that, in years of poor harvests, rail
tonnage increases, while, in years of good harvests, rail tonnage declines;
Mexico, thus, revises its forecasts e-very year and adjusts its investment
plans, particularly for locomotives and rolling stock. To minimize the
problem of uncertainty, the project proposes the following with regard to
rail traffic forecasts: forecasting methodology and data base have been
upgraded, particularly for grain; an annual review process is being
institutionalized; and two forecasts have been prepared - a commercial
forecast following N ae M's detailed product-by-product methodology and a low
forecast for the financial analysis based on the historical trend of the last
14 years. The commercial forecast has been applied to determine investment
requirements to ensure that the railways have sufficienL capacity to serve
the identified target market. The low forecast has been used in the
financial projection to ensure that N de M will be able to maintain an
adequate financial position even if investments are made and expected traffic
does not materialize (more details on the traffic forecast are provided in
Annex 3).
3.13      The commercial forecast for 1984-1988 predicts an annual increase
in tonnage of 5.3% and in ton-km of 5.0%, rising from 61.9 to 76.2 million
tons and 37.1 to 45.2 billion ton-km (Table 3.5). The distance per ton is
expected to stabilize at about 593 km. Major traffic increases are expected
for certain grains and intermediate industrial products for which N de M
believes it can attain a higher market share and is targeting special
commercial efforts. The low" forecasL, which is applied in the financial
evaluation, assumes an annual growth rate of about 3.0% for tonnage, reaching
66.6 million tons or 41.8 billion ton-km by 1988. Related to this forecast
is the need.for improved and enhanced marketing practices. In order to
pursue a more aggressive commercial policy, the project proposes a
restructuring of the Traffic Department's marketing function and the testing
of new marketing approaches. Appropriate actions are called for in the
Action Plan (para 4.21), including more detailed costing studies for railway
operations, i.e., workshops, and specific commodity movements, i.e., the
cost of hackhaul movements. Technical assistance will he provided umder the
project to support these efforts.
(ii) Financial Status
3.14      Although the overall working and operating ratios of N de M have
improved significantly, further actions will be required leading toward the
objective of financial viability for N de M (for more details on N de M's
financial status, see Annex 2).  While tariff adjustments since 1982 have
managed to keep freight revenues ahead of inflationary cost increases, a
number of important commodities, e.g., iron ore, coal, ccke and cement, were
still, at the end of 1984. being carried at tariffs which, while covering
short-rln variable costs, are below long-term variable costs (with the latter
being distinguished from the former by including depreciation and interest)
(Table 3.6). It was agreed at negotiations that, as a special condition of
effectiveness, the Government and N de M would furnish a p'an of action
satisfactory to the Bank for the tariff reclassification of commodities and
would take initial action to reclassify some of the commodities still carried
at tariffs below long-term variable costs, which, de facto, represents an
important step toward the ultimate goal of covering such costs. At
negotiations, it was also agreed that, by January 1988, tariffs for all rail
commodities would be at least equal to long-term variable costs.



- 13 -
3.15      The other financial issue relates to N de M's debt situation.
Interest charges, which are mainly on foreign loans, have more than doubled
ir real terms over the last five years and, in 1983, consumed 46% of gross
revenue. Government and railway representatives, in response to this
problem, agreed that part of the long-term debt, related to N de M's need to
borrow in order to cover operating cash shortfalls, would be transferred to
the Government. Such deficits resulted from the Government's refusal to
allow adequate increases in tariffs, keeping revenues from rising
sufficiently to meet inflationary increases in costs and leaving N de M to
borrow on current account. The related borrowing amounts to about 40% of the
existing long-term debt of N de M by December 1983. An equivalent amount of
such debt would be converted, in stages, into Government equity during three
years beginning in 1985, leaving the railway with a debt burden based upon
capital borrowing, which could, in the future, be serviced by N de M itself,
if other financial conditions of the project are fulfilled (paras 4.20
and 4.26). Agreement on the debt assumption has been finalized, and initial
action has been taken for debt service payments in 1985.
(iii) Locomotive Efficiency
3.16      During recent years, N de M has been struggling with the problem of
declining availability of the diesel fleet (about 1,600 units in the fleet),
together with a steady increase in its traffic. To some extent, the two
phenomena have been interconnected as traffic pressures have led to neglect
of maintenance. Other factors, however, have also been responsible for the
development of a situation that requires an urgent solution. During the
sharp upsurge of traffic in 1979-1981, N de M hired and purchased second-hand
locomotives from the U.S. railroads, which are still in service. In
addition, because of budget limitations and import restrictions, the ordering
of spare parts did not keep pace with the requirements, while the number of
over-aged units has been increasing (Table 3.7). The Bank, therefore,
requested N de M to make an in-depth review of the locomotive situation and
to prepare an integrated locomotive recovery plan comprising: (a) a scrapping
program (218 locomotives to be eliminated in the years 1985-1988);
(b) a rehabilitation program for suitable locomotives which can be
reconditioned; (c) a purchase program for spare parts and components, and
equipment to streamline workshop repairs; and (d) purchase of new
locomotives. The plan also includes a review of workshop practices and
training programs (see Annex 4 for more details). The implementation of the
locomotive program has already started and is showing results. The
availability of locomotives improved from 65.5% in 1983 to 68% in 1984.
Under the project, availability is projected to rise to 80% by 1988
(para 4.26). The overall effect of the locomotive program will be that the
diesel locomotive fleet will be reduced, from 1,614 in 1984 to 1,457 in 1988,
with substantial increases in locomotive availability and in traffic served.
(iv) Track Condition
3.17      N de M operates about 15,300 km of track, of which some 1,250 km
were added in 1982 when FUS was integrated with the N de M system. N de M
faces two problems related to track infrastructure: high operating costs and
capacity limitations due to excessive gradients and curvatures on main lines;
and increasing accidents due to track conditions. Track-related accidents
are up by 22%, as compared with a decline of 45% in operations-related



- 14 -
accidents from 1980 to 1983 (Table 3.8). Regarding accidents, poor
maintenance and fluctuations in the rate of track rehabilitation are of
considerable concern. N de M has concluded that its labor-intensive
maintenance practices are ineffective in meeting the increasing maintenance
requirements as traffic rises. As a result, N de M is pursuing an
accelerated mechanization program with substantial equipment purchases
beginning in 1985 and a reorganization of labor (see Annex A for more
details). Appropriate maintenance targets for 1985-1988 are presented in
paragraph 4.26. Also, rail rehabilitation efforts have fluctuated with
budgetary allocations and the Government's policy on imports. During the
height of the recession, approval of rail imports was delayed, limiting track
rehabilitation. For 1985, N de M expects to carry out deferred
rehabilitation by completing about 340 km of track rehabilitation with new
rail and about 260 km with recovered rail (see Annex 4 for more details).
Appropriate rehabilitation targets for 1986-1988 are presented in
paragraph 4.26.
3.18      Resolving the problem of excessive gradients and curvature on trunk
lines is the focus of the SCT infrastructure works being carried out by
DGVF (see Annex 5 for more details). Many of these realignment works were
reviewed during the appraisal of the Third and Fourth Railway Projects, but
have progressed at a slower-than-expected rate, mainly because of budgetary
restrictions. The realignment works are generally concentrated on the
,iexico-Veracruz, Cordoba-Coatzacoalcos, Mexico-Lazaro Cardenas and
Saltillo-Monterrey lines.  Substantial capacity additions are being provided
through the double-tracking of Mexico-Irapuato. Finallv, new lines have been
initiated between Guadalajara and Monterrey and hetween Veracruz and
Tampico. Traffic forecasts and costs liave clhanged significantly since these
works were initiated, and a re-evaluation made during preparation of the
Sector Project confirmed the feasibility of most of the program. A number of
works, hnwever, are being delayed or scaled-down (para 4.33).
(v) Yard Capacity
3.19      The installation of telecommunications and the operational control
system have helped to reduce car turnaround times to 17 days in 1984 from a
high of 23 days in 1980 (Table 3.2), but this level is still considered
high.   The capacity constraints being experienced at the main railway yards
in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Coatzacoalcos represent a
principal factor in the long turnaround times for wagons. Freight wagons
generally spend a major portion of their available time in yards, as compared
with the line-haul movement. The physical expansion of existing yards,
however, is limited because these yards are now located within urban
centers. With restricted budgets, major yard works have been postponed, but
a Master Plan Study of all N de M vards is to be initiated to review the
operations of existing yards, to determine the future workload of the yards,
to view the problem of capacity on a network basis and to appropriately
locate, design and stage new yard investments (para 4.24).
(vi) Passenger Services
3.20      As the financial performance of N de M's freight services has
improved, attention is focusing upon N de M's passenger services, which
continue to generate deficits, while levels of service, in terms of equipment
and on-time performance, deteriorate. N de M offers a number of inter-urban



- 15 -
passenger services, including sleeping car service, first cl.lass special,
first class and second class services, and a mixed freight .-nd passenger
train service for outlying low density lines. Passenger traffic had declined
from over 33.2 million passengers in 1970 to 16 million passengers in 1981
until recent increases returned traffic levels to 22 million in 1983
(includinTg 3 million passengers of the recently incorporated FUS line). Much
of the decline is due to the elimination of uneconomic services representing
43% of all passenger services between 1974 and 1978. Passenger-km, however,
have not declined as precipitously because the average distance per passenger
rose from about 100 km to 190 km from 1970 to 1983, and, today, N de M
carries 4.2 billioa passenger-km, as compared with 3.4 billion in 1970.
3.21      Passenger fares cover only about 60% of short-run variable costs,
and the Government has been reluctant to raise fares substantially in real
terms, despite the substantial differential between bus and rail fares,
because service is so bad and because 87% of the passengers are lower income
groups using second class service. Unit cost decreases, higher load factors
per coach and per train, and the reduction of uneconomic services, together
with some real fare increases, however, reduced the deficit in real terms,
which is covered by a specific Government payment to N de M, by 37% from 1980
to 1984, reaching US$26 million equivalent per year.
3.22      The Government and N de M have proposed a comprehensive strategy
for passenger services which includes a new fare policy to reduce subsidies,
the improvement of high density services, the analysis of the potential for
new first class services on main lines which are being upgraded and the -
gradual elimination of low density services for which no social or economic
justification can be made (see Annex 6 for more details). The main element
in this strategy is the investment in new coaches beginning with the
acquisition of replacement coaches for existing services, followed by the
acquisition of additional coaches for new first-class services once such
services are shown to be economically and financially viable. Most of the
present fleet of coaches are over 25 years old, with more than 200 coaches
over 45 years old (Table 3.7). Based on this strategy, N de M has forecast
that total passenger trips (excluding the introduction of new services) will
grow from 22.5 million in 1984 to 24.8 million in 1988 and passenger-km from
4.3 billion in 1984 to 5.0 billion in 1988 for an average annual growth of
2.5% and 3.8% respectively (Table 3.9). The forecast assumes that all growth
will occur on the high density lines, while the lower density lines' traffic
either remains stable or declines.
3.23      In implementing the proposed strategy, the Bank has recommended a
series of actions to be taken, including a line-by-line costing exercise, the
raising of fares to long-term variable costs, and procedures for the economic
evaluation of new coach acquisitions. Initial estimates confirm the economic
viability of most of the existing inter-urban services. N de M's initial
coach acquisition contract for 1985 and 1986, however, contrary to the
proposed strategy (para 3.22), provides for more first-class "special"
coaches than required for replacement, and the economic evaluation is not
sufficient. N de M is now negotiating to postpone the 1986 tranche of such
coaches until the economic and financial Justification can be confirme'
(para 4.29).

(vii) Management Training
3.24      Although N de M has enjoyed a measure of stability in its
management unusual for railroads in Latin America, there is a lack of young
middle-management personnel required for continuity and the adoption of new
management techniques. While substantial attention has been paid to the
training needs of line personnel, the need for developing a cadre of young
professionals for management is one that assumes paramount importance with
the integration of the other railways and the gradually increasing workload
of the new system. To meet this need, the project includes a scheme for the
upgrading of qualified railway personnel and for the recruitment of
university graduates who would receive theoretical training at university and
practical training online at N de M, as well as overseas with railways
abroad. Financing for the foreign-exchange costs of the program would be
provided from the proposed loan (para 4.17).
IV. THE RAILWAY ACTION PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Project Concept and Objectives
4.01      The Railway Sector Project (Fifth Railway Project) will extend Bank
support for the continued improvement of the Mexican railways and will
broaden Bank participation in Mexico's transport sector following on the
Second Highway Sector Project (2428-ME) and the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial
Ports Project (2450-ME), both approved in FY84. The project will provide
assistance to help finance the 1985-1988 time-slice of the N de M and SCT
railway investment program and, by including financing for SCT works, it
represents a wider involvement than that under previous projects. The
long-standing relationship between N de M, SCT and the Bank, and the
experience gained through a series of consecutive transport projects, make it
possible to apply a sector loan format to this project, with the
responsibility for appraising investment commitments beyond the first year
resting with the staff of N de M and SCT, following procedures agreeable to
the Bank (Annexes 7 and 8).
4.02      The overall objective of the project is to support Government and
railway efforts to implement a Plan of Action wXhich will:
(a) improve railway traffic carrying capacity through a balanced
investment program;
(b) continue improvements in railway operating efficiency through
higher productivity of equipment and human resources;
(c) promote financial self-sufficiency for railway services with
tariffs appropriately related to railway costs and a rationalized
debt structure;
(d)  strengthen cosmercial practices for railway services; and
(e) upgrade planning methods for assessing railway infrastructure
requirements.

B.   Investment Program 1985-1988
(i) Overall Program
4.03      Since 1977, rail investment has increased substantially such that,
in 1984, total rail investmeni, including DGVF and all four railways, was 95Z
above the 1977 level, reaching about US$525 million equivalent in the
1980-1982 period (Table 4.1). The main increase was in new construction, up
over 200% in real terms from 1977 to 1984, due to the double-tracking and
electrification of Mexico-Queretaro and the new sections on the
Mexico-Veracruz line. Similarly, track rehabilitation increased by about
180%. Locomotive purchases have fluctuated, and wagon acquisitions, although
increased in the 1980-1982 period, are now at the levels they were in 1977.
The major decline has been for signaling, telecommunications, workshop and
track machinery and passenger coaches, all of which receive increasing
allocations in the projected 1985-1988 investment program. Prior Bank
reviews have confirmed the economic soundness of these investments. In some
cases, e.g., electrification works, the acquisition of machinery and
materials was premature because track works had not been completed. Also,
wagon and locomotive purchases were higher than would have been the case if
wagon turnaround times were lower and locomotive availability were higher.
4.04      The total N de M and SCT railway investment program for 1985-1988
is estimated to cost US$2,354 million equivalent (including physical and
price contingencies), of which N de M represents US$1,325 million equivalent
and SCT represents US$1,029 million equivalent (Table 4.2). The foreign
exchange cost of the total program, including the indirect foreign exchange
for SCT rail infrastrtucture civil works, is estimated at US$849 million
equivalent, of which N de M represents US$457 million equivalent and SCT
represents USS392 million equivalent.
4.05      A detailed analysis of the 1985 investment proposals and a more
general review of the proposals for subsequent years were carried out. It
was confirmed at negotiations that, by November of each year, beginning in
1985, N de M and SCT will prepare, for Bank comment, an updated four-year
investment program with a detailed breakdown for the following year based
uyon agreed technical and economic criteria. No investment should be included
unless it has an estimated rate of return of at least 12%.
(ii) N de M Investment
4.06      General.  The N de M program is about US$300 million equivalent per
year (ir 1985 prices), compared with about US$370 million equivalent in the
1980-1982 period, with a direct foreign exchange content of about 34%
(Table 4.3). The composition of the program is summarized in the following
paragraphs, and a more detailed discussion is provided in Annexes 4 and 7.
The investments are weighted heavily toward track maintenance and
rehabilitation, with all track-related investments reaching 28% of total
investments.



- 18 -
4.07      Track.  The track rehabilitation program with new rail is expected
to cover an average of 360 km per year at an average cost per km of about
US$150,000 equivalent per km (in mid-1985 prices) (Map IBRD 18768). Track
rehabilitation on lower traffic density lines with recovered rail should
cover 223 km per year over the period at an average cost of US$30,000
equivalent per km (Table 4.4). In addition, N de M has planned to purchase
about US$71 million equivalent worth of track machinery (in mid-1985 prices),
about 45% of this in 1985, as part of its plans to mechanize track
maintenance (Table 4.5).
4.08       Signaling.  In pursuance of Its policy of providing CTC on the
heavily used single-lines, a plan foreseei in the Fourth Railway Project but
inadequately implemented so far because of the lack of financial resources,
N de M proposes the following works in 1985: completion of CTC works in hand
between Guadalajara and Irapuato (250 km); installation of CTC between San
Luis Potosi and Benjamin Mendez (345 km); and completion of the study for CTC
between Lecheria-Teotihuacan-Vera Cruz (404 km) and initiation of the
purchase of materials. In addition, the 1985 budget provides for the
renovation and modernization of the over-aged car control and signaling
equipment in the Valle de Mexico marshaling yard to make the system serve the
longer and heavier cars now in use. The continuation of CTC works in
1986-1988 is likely to be confined to the completion of the above-mentioned
works.
4.09      Telecommunications.  N de M is currently making an analysis of the
combined Telecommunications and Operational Control System installed over the
network under the Third and Fourth Railway Projects. Work in 1985 to 1988
will comprise extension of the telecommunications system to the former FUS
Railway and, later, to the other three Railways - Pacifi_z, Ulihuahua and
Sonora-Baja California.  The main work for 1985 compiLses purchase of
additional V1F radios for 700 locomotives, and for track and train crews, as
well as the extension of telephone exchange and teleprintez facilities.
4.10      Motive Power.  As efficiency, particularly locomotive availability,
improves In accordance with the Plan of Action (para 4.26), N de M will
minimize its locomotive purchase (Table 4.6). In 1985 and 1986, about 20 new
locomotives are expected to be acquired each year at a cost of US$1.2 million
per unit. Also, 20 existing locomotives are scheduled for rehabilitation
each year, at a cost of US$230,000 per unit. In 1987 and 1988, no new
locomotives should be required since 39 electric locomotives, already
acquired for the Mexico-Irapuato line, will come into operation. N de M is
also expected to build up its locomotive spare parts inventory, which had
been depleted in previous years.
4.11      Rolling Stock.  In accordance with the traffic forecasts and the
target indices for wagon turnaround, N de M intends to purchase 460 wagons in
1985 (Table 4.7) and an additional 1,500 wagons per year from 1986 to 1988
(Table 4.8), at an average unit cost of US$65,000 equivalent. The railway
also intends to rehabilitate 700 wagons in 1985 and a similar number annually
thereafter, at an average cost of US$35,000 equivalent. Furthermore, N de M
has initiated the purchase of 330 passenger coaches, beginning with 30
first-class special coaches in 1985, at an average cost of US$500,000
equivalent each.



- 19 -
(iii) SCT Investment
4.12      The SCT program is about US$230 million equivalent per year (in
1985 prices), with a direct and indirect foreign exchange content of about
38% (Table 4.9). The composition of the program is summarized below, and a
more detailed discussion is provided in Annexes 5 and 8. About 67% of the
line works and electrification investments in the 1985-1988 program are
directed at completing ongoing works. The main items in the program
(Map IBRD 18767) include:
(a) the completion of double-tracking, with electrification on the
Mexico City-Queretaro-Irapuato line;
(b) the regrading and realignment of the Mexico City-Veracruz line and
sections between Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos;
(c) the completion of a new line between Guadalajara and Monterrey to
facilitate direct traffic between Manzanillo and Monterrey, and the
construction of appropriate bypasses around Guadalajara;
(d) the construction of rail bypasses at Monterrey and Saltillo; and
(e) the completion of realignment works between Mexico City and Lazaro
Cardenas.
4.13      Provision has been made for the continuation of a new line between
Veracruz and Tampico and the construction of a new line between Mexico City
and Tampico. Major investment in these subprojects, except for contracts
which already have been initiated, has been postponed pending further studies
(para 4.33), and priority has been placed upon directing limited budgets
toward the completion of works well under way. There is also a budgctary
allocation in later years for major yard investment, depending upon the
results of the proposed studies (para 4.24).
4.14      DGVF has also proposed the acquisition of specialized machinery
(Table 4.10) in order to carry out the construction program effectively.
This will require a total of about US$10 million equivalent (in 1985 prices)
between 1986 and 1988.
C.   Bank Participation and the Financing Plan
4.15      Bank participation would consist of a loan of US$300 million to
BANOBRAS as the borrower, with SCT and N de M as the executing agencies and
approximately US$150 million allocated to each entity. The loan would
represent 33% of the estimated foreign exchange requirements of N de M and
38% of the estimated foreign exchange requirements of SCT. The main
components for Bank financing would be as follows (in millions of US$,
including price contingencies):

4.16      Project costs have been estimated on the basis of 19A5 prieps and
include appropriate physical contingencies. Base prices have been converted
to US dollars at the projected exchange rate for mid-1985 and international
inflation assumptions applied to both local and foreign costs (2.5X for the
remainder of 1985, 7.5% for 1986, and 8% per year from 1987-1l88).
4.17      Technical assistance and training costs (in mid-1985 prices)
to be financed under the loan are detailed in Table 4.11. Bank financing of
US$1.0 million for N de M would provide for the foreign exchange costs nf
72 man-months of consultant services, related comptuter software, anti
30 man-months of overseas scholarships, all to support the expctution nf thi
identified studies in the Action Plan (paras 4.21 and 4.24) and the
middle-management training program (para 4.25). In addition, ahoiit
US$1.5 million would be provided to help carry out final engineering and
economic analysis for proposed railway yard investments.

D.   Plan of Action
(i)  Actions to Be Taken
4.19       In preparing this project, the railways and the Government, in
consultation with the Bank, established a series of actions directed at
resolving the major issues discussed in this report and a set of operational,
investment and financial targets to be achieved during the 1985-1988 period.

Government.
5/  Includes the balance of Loan 1929-ME still to he disbursed - about
USS45 million.

4.20      Financial Status.  To meet the financial targets in paragraph 4.26,
it was agreed at negotiations that:
(a) by no later than January 1988, tariffs for each commodity will be
at a level to cover at least the long-term variable costs;
(b) a detailed costing of mainline passenger services will be carried
out by N de M, distinguishing between lines and types of services,
by November 1986;
(c) the accounting systems will be modernized to enable costing,
budgeting and other management information to be produced through
electronic data processing by December 1987;
(d) passenger fares will be raised to long-term variable costs by
January 1988, except in the case of second-class passenger services
for which economic and social considerations miglht warrant fares
set below such levels; and
(e)  Government compensation for passenger services will br paid in a
timely manner and will cover related losses.
4.21       Commercial Practices and Costing.  To attain forecast traffic
levels and facilitate tariff estimates, it was agreed at negotiations that:
(a)  N de M will establish an accounting mechanism to monitor workshop
costs by September 1987;
(b) N de M will carry out specific costing exercises for a number of
important product movements and for backhaul services bv March
1986;
(c) N de M will study the organization and staffing of its commercial
department and make proposals for its restructuring by September
1986; and
(d)  N de M will study and prepare a marketing strategy by no later than
December 1986 and begin its application no later than April 1987.
4.22      Locomotive and Wagon Utilization.  To achieve operational targets
for locomotive and wogon utilization, it was agreed at negotiations that:
(a)  sufficient budgetary allocations will he provided annually to
ensure the needed spare parts for locomotive maintenance;

E.   Financial Forecasts
4.27      Financial projections for N de M over the period 1984-1988 are
given in detail in the second part of Annex 2 and the accompanying tables.
Briefly summarized, the revenue projections are based on a continuation of
the historic trend of traffic tonnage growth, some 3% per year, on the
assumption that the Government will indeed permit an annual average increase
in real freight tariffs of no less than 2% and that tariffs known not to be
covering long-term variable costs at present will be duly adjusted by March
1986 at the latest. With regard to passengers, the present level of specific
passenger compensation to cover the approximately 40% of costs not covered by
fares has been assumed, even though the Government agreed, at negotiations,
to progressively raise fares and reduce subsidies. On the cost side, the
wage awards of 1984, increased manpower projections and the incentive scheme
under the Thedernization Plan have been taken into account. In addition,
the Government will take over some 47% of the existing long-term debt,
reimburse N de M for direct pension payments still to be made to retired
staff, and compensate N de M for losses related to passerLer services.
4.28      Under such circumstances, N de M would be able to achieve an
operating ratio of less than 1.00 by 1985 and would, in addition, be able to
service all its own debt and still have some cash reserve left over by 1988.
The following is a summary of the projected Income Accounts and relevant
ratios for the period 1984-1988.

F.   Economic Evaluation
(i) General
4.29      A set of ec&rLomic evaluation procedures and guidelines has been
prepared by N de M and SCT in consultation with the Bank. These guidelines
have been applied in analyzing the investment commitments for 1985, whether
or not Bank financing is involved, and will be applied in annual updatings of
the four-year investment program and the annual preparation of the investment
budget (para 4.05). The results show that the proposed 1985 rail investments
have estimated rates of return well above 12% (Table 4.12) and indicate the
economic feasibility of the proposed 1986-1988 investment. A few low-return
subprojects in the SCT program have been postponed pending further review.
An initial evaluation of the acquisition of passenger coaches indicated a
serious need and acceptable rate of return for replacement coaches, but did
not support the railway's recent contracting for 100 first-class special
coaches to be delivered in 1985 and 1986. Traffic is insufficient, and there
is a more substantial need for first and second-class replacement coaches.
Prior to negotiations, N de M reviewed its initial acquisition of first-class
special passenger coaches; it is attempting to limit the order to those
already set for delivery in 1985 and is considering the acquisition of first
or second-class coaches for 1986. Further purchases of first-class special
coaches should await appropriate marketing studies which take into account
the effects of the proposed tariff policy upon demand forecasts and confirm
the economic and financial feasibility of such coaches. The proposed
guidelines and the results for 1985 are described in Annexes 7 and 8.
4.30      The principal economic benefits of the rail investments are
(a) savings in rail operating costs as track conditions are improved and
train delays are reduced; and (b) savings from avoiding the diversion of
traffic to higher cost road transport by ensuring sufficient capacity for
existing and future traffic levels. A comparison of road and rail economic
transport costs reflecting the net difference in door-to-door costs, with
fuel prices adjusted to reflect international prices, showed that road
freight transport has a long-term variable economic cost per ton-km of about
Mex$ 3.95 (in 1983 prices), compared with a long-term variable rail cost of
Mex$ 1.50 per ton-km. For passengers, the long-term variable road cost is
about Mex$ 3-4 per pass-km, compared with rail costs, ranging from Hex$ 2 to
Mex$ 7 per pass-km, depending upon the type of service offered and the
traffic density on the line. Appropriate sensitivity analyses have been
applied in order to ensure investment viability despite uncertainty over
several parameters, i.e., the timing and magnitude of traffic diversion. The
results confirmed the economic feasibility of the evaluated items.
(ii) N de M
4.31      The analysis of the 1985 investment commitments in the N de M
program covers track rehabilitation works, signaling, locomotive and wagon
acquisition and rehabilitation and passenger coach acquisition. In addition,
track machinery and workshop equipment acquisitions have been incorporated
into the overall evaluation of the track rehabilitation works and locomotive
and wagon investments respectively. The total of the evaluated items
represents 87% of the 1985 investment budget for N de M, and the rates of
return ranged from 18% to 74%. Investment in telecommunications equipment,
representing 5% of the 1985 investment budget, relates to an overall
telecommunications program prepared and evaluated under a previous Bank



- 26 -
project. In this case, a technical review of the items to be financed was
carried out, but an economic evaluation was not considered necessary.
4.32      To confirm the scale and types of benefits being estimated for
N de M investments, a series of monitoring efforts are included in the Plan
of Action, particularly with regard to track maintenance and locomotive
rehabilitation (paras 4.22-4.23).
(iii) SCT
4.33      The analysis of the 1985 investment program for SCT infrastructure
works focused on ongoing as well as new works. The issue to be resolved was
whether subprojects initiated in previous years, most of which were reviewed
during the appraisal of the Fourth Railway Project, are still viable taking
into consideration cost increases and lower traffic forecasts since that
time. Much of the rail to be acquired and some of the civil works to be
tendered are for these ongoing subprojects. Tne economic evaluation provided
estimated rates of return with and without sunk costs. The results confirmed
the feasibility of most of the works, with rates of return ranging from 16%
to 56%. The double-tracking which was initiated between Ramos Arizpe and
Villa Garcia (US$43 million equivalent in 1985 prices) does not provide a
sufficient rate of return, and the works have been discontinued. In
addition. with regard to the Veracruz-Tampico new line (US$23 million
equivalent budgeted for 1985-1988), investment is being limited to ongoing
contracts until further studies clarify the economic feasibility of this
subproject.
4.34      To improve the analyses of capacity and the comparison of
alternative operational and capital improvements to expand line and yard
capacity, measures have been included in the Plan of Action (para 4.24).
G. Procurement, Disbursements and Auditing
4.35      Procedures for project implementation, including annual investment
plan update and review, procurement procedures, disbursement rates and
schedule and auditing requirements, are detailed in Annex 9. All items to be
procured and the civil works to be contracted using the proceeds of this loan
would be subject to international competitive bidding (ICB) as conducted
under the ongoing Fourth Railway Project (1929-ME) and the Second Highway
Sector Project (2428-ME), all in accordance with current Bank guidelines.
For goods and equipment, local manufacturers would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15% of the CIF cost of competing imports, or the relevant
prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower. For goods having an
estimated contract value equal to or less than US$500,000 equivalent, tender
documents and proposed awards would not be subject to prior review provided
that the aggregate of such contract amounts does not exceed US$50 million
equivalent. For goods having an estimated contract value of more than
US$500,000 equivalent and all remaining goods contracts, all draft tender
documents and proposed awards would be subject to prior review. All civil
works draft tender documents and procedures would be subject to prior
review. However, because of its proven capabilities and long experience with
the Bank, SCT would award and sign civil works contracts without Bank prior
review. Consultant services and related equipment would be acquired in
accordance with Bank guidelines.



- 27 -
4.36      The design and specifications of the freight cars to be
manufactured by CN are considered satisfactory. However, the proposed design
for the passenger coaches is relatively old in terms of current practice in
the rest of the world, where tubular, all-welded, anti-telescopic designs are
being used which are not only lighter but also relatively safer in case of
accidents. The Bank has, therefore, recommended to N de M and CN that, with
the substantial number of passenger coaches to be manufactured in the next
few years, CN should explore the possibility of modernizing the design of the
coach and importing the required technology to manufacture the new design.
If, therefore, this change of design can be accomplished without an
uneconomic increase in the price of the coach due to the change in
technology, it would be desirable to adopt the revised designs. It was
agreed at negotiations that N de M and CN will explore the possibility of
changeover to a more modern design for the passenger coach in the future and
review the matter with the Bank by December 31, 1985. Also, to ensure a
competitive overall cost for the coaches (for which the Bank is financing
onLly imported components), it was agreed at negotiations that N de M will
establish, by December 31, 1985, a system, acceptable to the Bank, for the
monitoring of costs of the passenger coaches to be acquired.
4.37      For imported goods, disbursements would be made on the basis of CIF
costs, and, with respect to bids won by local manufacturers under ICB,
disbursements would be made on the basis of 100% of the ex-factory costs.
With regard to civil works, the Bank would finance 100% of the estimated
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs, amounting to 35% of the total
cost of each work (excluding value added taxes, IVA) or 100% of the direct
foreign exchange expenditures. 7/ The Bank would also finance 100% of the
cost of consultant services and 100% of the foreign exchange costs for
equipment, computer software and scholarships under the technical assistance
and training programs. Disbursements for civil works would be made on the
basis of statements of expenditures. The estimated disbursement schedule for
the proposed loan, based on the assumption that the loan would become
effective by November 1985, is shown in Table 4.13, and is based on the
standard IBRD profile for railway projects. The closing date would be
June 30, 1992. It was agreed at negotiations that SCT would complete all
investments initiated under the project in a timely manner and would provide
the funds, facilities and other resources required.
4.38      Auditing would be conducted annually by independent auditors for
N de M and SCT accounts as currently agreed under ongoing projects. In
addition, it was agreed at negotiations that SCT and N de M would prepare
periodic reports for the Bank in accordance with an agreed schedule and
format covering the progress of the project and the Plan of Action
(paras 4.19-4.26) and that a project completion report (PCR) would be
prepared within six months of the closing date. It should be noted that,
because of the comprehensiveness of this project, it would require more
supervision than the average for the sector, estimated at about 26
staff-weeks per year.
7/ The foreign exchange component for civil works is based on a detailed
consultant study, contracted by the Government, which analyzed the
composition of the various items and tasks in railway construction works.

H.   Assessment of Risk
4.39      The Railway Sector Project has been prepared on the basis of the
experiences of the previous four railway projects and has been designed in
accordance with the present economic circumstances of Mexico and the
projected outlook for 1985-1988. Two risks are related to the investment
plan: that projected traffic may not materialize, as was the case under
previous projects; or that Government budgetary allocations may be further
restricted and limit the amount of railway investment. With regard to
traffic, the average rate of growth projected is well below the estimates of
previous projects (5.1% per year, compared with about 7.6-7.8%). Also, in
previous projects, the economic evaluation of investments has been subject to
sensitivity tests in order to ensure feasibility under varying
circumstances. In addition, annual updating of investment plans will be
carried out in accordance with updated traffic estimates. Last, the
financial evaluation is based on a low" traffic estimate to confirm that
premature investments which may occur would not have a significant impact
upon the financial status of N de M. With regard to concerns on the
availability of counterpart fundings, agreement on minimum budgetary levels
for spare parts and track maintenance is being sought under the project in
order to minimize the impact of budgetary constraints upon basic maintenance
requirements.
4.40      One uncertainty is the extent to which the Government will continue
acting on its policy of reducing subsidies and raising prices to reflect the
cost of services as political pressures mount. There is no effective way of
reducing this uncertainty. It should be noted, however, that the present
administrations of both the Government and N de M have clearly stated their
policy objectives, which are consistent with those of the project, and have
taken substantive actions since 1982 which confirm their commitment to those
policies.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      At negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) that N de M will extend the economic evaluation guidelines to the
other railways' investment plans as they are incorporated within
N de M, and will maintain records with respect to project targets
which will exclude any newly incorporated railways (para 3.02);
(b) that tariffs for all rail commodities will be at least equal to
long-term variable costs by January 1988 (paras 3.14 and 4.20 (a));
(c) that by November of each year, beginning in 1985, N de M and SCT
will update the four-year investment program for Bank comment
(para 4.05);

(k) that N de M will prepare a marketing strategy by April 1987
(para 4.21 (d));
(1) that sufficient budgetary allocations will be provided for
locomotive maintenance (para 4.22 (a));
(m) that an agreed locomotive scrapping program will be executed
(para 4.22 (b));
(n) that the OCS will be fully installed by June 1986 (para 4.22 (c));
(a) that the cost and productivity of rehabilitated locomotives will be
monitored (para 4.22 (d));
(p) that sufficient budgetary allocations will be provided annually for
track maintenance (para 4.23 (a));
(q) that N de M will monitor and report annually on the
productivity of mechanized maintenance units (para 4.23 (b));
(r) that N de M will install and train on a Train Performance
Calculator by June 1987 (para 4.24 (a));
(s) that N de M will carry out a master plan study for future yards by
September 1986 (para 4.24 (b));
(t) that N de m -will carry out a middle-management training program
(para 4.25);
(u) that the subiect of revised passenger-coach designs will be
reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1985 and that N de M will
establish a system for monitoring the costs of passenger coaches by
that date (para 4.36); and
(v) that SCT will complete all investments (para 4.37).



- 30 -
5.02      At negotiations, agreement on the following was confirmed:
(a) railway targets (para 4.26);
(b) procurement procedures and guidelines (para 4.35);
(c) disbursement procedures (para 4.37);
(d) auditing arrangements (para 4.38); and
(e) project reporting requirements (4.38).
5.03       A condition for loan effectiveness would be that the Government and
N de M have furnislied a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank for the
tariff reclassification of commodities and have taken initial action to
reclassify some of the commodities still carried at tariffs below long-term
variable costs (para 3.14).
5.04      Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed
project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$300.0 million, with a term of
15 years, including a grace period of three years.

RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Major Sectoral Issues
Scope and Timing of New Transport Investment
1.        The main issue in the transport sector is the appropriate scope and
timing of transport investments. Indications are that traffic is recovering
from the declines registered in 1982. The most impressive recovery has been
on the railways. Freight on Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M) grew
by 13% in 1983 and by about 3% in 1984. Slower recovery has been estimated
for the other modes. Investment, however, was held down in 1983 and 1984
(about US$1.2-1.5 billion equivalent per year), and no major increases are
expected in 1985 as the Government continues to keep the lid on the budget.
Although there are a number of major new investments which the Government
wishes to implement, limited budget allocations have restricted such
projects, and SCT continues to focus primarily on maintenance and
reconstruction and on the completion of major ongoing works, such as the
doubling and electrification of the railway line between Mexico and Queretaro
and the new line between Guadalajara and Monterrey, the Lazaro Cardenas
industrial port and the Coatzacoalcos and Tampico bridges. Major new
investment outlays being considered are priority toll road widenings, the
coastal rail line between Tampico and Veracruz, continuing works at the
Altamira industrial port and at Manzanillo, extending railway electrification
from Queretaro to Irapuato and providing new airport capacity for Mexico
City. Other investments being studied are a suburban rail link between
Toluca and Mexico City and the northern road bypass, providing direct access
between northern Mexican cities and those to the east and south of Mexico
City. Most of these decisions will depend upon the expected timing and
structure of the economic recovery, the projected level of import
substitution and its impact upon grain imports and related transport
facilities, the transport requirements of non-traditional exports, and the
progress of industrial decentralization and urban deconcentration efforts.
The Bank's lending and sector work programs are designed to help the
Government to formulate an appropriate response to transport demand through
improved pricing policies and operational efficiency as well as investment
planning.
Fuel Pricing
2.        A Bank-financed road user charges study in 1975 found that refined
petroleum products were being priced at the pump well below world market
prices. This situation worsened as domestic inflation surged and gasoline
and diesel prices remained no higher than US$0.42 and US$0.18 per gallon
respectively during 1981. Since December 1981, however, the Government has
followed a policy of gradually raising domestic fuel prices toward
international levels (Table 1 of this annex). From December 1981 to January



- 58 -                               ANNEX 1
1985, gasoline prices rose from Mex$ 7/liter to Mex$ 70/liter
(US$1.38/gallon) for extra and Mex$ 2.8/liter to Mex$ 55/liter
(US$1.08/gallon) for regular, a real increase of 76% and 247% respectively.
Diesel prices were raised even more significantly from Mex$ 1.17/liter to
Mex$ 31.2/liter (US$0.61/gallon) for a real increase of over 367%. While
gasoline prices are above international levels (US$0.79/gallon), diesel
prices are about 77% of international price levels of US$0.79/gallon. 1/ In
January, the Government approved a monthly increase in diesel prices of 2.5%
to the end of this year, which, if coupled with additional periodic
increases, should gradually raise diesel prices in real terms.
3.         Action taken since the Second Highway Sector Loan (2428-ME) was
presented to the Board in May 1984 show that the Government continues to be
committed to resolving the fuel pricing issue and is trying to reduce the
price differential between diesel and gasoline while approaching
international levels. This policy has been confirmed by officials of SHCP
during the semi-annual discussions with the Bank. Understandably, political
concerns have determined the timing of the price increases. With the present
level of prices, no major distortions are evident in the transport
sector 2/. However, it is important that the Government not lose ground in
its efforts to reach international price levels, primarily to ensure pricing
equity among transport modes and among the various vehicle operators on the
nation's roads. The road user charges study (paras 4-6) is expected to focus
on the underpricing of diesel-operated vehicles on the roads and to propose
appropriate tax changes in this respect.
Road User Charges
4.         Related to the issue of fuel prices is the question of whether the
various road-related tolls and taxes imposed on road users sufficiently cover
the cost of providing road infrastructure. The general principle to be
applied in determining a minimum equitable distribution of user charges
should be that users pay the full costs of owning and operating the vehicle
and the attributable costs of operating, maintaining and reconstructing the
roadway, which vary in accordance with the number and weight of the various
types of vehicles. The charges which enter into this calculation in Mexico
include road and bridge tolls, fees for licensing, permits and public
transport concessions, producer taxes for tires and vehicles (over and above
normal taxation level), special import duties on vehicles and special taxes
on fuel. None of these charges are directly assigned to roads or identified
as road user charges, and all enter the federal treasury to be distributed in
accordance with general budgetary practices. Even road and bridge tolls
collected by the Toll Road and Bridge Authority, Caminos y Puentos Federales
(CyPF), are def±ned as being a tax and are turned over to the federal
treasury.
5.        With the surge in inflation, the subsequent devaluations and price
changes, an updated analysis of road user charges is required. Prior studies
and Bank estimates showed that the gross receipts from user taxes covered all

- 59 -                              ANNEX 1
administrative, construction, reconstruction and maintenance costs for the
federal, state and local networks. However, fuel tax revenues represented
the major contribution in these analyses, based on the fact that special
taxes on fuel reprepent about 45% of the total pump price. Since pump prices
are generally at or below international levels or their opportunity costs,
fuel tax revenues, in economic terms, cannot be considered as a contribution
to road infrastructure. Without this element, the results of the prior
analyses would be negative, with economic road user charges covering little
more than maintenance and administration. The deficit is apparently not
equally distributed over the network. A Bank-sponsored sector study of the
Mexican toll roads found that, with the increases in tolls along the 1,000-km
toll road network of almost 500% in the past year, gross toll revenues (about
US$135 million) should have been sufficient, in 1984, to cover all
administrative, operating and maintenance costs of CyPF and all debt service,
as well as to contribute to capital extensions and widenings.
6.        As fuel prices near international levels, it is time for the
Government to attempt to resolve the road user charges issue. A road user
charges study has been initiated which will focus on the overall balance
between tax receipts and road expenditures and on the allocation of taxes and
costs by type of interurban road user. Prior analyses concluded that
diesel-powered commercial vehicle operators, particularly for heavy trucks,
were paying a lower percentage of the costs that they impose upon the network
than were other types of road users. The study is expected to recommend
additional taxes to resolve observed deficiencies. SCT will complete the
study by December 1985 and will subsequently discuss with the Bank
alternative policy options and timing for resolving identified deficiencies.
Railway Financial Status
7.        The issues relating to the railways' financial status are discussed
in detail in Annex 2 and, thus, are not treated here.
Port Charges
8.        Port dues, levied on ships, and wharfage charges, levied on cargo -
intended to cover the capital costs of port infrastructure, its maintenance
and administration - long ago ceased to bear any relation to such costs.
Even though the present Government drastically increased port dues in 1983,
revenues from both port dues and wharfage were estimated to cover no more
than 22% of annual depreciation of the current value of SCT's port assets.
The Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port Project (Loan 2450-ME), therefore,
required that SCT complete a study of port dues by September 1985 and an
action plan for the progressive application of cost-related port charges.
9.        Port charges for services given to ships and cargr by the Port
Operating Companies (ESPs) have generally been adjusted to keep pace with
inflation. The SCT's Directorate General for Operations has declared its
commitment to keeping such operating companies financially self-sufficient.
Specifically for Lazaro Cardenas, a cost and tariff study of port services
has been undertaken, and it is intended to serve as a mDdel for such studies
throughout the port subsector.

.Rural Road Maintenance
10.       Rural road maintenance is lacking nationwide.  Since 1971, the
Government's attention has been directed at the construction of rural roads
with minimum design standards. With over 80,000 km built in ten years, the
requirements for maintenance, particularly periodic maintenance including
spot improvements, are accumulating rapidly. Rural road inventory procedures
have been inappropriate for identifying maintenance requirements, and it is
clear, from limited field inspections, that the need is significant and that
the US$300/km allocated in 1983 hardly met 50% of the needs. In the state of
Chiapas, estimates were made on the cost of routine and periodic maintenance
which showed that about US$800/km is required, of which about 552 represents
periodic and emergency maintenance. Taking into account the deferred
maintenance works, it is expected that the budgetary requirements in the
coming years may be even higher in several states. Under the Second Highway
Sector Project (Loan 2428-ME), the Government agreed to provide adequate
resources to maintain rural roads appropriately. Already, in 1984, the
Government increased the rural roads maintenance budget by over 45Z in real
terms and has projected substantial increases in future years by allowing
rural road construction funds to be use' for reconstruction purposes as
well. To assist ir defining the specific level of resources required, the
Government has initiated a rural roads inventory which is expected to cover
100% of the network by June 1987, applying agreed upon inventory procedures.
The Government will develop a program of periodic maintenance works from the
inventory data and will review progress with the Bank during the semi-annual
meetings through supervision of the highway loan.

RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
N de M Financial Status and Forecast Details
A. Financial Performance to Date
(i) Operating Results
1.        Despite the steady growth in traffic over the years of the Third
Railway Project (1975-1981) (1.7% annually in tons, and 4.7% in ton-km), the
gap between N de M's revenue and costs widened considerably. In real terms,
revenues increased by 6.3% over this period, while costs rose by 20.3%, with
the operating loss growing by 80%. Only after the crisis of 1982, reduced
traffic, and the coming to power of a new Government administration were
serious steps taken to reverse this trend. Tariffs were increased in early
June and September by 50% and 40% (freight), and 25Z and 40% (passengers)
respectively, following on the 35% (freight and passenger) tariff increase or
mid-December 1982, plus a 4.5% passenger fare increase on January 6, 1983.
The combined effect of these increases, together with the increase in traffic
of 1983 (some 12.9% in ton-km freight and 20% in passenger-km over 1982
figures) 1, was a 28% real increase in N de W's revenues for that year as
compared to 1982.   Higher utilization of capacity and more efficient
operations management, while costs were kept strictly under control, resulted
in lower real working costs and the first working surplus ever in the
railway's recent history.
2.                Table 1 of this annex gives audited revenue statements for
the years 1980-1983 in current pesos, and an estimate for 1984. Because of
the impact on costs of inflation and of currency devaluation in Mexico, and
of tariff increases on railway revenues, it is difficult to compare actual
figures with those forecast at the beginning of the Fourth Railway Project
(Loan 1929-ME). However, a review of the targeted and actual financial
ratios shows that there has been solid improvement. The working and
operating ratios improved from 1.38 and 1.60 respectively in 1980, to 0.85
and 1.08 in 1983, which was better than the Loan 1929-ME appraisal forecast.
3.        For comparison purposes, the annual revenue and expenditure figures
of Table 1 have been deflated to 1980 values, using domestic consumer price
indices, and are given on the next page in summarized form (details in
Table 2 of this annex).

4.        Table 2 indicates that, while railway operating revenues increased
slightly in 1981 in real terms, they fell sharply in 1982, despite the four
tariff increases of that year, but increased to the 1980 level again in 1983,
with the aid of further tariff increases which exceeded the inflation rate
(Table 3.4 of the text). The improvement in N de M's financial performance
has come about largely as a result of reduced operating costs. The better
usage of the railways' capacity (illustrated by the figures on page 2 of
Table 3.2) clearly indicates N de M's more efficient control and management
of its resources. In addition, the Government's policy of restricting wage
increases resulted in railway labor costs declining substantially, in real
terms, since 1981. M4aterials (including fuel) costs have also declined in
real terms since 1980, probably because of lower consumption of spares for
locomotives and rolling stock, and also because of reduced traffic in 1982
and financial stringencv in other years. Net expenditure on car rentals had
become a net revenue item by 1983 because of increased efficiency in the use
of rolling stock (see Table 3.2, page 2 - Operational Efficiencies).
5.       Against these reductions in operating costs, financial costs have
risen sharply, largely because of the continual devaluation of the Mexican
peso. In 1983, loan interest absorbed 46% of operating revenues, compared
with only 21% in 1980. Total debt service in 1983 amounted to MexS 37
billion in current pesos (about USS250 million eauivalent).
6.       Although annual depreciation was nominally increased from MexS 2.9
billion in 1.980 to MexS 14.3 billion in 1983, the annual amounts declined,
in constant pesos, in 1981 and 1982, but, after the fixed assets revaluation
of 1983, rose again above the 1980 level. Annual revaluation of assets is
mandatory when annual inflation exceeds 50%.

-65 -                               ANNEX 2
calculates the long-term variable costs of freight commodities and of
individual passenger services. Long-term variable costs (LTVC) are
distinguished from short-term ones (STVC) by the inclusion of depreciation
and interest (real) on assets used, in calculating the unit costs.
11.      Cost data prepared by N de M for the various main freight traffics,
using actual costs to date, revised to reflect the inflation expected in 1984
and compared with revenues, taking into account the latest tariff increase,
show that, for about 62% of the traffic (in terms of tonnage), revenues now
cover at least their respective LTVCs. N de M's cost calculations
consistently show that, for freight traffic, such variable costs amount to
77% of fully distributed costs. These cost and revenue data, which cover a
broad sample (82%) of the estimated 1984 freight tonnage, indicate that
total freight revenues would be Mex$ 121 billion as against total variable
costs of Mex$ 112 billion, giving a contribution of Mex$ 9 billion toward
fixed costs.
12.       The revenues for certain major traffics (including iron ore,
cement, coal, coke, sugar cane, dolomite and lime), totaling about 23.6
million tons (about 38% of the 1984 estimated total), will fail, however, to
cover their estimated LTVCs. The tariffs charged for these commodities
lie mostly within the lower three or four of the 20 classes of N de M's
tariff discussed in the following paragraphs. Table 3.6 of the text gives,
for 24 main commodities, data concerning tariff class, average haul, and
estimates, for 1984, of tonnages, variable costs and revenues, together with
ratios of the percentage coverage of revenues over costs, of the degree to
which highway truck tariffs exceed those of the railway, and of the
percentage which the average rail cost bears to the product selling price.
For the majority of the rail freight traffics listed in this table, the rail
cost element of total selling price is well under 10% - thus, even increases
of 50% or more in the rail tariff would not mater'ally affect delivered
costs. However, in the case of thr-ee of the major traffics (coal, dolomite
and gypsum), the table indicates rail cost percentages of 23.0, 18.3 and 36.4
respectively. Coal and dolomite are low rated commodities, the revenues from
which do not cover variable costs, and for which the Government has been
reluctant to allow N de M to raise tariffs substantially.
13.       Passenger fares are calculated at a flat rate per km of travel.  As
of September 1, 1984, the rates were: 2/
First Class - Numbered Seats         Mex$ 2.145 per pass-km
First Class - Sleeping Car           MexS 1.801 per pass-km
First Class - Special Car             Mex$ 1.801 per pass-km
First Class - Regular Car            Mex$ 1.466 per pass-km
Second Class                         Mex$ 0.877 per pass-km
Rail Cars                            Mex$ 1.801 per pass-km
There are separate charges for special facilities, such as berths in sleeping
cars.  These rates per pass-km are extremely low, at about, or less than, one
U.S. cent per pass-km. It is obvious that such low fares are wholly
2/ These fares include 15% government tax, payable to the Treasury by
N de M.



- 66 -                              ANNEX 2
insufficient to pay for the services provided.  In 1983, the direct costs
(including depreciation and interest) for passenger services amounted to
Mex$ 12.8 billion (including express parcel service and mail), against which
revenues of only about Mex$ 4.2 billion were received, making a loss of
Mex$ 8.6 billion.
14.       Reducing the number of classes, particularly at the lower end,
would simplify N de M's tariff, and, by shifting lower rated commodities into
higher classes, would automatically generate u.z-p revenues.  SCT, however, is
not disposed to change the present rigid classifiz'ation, although it agrees,
in principle, to move those items not covering LTV'C to a higher class and to
introdtuce some commercial flexibility within controlled bounds. Indeed, to
be able to use such commercial flexibility, the present costing done by
N de M would need considerable refinement. This would be part of the
technical assistance rendered under the proposed loan.
C. Principal Financial Issues
i5.       The preceding discussion has indicated that, while N de M's
financial performance has improved over the last two years, several problem
areas remain to be solved before a satisfactory situation is achieved. These
are discussed in the paragraphs following.
(i) Freight Tariffs
16.       Revenues from freight and passenger tariffs have been insufficient
to meet working expenses (except in 1983), depreciation and interest, let
alone provide reserves for developnent. Furthermore, the structure of
freight tariffs contains several distortions, such that, for several
important commodities, the revenues fali tu cover even the related long-term
variable costs. The problem of dealing with tariffs is compounded by the
continued inflation in Mexico. This has generally resulted in corrective
tariff action being too late, and leads to reluctance on the part of the
Government to take effective rail tariff action, for fear of adding .o
inflationary pressure.   Similarly, with regard to specific tariff increases,
major commodities incurring the highest deficits are often low priced
products for which transport costs represent a high proportion of the
delivered price, making specific increases politically sensitive. Thus, even
though the Government has agreed that restructuring of N de M's tariff is
necessarv no action has yet been taken.
(ii) Passenger services
17.       Revenues from passenger fares are well below their short run
variable costs. The Government is reluctant to raise rares sufficently to
cover costs, particularly since the rolling stock is old, and the services
provided are generally poor. Even when freight tariffs are raised, passenger
fares are often increased at a lower rate, if at all. In conjunction with
the Fourth Railway Project, the Government agreed to reimburse N de M for the
losses incurred by operating passenger services. In addition, N de M has
recently concluded a comprehensive study of passenger ser.ices; its
conclusions and recommendations are discussed in Annex 6. A progressive
reduction of all passenger service subsidies is proposed such that all
services reach LTVC by January 1988, except for certain second-class
passenger services for which fares may be set below LTVC because of social
and economic consideratIons.



- 67 -                               AN NEX 2
(iii) Debt Burden
18.       Servicing of N de M's debt has become an increasing problem for the
railway, which so far has been unable to contribute, from its own resources,
any funds for this purpose. A considerable proportion of this debt,
estimated at about 40%, was incurred to finance operating losses, or related
debt service, and was the result of the Government's refusal to allow timely
tariff adjustments when costs were rising steeply.
19.       In order to limit the debt burden to manageable proportions,
related purely to capital investments, enab'iL"tg LthL railway to reach
financial autonomy by 1988, the Government would need to assume no less than
40% of N de M's long-term debt.
D. Financial Projections
(i)   Assumptions Used
20.       The financial projections presented in this report are made in 1984
pesos or dollars. For revenue projections, the low traffic forecasts
(Annex 3) have been used, with freight increasing at a rate of 3% per year.
These traffic forecasts have been converted to revenues using (a) the revised
freight tariff of September 1, 1984 and (b) the revised passenger fares of
March 1, 1984. In addition, projected freight revenues have been increased
annually by a conservative 2% per year, in real terms, although Government
officials project 3-5% per year tariff increase. The reclassification of
certain cargoes, now being carried at rates lower than variable cost, is
taken into account, and it is assumed that some action on this matter will be
taken by spring of 1985. This last item is estimated to add approximately 5%
to the annual freight revenue base. For passenger traffic revenues, the
presently agreed upon LTVC's specific passenger subsidy, to make up the
approximately 40% of costs not covered by fares, has been included in the
revenue projections, even though Government commitment will be sought to
progressively raise fares and reduce subsidies.
21.       On the cost side, wages and salaries have been forecast to take
into account:
(a) the wage awards of 1984;
(b) the slight increase in manpower forecast over the project period
(about 3.4% overall); and
(c) the effect of incentive pay, which forms part of the last labor
agreement and of the Modernization Plan for the Railways. Since
precise details are not yet available on the manner in which the
incentive pay will be calculated, reserves have been built into the
forecasts.
A further assumption is that wages and salaries will be held at this real
level in the face of inflation throughout the project period.
22.        It is assumed that pensions, due to those pensioners not yet
covered by the Social Security Institute (IMSS), will continue to be paid
directly by the railway; the cost has been removed from the railway
operational expenses and classified as non-operating expenses. The forecasts



- 68 -                              ANNEX 2
also take into account reimbursement of these costs by the Government, as
confirmed by Government officials. Materials cost (other than fuel) is
assumed to increase in accordance with traffic forecast increases. For fuel
and lubricants costs, the consumption is based on freight and passenger
locomotive-km, which, in turn, are derived from the forecasts of freight
ton-km and passenger-km, using average past indices. Consumption in liters
is costed at the current 1984 price. Net car rentals are expected to become
positive in line with freight traffic and better utilization of rolling
stock.
23.       Depreciation is calculated at an average annual rate of 2.5% on the
gross fixed-assets value as of the end of the previous financial year, which
is the weighted average of different categories of structures and equipment.
24.       Forecast loan interest charges take into account present long-term
debt and the effect of assumed new debt (proposed new IBRD loan, Exim-Bank
and other commercial lenders).  In addition, 36% has been added as the
estimated average effect of peso devaluation in 1984. For long-term debt,
the Government's agreement to assume a portion of N de M's existing debt over
three years is assumed to be initiated in 1985. The 46% assumed is
equivalent to the total of former loans incurred by N de M to cover
operational losses when timely Government agreement on needed tariff
increases was not forthcoming, and the amounts of Government contributions
were insufficient to cover resulting operational deficits.  The estimated
peso devaluation during 1984 is also taken into account. This form,er
long-term debt becomes Government equity in N de M.
(ii) Forecast Results

fund flows and balance sheets are presented in Tables 4 to 6 of this annex.

26.       The forecast financial situation indicates a considerable
improvement in N de M's financial performance. While the railway has made
significant progress to date, particularly in unit cost reductions, largely
by carrying more traffic with only minor increases in its labor force,
further action is required to enhance revenues, reduce losses caused by
passenger traffic, and relieve N de M of some of its debt burden. The
actions which form the basis of the financial projections imply a continued
commitment by the Government to its stated policy of putting the railway on a
sound financial basis.
27.       The forecast funds-flow shows that, although N de M's revenues
will, in each year, be more than adequate to cover working expenses, the net
operating revenues, because of the impact of depreciation, will not be
sufficient to cover loan interest. However, by 1988, its cash generation
will be adequate to service both interest and loan repayments, and a modest
return on the current value of net fixed assets will be earned. Forecast
cash flows are shown in Table 5 of this annex.
28.       The table shows that, even with N de M's improved earnings and ca,h
generation, considerable sums will still be needed annually from the
Government, ranging from US$337 million equivalent in 1985 to US$460 million
equivalent in 1987. Despite the Government's assumption of some of the debt,
N de M's remaining debt service obligation is considerable - on the order of
US$240-300 million equivalent annually.
29.       Investment, in the years 1986-1988, includes assets financed by SCT
(largely track works) and handed over to N de M on completion. The actual
investment by SCT during the project period is much higher, as noted in
Annex 5.

MEXICO
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Basis of Freight Traffic Forecasts
A. The Economy and Railway Traffic Growth
1.   For the three decades preceding the mid-1970s, Mexico was very
successful in achieving rapid economic growth while also maintaining
stability in prices and the balance of payments. From 1940 to 1970, Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth exceeded 6% in real terms, inflation averaged
less chan 5% per year from the mid-1960s to 1972, and the dollar value of the
peso, fixed in 1954, was maintained until 1976. During the mid-_970s,
however, Mexico experienced increasing public sector deficits, inflation,
large balance-of-payments deficits, capital flight and a marked slowdown in
the real rate of GDP growth, dropping to less than 3.57 in 1Q77. Ecnnomic
stabilization measures, followed by major oil discoveries, refueled the
Mexican economy, and GDP rose by 8-9% from 1978 to 1981.  This suirge was
short-lived, however, as the oil market slackened, interest rates rose on the
debt acquired to support increasing investment, an appreciating peso Proded
the competitiveness of domestic tradeable sectors and private capital fled.
GDP dropped by 0.5% in 1982 and hy 5.3% in 1983.
2.   With the comprehensive stabilization program oIf the new administration
which took office in December 1982, the prospects for economic recovery are
good. In 1984, GDP is expected to have risen by 3.5%, and a growth of 4.5%
is projected for 1985, reaching 5.5-6% by 1988. The forecast depends upon a
broadening of Mexico's trade base beyond oil, the development of
non-traditional exports and a rationalization of public sector pricing and
investment policies.
3.   Transport has always been a key element in the successful development of
Mexico, and the railways, despite their low share in overall traffic (14% of
all ton-km or 23% of road and -a-l ton-km), are crucial to the efficient
functioning of several sectors. The railways carry about 40% of all heans,
about 30% of all sorghum, about 50% of all wheat and ahout 10% of all corn
p:oduced and imported by Mexico. The railways are also the principal carrier
for iron ore, coke, coal and sugar and are a maior carrier of fertilizers,
cement and many steel products. The importance of the railways was
underscored in 1978-1979 when the country's surge in econnmic growth and a
record import of grain due to a poor local harvest put a severe strain upon
existing infrastructure capacitv. Inadequate railwav services affected the
movement of basic grains, iron ore and pellets for the steel industry, raw
materials and finished products for the fertilizer industry and industrial
imports to serve oil expansion by PEMEX. Furthermore, the railways are
considered essential to new industrial development in areas outside Mexico
City, the industrial ports of Lazaro Cardenas and Altamira.
4.   Railway traffic has generally followed the growth in GDP.  From 1970 to
1984, both GDF and railway freight ton-km increased hy an average annual rate
of 5.1%. N de M's freight traffic grew from 3q.1 million tons and 18.4
billion ton-kin in 1970 to an estimated 61.9 million toT;s and 37.1 billion



- 77 -                              ANNEX 3
ton-km by 1984, with ton-km growing faster than tons (5.1% compared wit'
3.3%) as average hauls increased from 470 to about 600 km per ton during the
1970-1984 period (Table 3.3 of the text). In contrast to the worldwide
trend, Mexico's railway traffic has increased steadily, and railway's share
in the transport of its principal commodities has not changed significantly
except in the case of petroleum and derivatives, for which pipelines have
replaced rail se-vices. Excluding petroleum products, the historic annual
growth for N de M tons and ton-km from 1970 to 1984 is 3.7% and 5.7%
respectively.
5.   The most important group of commodities, in terms of ton-km, carried by
N de M consists of intermediate industrial products (cements, fertilizers,
sugar, petrochemicals and steel) representing 32% of total ton-km in 1984,
mineral products representing 27% and agricultural products 25%. This
distribution is similar to the composition of traffic in 1970, with the
reduction in petroleum products being distributed proportionately. The main
commodities, in order of ton-km in 1984, are iron ore (17%), fertilizers
(6%), sorghum (6%), cement (6%), corn (5%), wheat (4%), fuel oil (4%) and
coal (4%).
6.   Traffic mainly follows a radial pattern with Mexico City as the focal
point. The main corridors are Mexico-Queretaro-Guadalajara-Manzanillo;
Mexico-Queretaro-Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo; Mexico-Queretaro-Torreon-Ciudad
Juarez; and Mexico-Veracruz-Coatzacoalcos. There are also a growing number
of traffic movements between secondary cities such as Guadalajara and
Monterrey which require roundabout routings because of the radial pattern of
the network. The heaviest traffic flow (freight) is between Mexico City,
Queretaro, Irapuato and Guadalajara, ranging from over 8.5 to 14.5 million
net tons per year. North of Queretaro to Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo at the
U.S. border, traffic flows range from over 3 million to over 8 million net
tons annually. The other major cargo flow from Mexico City toward Veracruz
and Coatzacoalcos ranges from over 3 million to 4.5 million net tons per
year.
B. Forecast Methodology
7.   Previous traffic forecasts prepared by N de M in conjunction with Bank
projects have proven to be over-optimistic. The Third Railway Project
(Loan 1232-ME) estimated an annual growth rate of 7.8% for ton-km from 1974
to 1980, compared with an actual rate of 4.6% during that period. Similarly,
under the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1929-ME), the forecast for 1979-1984
was an increase of 7.6% in ton-km per year, compared with the actual rate of
3.8%. Two factors make railway freight forecasting ditficult in Mexico. The
first is the volatility of the Mexican economy. Both the Third and Fourth
Railway Projects covered periods of severe economic recession in 1976 and
1982. The second factor is the uncertainty regarding grain imports. The
railways carry a high percentage of gra'n imports so that, in years of poor
harvests, rail tonnage increases while, in years of good harvests, rail
tonnage declines. Mexico thus revises its forecasts every year and adjusts
its investment plans, particularly for locomotives and rolling stock,
accordingly.

8.   To minimize the problem of tincertainty, the proposed project institutes
the following with regard to rall traffie forecasts:
(a)  forecasting methodology and data hase have br-en upgraded,
particularlv for grain;
(b)  an annual review process Is heing I nstitittlonal ized; and
(c)  two forecasts have ben prepared:  :i commervial forecast following
N de M's detailed prodLct-by-prodict met1thodology and a low forecast
based on the hi storical tendency i,f the last 14 ye.ars.
The commercial forecast has been appli ed to determinen Investment requirements
to ensure that the railways h.vi' s;ufficient caparcitv to serve thie identifIed
market.  The low forecast has bten used in the financial projection to ensure
that N de M will be ahle to maintain an adtqritiate financial position even if
investments are wade and expected tra"1< f1 c es nct m:iterialIze.
9.   The traffic forecasts prepared hy N' dc M andl revlivwed by the Bank were
based on a product-by-prodtuct ;an.alvsis.  T!ho -level ol' detail applied varied
by type of product, depending on itS Importanct to overall  tr.affic, degree of
"eaptiveness" and commercial possibilities  tor significant change In N de M's
market share.  For major produicts, special re-ports were prepared hased on
discussions with affected industrivs on their expected transport needs.  For
other commodities, appropriate statistical relationships were developed with
population, GDP and other variables.  For grain products, a consultant study
was commissioned.  All ra,I traffic -was ass!gied to the lines related to
projected origins and destinations for  izijor commoditles or In accordance
with the present line distribution for other prdchic-ts.
10.  The commercial forecast for 10.84-]989 predicts .an ;nrc-0  lricrease in
rail tonnage of 5.3% and in ton-kmn of 5.O!'-, rising from 61.9 to 76.2 millIon
tons and 37.1 to 45.2 billion ton-km (Trnblv L i of tibe text).  The distance
per ton Is expected  to stabilizv at ahmtw  'Al3 km.  Major traffic Increases
are expected for certain grains and intermed':te ind'ivtrial preducts for
which N de M believes it can attaIn a highir rmark'et. *h:hre and Is targeting
special commercial efforts.  Tht *iow" forecast whlcbh  .  ipplied in the
financial evaluation assumes an alnnu.il growth r-;- _! f aboui 3.0O/ for tonnage,
reaching 66.6 million tons and 41.9 b[11'mn ton-r-I'  1w 19HR, hased upon the
historical trend over the ls.t l*4 v':irs.
C. Agricultural Products
11.  N de M's agricultural trafflc is pro fecte-d- to grow hy about 5.27
annuallv.  A consultant study, commissioned h,v N de M. projected national
consumption, domestic production and req1irot; importatior. for basic oralns.
This forecast was used to develop a table- of oriylns ^r.nd dsstirations to
determine transport requirements. Roaid and r.ii' traffic were analyzed to
assess each mode's comparative advantage, .nnL .i"1al assignment was made
based on cost, current shipper preference .n_ th--  ailway's assessment of
potential increases in market share.  Pnlv m!74al traffic increases are
expected for corn and wheat as internal production improves, :es.sening
imports and, thus, rail demand.  The most signific-int increases are expected
for sorghum.  With the concentration cf douestic production ix. northeastern



- 79 -                              ANNEX 3
Mexico, sorghum is a prime candidate for increasing railways' modal share. In
recent years, railway sorghum traffic has increased well above the average
for other commodities, and a newly consolidated shipping office for CONASUPO,
the national grain marketing company, and the continued favorable tariff
differential should assure this market for N de M.
D. Miueral Products
12. Mineral traffic is expected to grow by about 2.7% per year. Iron ore,
which represents over half of this traffic, is the major element in this
below-average growth because a slurry pipeline of 380 km, constructed by
SIDERMEX, will divert traffic away from N de M to the AHMSA Monclova and
Fundidora Monterrey steel plants. Also, any new steel Dlant capacity
expansions are expected to be located near ports and served by imported iron
ore such as the Altamira projects of SIDERMEX and HYLSA. For existing
movements, an analysis was made of iron ore reserves and possible changes in
traffic patterns.
13. Coal traffic was analyzed in a manner similar to that used for iron ore
and is expected to grow by 4.2% annually. The main growth in demand is to
serve the AIMSA steel. plants at Monclova, reaching almost 3 million tons per
year by 1983. Some traffic growth is also expected to the SICARTSA plant at
Lazaro Carde.-as by 1986.
E. Petroleum and Derived Products
14. Although petroleum and related products traditionally have left the
railways ir favor of pipelines, there have been increasing movements of fuel
oil carried in PEMEX-owned tank cars, increasing by 12.3% per year from 1980
to 1984. N de M planners are cautious about this traffic and its potential
and have projected a 4.1% annual increase to 1988 based on forecast fuel oil
production.
F. Inorganic Products
15. Limestone represents 36% of railway tonnage in inorganic products; it is
expected to grow from 2.8 million tons in 1984 to 3.6 million tons in 1986
and then remain constant. The underlving assumption is that new cement
plants will locate near their primary product sources and that railway
traffic growth will be limited to the expansion of existing plants,
especially at Tlanepantla.
G. Industrial Products
16. The category of industrial products covers a wide variety of commodities
and is the area ii. which N de M expects to focus more intensive marketing
efforts during the next four years. Overall growth is expected to be 6.9%
per year. Sugar traffic, which represents 10% of the product tonnage in this
category, is expected to grow by 6.2% per year, assuming that N de M's share
of national production will stay constant at about 55%. Similarly, cement
traffic, about 34% of N de M's industrial products tonnage, is expected to
grow by 6.5% per year as the railways maintain about a 30% share of total
production, taking new plants into account. In 1984, cement traffic rose by
26% as the railways carried new cement exports, an indication of the
railwayst role in the movemei.t of non-traditional exports.



- 80 -                              ANNEX 3
17. After the decline in fertilizer traffic experienced in 1980-1981 because
of the capacity limitations of N de M. the railways have regained much of
this traffic, growing from 1.i million tLns tc 3.3 million tons from 1981 to
1984. N de M has targeted fertilizers as having major growth potential and
increasing railways' share, reaching 5.6 million tons by 1988 and growing
from 54% of national consumption in 1984 to 78% in 1988 (compared with 90% of
earlier years). A product-by-product analysis was conducted, and assumptions
about new plari-s ar'. pipeline connections were made.
18. N de M ha. also targeted finished steel products (pipes, construction
bars and plates, etc.) as potential new railway markets. In 1984,
significant traffic increases had already been realized. However, marketing
efforts are not expected to have substantaiL results before 1988.
H. New Types of Traffic
19. N de M is reviewing new types of services, including trailer and
container-on flat cars, consolidation centers, special trains for smaller
loads on high density lines and special unit trains such as a new daily
automobile train between the U.S. and Mexico City. These services will have
to be costed and new marketing approaches designed before such traffic can be
projected.

RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
N de M Investment Program 1985-1988
A. Composition of Investment Program
1.        The principal items in the N de M Investment Program 1985-88 are:
(a) Rehabilitation of Track
(b) Track Machinery
(c) Workshop Extensions and Improvements
(d) Extension of Radio Communications
(e) Extension of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC)
(f) New and Reconditioned Locomotives
(g) New and Reconditioned Freight Cars
(h) New Passenger Cars
B. Rehabilitation of Track
2.        N de M has prepared detailed proposals for work to be initiated in
1985, using new 115 lb/yd rail on main traffic lines and recovered lighter
weight rail, in suitable condition, on secondary lines. A note on the
specifications used is given in Attachment 1 of this annex. The
rehabilitation proposals, together with notes on the existing rail age and
condition, are given in Table 4.4 of the text. Rehabilitation programs have
been reduced, in recent years, to around 250 km per year because of budget
constraints; however, the deteriorating condition of much of the track listed
has been causing concern at N de M because of the increasing numbers of
accidents (Table 3.8 of the text) and delays from speed restrictions. A
special effort is therefore to be made in 1985 to carry out a larger program
totaling about 600 km (339 km with new rail and 259 km with recovered rail).
There will be a carryover, into 1986, of the rehabilitation of line G
(Cordoba - Medias Aguas), and, if the provision of track machinery is
delryed, the overall program could be delayed also. The programs will
cortinute with further works in each of the years 1986 to 1988. These later
programs have yet to be detailed by N de M, but are expected to average about
-I0 km of rehabilitation each year. At the completion of the 1988 program,
the total length of track laid in 115 lb/yd rail will be about 4,000 km (as
against 1,200 km in 1974), and about 74% of N de M's 15,480 km of track will
be provided with rail of 100 lb!yd weight or heavier.
C. Track Machinery
3.        N de H has experienced increasing difficulty over the past few
years to obtain, and retain, sufficient labor for manual track maintenance.
The heavy work involved is not popular, gang-strengths are low (four to seven
men, plus foreman, per 14 km lengths), and absenteeism is high. In acdition,
manual packing of track ballast, under the heavy rail and concrete sleepers
now used to carry increased locomotive and freight car axle loads, is not
effective in preserving line and level. Track maintenance standards have,



- 82 -                              ANNEX 4
as a result, deteriorated, and accidents due to track conditions have
increased; N de M has, therefore, decided to make a concentrated effort to
change from the present situation, in which about 90% of maintenance is by
hand and 10% by machine, to a position in which the percentages will become
25% and 75% respectively. In addition, much of the machinery obtained in
past years and used mostly on rehabilitation works is now over-aged and in
need of replacement and supplementing in certain areas. N de M's Way and
Works Department has, therefore, developed a list of machinery (Table 4.5 of
the text) which is based upon the concept of equipping seven main categories
of work, as shown in Attachment 2 of this annex.
4.        With the mechanized maintenance system, each through-packing group
wi]l be programed to do 1 km per day over 220 days per year, or a total of
about 2,800 km per year. N de M considers that about 50% of its system
length (or about 7,500 km) is suitable for machine ballast packing; the
rotation will vary considerably, depending upon the physical conditions and
the traffic level, and could be from one to four years. The spot packing
programs will be prepared by the Divisional engineers but will be coordinated
by the head office of the Way and Works Department. The existing labor will
be grouped into larger gangs of 22 men provided with gang trollies and hand-
held tools, each to cover about 50 km and to deal with the lighter
maintenance work adjacent to the track. The standards of maintenance
achieved can be assessed from time to time on the graphs produced by a track
condition recording unit already in use on the system.
5.        The list of equipment proposed for purchase in 1985 still leaves a
balance of some items to be obtained in subsequent years. Amounts are
allocated in the Investment Program for 1986-1988 to cover both the
additional equipment and the replacement of existing units now in poor
condition and not repairable. Budget provision has been made by N de M in
1985 for the additional machine operators and mechanics required; training is
being provided at the N de M training institute, and contracts for some of
the major new equipment will specify that the suppliers will also assist with
the training of operators and mechanics. Additionally, a new large, fully
equipped maintenance workshop is being constructed at Pantaco, in Mexico
City, and is due to be completed about June 1986.
D. Workshop Extensions and Improvements
6.        The maintenance of N de M locomotives is based upon:  (a) daily
inspections in service; (b) monthly inspections at depots; (c) half-yearly
repairs; and 'd) two-yearly and four-yearly general overhauls in main
workshops. However, the existing buildings and equipment are not adequate to
meet these programs. Three measures are proposed by the Department of
Locomotives and Rolling Stock: (a) a proper organization of the procedures
for the inspection of locomotives at depots; (b) the allocation to workshops
of adequate resources for the half-yearly repair cycle; and (c) the
enlargement of the principal workshops for general overhauls at San Luis
Potosi to serve all the fleet. The system of inspection and maintenance of
freight and passenger cars is also to be overhauled, and a system of car
repair depots (Spot-System) is to be established at strategic points to deal
with light repairs; workshops are to be provided to deal with medium and
heavy repairs.



- 83 -                              ANNEX 4
7.        Following a review of the facilities available, the Department has
drawn up two development proposals for 1985 investment, one for buildings and
facilities and depots and workshops, and the other for adequate machinery and
equipment. Budgetary constraints have led to some reduction in these
programs, and some items will have to be deferred to following years.
However, the programs are reasonably conceived and should enable N de M to
maintain its locomotive fleet to a better standard with higher percentage
availability.
E. Communications
8.        The original VHF/UHF communications system on N de M has been
completed, but the former FUS Railway, recently brought into N de M as the
Merida Division, still has to be incorporated into the N de M communications
system. This, however, will be carried out during the 1986-1988 period when
the remaining three separate railways - Pacifico, Chihuahua al Pacifico, and
Sonora-Baja California - will also be prepared for extensions to the
communications system.
9.        The main works proposed for 1985 are:
(a) acquisition and installation of radio communications for 700
locomotives;
(b) acquisition of portable VHF radios for track foremen, crews on
passenger and freight trains and some other special service
categories;
(c) extension of teleprinter facilities; and
Cd) enlargement of telephone exchange facilities at some stations,
stores, depots and workshops.
10.       The operational control system (SCINCO) has been largely brought
into use and has also been interconnected with that of the American
Association of Railways (AAR) in Washington. On N de M, 52 centers
throughout the system have been connected, leaving seven to be completed. In
most cases, only minor work is needed to enable these remaining centers to be
operational.
F. Signaling
11.       In pursuance of the policy of installation of Centralized Traffic
Control (CTC) on the busiest single-line sections of N de M, the main items
of work for 1985 are:
(a) completion of the installation of CTC between Guadalajara and
Irapuato (length 250 km); all material supplied, and it is
planned to complete the work in mid-1985;
(b) installation of CTC between San Luis Potosi and Benjamin
Mendez toward Saltillo - length 345 km; imported material on
order, and it is planned to obtain local material arnd install
during 1985; however, because of budgt.t reduction, the work
may carry over into 1986;



- 84 -                              ANNEX 4
(c) initial purchase of imported material for
Lecheria-Teotihuacan-Veracruz (length 412 kun); the detailed
study for this work has been completed recently; the purchase
of all material, imported and local, and the installation will
probably take two to three years, that is, into 1986 or 1987;
and
(d) renovation and modernization of all car control. and signalinig
equipment at the main Valle de Mexico marshaling yard; the
maiiu problems are with the newer, larger cars, in the fleet
and ex-USA, which are too long and heavy for the retarder
equipment originally installed; the new equipment, for which
preliminary studies have been done, will reduce damage and
improve the efficiency of operation.
12.       For 1986-1988, although further CTC installations are contemplated,
they are not very likely to be undertaken because of lack of funds. The
sections considered are Cordoba-Medias Aguas; Salinas Victoria-Ntuevo Laredo;
Villa de Garcia-Salinas Victoria; and Saltillo-Villa de Garcia. The last two
are presumably for the realignment under construction --Saltillo-Ramos
Arizpe-Villa de Garcia-Salinas Victoria-- and referred to in Annex 5.
G. Locomotive Recovery Program
13.       The declining state of repair of the N de M locomotive fleet has
been a source of some concern to the Bank, and discussions regarding the
preparation of an integrated locomotive recovery program were started with
the Locomotive Department of N de M over a year ago. As a result of these
discussions, a comprehensive program has been developed covering the
following aspects:
(a) a scrapping program;
(b) a program for rehabilitation of selected locomotives;
(c) purchase of new locomotives;
(d) a review of procedures and practices in workshops;
(e) a training program for selected categories of staff In
workshops;
(f) workshop extensions and improvements;
(g)  procurement of machinery 'or updating workshop operations; and
(h)  a program for procurement of locomotive spare parts.
14.       N de M's program 'or scrapping the older and generally less
reliable units in the fleet is aimed at the elimination of locomotives which
are uneconomical to repair. The total number of locomotives to be removed
during the four years 1985-1988 is 218 and will nave the effect of reducing
the number of locomotive types in the fleet by 1?, from 59 to 42. In
addition, it will remove 41 second-hand units purchased and hired in



- 85 -                               ANNEX 4
1979-1981 to help cope with a sudden upsurge of traffic at that time; this
will leave another 88 second-hand units to continue in use as long as they
can give reasonable service. A number of locomotives are out of service, -
awaiting room in the workshops or awaiting spare parts. The scrapping
program will make more room in the workshops for more useful work, while
funds being provided under the ongoing Fourth Railway Loan and the Sector
Loan will provide much of the foreign exchange required for acquiring spare
parts for repairable units.
15.       In addition, N de M has prepared a plan to rehabilitate 46 units of
the locomotive series 8290, of which 40 are in the 1985-1986 program. These
units, now 18-19 years old, have parts, diesel motors, principal generators,
control systems, etc., which are obsolete and not replaceable. Six units
have been rebuilt using new components as a trial and have been successful.
An examination of the economics of reconstructing these units, as opposed to
purchasing new units, shows that the overall life cycle cost of the
reconstructed unit is substantially lower than that of new units. It is,
thus, ensured that whatever locomotives can be repaired economically will be
rehabilitated and put back into service.
16.       An assessment of the requirements of new locomotives for the years
1984-1988 is shown in Table 4.6 of the text. In addition, N de M has made a
detailed review of locomotive needs for each type of service for the year
1985, and a similar review will be made annually thereafter. The combined
effect of improving the efficiency criteria, the integration of the
scrapping, repair and rehabilitation program, and the reduction of traffic
forecasts has been to decrease locomotive purchases from 252 in N de M's
original assessment to 100. Of these, 60 were purchased in 1984, 20 are to
be purchased in 1985, and 20 in 1986.  For 1987, the requirements of
additional motive power will be met by bringing into operation 39 electric
locomotives which have already been acquired in connection with the
electrification of the Mexico-Queretaro-Irapuato line.
17.       The overall effect of the program of scrapping, rehabilitation, new
acquisitions and other measures (detailed in para 13 preceding) results in a
recovery of the locomotive fleet by improving the locomotive availability
from the present 68% to 80% by 1988. The main feature of this program,
summarized below, is the reduction of the diesel locomotive fleet by 157
units, with substantial increases in the locomotive availability and traffic
handled:

- 86 -                               ANNEX 4
The proposed improvement in the availability targets is incorporated into the
Plan of Action together with the scrapping program, which is an important
part of the locomotive program and one that needs close monitoring because of
the problem of slow Government procedures related to the scrapping of large
assets on the railway.
H. Freight Cars
18.       N de M has made a detailed assessment of its freight car needs for
1985, based upon the traffic forecast, as set out in Table 4.7 of the text.
The only shortage indicated is in covered hopper cars, and N de M proposes to
acquire 300 units. In addition, N de M proposes to purchase 160 ballast cars
for the transport of stone ballast required for the track rehabilitation and
maintenance programs. A further, more general assessment is made, in
Table 4.8 of the text, of the approximate numbers of additional cars likely
to be needed over the years 1986-1988. A total of 4,500 additional cars is
indicated, spread equally over the three years. A detailed assessment,
however, should be made by N de M each year (as was done for 1985), before
reviewing, with the Bank, the actual number of cars to be ordered in the
succeeding year.
19.       N de M is also proposing to carry out a program of rehabilitation
of freight cars, with 700 box cars to be rebuilt in 1985, half by N de M's
own workshop and half by Constructora. In the succeeding years, 1986-1988,
allowance is made for further cars to be rehabilitated.
I. Passenger Cars
20.        N de M's passenger car fleet contains a large number of aged units;
some 300, or 25%, are over 40 years old and some 600, or 50%, are over 30
years old. The Investment Program makes allowance for 30 new cars in 1985
and 100 in each year 1986-1988, or a total of 330. This is reasonable, as
long as the acquisition is limited tc replacement coaches. N de M, however,
has already contracted for a total of 100 special first-class coaches in
1985-1986, more than what is required for reF acement, and for which the
economic justification i's not sufficient. N de M is now negotiating to
revise the contract and postpone the 1986 tranche of coaches until its
economic and financial justification can be clearly shown (para 4.29).

N de M Track Specifications
The N de M specifications for track rehabilitation remain generally
as in earlier projects: (a) new 115 lb/yd is normally obtained according to
American specifications, but now a proportion is obtained as higher manganese
steel, such as is commonly used on other railways, to give less wear and
longer life on sharply curved tracks (rate of wear can be 50% of that on
normal rail steel with only a relatively small increase in price); (b) the
rails are welded by the flash butt process at fixed depots into longer
lengths before laying and are then joined again in the track using the
alumino-thermit process; N de M intends to purchase a mobile flash butt
welding machine to replace the site thermit welding, in order to give a
stronger joint; (c) concrete sleepers are locally made, post-tensioned,
reinforced concrete and are placed at 1,666/km and using RS (French) elastic
clips; and (d) stone or slag ballast is provided at about 1,700 m3/km.
Recovered rail of 112 lb/yd is cropped to remove end defects and then welded
into longer lengths; sleepers used with recovered rail are generally of
impregnated timber, and fastenings are clips and screw spikes; and ballast is
provided at about 1,300 m3 per km.

SCT Rail Investment Program
A. General
1.        In the 1970s, SCT developed an extensive program for construction
and modernization of railway infrastructure which was carried out as and when
funds were made available by DGVF. This program WdS reviewed during the
appraisal of the Third and the Fourth Railway Projects and, although no Bank
financing was asked for or provided, the conclusion of the reviews was that
the proposed works would help to resolve N de M's most pressing capacity and
operational problems. Many of the works were started, but progress has been
slow because of budgetary constraints. At the start of preparation of this
project, a thorough evdluation of the program was conducted in consultation
with the Bank, and a revised investment plan has been prepared which focuses
upon completing the ongoing works and, in some cases, scaling down the scope
of the works. Revised traffic forecasts and cost estimates have been applied
in the reevaluation. New priority works are proposed for construction
beyond 1985.
2.        The analysis has covered length of crossing loops, additional
crcqsing stations, strengthening of bridges to take heavier locomotives and
rolling stock, reg.-adings and realignments and relatively short stretches of
new lines to complement the realignment works. In general, N de M's works on
rehabilitation, bridge strengthening and CTC installations (Annex 4)
complement the DGVF works. The following paragraphs describe the details of
the main investment items in the 1985-1988 program.
B. Mexico-Queretaro
3.        The construction of a new double line 215 km long, between
Huehuetoca (about 30 km outside Mexico City) and Queretaro, was started 1--
the mid-1970s. It was to replace two existing single lines which carried
both through trains and local industrial traffic. The corridor carries the
heaviest traffic on the system, at about 30 million gross tons per year,
forecast by N de M to rise tc about 40 million g.-oss tons by 1990. The
original program envisaged cc..-mpletion at the end oF 1981, but budget
restrictions delayed the work, and it was about 90% complete by October 1984;
some 20 km of track remain 1o be laid, and completic.n of the work is expected
by December 1984.
4.   In 1980, the Government decided that the new lire should be electrified
and that this electrification should be carried into the Mexico City main
passenger station at Buena Vista. At the same time, it was decided to
quadruple the tracks from Huehuetoca, past the main Valle de Mexico freight
yards, into Buena Vista, a distance of 30 km, and to provide grade
separations at all the intersecting city streets, in order to enable both
fast through-passenger trains and frequent local suburban trains to operate.
This ne-w section involves major earthworks, bridging and a tunnel, and the

work is in its early stages; between Huehuetoca and Lecheria (about half
way), earthworks are 5% complete and bridges 30% while, from Lecheria to
Buena Vista, the earthworks are also 5% complete, and a tunnel is 5%
complete, but all the bridging has yet to be started. Contracts for many of
the remaining works have still to be placed, and completion in all respects
is scheduled for mid-1988. The track material for the Huehuetoca to Buena
Vista section has yet to be provided.
C. Queretaro-Irapuato
5.        The continuation of double track beyond Queretaro to Irapuato, a
length of 115 km, witlh a maximum grade of 0.3 x and a minimum curve of 2°
(573 m radius), was started in late 1980, but, again, has been slow because
of budget constraints.  Earthworks are about 30% complete, and bridges 20%
complete, but track laying has not yet started. Remaining carthworks,
including those for a new marshaling yard at Irapuato, have almost all been
contracted, but 20 bridges over the whole lei,gth htave yet to be tendered.
The laying of the first 10 km of track has been tendered, but no track
material is available for the remaining length or for the Irapuato yard.
Completion is scheduled for early 1988. This new double track is also to he
electrified, buit installation will nor he started until late 1986, with
completion scheduled for 1988 or 1989.
D. Electrification, Mexico City-Queretaro-Irapuato
6.        Almost all the material and equipment for the electrifiration of
this line, including 39 electric locomotives, have been ordeied and
supplled. Site installation is now heing started after administrative
problems led to important staff changes. The new staff is reactivating the
foreign contracts and forming a site organization to deal with the
installation work, which is to start at Aragon about half way between Mexico
and Queretaro; about 40 km of installation was planned for 1984, 10() km for
1985 and 100 km for 1986, but this program seems lik-lv to be delayed. A
program for the further installation for Queretaro-Irapuato has not vet heen
defined, but is contemplated to start in late 1986 fo- completion in 1988 or
1989. The contract for the workshops may be placed in 1985, while contracts
for the signaling and telecommunications equipment still have to be
considered.
E.  Mexico-Veracruz
7.        Because of increasing traffic to and from the southern oil
development area near Coatzacoalcos, the original single "Mexicano" line
between the coastal plain and the Mexico Citv plateau, with grades up to 4%
uncompensated and curves of 12° (100 m radius), was found to have inadequate
capacity. The alternative route, via Veracruz and Jalapa, had 2.5%
compensated ruling grade and similar curvature, and its capacity was being
used fully, mainly for Veracruz traffic.  Construction of a new single line
was, therefore, started in 1978 on the Mexicano escarpment section, the new
line having a ruling grade of 2.5% compensated and minimum curvature of 6°
(200 m radius), with a length of 74 km between Los Reves and Ciudad Mendoza.
Traffic forecasts indicated that the new single line capacity might be
exceeded within 12-15 years from. completion; therefore. DGVF and N de M



- 91 -                             ANNEX 5
decided that reconstruietion of the lines toward the south and to Veracruz
shouild be in double track. Consequently, the Ciudad Mendoza-Paso del Macho
section was authorized for double-track construction. The many tunnels and
bridges already under construction from Los Reyes to Ciudad Mendoza, however,
made a late change impossible for douhling that track, so the intention, in
the ftuture, is to rehabilitate the original steep single line for use for
down-hill traffic and  i usc the new, lesser graded line for up-hill traffic.
8.         The Los Reves-Ciuidad Mendoza section is only now being completed
(some final leveling and stone hallasting remains to be done, and the
telecommtunications are still to he tendered); the section is expected to be
placed in operaLion by N de M In 1985. On the Ciudad Mendoza-Paso del Macho
section, some sections are completely new double track, while on others, a
new single line is being built parallel to the existing line.  The length is
60 km, ruling grade 1.8% and minimum curvature 6'. Earthworks are completed
or contracted, except for one 12-km section near the Paso del Macho end.
Overall, earthworks are about 50%' complete, bridges 50%, tunnels 90%. and
track work 20%. A large viaduct (Metlac) near Fortin has recently been
completed. About 60 km of track material is still needed co finish the
diouble-track length, and full completion is scheduled for mid-1987.
9.        The capacity of the new single 2.5% grade line, Los Reyes-Ciudad
Mendoza, using 64-car freighlt trains ancd 6 x 3,000 HP locomotives (as
operated on the similar grade Veracruz-Jalapa line), after installation of
CTC (as part of the N de M program for Teotihuacan-Los Reves-Cordoba-Paso del
Macho-Ver-cruz), should he about il million net tons of freight plus
pas i.ec  and local trains.  The original line capacity was about 1.5 million
net tons. The schedule should provide enough time for DGVF to deal with the
reh'abilitation of the original, steeply graded Los Reves-Ciudad Mendoza line,
as a second iine on the escarpment section. DGVF also intended to carry the
dot'lle-line construction through from Paso del Macho to Veracruz, but has now
poistponed that scheme, assuming that N de M's installation of CTC through to
Veracruz should be sufficient for some time ahead.
F. Tierra Blanca-Medias Aguas-Coatzacoalcos
10.        South of Cordoha, the existing single line to Tierra B]anca (92 km)
has a 2.5Z compensated grade, sco that 64-car freight trains should he ahle to
operate tip-hill. From Tierra Blanca south to Medias Aguas, the terrain is
generallv flatter, but the line has lengths of grade up to 2% and 2.3% in
eit;.er direction.  There are similar lengths of 2% grades between Med'as
Aguas (the junction for the line to the Pacific at Salina Cruz, also south to
Tapachula and the Guatemala border) and Coatzacoalcos. Some regrading has
already been done between Rodriguez Clara and Medias Aguas to give a ruling
grade of 1.3%; DGVF is now proposing to carry out a realignment and regrade
over some 90 km south froir Tres Valles to Azueta, making a double-traei: line,
partly by new construction and partly by laving a new single track parilllel
to the existing line.  DGVF's plan is then to zonstruct a new single line
about 150 km long, from Azueta, on a more direct route to Jaltipan, some 40
km from CoatzacoXlcos. The total present length, Tres Valles-Jaltipan, is
261 km, and the dListance by the new direct rouze would be 227 km; the new
ruling grade would be 1% and the minimum curve 10 (1,146 m radius).   After
recent reviews, DGVF has decided to proceed only with the first part of the
proposal in the period 1985-.988 and to leave the second part, the direct
line to Jaltipan, to follow in a subsequent program period.



-9 9-                               ANNEX 5
11.        The completion of all N de M and SCT programs on this route to
rehabilitate the track, strengthen bridges, ansd lengthen crodsing loops, plus
the limited realignments to reduce the ruling grade to at least 1.3%, would
enable longer, heavier trains to operate and would increase the freight
traffic capacity from an exlstinig 2.4 million net tons (in one direction) to
about 5.4 million tons.  If CTC nhoutud be added later, the capacity would go
up, with 75 car trains, to about 14 milliox; nec tons (again in one direction)
and would suffice for 20 years or o.rre, hased a.' N de M's traffic
projections.  This hardly justifles the DCVF proposal to build sections of
double track now, especially as long as the controlling hill climh, TierrA
I inca-Cordoba-Los Reyes, remains a single line. It may be worthwhile to
r *vide the earthworks and bridges for two tracks on reallgned sections to
save the cost and trouble of repeat operations some years later. however,
material for only one track should be laid initially, leaving the second
track to follow.
12.       On the Medias Aguas-Coatzacoa]cos section, DCVF already has in hand
a regrade 20 km long between Almagres and Texistepec to reduce the ruling
grade from 2% to 1.3%.  The work was heing done to double track standards as
part of DLVF's policy to eventually provide a double-track across the
Atlantic/Pacific isthmus, between Coatzacoalcos and Sallna Cruz, to serve the
projected growth in inter-ocean traffic.  However, because of the budget
reductions for 1985-1988, and also because of the newer scheme to build the
direct line, Azueta-Jaltipan later, DGV has decided to lav one track onlv,
Almagres-Texistepec (earthworks are 80% complete, bridges 1007 complete,
track laying to start in 1985, for completion mid-1986), and to defer furtl.er
regrading of Medias Aguas-Coatzacoalcos. Present line capacitv is ful!v used
by freight, passenger and local trains, and the present freight capacitv (one
way) is about 2.4 million net tons per year.  With the use of heavier
multiple locomotives of 3,000 HP, the capacity could go up to around 4.7
million net-tons with 64-car trains and to about 5.4 million net-tons with 75
car trains.  To bring the section up to the capacitv of the rest of the line
to Tierra Blanca and on to Cordoba and Los Reves after 1988, either (a) the
regrades, Azueta-Medias Aguas-Coatzacoalcos, should be completed; (b) the new
direct line, Jaltipan-Tres Valles, should he constructed; or (c) CTC should
be installed.  In the meantime, the altfrnatives should be costed for both
construction and operation.
G.   Manzanillo Bypass
13.       The main railway line at Manzanillo passes throuph the closelv
built-up central city area, with numerous level crossings to reach the
Iron-ore pelletizing plant of Pena Colorado about 8 km to the north of the
citY. Six nnit trains dailv carry the ore to the center and north of the
country and these, together with other frelght, passenger and local trains,
cause  :nsiderable congestion and delay tc citv street traffic.  A new sirgle
line 'ypass is proposed which will be 10.3 km long, have 2 ruling grade of
0.8% and minimum curvature of 30. It will carrv all the iron-ore clear of
the city traffic, as well as improving the transit time of the trains. The
area crossed, however, is mountainous, and a tunnel 1.12 knm long will need to
be constructed, which will account for about 60% of the cost of the project.



- 93 -                            ANNEX 5
H. Guadalajara Bypass
14.       To avoid through traffic to and from Manzanillo and also to and
from the Pacifico system northward, having to go th:ough congested
Guadalajara, as at present, and-also to provide access to the future new
Guadalajara terminal site, a southern bypass is proposed. This bypass is to
be in three sections connecting the existing lines radiating out from
Guadalajara.. The first section, a double line, El Castillo to Tlajomulco,
will serve Manzanillo traffic and is scheduled by DGVF to be built in
1986-1988; a second section, as a single line, Alzada-Fernandez, is to follow
in 1987-1988.  The latter may be delayed because of budget limitations', while
the third section will definitely be in the post-1988 period.
I. Ajuno-Caltzontzin
15.       A realignment, 46 km long, is under construction to reduce the
existing ruling grade, from 2.5% to 1.5%, on a critical section of the single
line connecting the new industrial port of Lazaro Cardenas to the mdin
railway system. Again the work was originally scheduled for completion at
the end of 1981, but is now still under construction, with earthworks 60%
complete, structures 50%, a tunnel 50% (made in open cut and backfilled
because of poor ground conditions), but no track material has been acquired.
J.  Guadalajara-Monterrey
16.       To shorten the route for mineral trains between Manzanillo and
Monterrey, two new lines are being built. The first, Guadalajara (El
Castillo) to Encarnacion, will avoid traffic congestion in the Irapuato area
and the second, Salinas-Laguna Seca, will connect across to the San Luis
Potosi-Saltillo main line, leading to Monterrey. The length of the first
construction is 195 km and of the second 125 ki, with ruling grades of 0.35%
and 0.20% respectively, and minimum curves of 1.50 (764 n radius). The total
length from Guadalajara to Vanegas (on the San Luis Potosi-Saltillo line)
will decrease from 724 km to 567 km. The second section, Salinas-Laguna
Seca, is the most advanced in construction, earthworks and bridging being
100% complete and trackwork 60% complete. Track material can be made
available for completion '- -id-1986. On the other section,
Guadalajara-Encarnacion, earthworks are only 10% complete and bridging 15%,
with no provision as yet for track material; final completion is not expected
until mid-1988.
K.  Monterrey-Saltillo
17.       Four sections of new work are proposed in the Monterrey to Saltillo
area. Proceeding from east to west, the first is the eastern sector of the
Monterrey northern bypass, a double track 21-km long, to connect eastern
lines, from Matamoros and Tampico to the proposed new Monterrey terminal
site; work has not yet started and is planned for 1986-1988. The second item
is the east^ru sector of the bypass, 40-km long, from the new terminal site
to Villa cle Garzia, also double track and now under construction; earthworks
are 90Z co'plete, bridging 60% complete, with track work still to be started.



- 94 -                            ANNEX 5
18.       :?rom Soledad, west of Villa de Garcia, to Ramos Arizpe, toward
Saltillo, is r climb on a ruling grade of 2%. DGVF had started work on the
construction of a new double-track alignment, through difficult country, to
give a 1% ruling grade; one contract had been let for 20 km (out of 64 km) at
the Ramos Arizpe end. However, there is, as yet, no capacity constraint on
the section, and the only operating saving occurs from assisting locomotives,
with the result that there has been difficulty in proving an economic case
for the construction cost involved. The work was stopped in July 1984, and
SCT and N de H are studying the project further to decide on whether to
proceed and whether to make the line single or double track and the ruling
grade 1% or 1.5%.
19.       The last section of improvement is to build a new single line from
near Ramos Arizpe, around Saltillo, as a bypass to rejoin the main line to
the south at Benjamin-Mendez; this would enable through trains to avoid the
congested Saltillo industrial area. The work is not included in DGVF's
1985-1988 progrant, but would probably be of more operational benefit to
N de M in the near future than the previous item, for the Soledad-Ramos
Arizpe section realignment.
T. Veracruz-Tampicc/Mexico-Tampico
20.       These are both new lines:  the first, some 400 km long, is to
provide a new coastal route between the two cities; the second, between Honey
on the existing system on the Mexican plateau and Magosal-Tampico, some 200
km, would provide a more direct connection than the existing route via San
Luis Potosi. On the Veracruz-Tampico line, the first section of
construction, Cordel-Nautla (87 km), was started in 1980; 30 km of this
length is due for completion in mid-1985; bridges onward toward Nautla are
also under construction. Because of budget constraints, the work is being
closed down. The Mexico-Tampico direct connection is scheduled to be started
in 1987-1988. The operational and economic data are insufficient to
evaluate either of these new lines adequately, and further tenders should be
delayed until further studies are carried out.
M. Yards and Terminals
21.       With the substantial increases in traffic that have taken place in
recent years, the principal railway yards of N de M have reached the
saturation point, and delays to freight cars and trains in yards are becoming
a problem. The SCT construction program foresees five new yards at Irapuato,
Coatzacoalcos, Monterrey, Coyotopec (outside Mexico City) and Guadalajara.
To examine the problem of the yards, a technical committee was set up in 1980
comprising representatives of N de M and DGVF. This team has done some work
in analyzing the various issues involved in studying new yards and yard
equipment in the U.S. and Canada, and a certain amount of research work with
computer modeling for large yards. However, concrete progress on this front
has been limited, partly because of political and organizational problems and
partly because of lack of definition of priorities. The Coyotopec yard,
which is to relieve the major Valle de Mexico yard and on which substantial
effort has been spent, is being delayed because of land acquisition
problems. Some progress, however, has been made on the Monterrey yard, for
which land is being acquired.



- 95-                             ANNEX 5
22.       The Bank's review of the yard problem has recommended the need for
a modular approach to the development of the additional yard facilities, not
only to avoid over-ambitious planning but also to ensure that investments are
made gradually and in accordance with proven demand. Further, there is
need to develop a Master Plan for the yards on a systemwide basis that would
take into account the changing patterns of traffic. Finally, there is need
to analyze the present operations of the principal yards to ensure that
everything possible is done to improve the productivity of the existing
facilities in order to minimize investments in new facilities. As part of
the proposed project, it is expected that a Yard Master Plan Study will be
done, with the participation of foreign consultants and expertise wherever
necessary, including, inter alia, a study of yard operations to examine ways
and means of improving the efficiency of the existing installations.
23.       Meanwhile, preparatory work is to be initiated on the relatively
minor yards at Irapuato and Jaltipan (to relieve Coatzacoalcos) - the former
as it is to be the terminus of the new electrified service between Mexico and
Irapuato, and the latter because of the steep increases in the traffic caused
by the integration of the FUS and the growing demand of oil-related traffic
from the South.

MEXICO
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Passenger Service Strategy
A.   Defining the Issue
1.        Rail passenger services in Mexico have traditionally been given
little attention since most concern of the Government and N de M has been
directed at freight services. A large number of trains were eliminated in
the mid-1970s after being declared uneconomic, and traffic declined, despite
fares set well below even short-run avoidable costs. Some equipment was
purchased in the late 1970s, but the overall fleet has deteriorated to
substandard levels. Renewed interest in passenger services has recently
arisen for several reasons:
(a) the attractiveness of rail service and traffic is apparently
growing as a result of rising fuel prices and the increasing cost
of competing services;
(b) load factors have increased to such an extent, despite highly
deteriorated equipment, that, if existing services are to be
continued, substantial investments are required;
rc) infrastructure investments on the main lines have removed capacity
restrictions, and new types of first class passenger services are
technically feasible; and
(d) the economic recession has broug'lt attention to the continuing
operating losses for passenger services.
2.        N de M prepared a paper (June 1984) which recommends a
comprehensive strategy for rail passenger services including the
identification of services to be improved, an appropriate fare policy,
required investments and a proposal for assessing the feasibility of new
services. The following is a summary of the findings and proposals of the
N de M stragegy paper. Specific recommendations and guidelines regarding the
implementation of the N de M proposals, developed during the preparation of
the sector project, are also presented. The main questions to be answered
are:
(a) which railway services are economically viable when compared with
competing transport modes;
(b) at what level should fares be set and what impact would that have
upon traffic; and
(c)  at which services should -iew investment be directed.
B. Evolution of Passenger Traffic
3.        N de M offers a number of interurban passenger services including
sleeping car service, first class special, first class and second class
services and a mixed freight and passenger train service for outlying low
density lines. Passenger traffic had declined, from over 33.2 million
passengers in 1970 to 16 million passengers in 1981, until recent increases
returned traffic levels to 22 million in 1983 (including 3 million passengers



- 97 -                           ANNEX 6
of the recently incorporated FUS line). Much of the decline was due to the
elimination of 43% of all passenger services between 1974 and 1978.
Passenger-km, however, have not declined as precipitously because the average
distance per passenger rose from about 100 km to 190 km from 1970 to 1983,
and, today, N de M carries 4.2 billion passenger-km as compared with
3.4 billion in 1970 (Table 3;9 of the text). This represents only about 1%
of all passenger-km in Mexico, with road transport being the dominant mode.
4.        About 75% of the passengers are carried in normal passenger trains
and about 25% in mixed freight/passenger trains. Furthermore, about 87% of
the passengers use the second class services while 10% use first class and
the remaining 3% use sleeping car services.
C. Level of Service
5.        The predominance of second class passengers is explained by the low
level of service that N de M is offering. On-time performance, although it
has improved recently, is still below tolerable levels for most first class
passengers, with only 21% of the main-line trains arriving on time, 48%
arriving within an hour of the scheduJa and 31% arriving between one and
three hours late. Similarly, the condition of the coaches is indicated by
the age of the fleet. Of the almost 790 coaches in the fleet (including 192
sleeping cars), about 20% are less than 10 years old and the rest are over 25
years old, with more than 200 coaches over 45 years old (Table 3.7 of the
text). Lastly, load factors on the coaches have increased to a point at
which some potential passengers are apparently not able to be served and
traffic is being turned away. The average number of passengers per coach
increased from 40 in 1977 to 63 in 1984, with certain routes at certain
periods of the year being extremely saturated.
6.        A recent survey on the trains confirmed the problems of railway
services and the types of passengers who are using the trains. About 75% of
the users stated that they used the railways because of the relatively low
fare. When asked about the types of improvements they would like to see, 32%
stated the need for more coaches, 44% wanted cleaner coaches and 31%
expressed concern over the maintenance of the stations. Interestingly, only
11% expressed concern about the on-time performance of the trains, an
indication of the low value placed on time savings by the second class
passenger.
D. Fares and Costs
7.        Fares are set below even short-run variable costs, with passenger
revenues covering about 60% of such costs. Although passenger fares had been
increased faster than inflation between 1980 and 1983, they had not been
increased at the same rate as freight and, in 1984, the advances of the
previous three years were reduced when the Government failed to raise fares
in line with inflation. The Government agreed, under the Fourth Railway
Project, to provide a specific subsidy to cover the related deficit. This
subsidy increased from about Mex$ 1.0 billion in 1980 to Mex$ 5.1 billion in
1984.  In real terms, however, the subsidy declined by 37Z over the same
period and today amounts to about US$26 million as a result of the higher
load factor per coach and per train and real tariff increases. In addition,
other factors mentioned in Annex 2, such as the overall real decline in
salaries and materials costs, affected subsidy levels.



-98 -                            ANNEX 6
8.        As N de M and the Government continue to reduce freight subsidies,
the passenger deficit represents an increasing proportion of the net
operating rail deficit, having risen from 11% in 1980 to 20% in 1984. In
addition, although passenger revenues, including Government subsidy,
represent only 7% of gross railway operating revenues, passenger services
represent 28% of all train-km.
9.        In comparison with bus transport, rail passenger fares declined
from 86% of a first class bus fare and 62% of a second class bus fare in 1970
to 59% and 38% respectively in 1984. Thus, bus fares have been increased by
the Government at a faster pace, although a general review of bus costs
indicates that bus operators are not covering the replacement cost of their
vehicles under present tariffs, requiring further real increases over the
next several years. Similarly, a comparison of the economic costs of railway
and bus services indicates that the railways maintain a substantial advantage
over buses on the high density lines, with most services averaging about
Mex$ 2-4 per passenger-km compared with about Mex$ 3-4 for bus transport.
Certain rail passenger service costs were near, or more than, those for buses
and usually related to sleeping car services, which, because of the low
number of passengers per coach (27 as compared with 63 in regular coaches),
resulted in costs of about Mex$ 5-7 per passenger-km.
E. Government and N de M Strategy and Forecast
10.       The Government and N de M have proposed a comprehensive strategy
for passenger services which includes the improvement of high density
services, the analysis of the potential for new first class services on main
lines which are being upgraded, and the gradual elimination of low density
services for which no social or economic justification can be made. The main
element in this strategy is the investment in new coaches, beginning with
replacement coaches and continuing with additional coaches for new services,
once such services are shown to be economically and financially viable. An
additional number of replacement coaches are to be acquired for the other
three railways (about 176 coaches). The initial new coaches will be assigned
to first class services.
11.       The tariff policy described in the strategy paper calls for
increasing passenger fares for first class services to cover at least
short-run variable costs in the near future and progressively increasing
thereafter to cover long-run variable costs. Similarly with sleeping car
services, the paper proposes the same tariff policy, with the understanding
that this would divert passengers to other rail or bus services and lead to a
decline in sleeping car services. For second class services, the paper
proposes gradual increases to short-run variable costs, with compensation for
the deficit to be provided by the Government to N de M and classified in a
manner equivalent to that used for fare revenues in the N de M balance
sheets. Any new services would be expected to cover the full costs of those
services.
12.       Based on this strategy, N de M has forecast that total passenger
trips (excluding the introduction of new services) will grow from 22.5
million in 1984 to 24.8 million in 1988 and passenger-km from 4.3 billion in
1984 to 5.0 billion in 1988, for an average annual growth of 2.5% and 3.8%



- 99 -                           ANNEX 6
respectively (Table 3.9 of the text).  The forecast assumes that all growth
will occur on the high density lines while the lower density lines' traffic
will either remain stable or decline.
F. Recommendations
13.       While the strategy is relatively sound, questions still arise over
how it will be implemented and what specific criteria are to be applied in
setting fares, projecting demand and assessing investments. Some initial
actions, i.e., with regard to investments, appear not to be consistent with
the proposed strategy. The following recommendations address these questions
and provide a basis for formulating a plan of action under the Railway Sector
Project.
14.       Passenger Fares.  The Government has indicated that, with regard to
passenger fares, it is not considered feasible to raise fares substantially,
in real terms, until the proposed improvements are made because of the
divergence between appropriate long-run fares and the present level of
service. It is recommended that:
(a) a detailed costing of mainline passenger services be carried out by
N de M, distinguishing between types of services, by November 1986;
(b) passenger fares be increased gradually between 1985 and 1988,
reaching the level of long-run variable costs by January 1988; and
'c) a Government-specific subsidy for losses incurred for passenger
serv'ces be provided to N de M in a timely manner each year.
15.       Demand Forecast.  The demand forecast for each passenger line and
type of service should be based on the fare policy to be established and the
comparative levels of service and fares on competing modes. Appropriate
surveys should be conducted to help estimate the cross-elasticities between
modes.
16.       Investment.  An initial evaluation of the acquisition of passenger
coaches indicated a serious need and acceptable rate of return for
replacement coaches, but did not support the railways' recent contracting for
100 first-class special coaches to be delivered in 1985 and 1986. Traffic is
insufficient, and there is a more substantial need for first and second-class
replacement coaches. N de M is reviewing its initial acquisition of
first-class special coaches in order to limit the order to those already set
for delivery in 1985. Further purchases of first-class special coaches
should await appropriate marketing studies which take into account the
effects of the proposed tariff policy on demand forecasts and confirm the
economic and financial feasibility of such coaches.

RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Evaluation Guidelines for the N de M Investment Plan
and Results of 1985 Evaluation
A. General Methodology
1.        The approach of the Sector Project for the economic evaluation of
N de M's investments is to establish a set of guidelines to be applied
annually by N de M during its normal budgetary preparations covering all
investment commitments to be made in the following year.  For the purpose of
the appraisal of the Sector Project, the guidelines were applied to
investment commitments to be made in 1985.  The following summarizes the
agreed upon guidelines and the results of the economic evaluation of the 1985
investments. The discussion covers the following major types of investments:
(a) acquisition and rehabilitation of motive power;
(b) acquisition and rehabilition of freight rolling stock;
Cc) acquisition of passenger coaches;
Cd) track rehabilitation with new rail;
Ce) track rehabilitation with recovered rail; and
Cf) signaling.
A technical evaluation is to be made of other rail investments such as
telecommunications and workshop machinery.
2.        The N de M Investment Plan is an integrated package with a number
of interrelated components. For example, the realization of benefits from
capacity-increasing investments, such as investments in rolling stock and
motive power, is dependent upon the availability of adequately maintained
infrastructure which will allow commercial speeds, and locomotive and car
utilization envisaged under the Plan of Action. In turn, the benefits from
works such as track renewal, which prevent line deterioration, thereby
avoiding capacity restrictions, are dependent, in part, upon the availability
of adequate motive power and rolling stock to carry forecast traffic. In the
evaluation of the N de M Investment Plan, each of the investments is
evaluated separately to determine its economic viability. Because of the
interrelationship between the subprojects, however, some degree of overlap is
unavoidable in evaluating each separately. Thus, for example, it is assumed,
when evaluating infrastructure investments (track renewal and signaling),
that expansions of fleet and motive power will take place to sustain the
increasing traffic. Their depreciation is included in the operating costs on
these lines, and it is assumed that the operational improvements under the
Action Plan will be realized.
B. Acquisition and Rehabilitation of Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.        In 1985, N de M expects to acquire 20 new locomotives and to
rehabilitate 20 locomotives, as well as to purchase 460 new wagons (including
160 ballast wagons) and to rehabilitate 700 wagons. The economic evaluation
of investments in acquisition and rehabilitation of motive power and rolling
stock assumes a without-project case in which investments are not made



-101-                             ANNEX 7
(including investments in renewal motive power, which has reached the end of
its economic life), and, consequently, traffic is diverted to road at a
higher economic cost. The commodities which would most likely be diverted
are identified, and the economic cost differential between road and rail for
those commodities is calculated.
4.        Project benefits consist of the net savings derived from rail
transportation as compared with road transport for the door-to-door movement
of goods. Truck operating costs are calculated for a truck (5-axle
tractor-semi trailer) with an average load of 12 tons (including backhauls);
economic vehicle operating costs are based on estimates used for road
investment evaluations by SCT. Truck costs, which include the estimated
contribution of the diverted traffic to the marginal cost of road
maintenance, were taken at Mex$ 3.94 per ton-km 11. Long-run variable rail
costs, excluding the capital cost of the wagons and locomotives (since these
are included in the cost stream for the economic return calculation) but
including terminal costs, averaged Mex$ 1.20 per ton-km. In both cases,
diesel fuel was priced at an opportunity cost of US$0.85 per gallon. A
shorter useful life is assumed for rehabilitated equipment (12 years compared
with 20 years for new locomotives, and 18 years compared with 30 years for
new wagons).
5.        It was estimated that, without the 40 locomotives and 460 wagons,
the potential traffic diversion could reach 1.9 billion ton-km. The economic
analysis evaluated the investment in rolling stock and motive power together
and separately. Results of these evaluations are presented in Table I of
this annex and show an estimated rate of return of 21X for the combined
locomotive and wagon investment, along with workshop equipment, 74% for
locomotives alone and 33% for wagons alone.
6.        In deciding whether to purchase new locomotives or to rehahilitate
a number of existing locomotives in appropriate condition, a life-cycle cost
comparison was made which assumed that, while the initial rehabilitation cost
would he lower than purchasing a new locomotive, the maintenance costs would
be higher, and the useful life would be shorter (12 years versus 20 years for
a new locomotive). In addition, it is probable that the operating cost of
the rehabilitated locomotive would be greater in terms of fuel consumption,
and, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the rehabilitated
locomotive would consume about 30% more fuel than a new locomotive. The
life-cycle cost differential is substantial in favor of rehabilitation, with
the total discounted costs of the rehabilitated locomotive representing 68%
of the new one (Table 2 of this annex).
C. Track Renewal Program
7.        In 1985, N de M is expected to carry out a program of selective
track renewal on 339 km of its routes with traffic ranging from 2.8 to 4.9
million net tons, using 115 lb/yd rail with elastic type fastenings which are
supported on concrete sleepers.  Also, the program considers the procurement
of machinery to support the renewal works, as well as maintenance operations.
8.        The quantified benefits from main line track renewal are (a) the
reduction in track maintenance costs, including avoidance of investment in
deferred maintenance to bring the line- zo a minimum standard of safety; and
l/   In end-1983 Mex$ with an exchange rate of US$1.00: MexS 150.



-102 -                            ANNEX 7
(b) avoidance of track deterioration which, without the project and in spite
of routine and deferred maintenance, would lead to extensive speed
restrictions, ultimately limiting line capacity and causing diversion of
traffic from rail to road. Benefits from reduced wear and, therefore,
maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock, and from increased safety, were
not quantified. Table 3 of this annex give details of the economic
evaluation by line. Maintenance cost savings calculations were based on the
following assumptions. In the "without" case, first year maintenance costs
represent the cost of deferred maintenance needed to upgrade the line to a
minimum level of safety. In subsequent years, maintenance costs are based on
the cost of maintaining the existing 100 lb/yd rails, calculated at
Mex$ 992,000 per km, and increasing proportionately with traffic. In the
"with" project case, maintenance costs are based on the cost of maintaining
115 lb/yd rail. These costs increase from about Mex$ 100,000 to Mex$ 900,000
per km (depending on the line) by year 10, increasing at the same rate as the
traffic thereafter. In calculating benefits from avoiding diversion of
traffic from rail to road transport, a line capacity analysis was carried out
which identified the year in which speed reductions from rail deterioration,
given increasing traffic, would result in an intolerable level of service.
To arrive at ton-km diverted from rail to road, it was assumed that, in the
-'-without" project case, the train velocity in the limiting section would
decrease by 5 km/hr per year, until a limiting level of service was reached,
and any future increase in traffic would be diverted. Tons diverted were
multiplied by the average rail haul. Since sections to bw tm-proved belong to
different corridors, no double counting occurs.  To quantify the benefit from
avoidance of traffic diversion, the difference between long-run variable rail
and truck costs per ton-km (including terminal costs) was calculated.   These
costs include depreciation of wagons and motive power, thus assuming that
rolling stock and locomotives adequate to meet traffic increases would be
available. Investment in these items is, thus, implicitly evaluated in the
analysis.
9.        Track renewal with recovered rail is to be carried out on 260 km of
secondary lines (traffic ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 million gross tons).
Benefits from track renewal with recovered rail include (a) reduced track
maintenance costs and (b) improved equipment utilization due to increased
speeds on lines which, without the project, would be subject to speed
restrictions. Maintenance costs without the project were based on the
maintenance of existing 85 lb/yd rails "emplanchuelado" and supported by wood
sleepers; they were calculated at about Mex$ 1,000,000 per km and increasing
at the same rate as traffic. In the "with" project case, maintenance costs
were assumed to rise from Mex$ 100,000/km in year 2 to Mex$ 943,000/km by
year 10, increasing at the same rate as traffic thereafter. To quantify
savings from removal of speed restrictions, a typical train comprising 2.3
locomotives of 3,000 HP with 40 wagons and 2,122 tons was considered.
Quantified savings vary from Mex$ 0.0477 to 0.115 per gross-ton/km depending
upon the scale of speed improvements. The results of the benefit-cost
analysis are shown in Table 3 of this annex.
10.       The results of the evaluation showed estimated economic rates of
return from 18% to 67% for rehabilitation with new rail, and from 31% to 36%
for rehabilitation works with recovered rail. The estimated rate of return
for the total rehabilitation program, including track machinery for
maintenance and rehabilitation force account works, is 19%.

D.   Acquisition and Installation of Systems/or Centralized Traffic
Control (CTC)
11.       In 1985, N de M is expecting to complete CTC installation for
Benjamin Mendez-San Luis Potosi.   This investment was analyzed under Loan
1929-ME with an estimated rate of return of 40% and is virtually complete.
In addition, N de M expects to initiate the acquisition of CTC equipment for
installation on 404 km of the Mexico-Veracruz line in an effort to postpone
costly double-tracking on the remaining single-track sections of the route.
The average traffic on this line is about 16-18 trains per day. This
investment was also analyzed under Loan 1929-ME (estimated rate of return of
33%), but was not executed, and it has been reassessed, applying the
procedures discussed in the following paragraph.
12.       Investments in CTC are evaluated on the basis of savings in train
operating costs derived from the improvement in the traffic flow where the
need to wait for instructions during train meets or passings is eliminated.
Based on empirical data, N de M considers, for the -with' and "without"
project cases, the transit and waiting time for the type of train formation
that each case can accommodate. Taking into account the consumption of fuel
and oil, the amortization of tractive power and rolling stock and crew costs,
the trains transit and waiting times are translated into costs with and
without CTC. The combined estimated economic rate of return for three route
sections, based on the flow of benefits and costs in Table 4 of this annex,
is 34%.
E. Acquisition of Inter-City Passenger Coaches
13.       N de M has already contracted with the local car manufacturing
company to provide, in 1985 and 1986, 100 first-class special passenger
coaches. The economic evaluation of investments in passenger coaches is
mostly based on the benefits derived from avoiding traffic diversion to more
costly transport modes that would occur if the present N de M condemnation
program of obsolete coaches takes place without replacement. Investment in
coaches to provide new first-class services will require a full marketing
analysis, and the decision criteria will be based on the ability of the
serv,ce to achieve full cost recovery, including a return on capital.
14.       Underlying the measure of the economic merits of the investments in
passenger coaches is a detailed strategy of allocating existing and/or new
coaches to specific lines and type of services in order to maximize the
returns from the investment. In the "without" project case, the equipment
remaining after the condemnation program takes effect is assigned to the
lines with lowest operating cost per passenger-km so that traffic diversion
occurs on the lines with the highest operating costs. For the "with" project
case, new coaches are assigned to a specific service on the line with the
lowest operating costs, and the coaches currently used are transferred to the
best alternative use on the same line or on a line with higher operating
costs, resulting in a cascading of equipment. The cost-benefit of avoiding
diversion on another line is then evaluated. If investments on a specific
line and service are found to be justified, the economic analysis continues
for investments on the next line in terms of operating costs. This iterative
process stops when the optimum number of passenger coaches to be acquired is
found.



- 104 -                           ANNEX 7
15.       An initial analysis of the investment in coaches showed that
N de M's decision to acquire 100 first-class special coaches in 1985-lqR6 was
not sufficiently justified and that, at least, the 1986 tranche shonld he
postponed, if contractually feasible, and more attention plAced on first and
second-class replacement coaches. More detailed financial and economic
evaluations are required, particularly for the first-classR coaches. The
forecast of demand for passenger services on lines to which the new coaches
would be assigned should take into account the impact of the planned increase
in passenger fares, as well as the improved quality of services (Annex 6).
F. Other Types of Investment
16.       There are other N de M investments for which an economic evaluation
was not considered feasible, and only a technical evaluation was made to
confirm the utility of the proposed items. The major component in this
category is telecommunications, including the extension of communication
lines and equipment to stations and yards, and the equipping of locomotives
with radios, following the proposals of the consultant study financed under
the Second Railway Project (Loan 825-ME). The telecommunications investment
for 1985 totals Mex$ 3,244 million (US$15.1 million). N de M is carrying out
a post-evaluation of the benefits of prior telecommunications investments and
will use the results in assessing future investments.
17.       Also, workshop and track machinery have not received separate
economic evaluations, but have been reviewed from a technical perspective
(Annex 4). The costs of these items have been includeA in the evaluation of
locomotives and rolling stock for workshop machinerv, and in the evaluation
of rail rehabilitation for track machinery.
G. Evaluation Criteria
18.       All evaluated investments, whether subject to Bank financing nr
not, must have a minimum estimated economic rate of return of 12X unless
otherwise agreed with the Bank. Appropriate sensitivity tests are to he
applied to factors in the analysis subject to a relative degree of
uncertainty, including traffic and costs.
19.       In developing appropriate sensitivity tests, the foctis has heen on
the scope and timing of the diversion of traffic, the basis for much of the
calculated benefits. In some cases, equipment may he used a few more years
with higher maintenance costs, or traffic may take more time to respond to
declines in speeds related to a lack of rehabilitation or inadequate
signaling. The specific costs are difficult to quantify and, thus, a
sensitivity check of lagging traffic diversion, over a period of five years,
has been included in the locomotive and wagon analysis. Further refinements
to this analysis will be developed during the project and applied In the
annual investment review.

MEXICO
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Evaluation Guidelines for the SCT Investment Program
and Results of 1985 Evaluation
A. General Methodology
1.        As with the N de M investment plan, the approach of the Sector
Project for the economic evaluation of the SCT investments is to establish a
set of guidelines to be applied annually by SCT during its normal budgetary
preparations, covering all investment commitments to he made in the following
year. For the purpose of the appraisal of the Sector Project, the guidelines
were applied to subprojects which are to be committed in 1985, or for which
substantial expenditures are still required in 1985 to continue and/or
complete the works. The following summarizes the agreed upon guidelines and
the results of the economic evaluation of the 1985 investments.
2.        The economic evaluation of the SCT program for track realignment,
double-tracking, bypasses and new lines is based upon benefits derived from
the elimination of capacity and/or major operational constraints. The
methodology used for the evaluation of the subprojects included in the
program quantified the following benefits:
(a) operating cost savings due to the reduction of controlling ruling
grades and curvatures;
(b) savings derived from increased capacity, calculated as savings in
transport costs due to the avoidance of traffic diversion from rail
to road, or from rail to more costly rail lines;
(c) savings in time and vehicle operating costs accruing to road users
because of bypass rail lines to avoid urban developments; and
(d) reduced investments in new locomotives due to the release of
helpers" when grades are reduced.
B. Savings in Train Operating Costs
3.        Operating cost savings due to the reduction of controlling ruling
grades and curvatures are quantified as the difference between operating
costs in the "with' and 'without' project cases. The methodology basically
consists of the determination of the cost of operating a typical train in the
different sections of the line under study, as a function of the motive power
necessary to overcome the limiting sections.



-110-                             ANNEX 8
4.        Train operating costs are based mainly upon the quantification of
the following elements:
(a) amortization costs of the motive power needed for an adequate
operation of a typical train on the line, taking into account the
normal scheduled time as a function of the projected traffic;
(b) amortization costs of wagons;
(c) cost of fuel and oil consumed; and
(d) cost of the train crew.
C. Capacity
(i) Description of the Methodology Used for Evaluating Capacity
5.        To assess when individual lines would reach their capacity limits
and further demand would have to be diverted to more costly alternatives,
N de 1x and SCT have carried out a detailed series of analyses. Simple
theoretical assessments are made manually of the limiting number of trains
under existing conditions and with various improvements, such as increasing
the number of crossing stations, increasing the length of crossing stations
to take longer, heavier freight trains, introducing centralized traffic
control (CTC), relocation to reduce ruling grade and curvature, and provision
of double-track on controlling sections. These assessments are checked with
train diagrams and train timings. Traffic forecasts are developed to help
determine the appropriate timing for alternative additional capacities.
Costs and benefits are then assessed for the alternative or staged
investments.
(ii) Adequacy of the Caacity Analysis and Present Action Plan
6.        The methodology described above is adequate for identifying
potential bottlenecks and the years in which they are likely to occur, but it
will be necessary for SCT and N de M to develop more sophisticated and
detailed techniques during the course of the project for analyzing the
cost-effectiveness of alternative solutions for expanding capacity and/or
improving operating performance with regard to new potential investments. To
this end, it is proposed that the railways acquire and introduce a type of
computer program used by most other railways in developed countries called a
Train Performance Calculator (TPC). This type of computer program can be
used not only in performing capacity analysis, but also in many other areas,
such as:
(a) evaluation of fuel usage under varying operating conditions;
(b) scheduling of trains (most railroads now use TPC programs for
running time information for their train preparation);
(c) evaluation of time savings through various operating changes, such
as different powering strategies; and
(d) better information for use in any economic evaluation, such as
improving the quality of present calculations for fuel consumption.



-111 -                            ANNEX 8
7.        The TPC program requires details of the track profile as an input,
which do not appear to be readily available. The first step, then, for the
i.mplementation of the program would be to carry out line surveys.
Implementation of a TPC program, as an established day-to-day tool of both
Planning and Operations, is expected to take about two years. After that
period, the railway would have the necessary capability to consider the
acquisition, or creation, of even more detailed capacity analysis tools. The
Introduction of a TPC program, however, should be considered a first step
toward the ultimate objective of evaluating capacity through the use of a
redispatch technique - to stage the expansion plans for N de M's main lines.
D. Quantification of Benefits Accruing to Road Users Because of Relocation
of Lines
8.        For those projects in which rail lines are relocated to bypass
urban developments, SCT quantified the benefits derived from savings in
vehicle operating costs and passenger time accruing to road users because of
the elimination of level rail crossings. To that end, SCT considered two
'without" project situations:
(a)  that in which a train Is approaching the road and vehicles are
forced to stop and wait for the train to pass; and
(b)  that in which vehicles reduce their velocity only to effect the
rail crossing.
9.        The type and number of vehicles affected by each of the situations
are derived from the application of a Poisson probability distribution to
traffic data compiled for SCT's 1983 study, "The Specific Characteristics of
Road Users and Their Vehicles on the Basic Road Network." The study also
determined vehicle occupancy and the value of the time of drivers and
passengers for those vehicles considered in the analysis.
10.       To calculate vehicle operating costs in the "without" project
case, it was assumed that a vehicle approaching a rail crossing for which
signals are warning of a coming train, the process of deceleration and
acceleration to normal velocity after waiting for the train to pass takes
place over a road length of 100 m. The actual waiting time is derived as a
function of the velocity and the length of a train, which SCT estimates for
each line and for each type of train (direct, unit trains or passengers).
The -with' project case assumes that vehicles will reduce their velocities
slightly to effect a bridge-crossing.
E.   Reduced Investments in New Locomotives
11.       In those cases in which, because of reduced grades, "helper"
locomotives are no longer needed and can be incorporated into the rest of the
system, a one-year benefit, equal to the price of a new locomotive times the
number of locomotives released, is considered. The underlying assumption is
that the railway can reduce the number of locomotives in its purchase program
in the year subsequent to the completion of the project.

F.  Yard Investments
12.       Substantial investments are being considered to relocate major rail
yards in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Coatzacoalcos. Neither
N de M nor SCT have sufficient technical tools to assess these investments,
and, under the project, they should carry out a master plan of yard needs for
the network, focusing upon the projected future workload of yard facilities.
This plan would include an operational study to explore the possibility of
better handling efficiency in existing terminals. To conduct this study,
consultant assistance would be required, especially to install appropriate
computer models and to train local staff in the use of computer models in
analyzing yard capacity and design. The economic evaluation would be a
component of the master plan study.
G. Electrification Works
13.       No detailed analysis of the electrification works between
Mexico-Queretaro-Irapuato was conducted because of the level of completion of
those works. The equipment and materials have already been purchased
(including locomotives and catenaries), and the remaining investment relates
to final installation. A general evaluation, however, was carried out to
determine if the level of traffic was sufficient to justify electrification
following the methodology described in the Bank's Staff Working Paper
No. 634. 1/ In accordance with this methodology, it was found that the
traffic of 46.5 million gross tons on the Mexico-Queretaro line and 28.5
million gross tons between Queretaro and Irapuato exceeded the minimum
required.   No further electrification works are contemplated for the period.
H. Economic Criteria and Evaluation Results for 1985 Program
14.       All subprojects in the SCT rail investment program should have an
estimated economic rate of return of at least 12%. Sensitivity analyses
should consider a shortfall in projected traffic of 15% and a delay in
expected timing of traffic diversion. The results of the evaluation of the
1985 investment program are summarized in Table 1 of this annex along with
the characteristics of each subproject. Since many of the subprojects are
ongoing, the analysis was carried out with and without sunk costs. The
results were:
(a) that the program is economically viable with the exception of the
double-tracking between Ramos Arizpe and Villa Garcia. Excluding
this section, the estimated economic rates of return were above
15Z;
(b) that the ongoing work on one subsection of the Ramos Arizpe and
Villa Garcia line should be finished and put into operation, but
that the remaining subsections should not be tendered unless
further analysis of those subsections or a revised program for them
indicates the economic viability of the works; and

-113 -                            ANNEX 8
(c)  that the investments in Veracruz-Tampico and Hexico-Tampico
required more detailed evaluations, in terms of traffic potential
and the comparative advantage of rail over other modes, and should
be postponed.
15.       It was also found, in the evaluation of ongoing subprojects, that
alternative levels of improvement were not always compared sufficiently.
More appropriate alternatives analysis is to be performed for any new
investments in the SCT program, and more sophisticated modeling capabilities
will need to be provided under the project. Subprojects to be included in
the investment program in subsequent years will, thus, be analyzed by
applying more refined procedures.

MEXICO
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Project Implementation
A. Annual Updating of Investment Programs
1.        By November of each year during project execution, beginning in
1985, N de M and SCT would update their rolling four-year rail investment
programs, applying procedures and criteria agreeable to the Bank (para 4.05
of the report). The updating would consist of revised traffic forecasts, the
technical and economic evaluation of new investment commitments to be made
under the following year's budget, the review of costs for ongoing
investments and the reevaluation of those investments whose real costs are
expected to increase by more than 20%, and a projection of investment needs
in the subsequent years, taking into consideration probable budgetary
levels. The Bank would carry out a review of the updated proDgrams in time
for SCT and N de M to incorporate Bank comments in the finalized budget. SCT
and N de M would provide, annually, a listing of the items to be financed
under the loan in the subsequent year and any related data that the Bank
shall reasonably request.
B. Procurement
2.        The principal items to be purchased with the proposed Bank loan
would be rails, track and workshop machinery and components for freight cars
and passenger coaches. In addition, the estimated foreign exchange content
of selected SCT civil works in the project would be financed from the
proposed loan. All items to be procured using the proceeds of the proposed
loans, as well as the civil works contracts, would be subject to
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Also, financing for consultant services and for the foreign exchange content
of the training program would be provided under the project following Bank
guidelines for procurement.
3.        The tenders for rails, machinery and parts for N de M would be
coordinated by N de M (Sub-Gerencia de Adquisiciones) whereas those required
by SCT would be processed by the Direccion General de Vias Ferreas (DGVF)
of SCT. In bid evaluation, Mexican manufacturers would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of -.ompeting imports, or the
relevant prevailing level of custom duties, whichever is lower. Tenders In
connection with civil works for SCT would be processed by DGVF after
satisfactory review by the Bank of the technical and economic evaluations of
the candidate investments provided by SCT or its consultants. For goods
having an estimated contract value equal to or less than US$500,000
equivalent, tender documents and proposed awards would not be subject to
prior review provided that the aggregate of such contract amounts does not
exceed US$50 million equivalent. For goods having an estimated contract
value of more than US$500,000 equivalent and all remaining goods contracts,
all draft tender documents and proposed awards would be subject to prior
review. All civil works draft tender documents and procedures would be
subject to prior review. Proposed awards, however, would not be subject to



- 116 -                           ANNEX 9
prior review. The time allowed for preparation of civil works bids would be
45 days for tenders having an estimated contract amount of less than US$10
million equivalent, 60 days for those with estimated contract amounts of more
than US$10 million equivalent but less than US$20 million equivalent, and 90
days for larger contracts. For preparation of bids for goods, the time
allowed would be 45 days for tenders having an estimated contract amount of
less than US$5 million equivalent, 60 days for those with estimated contract
amounts of more than US$5 million equivalent but less than US$20 million
equivalent, and 90 days for larger contracts.
4.        The components for freight cars and passenger coaches, to be
procured through ICB and financed under the loan, would be used in the
manufacture of freight cars and passenger coaches by Constructora Nacional de
Carros (CN), a state-owned enterprise which operates efficiently on a
commercial basis and produces good quality cars at internationally
competitive prices; these prices are subject to Government review and
approval. CN's factories have the capability to produce 3,000-3,500 freight
cars and up to 200 passenger coaches per year. Therefore, the Mexican
Government and N de M have requested, in keeping with the Government's policy
of utilizing installed capacity, that construction and final assembly of
freight cars and passenger coaches be reserved for CN during the prciect
period and that Bank financing be provided only for directly imported
components, as in the Fourth Railway Project, estimated at about 10-15% of
the final car and coach price.
5.        The design and specifications of the freight cars to be
manufactured by CN are considered satisfactory. However, the proposed design
for the passenger coaches is relatively old in terms of current practice in
the rest of the world, where tubular, all-welded, anti-telescopic designs are
being used which are not only lighter, but also relatively safer, in case of
acc4dents. The Bank has, therefore, recommended to N de M and CN that, with
the substantial number of passenger coaches to be manufactured in the next
few years, CN should explore the possibility of modernizing the design of the
coach and importing the required technology to manufacture the new design.
If, therefore, this change of design can be accomplished without an
uneconomic increase in the price of the coach due to the change in
technology, it would be desirable to adopt the revised designs.
C. Disbursements
6.        For imported goods, disbursements would be made on the basis of CIF
costs, and, with respect to bids won by local manufacturers under ICB,
disbursements would be made on the basis of 100% of the ex-factory costs.
With regard to civil works, the Bank would finance 100% of the estimated
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs, amounting to 35% of the total
cost of each work (excluding value added taxes, IVA) or 100% of direct
foreign exchange expenditures. The Bank would also finance 100% of the cost
of consultant services, which is equivalent to the foreign exchange cost, and
100% of the foreign exchange costs for equipment, computer software and
scholarships under the technical assistance and training programs. A special
account would be established following procedures agreed to under ongoing
Bank operations in Mexico. The estimated disbursement schedule for the
proposed loan, based upon the assumption that the loan would become effective
by November 1985, is shown in Table 4.13 of the report. The closing date
would be June 30, 1992.

D.   Accounting and Auditing
(i) N de H
7.        N de M has a competent accounting staff, and the accounts are
well managed and reasonably up-to-date. Much of the accounting has,
until recently, been processed manually, but, in May 1984, the Accounts
Department installed its own Burroughs B-21 Computer. Operating expenses
will be processed first, followed by operating revenues; this should help
to speed up production of periodic financial data. Technical assistance
should be provided under the project to help N de H to improve its
accounting function, particularly in computer operations and in providing
more detailed information for traffic costing.
8.        Internal audit is carried out by a unit operating independently of
the finance department, and reporting directly to the Director General.
The Government Secretariat of Control ("Contraloria") does not audit N de X's
accounts and relies upon the external auditors. However, the appointment of
auditors requires its approval, and their report is reviewed by
Contraloria before being issued.
9.        External audit is performed annually by independent professional
auditors, and it should be determined that N de M would continue to have
external audits carried out annually, in accordance with sound auditing
principles, by an independent auditor, and would forward the audit reports
and management letters to the Bank not later than six months after the close
of each fiscal year. A new auditing firm, acceptable to the Bank, was
selected by N de M and the Contraloria as of 1984.
(ii) DGVF
10.       Unless other auditing procedures are agreed upon with the Mexican
Government, proper use of loan proceeds would be controlled by the General
Directorate of Control of SCT, which is itself controlled "externally' by
the Secretaria de la Contraloria General de la Federacion, as well as being
subject to control by SPP. The latter arrangement is that which has
provisionally served the Bank's auditing requirements with regard to
Government ministries.
E. Project Monitoring
11.       SCT and N de M confirmed that they would prepare periodic reports
for the Bank in accordance with an agreed schedule and format covering the
progress of the project, and that they would prepare a project completion
report within six months of the closing date. In addition, the Bank would
meet semi-annually with Government and railway officials to discuss project
execution.
