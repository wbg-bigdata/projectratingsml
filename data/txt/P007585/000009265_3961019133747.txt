MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Mexico
Railway Sector Project (Loan 2575-ME)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Mexico: Railway Sector project (Loan 2575 -
ME, approved in FY85). The Loan for $300 million was closed on June 14, 1994, two years behind schedule.
An undisbursed balance of about $4.62 million was canceled. The PCR was prepared by the Latin American
and the Caribbean Regional Office, with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The Loan, the fifth to the Mexican railway system, was to assist the railways efforts to: (a) improve
their carrying capacity through investments; (b) improve their operating efficiency by better use of equipment
and human resources; (c) promote financial self-sufficiency through restructuring tariffs and rationalizing the
debt structure; (d) strengthen commercial practices, and (e) upgrade investment planning methods.
A predecessor railway project, thanks to tariff adjustments and increases in traffic, had improved the
railways' finances. The Railway Sector project suffered from a drop in traffic as deregulation of road transport
in 1989 led to a diversion of railway customers to the road; at the same time, while the railways carried out
substantial tariff increases, they were insufficient to match the hyperinflation during the period, when the peso
devalued by more than ten times vis-A-vis the American dollar. As a result, the railways' financial performance
actually deteriorated. During implementation, in response to the changed economic conditions, physical
investments were scaled down and reoriented to strengthening maintenance and rehabilitation of track as well
as locomotives and rolling stock, rather than to providing new capacity. These investments, combined with
substantial reductions in railway personnel towards the latter part of the project, helped in meeting most of the
operational efficiency targets. The reduction in labor force, as well as other operational and commercial
improvements were largely the result of a major program of railway reform which was enacted in 1991, and
which supported project objectives.
The PCR is comprehensive but omits to mention what was done, if anything, to improve investment
planning methods. The reevaluated economic rate of return for the project is calculated at 21 percent.
The project had mixed results: the major financial objectives were not achieved; a sensible reallocation
of investments led to an overall economic return which is probably acceptable; implementation of the program of
reform in parallel with and supporting the project, helped improved operational efficiency and launched new
initiatives for restructuring the railways. The project outcome is rated as marginally satisfactory, its
sustainability as uncertain and the institutional development as modest.
The project may be audited.

PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Railway Sector Project in
Mexico, for which Loan 2575-ME in the amount of $300 million was approved on June 11,
1985. The loan was closed on June 15, 1994, two years behind schedule, by when
$295,382,809.97 had been disbursed and $4,617,190.03 had been canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region, Country Department II (Preface Evaluation Summary and Parts I and
III). The Borrower's Report of Project Completion is incorporated as Part II.
This PCR is based, inter-alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee
and Project Agreements, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, internal Bank Memoranda, reports/data received from the Borrower, and
information available from the Project Files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(Loan 2575-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
(i)    The main physical and operational objective of the project, the improvement of the
railway operating efficiency through higher productivity of equipment and human resources,
was to a large extent achieved. However, the financial objectives were not achieved (para.
6.01), partly because traffic and tariffs did not increase as predicted (paras. 6.05 and 6.06)
and partly because of the adverse effects of incorporating other weak-performing railway
units into the national railway system (para. 6.02).
Implementation and Results
(ii)   Implementation of the project was adversely affected by various structural changes
undergone by the Mexican economy, including increased competition from a deregulated
road transport, resulting in lower railway traffic (para. 6.01). These difficulties forced FNNM
and the Government to launch a far reaching restructuring program, which reinforced the
objectives of the project and brought about economies in staff and improvements in
operating methods. During the course of the project, substantial cuts were made in the
investment program, although these changes were too little and too late to make a
continuation of FNM's structure and relationship with the Government sustainable.
Instead, greater emphasis was placed on the maintenance of existing infrastructure and
equipment. The overall re-evaluated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project is
21.2% compared with 16% to 56% for the various subprojects determined at Appraisal
(para. 6.08).
Sustainability
(iii) Despite reductions in investments, most of the essential components of the project
were implemented, although on a more modest scale than the one envisaged at appraisal. A
sustainable basis was established for maintaining railway equipment and infrastructure.
However, the failure to resolve the financial problems faced by the railway makes its
continuation on its present basis unsustainable. The Government plans to concession the
railway and make it largely independent of Government funding for both operations and



- ill -
investment. These changes do not alter the expectation that the projected level of net
benefits from the project will be achieved (para. 7.01).
Findings and Lessons Learned
(iv)   The period of implementation of this project (1985-1994) was a period of
considerable economic difficulties for Mexico. For the railway system, it was a period of
tumultuous change, starting with the unification of all railway operations into one railway
system. This created a concentration of economic, financial and operational problems
which the Government and FNM never completely resolved. A performance audit of the
Fourth Railway Project pointed out that deep structural change was required, with a need
for shifting from a production-oriented state-owned railway to a commercially oriented and
privately operated enterprise. This change should have been made at the time of unification.
Pursuing this objective, the Bank supported the "Programa de Cambio Estructural" (PCE)
or Program for Structural Change and appraised a Railway Restructuring Project in 1993.
This project would have supported the railway during the period of transition, but the
project did not materialize when the Government decided to accelerate the privatization
process.
(v)   Nonetheless, the PCE began to show immediate results in increased efficiency,
reflected in financial improvements for the first time in more than four years (para. 6.18).
Despite these improvements, progress was too slow for the Secretariat of Finance (SHCP),
which, in 1994, contracted consultants to review how railway services could most
effectively and efficiently be provided. The new Congress that took office in December
1994 already approved a Constitutional reform that would enable the privatization of the
railway and announced its intention to restructure it in the immediate future (para. 6.18).
(vi)  In the past two decades, railways in the US, UK, France, Sweden, Japan, New
Zealand, Colombia and Argentina have undergone a fundamental restructuring process, not
only to recast their relationship with Government, but also to change the manner of
conducting their business.   Railway restructuring, however, is a complicated and
contentious process. Critical policy decisions and their implementation can be productive
only if these emanate from a consensus within a country. In Mexico, the problems of
reforming the Collective Labor Agreements and staff downsizing have already been tackled,
and private sector involvement in the various railway operations is being increasingly
sought. However, the restructuring effort is now entering a critical phase in which the Bank
is working closely with the Mexican Government to prepare and implement the privatization
of FNM.
(vii) The unification of the railways, the deregulation of the tracking industry and the
Government's push for privatizing the railway were not and could not have been foreseen at
appraisal. However, using a sector format in the project contributed to making possible
adapting the project's scope and components as the environment changed.

11.    Backlround
2.01   Mexico has developed an extensive transport network, which comprises over
200,000 km of roads (including 67,000 km of paved and over 80,000 km of rural roads,
with the rest being state and local unpaved roads); about 26,000 knm of railways (all except
300 km being standard gauge); some 33 ports, of which 13 serve international traffic;
about 50 airports capable of handling medium or larger size aircraft; and over 20,000 km
of pipelines for crude oil, refined products and gas. For the ten years prior to 1982, traffic
on the nation's roads grew by 10% annually, with road traffic by the end of the period
representing an estimated 48% of total traffic in ton-km and over 90% in passenger-km.
Railway freight traffic, representing about 14% of total ton-km, experienced a growth of
7% annually in the same period. Even more significant growth rates were registered by
coastal shipping and pipelines because of increased oil production, resulting in estimated
shares of 15% and 21% respectively. After only limited growth prior to 1977, the ports
registered average annual increases of almost 17% in cargo tons handled after 1977. In
passenger transport, domestic aviation traffic increased by over 17% annually, with total
passenger-km generally equal to that of the railways.
2.02   During the 1960s and early 1970s, substantial amounts were invested in transport,
particularly roads, railways and aviation, with the transport sector receiving about 20% of
all public investment. With the trunk network generally in place, emphasis shifted to
operational improvements and pricing, and using transport investment to foster the
development of outlying areas, especially through the extensive rural roads construction



2
program of the mid- 1 970s. Transport investment declined to 9% of all public investment.
This investment policy, however, proved to be untenable with the surge of economic
activity in the late 1970s, which was accompanied by accelerated growth in traffic in all
modes.  Between 1978 and 1981, serious port and rail bottlenecks emerged, clearly
affecting the operation of basic industries and the conduct of international trade.
Consequently, in  1977, the Government launched  an important industrial ports
development program and a major track improvement and modernization plan for the
railways. While the highways' share of transport sector investments declined from 68% in
1977 to 44% in 1984, the railways' share grew from 39% to 42%. Although there were
instances of premature investment and some works suffered from poor programming, the
overall response of the Government to the situation in those years was appropriate.
2.03  In 1985, when this Project was appraised, all transport agencies were incorporated
under the Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT). A Subsecretariat for
infrastructure in SCT handled infrastructure development for almost all transport, and a
Subsecretariat for Operations had responsibility for operational, regulatory and tariff
matters.  A Directorate General for Planning (DGP), which reported directly to the
Secretary, was in charge of overall planning and budget preparation. Planning units within
the various modal directorates were responsible for identifying and proposing capital
investments and for providing technical details required for the analysis of such
investments. DGP, in turn, had the responsibility for carrying out the economic feasibility
analysis and providing a multimodal and consistent analytic framework for the preparation
of the medium  and long-term  investment programs.  With the recent institutional
reorganization of the sector, SCT had been upgrading its planning procedures and criteria,
with the Bank providing assistance to this effort under various transport loans. In addition
to SCT, the old Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP - now absorbed by
SHCP), played an important role in ensuring consistent modal planning. The Directorate
for Public Infrastructure of SPP approved the proposed SCT investments and operating
budgets and conducted a serious review of all major investments in the sector.
2.04   To carry out the sector's price and operational regulation, SCT and the Secretariat
of Finance (SHCP) shared responsibilities.  SCT, through its Directorate General for
Tariffs (DGT), made the final decision with regard to pricing of transport services
provided by private operators, such as trucking companies and private port operating
firms. For quasi-public enterprises, such as the railways and public port operating entities,
DGT reviewed and made recommendations to the Pricing Unit of SHCP for final
decisions. Other types of regulation of transport services were carried out by various
directorates in SCT under the Subsecretary of Operations.  Since October 1994, the
railways have been free to set their own tariffs and fares, subject to any rationally
negotiated agreements with labor interests.
2.05   The Bank had an extensive involvement in the Mexican transport sector. Nine
highway loans had been made, focusing on the trunk network, the first in 1960 and the
ninth (a Second Highway Sector Project - Loan 2428-ME) in 1984. There were four
Railway loans, with the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1929-ME) in execution at the time
of appraisal of this Project. In addition, there had been four port loans, including a port
preparation loan in 1981 (Loan 1964-ME), the Lizaro Cirdenas Industrial Port Project
(Loan 2450-ME) and the Ports Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2946-ME). For air transport,



3
an airport loan (Loan 1022-ME) was made in 1974 and completed in 1982. The four
Bank Railway projects, one for Ferrocarril del Pacifico and three for NdeM, helped to
finance important rehabilitation and modernization works, such as track renovation,
strengthening of bridges and the purchase of locomotives, rolling stock and other
equipment. The first loan (103-ME) of US$61 million for Ferrocarril del Pacifico was
made in 1954, and the works were completed successfuilly in the late 1950s. The second
loan (825-ME) of US$75 million for the rehabilitation of NdeM was made in 1972 and
completed in 1977. The third Railway loan (1232) for US$100 million was made in 1976
and completed in 1982, and the fourth loan (1929-ME) was made in 1980 for US$150
million and completed in 1986. None of the earlier Railway projects were directed at
financing major infrastructure works under SCT.
2.06   As a follow-up of the Fourth Railway Project, the Government of Mexico initially
proposed two Railway loans, one for the NdeM and the other for the SCT, to take care of
new construction and realignment works. However, a Bank identification mission in
1983, as well as Sector Study Note proposed one loan with two components for the
NdeM  and SCT.  In October 1983, the first Project Brief detailed the proposed
investments on NdeM and under the aegis of the SCT, the former to improve NdeM's
services, and the latter to finance complementary projects to improve Railway capacity by
double-tracking, electrification and realignment and regrading'. A preparation mission
visited Mexico in March 1984, and revised Project briefs were prepared in August 1984
and October 1984, expanding the Project and the issues. Following an Appraisal Mission
in October 1984, the Issues paper highlighted the principal issues as financial (the
railways' debt and financial position), the need for adequate and appropriate tariff
increases, the railway's passenger services, and the SCT's investment program. During
the following missions, a Plan of Action and an Investment Plan for 1985 were agreed,
and it was decided that the Project would follow a sector (time-slice) approach, whereby
the first year (1985)'s program was evaluated in detail, and the subsequent years'
investments would be reviewed and agreed through annual reviews. These would take
into account the latest trends in rail traffic and the country's economy.
III.   Proiect Obiectives and Description
3,01   The Railxvay Sector Project (Fifth Railway Project) was designed to support the
continued improvement of the Mexican railways and to broaden Bank participation in
NIeMico's transport sector, following on the Fourth Railway Project (1929-ME), the
Second Highway Sector Project (2428-ME) and the Lazaro Cardenas Industrial Port
Project (2450-NE). The Project would provide assistance to help finance the 1985-1988
time-slice of the NdeM and SCT Railway investment programs, and, by including the
financing for SCT works, it would represent a wider involvement than that under previous
railway projects. The long-standing relationship between NdeM, SCT and the Bank, and
the experience gained through a series of consecutive transport projects, made it possible
to apply a sector loan format to this Project, assigning the responsibility for appraising
'  Man) lines, wvhich wcre constructed in the ninctccnth century, had sharp curvcs and gradicnts w-hich

investment commitments beyond the first year to the staff of NdeM and SCT, based on
detailed procedures agreed with the Bank.
3.02   The overall objective of the Project was to support Government and Railway
efforts to implement a Plan of Action, which would:
(a)  improve Railway traffic carrying capacity through a balanced investment
program;
(b)   continue improvements in Railway operating efficiency through higher
productivity of equipment and human resources;
(c)   promote financial self-sufficiency for Railway services with tariffs
appropriately related to Railway costs and a rationalized debt structure;
(d)   strengthen commercial practices for Railway services; and
(e)   upgrade planning methods for assessing Railway infrastructure
requirements.
IV.   Proiect Desien and Organization
4.01   The total NdeM and SCT Railway investment program for 1985-1988 (para. 4.02)
was estimated to cost US$2,354 million equivalent (including physical and price
contingencies), of which NdeM represented US$1,325 million equivalent and SCT
US$1,029 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost of the total program, including
the indirect foreign exchange for SCT rail infrastructure civil works, was estimated at
US$849 million equivalent, of which NdeM represented US$457 million equivalent and
SCT US$392 million equivalent. A detailed analysis of the 1985 investment proposals and
a more general review of the proposals for subsequent years were carried out. It was
confirmed at negotiations that, by November of each year, beginning in 1985, NdeM and
SCT would prepare, for Bank comment, an updated four-year investment program with a
detailed breakdown for the following year based upon agreed technical and economic
criteria. No investment was to be included unless it had an estimated rate of return of at
least 12%.

4.03   It was proposed that, out of the total of estimated S2,354.40 million, $44.5 million
would be financed from  the then ongoing Loan (1929-ME), $300.00 million from  the
proposed loan ($150 million each for NdeM & SCT), S273.9 million from Suppliers'
Credits and Commercial Banks, and $1,736 million from the Government's own
resources.
4.04   NdeiVI Investment Program
(a) General. The NdeM  program  for the period 1985 through 1988 was about
US$300 million equivalent per year (in 1985 prices), compared with about
US$370 million equivalent in the 1980-1982 period, with a direct foreign
exchange component of about 34%.  The composition of the program,
summarized in the following paragraphs, shows that the investments were to be
weighted heavily toward track maintenance and rehabilitation, with all track-
related investments reaching 28% of total investments.
(b) Track. The track rehabilitation program with new rail was expected to cover
an average of 360 km per year at an average cost per km of about US$150,000
equivalent (in mid-1985 prices) (Map IBRD 18768). Track rehabilitation on
lower traffic density lines with recovered rail would cover 223 km per year
over the same period at an average cost per Km of US$30,000 equivalent. In
addition, NdeM planned to purchase about US$71 million equivalent worth of
track maintenance machinery (in mid-1985 prices), about 45% of it in 1985, as
part of its plans to mechanize track maintenance.



6
(c) Signalin.g. With the objective of providing CTC on heavily used single-lines, a
plan foreseen in the Fourth Railway Project but inadequately implemented
because of lack of financial resources, NdeM proposed the following works in
1985: completion of CTC works in hand between Guadalajara and Irapuato
(250 km); installation of CTC between San Luis Potosi and Benjamin Mendez
(345 km); and completion of the study for providing CTC between Lecheria
and Veracruz (404 km) as well as initiating the purchase of materials. In
addition, the 1985 budget provided for the renovation and modernization of
the over-aged car control and signaling equipment in the Valle de Mexico
marshaling yard, to serve the longer and heavier cars now in use.  The
continuation of CTC works in 1986-198S was likely to be confined to the
completion of the above-mentioned works.
(d) Telecommunications. Under the Third and Fourth Railway Projects, NdeM
was in the process of making an analysis of the combined Telecommunications
and Operational Control System installed over the network. Work in 1985 to
1988 would comprise extension of the telecommunications system to the
former FUS Railway and, later, to the other three Railways - Pacifico,
Chihuahua and Sonora-Baja California. The main work for 1985 comprised
purchasing additional VHF radios for 700 locomotives and for track and train
crews, as well as extending telephone exchange and teleprinter facilities.
(e) Motive Power.  As efficiency, particularly locomotive availability, was
expected to improve during the implementation of the Plan of Action, NdeM
would minimize its locomotive purchases. In 1985 and 1986, about 20 new
locomotives were expected to be acquired each year at a cost of US$1.2
million per unit (US$24m). Also, 20 existing locomotives were scheduled for
rehabilitation each year, at a cost of US$230,000 per unit. NdeM was also
expected to build up its locomotive spare parts inventory, which had been
depleted in previous years.
(f) Rolling Stock. Based on the traffic forecasts and the target indices for wagon
turnaround, NdeM intended to purchase 460 wagons in 1985 and an additional
1,500 wagons per year from 1986 to 1988 at an average unit cost of
US$65,000 equivalent. The Railway expected to rehabilitate 700 wagons in
1985 and a similar number annually thereafter, at an average unit cost of
US$35,000 equivalent. Furthermore, NdeM had initiated the purchase of 330
passenger coaches, beginning with 30 first-class special coaches in 1985, at an
average cost of US$500,000 equivalent each. These purchases would be
reviewed, as the Bank did not consider them justified.
4.05  SCT Investment Program.
(a) The SCT program was about US$230million equivalent (in 1985 prices), with
a direct and indirect foreign exchange content of about 38%. About 67% of
the line works and electrification investments in the 1985-1988 program were
directed at completing ongoing works.  The main items in the program
included:



7
(i)  completion of double-tracking, with electrification, on the Mexico
City-Queretaro-Irapuato line;
(ii) regrading and realignment of the Mexico City-Veracruz line and of
sections between Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos;
(iii) completion of a new line between Guadalajara and Monterrey to
facilitate direct movement between Manzanillo and Monterrey, and
the construction of appropriate bypasses around Guadalajara;
(iv) construction of rail bypasses at Monterrey and Saltillo; and
(v)  completion of track realignments between Mexico City and Lazaro
Cardenas.
(b) Tentative provision was also made for the continuation of a new line between
Veracruz and Tampico and the construction of a new line between Mexico
City and Tampico. Major investment in these subprojects, except for contracts
which had already been initiated, was postponed pending further studies, and
limited budgetary resources were directed toward advancing works already
nearing completion. There was also a provision in later years for major yard
investment, depending upon the results of the proposed studies. Some of these
rather over-ambitious programs were later eliminated, after detailed studies
(para. 5.02 ).
(c) DGVF also proposed acquiring specialized machinery in order to carry out the
construction program effectively. This would require a total of about US$10
million equivalent (in 1985 prices) between 1986 and 1988.
Plan of Action
4.06   To complement the Investment Program, the railways and the Government, in
consultation with the Bank, established a series of operational and financial targets to be
achieved during the Project period 1985-1988, as well as the major steps to be taken to
achieve the goals agreed upon. The Project was programmed for completion in 1991.
V.    Project Implementation
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
5.01   The Project was appraised in October 1984, negotiated in April 1985 (after a post-
appraisal mission), and approved by the Board in June 1985. The Loan Agreement was
signed in July 1985 and became effective in February 1986. In the meanwhile, there were
two supervision missions, one in July 1985 and the other in September 1985, which
reported the start-up of Project activities. The last of these missions was concerned
mainly with the consequences of an earthquake (8.1 on the Richter scale) which had its



epicenter near the Pacific Coast, close to the border between the States of Michoacan and
Guerrero. The earthquake and subsequent aftershocks caused severe damage in Mexico
City, Jalisco, Michoacan, Colima and Guerrero, particularly in the Lazaro Cardenas Port
area (which is also a rail terminal for the Port and the Steel plant). The mission found that
damag,e to Project related rail works was marginal.  Fcllowing missions reviewed
investments in 1985 and the planned investments in 1986. In general, the level of FNM
investments in 1985 was maintained in 1986, but SCT significantly reduced its
infrastructure investments and concentrated on completing existing projects.  Bank
missions also recommended that a study be conducted on operations in the extensive Valle
de Mexico marshaling yard, to reevaluate the need for proposed investments, and advised
that the problems in the Monterrey and Coatzacoales yards could also be solved by minor
works and operational changes rather than major investments.
Project Execution
5.02   The adoption of the Sector format for this Project permitted annual reviews of and
adjustments to planned projects. This indeed proved very useful. In the first place, the
expectations of the traffic increases foreseen at appraisal did not materialize. Secondly, the
unification of the other Railway systems (Ferrocarril del Chihuahua-Pacifico, Ferrocarril
del Pacifico and the Sonora Baja) in 1987 and the conversion of Nacionales de Mexico
(NdeM) into Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (FNM), changed substantially the
character of NdeM, as the amalgamated railways were less efficient, carried less traffic,
were more over staffed, and were in generally poorer financial condition than NdeM. As a
result, substantive changes had to made in the Investment Program and to the financial
targets.  By 1989, it was no longer considered necessary or desirable to keep
infrastructure investment separate from railway operations and maintenance, so the
Direcci6n General de Vias Ferreas (DGVF), responsible for the construction program of
the SCT, was transferred to FNM. This move represented an important change in
philosophy, with railway infrastructure investment being seen as related to the efficiency of
railway operations rather than to economic development. A first result was further cuts in
the new investment program in favor of track conservation works, procurement of spare
parts, and additional equipment and machinery for repairs and maintenance of track,
locomotives and rolling stock. Another significant development associated with the same
change of philosophy was the virtual elimination of the passenger coach acquisition
program for money-losing passenger services.
5.03   The slower rate of investment extended the span of the Project from 1985 to 1993,
with greater emphasis on track maintenance and repair and rehabilitation of locomotives
and wagons. In accordance with this trend, 3,611 km of track were rehabilitated with new
rail in 1985-1993, instead of the 1,923 km foreseen at appraisal for 1985-1988. As for
rehabilitation with second hand rails, 2,145 km were completed in 1985-1993, rather than
1, 1 16 km foreseen at appraisal. On the other hand, several of SCT works were deleted or
substantially reduced, only $39.1 million of the $150 million originally set aside for SCT
was used by them. The balance of $1 10.9 million was transferred to FNM to finance
extended track conservation works, track machinery, spare parts for locomotives, and
machinery to modernize maintenance workshops.



9
5.04   Except for the 1985 investments, which were evaluated at appraisal, the other
investments were to be undertaken only after detailed evaluation taking into account the
evolving needs of the economy.  Project execution illustrates an increase in track
conservation works, larger investments in spare parts, machinery and equipment, as well
as cuts in the new construction works initially included in the investments to be made by
SCT. In general, the individual investments over the nine-year period 1985-1993 costed
less than the investments estimated at appraisal for the four year 1985-1988 period (para.
5.05).
Project Costs
5.05   Analysis of Project costs was complicated not only because of the relatively high
and fluctuating inflation rates but also because the parity between the dollar and the
Mexican Peso varied considerably during the Project period. A comparison between the
Appraisal Estimates and the Actual Costs (in US$) is given in Tables 3 and 4 (Part III).
The estimated and Actual Financing Plan is given in Table 5 (Part III). With all the
changes that were made, actual investments in 1985-1993 were $2,147.4 million, less than
the appraisal estimate of $2,354.6 million for the four-year period 1985-1988. The local
costs of the Project were $1,409.4 million instead of $1,535.3 million and the foreign
exchange costs $738.0 million instead of $819.3 million estimated at appraisal. Regarding
the Bank loan, $4.6 million were canceled out of a total of $300 million.
5.06   The main features of Project implementation were:
a) Lack of economic growth, a change in economic structure, and increased and
unforeseen competition from deregulated road transport made it possible to
reduce substantially planned new investments for a lower level of rail traffic.
Financial constraints slowed the completion of those projects that were
implemented;
b) the Project was actually completed in 1993;
c) a large number of SCT infrastructure works were canceled, and the scarce
resources available to the FNM, were concentrated on a stronger maintenance
and conservation program, aimed at rehabilitating track, motive power and
rolling stock.
Disbursements
5.07   Table 6 (Part III) gives the position of the estimated and actual Schedule of
Disbursements.  Disbursements actually started in 1986 soon after the loan became
effective and by the end of 1987 about $68 million were disbursed against $1 11 million
foreseen. The shortfall occurred mainly due to the reduction of the SCT investment
program and the spacing out of the investments over a longer period. By the end of 1988,
$118.8 million were disbursed; by 1990, $206.3 million; reaching $295 million by the end
of 1993. The Loan Closing date was extended once on June 26, 1992 to June 30, 1993.



10
The last disbursement was made on May 31, 1994 and the loan was closed on June 15,
1994, with $295,382,809.97 disbursed and $4,617,190.03 canceled.
VI.   Proiect Results
Project Objectives
6.01   The main objective of the Project, the improvement of Railway operating
efficiency through higher productivity of equipment and human resources, was achieved to
a large extent, although the forecasted financial improvements did not materialize.
Provision of additional capacity, considered important by the Government at the time of
appraisal, became largely irrelevant as rail traffic diminished throughout the Project.
Nonetheless, compliance with the operational and investment targets of the Project was
substantial (Table No. 10, Part III). Targets of locomotive utilization and locomotive
availability were largely achieved due to the reinforced program for rehabilitation and
procurement of spare parts. Freight car availability also improved as did average wagon
load. Wagon turn-around deteriorated, due to the drop in traffic and an ingress of foreign
cars. Staff productivity2, which was 644,134 in 1985, fell steadily to 478,583 in 1991, due
to lower freight and passenger traffic. When the PCE kicked in, with reductions in staff,
economies in cost, and improvements in train operations (Para. 6.02), staff productivity
rose again to 665,080 in 1992 and to 698,674 in 1993.
6.02   The absorption of the Chihuahua, Pacifico and Sonora Baja Railways and the
Sleeping Car Company (Servicios de Coches Dormitorios) by FNM in 1987, followed by
the transfer of SCT's Railway Infrastructure Directorate (Direcci6n General de Vias
Ferreas) increased the Railway network from 20,287 km to 26,399 km. This absorption
was associated with a significant increase in staff and no appreciable increase in traffic,
with the result that staff productivity fell from 750,000 in 1987 to 575,965 in 1988 and to
a low of 478,581 in 1991. In January 1991, the Government appointed a new Director
General, and a number of department heads and senior officers were also changed. One of
the first acts of the new administration was to table a proposal for a significant
restructuring of the Railway, entitled 'Programa de Cambio Estructural" (PCE). This
Program reinforced the objectives of the Bank-financed Project and implied a change in
FNM's orientation from a production-oriented railway to that of a commercial enterprise.
To this end, the following measures were taken:
(a) modifying the collective labor agreement to bring about better staff utilization;
(b) implementing a voluntary retirement program to reduce labor force by more
than 30% in two years;
(c) organizational reform and administrative modernization to strengthen the
enterprise's commercial functions. A competitive pricing policy was
introduced so that, by the end of the Project, more than 90% of freight was
being carried under negotiated contracts rather than at published tariffs;
-  Mcasured as the sum of ton kms and pass kms per cmploycc.



I1
(d) modernizing operations, by updating technology;
(e) canceling unprofitable passenger services, closing redundant installations, and
selling some redundant assets;
(f) encouraging private sector participation in railway activities, particularly track,
locomotive and wagon maintenance.
6.03   Following the PCE, 22,450 staff positions were eliminated by the end of 1993.
Also by 1993, a new management structure of the enterprise was introduced; the train
order system was replaced by CDT (Control Directo de Trafico) over the most densely
used parts of the network, and by radio control elsewhere; and the inefficient manual
wagon, control system was replaced by a computerized system, SICOTRA (Sistema
Integral de Control de Transportes). In addition, FNM discontinued less-than-carload
traffic and most uneconomic passenger services; introduced private sector participation in
yard operations and in maintenance of motive power and rolling stock; and improved track
maintenance by greater mechanization and introducing 'hy-rail" trucks for track inspection
and repairs.
Traffic
6.04  The project was conceived on the basis of providing physical capacity for the
expected increase in'traffic and improving the financial results of the railway, as economies
of scale became more apparent. Two projections of traffic were made in the SAR, a higher
rate for infrastructure and operations planning and a lower rate for economic and financial
evaluations. Even the lower rate turned out to be very optimistic, although the assumed
figures were reasonable at the time they were projected.
6.05   Traffic failed to keep up with expectations and instead of economies of scale there
was diseconomies, as traffic declined faster than costs could be cut. Financial targets were
not met, and indeed the financial results of the railway continued to get worse throughout
the course of the Project, despite superficial attempts by the Government to try to control
them. The railway was adversely affected by the above mentioned macroeconomic and
structural changes, a reversal in the competitive situation of the railway relative to other
transport modes, and the Government's interference in setting rail tariffs. These factors,
together with the railway's failure to take timely actions to control costs (particularly
labor), were the principal causes contributing to the railway's poor financial performance.
6.06   The lower freight traffic projections included in the SAR were based on a detailed
consideration of each of the main products carried by the railway and or interviews with
representatives of its principal clients.  The resulting projections considered a 3.5%
growth per year in ton km over the life of the project, compared with an achieved growth
of about 3.2% over the previous fifteen years. Although the SAR contained no explicit
forecasts on economic growth, the assumed traffic growth rate must have been based on
an assumption of even higher economic growth, such as about a 5% annual growth in
GDP in both 1984 and 1985. But, rather than growing, total GDP in 1988 was almost
identical to that of 1985, with declines in the agricultural and mining sectors, which had



12
been expected to provide for most of the growth in rail traffic. In addition, traffic
projections failed to take into account the structural change in Mexican industry that came
about half way through the life of the project. One of the policies of the new
administration that took office in 198S was to reduce the size of the public sector
involvement in the economy. Many state industries that had been 'baptive" to the railway
were privatized and became responsible for their own transportation choices.
6.07   The changes mentioned in paras. 6.02 and 6.05 occurred at the same time that the
Government was implementing a road transport deregulation policy which also had
significant consequences for the railway. The road transport industry was characterized
by over regulation and inefficiency in the early and mid 1980s. Realizing the negative
impact of this inefficiency on economic growth, the new Government deregulated road
freight and passenger transport in 1989, with dramatic results. The for-hire road vehicle
fleet increased by more than 50% in less than two years and there was a widely recognized
improvement in the quality and range of services offered, even though transport tariffs
were reduced only slightly. The railways were unable to respond effectively or quickly
enough to these changes. There was an immediate and significant reduction in rail
transport of many agricultural and industrialized products. The volume of freight traffic
started to fall at the inception of the project, after a period of twenty years of almost
uninterrupted growth. The reduction in freight traffic from 1985 to 1986, largely
attributable to a 40% increase in real tariffs and partly attributable to the privatization of
the industrial sector, was more than 10%, the highest recorded annual'reduction in recent
history. There was a similar reduction in 1989-1991, largely attributable to increased
competition from deregulated road transport. Behind both of these large reductions, there
was the beginning of a longer-term trend of reducing rail freight, due mostly to a poorer
quality of service. Although only the last of the causes just cited was directly attributable
to the railway itself, responsibility for the failure to respond in time and in scale to all these
environmental changes should be assigned to railway management.
Rates and tariffs
6.08   The 40% increase in real freight rates from 1985 to 1986 was a culmination of five
years of continuous increases in real rates after fifteen years of decline.  Financial
projections in the SAR had assumed a 2% annual average increase in freight tariffs, so the
40% increase in 1985 was far greater than expected. The increase, was supported by the
cost analyses reported in the SAR, which indicated that most rail freight rates were 50%
too low to recover working costs and were even further below competing road rates. The
response to the loss of traffic was to allow freight rates to fall in real terms throughout the
remainder of the project period, so that by 1993, rates were less than 80% of those in
1984. The two Operating Agreements that were in force from mid-1985 until 1987 failed
to identify responsibility for setting railway freight rates and were unclear even as to what
was the objective of tariff policy.
6.09   Passenger tariffs increased in real terms until 1988, then gradually declined until
1993. By the end of the project period, passenger tariffs were about 35% higher in real
terms than they had been in 1984, but at about US I cent per passenger km, they were still
inadequate even to cover marginal costs.



13
Financial results
6.10   FNM failed to satisfy the financial performance criteria of the project. Moreover,
the financial situation of the railway was a continual concern to both the railway and the
Government.  FNM  could not manage to improve its financial performance despite
implementing all the conventional policies to do so. In the end, the Government has
concluded that FNM's problems are irresolvable without a complete restructuring of the
railway, including separating railway operations from direct Government intervention and
finance.
6.11   The working and operating ratios had been improving in the three years prior to
project implementation, and this improvement was maintained in the first year of the
project, thanks to the large real freight rate increase. Expected growth in traffic and
increasing real tariffs, combined with control over cost increases, were expected to lead to
a continued improvement in financial results. The working and operating ratios of 0.76
and 1.08 in 1984 were expected to improve to 0.70 and 0.94, respectively, by 1988.
6.12   However, failure to maintain real freight rates, together with a continuing decline
in traffic and a failure to control costs after 1986, resulted in a rapidly worsening financial
picture.  By 1988, the working and operating ratios had reached  1.26 and  1.54,
respectively, and by 1992, they had reached 1.58 and 1.89. The small annual operating
surplus observed in 1983 and 1984 disappeared in 1985, and annual deficits increased to
almost US$800 million by 1992. The Government was aware of the worsening result but
for macroeconomic considerations was not prepared to take the measures that would have
improved the situation.
6.13   Railway operating costs increased significantly in 1985, with a 40% increase in real
labor unit costs followed by a further 23% and 21% in 1987 and 1988, respectively. The
last two increases coincided with the absorption by FNM of other state railways and
SCT's rail infrastructure unit. Although FNM's weakening financial situation was, in part,
a result of consolidating the financial results of all the federal Government's railway
activities, there was too little attention by the Government to the consequences of this
consolidation on the railway's performance and its ability to control labor costs. An
Operating Agreement made between the Government and the railway in 1985 was
abandoned foMlowing the first round of railway unification, and the second Operating
Agreement (19S3) was not renewed after its first (unsuccessful) year. There was a write
of 50% of the railway's long-term debt in the First Agreement and a further write off in
u;e second. Under both Agreements, the Government accepted to allow tariff increases,
but these were not implemented for fear of losing traffic, as it had occurred in 1985.
6.14   By 1992, the Government realized that more dramatic action was necessary and
encouraged FNM to develop its Plan for Structural Change (PCE). This was designed to
bring about needed staff reductions through voluntary redundancies and other cost
reductions through investing in technology and contracting and concessioning ancillary
services ('butsourcing'). The scope of these changes was limited by an unwillingness to
contemplate a change in the federal constitution, without which the railway (considered a
strategic asset), with its infrastructure development, maintenance and use, would have
remained under the Government 's direct control.



14
6.15   Memory of the traffic losses following the 19S5 increases, combined with a
tripartite agreement between the Government, unions and industrialists that Government
taxes and tariffs (including those of the railway) would not be increased, resulted in a
continued decline in real tariffs, even after the railway had the apparent freedom to
determine its own rates. By the end of 1993, more than 90% of rail freight was being
transported under contracts rather than at published rates. These contracts involved tariffs
lower than those published, but there were no counterpart agreements with the railway
clients that would have allowed reductions in operating costs to offset the lower tariffs.
6.16  In spite of the above, the PCE began to show results in increased efficiency that
were in turn reflected in improved financial results. The working and operating ratios
improved to 1.33 and 1.65, respectively, and the operating deficit diminished to less than
US$600 million. This financial improvement was too little and too slow to satisfy the
Government and was not reflected in operating improvements to satisfy the railway's
major clients. In the last year of the project, the Secretariat of Finance contracted
consultants to review how railway services could most effectively and efficiently be
provided, notwithstanding the constitutional constraint that existed at the time. One of the
first acts of the new Government that took office at the end of 1994 was to start the
process of removing that constraint and to announce its intention of restructuring the
railway.
6.17  The consultants' report indicated that the railway's freight operations were close
to financial viability and that this result could best be achieved by dividing the railway into
three regions to be operated independently and concessioned as quickly as possible. New
uncommercial services, including those for passengers, would only be provided. if an
Operating Agreement were to be made between the concessionaires and either the Federal
or the relevant State Governments. Unfu'nded pension obligations would be assumed by
the Federal Government, if these arose when the railway was still under its direct financial
control. Additionally, there would be a further write off of the railway's accumulated
debt.
Economic Re-Evaluation
6.18   At appraisal, a set of economic evaluation procedures and guidelines were
prepared by FNM and SCT in consultation with the Bank. These guidelines were applied
in analyzing investment commitments for 1985, whether or not Bank financing was
involved, and further applied in annual updating of the investment program. The principal
economic benefits of the rail investments were: (i) savings in rail operating costs as track
conditions improved and train delays were reduced; and (ii) savings from preventing a
diversion of traffic to higher-cost road transport, by ensuring sufficient capacity for
existing and future traffic levels. The evaluation showed that the 1985 investments had
estimated rates of return well above 12% and indicated the economic feasibility of the
1986-1988 investments. Some of the other SCT works did not appear well justified and
most of these investments were deleted during implementation (para. 5.02).
6.19   The Economic Re-evaluation has used the same methodology as that in the SAR,
although there has been some refinement, in view of the better availability of data for track



15
works, particularly in relation to accident cost reductions and track maintenance costs.
Traffic did not increase as forecasted and important adjustments were made in the
procurement of locomotive and rolling stock, not only because of the fall in traffic, but
also to spread out investments over the longer Project period. The re-evaluated ERRs are
detailed in Table 11, Part III, and are summarized below:
Sub-Proiect                      SAR  IRR
Track Rehabilitation with new rail      -      16.7%
Procurement of Hy-Rail Trucks           -     92.7%

Project average                         n.a.   21.2%
VII. Sustainability
7.01   Although this project was implemented during a difficult period of economic
adjustment and reorganization, most of the essential components of the project were
executed, although on a scale substantially more modest than envisaged at appraisal. A
suitable basis has been established for railway equipment and infrastructure maintenance.
This, together with institutional reforms introduced during the project period, augers well
for the realization of the full potential benefits of the project. It is fair to expect that the
level of net benefits throughout the economic life of the project would remain acceptable.
Resolution of the present financial problems of the railway by the proposed fundamental
restructuring and privatization would not change this conclusion. Despite these financial
problems, improvements in operational efficiency and maintenance practices are
themselves sustainable, and are likely to provide a better starting point for the newly
restructured railways than would have been the case without the project.
vm. Bank Performance
8.01   The Bank spent nearly 154 staff-weeks to prepare and appraise the project
including 323 person-days in the field (Tables 8A and 8B). A total of 181 staff-weeks was
spent on supervision, including 338 person-days in the field. This was a well-prepared
project that was adequately monitored.  However, the project as implemented was
substantially changed during the delayed implementation (para. 5.02). It is significant,
though, that when circumstances changed and the Borrower had to curtail or postpone
investment, the Bank responded by assisting in re-ordering project priorities and in
reducing investments to the minimum required. The project's Sector format, requiring
annual reviews, greatly helped in this process. As a result, the project implemented was



16
considerably leaner than the project appraised, and one that was certainly more meaningful
under the changed circumstances.
IX.   BorroNver Performance
9.01   During project implementation, the railway underwent far-reaching changes.
Through the merger with other railways under FNM's umbrella, the railway had to cope
not only with unifying operations, but also combining finances and administration. The
reorganization imposed a challenge on the borrower and led to the formulation and
implementation of the 'Programa de Cambio Estructural" (para. 6.02), resulting in a
reordering of collective labor agreements, sale of assets (to finance staff reductions), and
reductions in staff, redundant installations (such as workshops) and unprofitable services.
Thus, this was a period of considerable change to which the Borrower responded with
appropriate flexibility. Although the Borrower did not utilize the funds set aside in the
loan for technical assistance, FNM carried out from its own resources over sixty studies to
indicate the steps to be taken to reorganize the railway, reduce staff and services and seek
greater private sector participation. However, much remains to be done. This was the
last of a series of six Bank-financed projects for the Railways, and there was evidence of a
growing understanding of Bank analytical and procurement procedures. - The Borrower's
efforts in implementing the 'Programa de Cambio Estructural" started a restructuring
effort in the right direction.
X.    Proiect Relationships
10.01 Bank relationships with the Government, the Railways, Banobras, and various
other agencies dealing with project implementation were generally satisfactory.  The
procurement processes were properly executed and there were no serious differences
between the Borrower and the Bank, a result of nearly twenty years of continuous
dialogue in project implementation.
Xl.   Consulting Services
11.01 Less than a quarter of the S2.5 million equivalent provided in the Loan for
technical assistance and training was actually utilized, partly because of budgetary
restraints, and partly because FNM wanted to employ consultants of its own choice to
examine the issues related to the restructuring effort. Bank loan funds were utilized for
environmental studies, to develop a Master Plan, and to conduct detailed studies of
contamination problems near workshops and fueling stations, health and safety issues,
train accident prevention, and environmental protection measures with regard to new
works and maintenance operations. These studies were a prerequisite to the subsequent
concessioning of most workshops.

XII.  Project Documentation and Data
12.01 The Staff Appraisal Report was the basis for framing the legal documents and
provided a take off point for supervision and procurement of goods and services. Given
the eventual duration of the project (nine years instead of the originally conceived four
years), changes in Bank supervision teams, and in the Government and the Borrower's
management, the SAR also highlighted the project origins and objectives and provided a
frame of reference for alterations and amendments to the project content, which ensured
that the basic project objectives were maintained.
12.02 Reports from the borrower were received regularly, though with frequent delays.
The Borrower sent a brief 'Reporte de Terminaci6n del Proyecto" in June 1994, which
has been incorporated as Part II of this report. This was followed by further data in
October 1994 and January 1995, which provided important inputs into the preparation of
this report.

RAILWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(Loan 2575-ME)
PART H
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
I.    Evaluation of the Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned for the Future
Mexico's railways have been working with the World Bank for the past twenty
years, during which the Bank has provided funding for the execution of different specific
railway projects which has virtually amounted to a constant line of credit. Ferrocarriles
Nacionales de Mexico (FNM) is accordingly in a position to evaluate objectively the World
Bank's performance during or execution of the project financed by Railway Sector Loan
No. 2575-ME, in effect between July 31, 1985 and December 31, 1993.
Regarding the loans granted earlier and specifically the one under review, it can be
affirmed that the World Bank has fully performed its function of stimulating the
development of countries such as Mexico, which rely on external financing for carrying out
large-scale public projects of importance for their modernization and for their economic and
social progress.
FNM is especially appreciative of the World Bank's unfailingly professional attitude
and the understanding shown during the negotiations and throughout the project execution
period, since it was always at FNM's side with technical guidance and advice for
accomplishing the project's objectives.
It is worth underscoring that, in addition to the economic benefits from the
investments financed by the World Bank and the financial comparative advantages of its
loans, the advice provided to FNM through the frequent supervision missions during the
course of the project was of great value, because those missions were made up of persons
possessing extensive experience and impressive technical qualifications for identifying and
resolving railway-related problems, including detailed questions in specific areas. As a
result, their recommendations were invariably right on target and most valued by FNM's
management in addition to being heard and taken into account by the Federal Government,
and served to guide the execution of the measures necessary for tariffs, the revaluation of
FNM's assets, the assumption of liabilities, the sharpened focus of capital expenditure and
the establishment of performance contracts setting specific goals and commitments, are
concrete results of the advice provided by the Bank through the supervision missions.
In short, with the loan under review and those that preceded it, the Bank not only
contributed to the railways' development and modernization but also furnished the benefit



19
of valuable opinions that significantly assisted FNM's planning, execution, evaluation and
control work.
The main lesson learned from the execution of this project relates to the fact that the
financial targets set for FNM were overoptimistic, since their achievement was not solely
dependent on actions taken by FNM which, since it serves a secondary demand, had its
earnings severely impacted by the economic crisis Mexico suffered in the 1980s. For the
future, every effort should be made to set financial targets that are consistent with FNM's
actual circumstances and those prevailina in the environment in which it operates, so as to
ensure to the fullest extent possible that they are attainable.
II.    Self-Evaluation of FNM's Performance and Lessons Learrned for the Future
Despite the downturn in economic activity in Mexico in the 1980s, which impacted
most Mexican businesses and chiefly public-sector enterprises such as FNM, the railways'
performance during the execution of the Railway Sector Project under review is considered
acceptable, since almost the full amount of the loan was utilized. However, its effectiveness
had to be extended and the originally agreed use categories had to be modified to bring
them into line with the new operating conditions created by the absorption in 1987 of the
other Mexican railway companies which up till then had been under separate management,
namely the Chihuahua-Pacific Railway, the Pacific Railway, the Sonora-Baja California
Railway, and the Sleeping Car Company (Empresa de Servicios de Coches Dormitorio).
In addition, 1989 saw the transfer of the former Direcci6n General de Construcci6n
de Vias Ferreas (DGVF) from the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) to
FNM. DGVF was originally assigned to be executing agency for 50% of the Railway
Sector Project, equivalent to USS150 million of Loan 2575-ME, which commitment was
then also transferred to FNM.
The objectives of the Railway Sector Project--continuous improvement of the
railways' operation, strengthening of their marketing practices and improvement of railway
'panninc methods--were to a large extent achieved, notwithstanding the inevitable
consmraints on investment resources as a result of the country's economic problems.
The Railway Sector Program contained in the Staff Appraisal Report on Loan 2575-
NE envisaged investment of US$2,354.5 million in the period 1985-88, whereas the actual
av;cunt invested in that period was only 27.4% of that target, at USS644.8 million, on the
basis of annual sector expenditure in Mexican pesos at the average dollar exchange rate for
each year.
In the period 1989-93 the improvement in the Mexican economy meant that more
funds were available for railway investment purposes each year. Whereas between 1985
and 1988 average annual railway investment amounted to USS161.2 million, between 1989
and 1993 this average rose by 86.8% to US$30 1.1 million.



20
As regards the commitments FNM assumed vis-a-vis the World Bank, almost all
were carried out during the loan effectiveness period except for the financial targets set,
which FNM was unable to achieve because the exogenous macroeconomics variables that
made these targets impossible to meet were outside of its control. In addition, the funds set
aside for "Technical Assistance" were not utilized for that purpose, because following the
closing of the locomotive and rolling-stock shops and the contracting out of maintenance
and repair of this equipment FNM considered the technical assistance no longer necessary.
A part of these funds was used instead, with World Bank authorization, in the preparation
of an environmental plan and ecological audits necessary for FNM.
Besides the physical progress achieved in infrastructure and equipment
modernization, telecommunication systems and the handling of environmental problems, the
World Bank financing and advisory services also contributed to the preparation,
implementation and consolidation of the FNM Structural Change Program aimed at
producing an integral solution to the problems built up over preceding years in the Mexican
railway system. Formal implementation of this program was begun as of 1992, the main
results posted as of the end of 1993 being:
- Elimination of 22,450 positions.
- 46% improvement in staff productivity compared with 1991, in terms of traffic
units per worker.
- Gradual replacement of the train management system based on train orders by
the Direct Traffic Control (Control Director de Trafico - CDT) system and the
implementation of an Integral Transport Control System (Sistema Integral de
Control de Transportes - SICOTRA).
- The sustained increase in freight carried in 1992 and 1993, compared with 1991,
with a favorable shift toward specialized high economic density traffic.
- Discontinuation of express and less-than-carload services and of other
unproductive services, chiefly passenger and mixed trains.
- Introduction of private participation, which in addition to contributing rolling
stock now constructs and operates freight terminals and will provide motive-
power and rolling-stock repair and maintenance serves on a contract basis and
also perform part of the track rehabilitation work and all of the mechanized
maintenance.
- Establishment of an active marketing policy which makes it possible to capture,
by means of agreements with primary users, around 90% of the annual freight
carried; and
- Federal Government authorization to deregulate rail service tariffs, which from
now on will bet set by the railways in light of market conditions and the cost-
price ratio.



21
Throughout the planning, preparation and implementation phases of the above
program, due account was taken of the timely observations made by the frequent World
Bank supervision missions.
The main lesson learned and considered useful for future projects is connected with
planning of the operation of Mexico's railways, to ensure that in the future conservative
development scenarios are considered so that no unrealistic general goals are set that
subsequently lead to failures to meet financial targets and commitments.
III.   Proiect Relationships between the World Ba:nk and Ferrocarriles Nacionales
de Mlexico
The relationships established between the World Bank and FNM in the course of
Loan 2575-ME and previous operations were amicable, respectful and totally professional
based on philosophy of active collaboration in order to move ahead with and appropriately
conclude both the negotiations and the execution of the project within the time frame
agreed upon.
FNM always supported the specific work of each Bank mission, while the Bank
performed its responsibilities swiftly in accordance with its established rules and procedures
with a view to execution of the financing granted to FNM.
The information forwarded by the Bank concerning utilization of the loan funds and
the pertinent statements of account is clear and sufficient, although it would be desirable for
the balance confirmations required by FNM's outside auditors to perform their audit of its
financial statements after the close of the fiscal year to be made available earlier. This
requirement will have to be included in the subsequent information obligations for
subsequent years and any future IBRD loans to FNM.
IV.   Evaluation of the Performance of the Banco Nacional de Obras v Servicios
Publicos. S.N.C. (BANOBRAS)
Banobras was the institution designated by the Mexican Government to act as
fin---zal agent between the World Bank and FNM  during the Railway Sector Project
.i-.t,rced by IBRD Loan 2575-M[E. Throughout the execution of the project BANOBRAS
,as at all times fully abreast of its progress, performing its liaison function promptly and
efficiently, carrying out all the procedures for which it was responsible and establishing a
quick-acting communication process. Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico hereby expresses
its sincere appreciation to the Federal Government, the World Bank and BANOBRAS for
the support they provided to enable satisfactory completion of the Railway Sector Project
funded by IBRD Loan 2575-ME.
