PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
SLOAN 1867-BR)
PREFACE
This is the Project completion Report (PCR) for the iio-LieaL
Basic Education Project in Brazil, for which Loan 1867-BR in the amount of
US$32 million was approved in June 1980.   The Loan was closed with two
years' delay on September 1, 1987, after all the Loan funds had been
disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by UNESCO based on a draft report by the
Borrower, and supplemented by an overview provided by Regional staff.  In
addition, the authors of the PCR reviewed the relevant project documents
(Staff Appraisal Report, President's Report, Loan Agreement and project
files) and undertook a mission to Brazil in December 1988.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for comment on
August 9, 1989. No comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REUR,I
BRAZIL
NOwrHEAST BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1867-BR,
OVERVIEW
The Northeast Basic Education I (EDURIURAL) project in Brazil,
which was financed by Loan 1867-BR (approved in June 1980 for US$32
million), was completed and the Loan Account was closed on September 1,
1987, 24 months after the originally planned Closing Date.  The extension
in time was approved in order to enable works to be completed in all muni-
cipalities in the nine project states in northeastern Brazil.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) which follows was prepared by
Unesco under the Cooperative Agreement between Unesco and the World Bank.
The PCR is based on the work of Messrs. Luis Secco, architect (Unesco), and
Dino Carelli, education planner (consultant to Unesco), who reviewed proj-
ect documents, including the several completiun reports prepared by the
Brazilian government, and visited Brazil from November 30 to December 15,
1988 to collect additional data, hold discussions with Brazilian officials,
and visit project institutions.   The Unesco team gratefully acknowledged
the valuable assistance provide' by the Government, particularly Project
Implementation Unit staff, in the preparation of their report.  The draft
report prepared by Unesco was edited by staff of the Population and Human
Resources Operations Division of the 'irazil Country Department of the World
Bank (LAIPH).
With the exception noted below in this Overview and in footnotes
to the text, LA1PH agrees with the conclusions of the PCR.  As stated in
the PCR, EDURUPAL clearly contributed to improved educational opportunities
for children in rural northeast Brazil, as documented by the research
component of the prcject.  Specifically, the project resulted in expansion
of access to educational inputs (classrooms, trained teachers, textbooks,
and teaching materials adapted to the rural milieu) in rural municipalities
in the Northeast, strengthened the capacity of rural municipalities to plan
for and provide primary education,  contributed in the Northeast to a
greater awareness of the problems and possibilities in rural education, cnd
led to better collaboration among Northeast states in tackling difficult
basic education issues.   These achieveirenzs provide the foundation for
further improvements in rural education. The project helped to legitimize
a decentralized approach to the provision of primary education based on
municipFl authority and assisted by specialists and resources from the
state and national levels.   The research conducted under the project
illuminated the effects of educational inputs on learning and indicated
priorities for program changes at the municipal, state, and federal levels.
Despite these achievements, however, rural education has improved
only marginally in the Northeast.   The project represented a very small
investment when compared with the size and poverty of the region and had



- iii -
only a limited impact on such critical institutional problems as profes-
sionalizing school administration and attracting qualified teachers to
rural areas.   The project  itself had administrative  and managerial
problems- these problems wore a result of the necessary involvement ot many
layers of government (federal, state and municipal) and reflected overall
problems in the system of public education in Brazil.   Inadequate mecha-
nisms for transferring resources between governmental levels seriously
hampered project execution in the early years. The many executing institu-
tions and agencies (including special federal and state level agencies
responsible for such programs as textbooks, as well as the normal adminis-
trative organs) failed to coordinate effectively with each other, leading
to the development of textbooks and carrying out of teacher training before
school curricula were fully developed, and long delays in the actual
arrival of inputs to rural schools. Frequent turnover of project staff
further inhiMted coordination and resulted in delays in implementation.
There are several lessons to be drawn from EDURURAL with impli-
cations for the design of follow-on projects.   The transfer of resources
between government-.l levels should be streamlined and based upon the
principles of automaticity and transparency in order to minimize delays and
resulting uncertainty regarding receipt of funds as well as poor accounta-
bility at various levels.   The project design, by selecting a limited
number of the poorest municipalities for investment, with the other muni-
cipalities to receive no project inputs (but to receive funding in a
subsequent project), was never fully accepted by the Borrower, and in the
end, was not effective. In order to avoid the restrictions of this design,
state governments expanded the project into almost twice as many munici-
palities as was originally intended, in some cases reducing standards and
delaying implementation.   A future project should be less restrictive in
its targeting, and allow participation of a wider range of municipalities.
A future project should also focus more directly on issues of institutional
development (e.g. teacher charters, planning and management, teacher pay,
and the relationships between state run and municipal run school systems)
which are the long-run binding constraints to educational change.
LA1PH disagrees with the PCR's negative assessment of the research
financed under the project (as well as partially through the Bank's own
research budget). The issues raised in paragraph 2.40 are theoretical and
philosophical and are not subject to analysis leading to possible action.
The data gathered under the research project are among the richest in the
developing world and will help in understanding not only how the education-
al process works in Northeast Brazil but also in further developing theore-
tical analysis of how and why children learn. At the same time IAIPH agrees
with the PCR (paragraph 6.10) that the project-based research should have
been better balanced with process evaluation. In particular, case studies
of institutional change, as well as systematic classroom observation, could
have yielded process information that would have been invaluable to the
development of future projects in the Northeast and elsewhere.  This type
of information is as imprctant as that yielded by statistical analysis, but
is at least as difficult to gather properly and systematically.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN l867-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The goal of the Northeast Basic Education I Project (EDURURAL),
the Bank's fourth project in the education sector in Brazil, was to improve
the coverage, quality and efficiency of basic education in the nine north-
eastern states, where basic education has been particularly deficient. The
project assisted the federal, state, and selected municipal governments to
implement the first phase of a long-term national basic education devel-
opment plan aimed at correcting imbalances in educational opportunities.
The project was appraised in May and October 1979 and the Loan Agreement
(providing a Lean of US$32 million) was signed in July 1980 and became
effective in May 1981. The project has been completed and the Loan Account
was closed in September 1987 (two years later than originally planned),
with all funds disbursed.
Project Objectives and Content
As described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the project
consisted of:
(a) construction and/or remodeling, furnishing and equipping of: (i)
1,148 primary schoois (2,115 classrooms); (ii) 13 municipal educa-
tion units; and (iii) nine school meal warehouses;
(b) curriculum development and teaching/learning materials;
(c) training of teachers, supervisors and administrators;
(d) support for the school meal programs;
(e) strengthening of municipal education administration;
(f) school mapping, curriculum, materials and education impact
studies.
Implementation ExDerience
In logistical terms the project had several difficulties:   (i)
responsibilities were not clearly defined and distributed at different
management levels; (ii) there were frequent staff changes; and (iii)
project decision-makers lacked well-organized, periodically updated infor-
mation.   Because of these circumstances,  the overall complexity of the



x
project, and early difficulties in securing counterpart funds, project
implementation was delayed by about two years.
Results to Date
Despite the delay, the project successfully met or exceeded physi-
cal implementation targets reported in the SAR.  The project resulted in:
(i) provisiort of 112,000 rather than 62,000 additional student places; (ii)
construction and/or remodelling, equipping and furnishing of 4,902 rather
than 2,115 classrooms; (iii) training of 66,000 rather than 25,000 teachers
and supervisors; and (iv) delivery of 5.7 million rather than 4.8 million
teaching/learning materials packages.   The project was able to achieve
these levels because of cooperation between state and municipal govern-
ments, and because the unit costs of some items fell in dollar terms during
the project implementation period.
The project did not consistently achieve planned physical quality
standards because of lax administrative and quality controls, together with
a conscious decision on the part of municipal authorities throughout the
Northeast to reduce costs. An estimated 7 percent of the classrooms built
were of poor quality, with structural deficiencies and inadequate natural
lighting, and more than 25 percent of the furniture delivered to project
schools was of poor quality.   Most of the schools visited by the mission
did not have access to water on the premises due to hand-pump failures.
Both the physical and pedagogical quality of learning materials were lower
than expected.
The interim results of the evaluation provided important infocma-
tion -egarding the effectiveness of the various project interventions. The
evaluation found that the project contributed to:   (i) an increase in
enrollments in Ceara, compared to non-project schools; (ii) a slightly more
even distribution of students through grades 1-4 in Piaui; (iii) a slight
reduction in the average number of student-years taken to reach grade 2 in
Ceara and grade 4 in Pernambuco; and (iv) significantly higher achievement
in Portuguese and mathematics for students in grades 2 and 4 in Ceara,
Piaui, and Pernambuco.  The research also uncovered the fact that primary
school teachers in the three states performed only slightly better than
their students on standardized tests in Portuguese and elementary mathe-
matics. More definitive research results were not available at the time of
writing this PCR.
Sustainability
The project supported institution building in 400 rural municipa-
lities by:  (i) constructing, furnishing and equipping 199 new facilities
for MLtnicipal Offices of Education (OME); (ii) training 4,000 OME staff;
(iii) signing of teachers charters in all pioject municipalities; and (iv)
school mapping in all project municipalities, as well as in an additional
880 non-project municipalities.   This provided a good institutional basis
for the continuing operation of the project schools (provided that recur-
rent funding levels are adequate) and for an eventual widening of the scope
of the educational development policies embodied in this project.



- xi -
Findings
The project demonstrated the difficulties inherent in projects
that span several levels of Government (in this case, three).   In future
projects of this type, the Bank would be well advised to develop and incor-
porate procedures that would ensure a timely transfer of resources from the
national to the subsidiary levels.
Future projects should be less restrictive in their criteria for
selecting beneficiary municipalities, in order to avoid time-consuming
arguments over the relative merits of candidate towns whose educational
needs may differ only marginally.
The key role of municipal education authorities in allocating
resources and implementing reform measures should be recognized by creating
such units for all municipalities, and by strengthening the existing ones.
By the same token, school mapping should be extended to cover the entire
Northeast.
In view of the low salaries of rural teachers in the region and of
the difficulties of attracting and retaining good teaching staff, thought
should be given of how performance based incentives could be built into the
salary structure.
In future project-related studies programs, a stronger emphasis
ought to be placed on regular monitoring and evaluation compared to more
basic educational research.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NORTHEAST BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1867-BR)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Economic Settina
1.01     The Northeast  Basic  Education I Project,  Loan No.  1867-BR
(EDURURAL), was implemented during a period in which Brazil's economic
development was adjusting to a slow-down of international economic growth,
and' the sozio-economic, regional and sectoral imbalance that had emerged
during the preceding decade. The basic objectives of the government which
came to power in March 1979 were: (a) to continue to develop the country's
vast national resources and its industrial capabilities, with emphasis on
the agricultural sector; and b) to spread the benefits of growth more
widely among the country's population, mainly by providing basic services
to a larger share of the population in all geographical regions.
1.02     During the early 1980s, the population of Brazil grew at an annual
rate of 2.2 percent. More than 40 percent of the population was less than
14 years old. The economically active population was expanding at the rate
of 3 percent per year, and, on the whole, the labor force was very poorly
educated--36 percent were illiterate and 23 percent had completed less than
three years of schooling.   There were substantial migratory flows, both
within and between regions of Brazil, and the country was rapidly urbaniz-
ing, with over 60 percent of the population living in urban areas.
Overviev of the Education System
1.03     The Brazilian education system consists of:  (a) eight years of
primary education subdivided unofficially into two cycles (grades 1-4 and
5-8), with most pupils, particularly in rural areas, concentrated in the
first two grades; (b) three years of secondary education (grades 9-11),
leading to university and/or professional training; (c) higher education of
varying duration; and (d) post-graduate education.   In the Northeastern
states, administrative responsibility for education is distributed among
municipal, state, and federal authorities, as well as to private institu-
tions.   Lunicipalities take primary responsibility for rural primary
education--constructing schools, recruiting teachers, and covering recur-
rent costs.   States are the main providers of primary education in urban
areas, as well as of secondary and non-university higher education. States
also provide some financial, technical and supervisory assistance to the
municipalities.   Federal authorities are responsible for overall policy-
making and planning, and for supplementing the financial resources of the
states and municipalities. The federal government, through the Ministry of
Education and Culture (now Ministry of Education) (MEC), also provides
assistance to the states and municipalities through MEC's regional offices



-2
and through several national specialized agencies--for curriculum deve-
lopment, production and distribution of textbooks and teaching aids, in-
service teacher training, school construction, and school meal
distribution,
1.04     Enrollment growth at all levels was very high nationwide during
the mid-1970s.   Primary education enrollments expanded 3-4 percent
annually; secondary education, 14-15 percent; and higher education, 22-23
percent.   Major problems in primary education still persist:   high
repetition and drop-out rates in grades one and two, and consequently,
heavy enrollment of over-aged pupils in primary education.
Educational Features of the Northeastern States (Annexes 1, 2, 3)
1.05     Rural basic education in the nine northeastern states in the early
1980s had low coverage and was inefficient and of poor quality.   Primary
education in rural areas was mostly confined to the first four grades; and,
in many schools, to grades 1 and 2. Total primary school enrollment in the
Northeast was equivalent to only 77 per cent of the 7-14 age group, and,
because many of these students were over-aged, the primary education system
was serving only 50 per cent of all children between the ages of 7 and 14.
Reflecting the high repetition rates of first grade students in the mid-
1970s, there were four times as many students in rural areas enrolled irn
first grade as there were in second grade. Of 100 students in grade one in
rural schools in the Northeast in 1974, 63 dropped out during the school
year, 18 failed at the end of the year, and only 19 were promoted to second
grade. The content of the instruction provided in rural schools, and the
teaching methods and materials used, did not contribute to the growth and
development of rural students, since they were generally irrelevant to the
environment of these students and their parents.
1.06     The reasons for the above failings were mainly institutional.
Rural mayors and other municipal-level office holders exercised effective
control over appointing staff and teachers in the municipal school systems
serving rural areas, and they distributed jobs to reward their supporters
rather than to build an effective educational service.   There was no
specialized unit of qualified staff with management authority over the
municipal schools, no formal procedures for decision-making on the location
and construction of schools, and no contracts or proper conditions of
service for teachers.  Educational resources were allocated arbitrarily at
the discretion of political leaders, and there were no clear norms or
practices governing the relationship between the municipalities and the
state secretaries for education (SEC) or the federal MEC.   Finally,  the
education system had to operate in the context of severe resource con-
straints; the Northeast did not have sufficient resources to attend to
infrastructure for housing, water supply, health and sanitation, education,
and roads.
The EDURURAL Project (Annexes 4, 5)
1.07     Loan No.1867-BR for rural basic education was intended to support
the Federal Government and the nine northeastern states (Alagoas, Bahia,
Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte and



- 3 -
Sergipe) in the implementation of a long-term program to correct the defi-
ciencies discussed above.  The proposed project was to provide the frame-
work for future work in improving education in the Northeast. The project
was to focus its resources on selected municipalities (originally 248,
later increased to 400 with Bank agreement) where problems were most acute
in order to solve them and develop experience, criteria, procedures,
materials and practices that would allow the process to be extended to all
the rural municipalities of the nine northeastern states.
1.08     The objectives of the projec'  were to:   (a) improve access to
municipal basic education in rural area;., through provision of additional
school facilities; (b) improve efficiency of rural municipal schools, by
improving existing school facilities, adjusting the school calendar, and
strengthening the school meal program; (c) improve pupil performance, by
revising the school curriculum, training teachers and school administra-
tors, providing teaching materials, strengthening school supervision,
increasing class time, and improving the conditions of service for rural
teachers; and (d) to improve institutional capacity to provide education,
by creating project management units at the state and federal levels,
strengthening municipal education administration, developing monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms, and providing technical assistance services.
1.09     The content of the project as originally planned and amended in
the course of its execution by component, by state, and by municipality
appears in Annex 5.
1.10     The loan agreement required that a number of agreements be con-
cluded between states and municipalities with a view to strengthening
institutional capacity at the municipal level: (a) each project municipa-
lity wovld establish and adequately staff a municipal education unit (OME)
comprised of at least three staff members, (i.e., one coordinator/educator/
planner in charge of planning, one to three supervisors, and, where justi-
fied, one administrator); (b) the mayor of each project municipality would,
within three years of the signing of the Loan Agreement, submit a Teachers'
Charter to his legislative body for approval; (c) unqualified teachers
already in service would be given preference in selection for training
under the project;  (d) after successfully completing training,  teachers
would be guaranteed employment for at least two years, and would be given
priority for the benefits and privileges included in the teachers' charter;
(e) project schools would be staffed with unqualified teachers who have
completed at least grade 4, have already been trained or are currently
undergoing training, are being trained for implementation of the new curri-
cula, and have agreed to teach a minimum of four periods per shift per day
during the academic year; (f) recruits for supervisors' courses would have
completed at least secondary education and have teacher supervision experi-
ence; (g) regarding the physical components of the project, the municipali-
ties would secure deeds to the land for the proposed school, guarantee the
use of project resources as planned, and maintain, repair and renew build-
ings, furniture and equipment provided under the project; and (h) municipa-
lities would keep records of all OME expenditures and resources used in the
implementation of the project.   The Borrower's compliance with the cove-
nants of the Loan Agreement is described in Annex 16.



-4-
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
(Annexes 5 and 6)
2.01     Several factors make analysis of project implementation difficult.
There were several programs funded separately by the Brazilian government,
for training and providing textbooks, teaching guides, and learning mater-
ials, and being conducted in the project schools parallel to the project.
Data problems abound:   data recorded in each municipality are unclear;
monitoring procedures and records of the state project management units
(SPMU) and the national specialized agencies are inadequate; and project
data (except for financial data) were dispatched irregularly to the
national project management unit (FMU). Staff changes at the municipal and
state levels led to temporary unfamiliarity with the project and lack of
motivation for project execution, and changes in the structure of the
Ministry of Education (MEC) and the state secretariats for education
resulted in relocation of the PMU, the SPMU, and the national specialized
agencies within the new structures.   Finally, interviews of participants
were difficult due to the rapid transfers of staff following project com-
pletion in 1987.
ProLect Administration
2.02     The administration of the project was confronted with a three-fold
challenge:   (a) coordination of three levels uf autonomous responsibility
(federal, state and municipal), each with different administrative struc-
tures, departmental jurisdictions, funds, and procedures for executing
project elements and communicating with the Bank and with each other; (b)
involvement of a great many specialized bodies operating independently of
each other (at the national level: MEC, Ministry of Finance, specialized
agencies, and the PMU; at the state level:  nine SECs, nine state se    I -
riats for finance and nine SPMUs; at the municipal level:  400 mur           1
mayors and OMEs; and (c) the particular political and economic charact   s-
tics of Brazil in the 1980s, including the transition to a constitutional
civilian government,  and persistent high inflation rates.   Furthermore,
institutional arrangements were hampered by cumbersome procedures for
transferring funds to direct executing agencies.
2.03     The appraisal mission recognized the above-average administration
risks of the project, and selected what it believed to be an appropriate
preparation and implementation strategy:   (a) the detailed preparation of
working papers by the states; (b) the securing of agreements (convenios)
between various levels of government; (c) the strengthening of institutions
at all three levels; and (d) the emphasis on active participation of appro-
priate federal and state organs during discussion of project objectives,
working procedures  and preconditions.   It was appropriate  to place
responsibility for management and the provision of technical assistance
within the existing MEC structure and with the autonomous specialized agen-
cies at the national level, and within the education secretariats at the
state and municipal levels. Because project management was so tightly tied

to these government agencies, however, the structural changes and staff
turnover in these agencies had a negative effect on project implementation.
Physical Facilities
2.04     School construction.   Early in 1978,  the states of Paraiba,
Sergipe, Ceara, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte prepared five sets of
architectural briefs and design standards for the project.   The project
provided funding for an experimental program in Bahia to develop and test
soil-cement technology for constructing school buildings.   Because the
experimental program in Bahia did not yield replicable positive results, it
was agreed that project schools would be built following a more traditional
technology, based on concrete columns supporting wood scissors trusses,
ceramic tile roofing, and concrete floors.
2.05     The project design was based on the construction of prototype
schools with two classrooms.  Because of the dispersion of the rural popu-
lation, however, these plans were changed, and about half of the schools
were built with only one classroom.  Plans for building seven five-class-
room schools to serve students in grades 1-8 in Pernambuco were expanded to
eight of the nine project states; a total of b4 schools (370 classrooms)
were built following this model (see Annex 6).
2.06     Although classroom designs were based on attendance of 35 children
per class, a survey of about 300 schools conducted between 1984 and 1987 by
the Center of Development and Technical Support to Education (CEDATE) found
average class sizes to be substantially higher in Rio Grande do Norte (48
students) and Maranhao (40) than in the rest of the Northeast (27).  The
larger class sizes in these two states appears to be the result of having
located project schools close to more heavily populated urban areas, where
there is a high demand for student places.
2.07     The quality of construction was lower than expected.  CEDATE found
that only 70 percent of the schools constructed w re of acceptable quality;
23 percent were of fair quality; and 7 percent, poor.   In an effort to
stretch project funds as far as possible, municipal authorities in all
states attempted to shift a large portion of construction costs onto the
beneficiary communities. In the poorest communities, this strategy trans-
lated into a substantial reduction in construction quality (e.g., using
under-dimensioned trusses, which caused the classroom roof to sag).
2.08     Maintenance.   School buildings suffered from inadequate mainte-
nance.  Despite the interest of the Government and the Bank in seeking a
practical solution to ensure implementation of a reasonable maintenance
system based on community participation, communities were generally unable
to undertake even minor maintenance tasks and repairs because of a lack of
resources.   An illustration of the problem is the fact that the mission
found inoperative handpumps in all of the schools it visited.
2.09     Furniture and equipment.   The project provided almost twice as
many student places as was estimated at appraisal (172,000 places rather
than 78,000).   The project equipped about 3,100 canteens rather tnan the



-6
- 6 -
1,160 eszimated at appraisal.  Although CEDATE carefully prepared lists and
documents for the acquisition and distribution of furniture and equipment,
a CEDATE study reported that only 70 percent of the furniture and 75 per-
cent of the equipment was of acceptable quality.
Curriculum Development
2.10     The project design; called for the development of curricula for
rural basic education (originally for grades 1-8, but in fact only achieved
for grades 1-4) early in the project.   Textbooks and teachers' guides,
training programs for teachers, supervisors, and administrators, and the
design of the impact evaluation would then be prepared to support and
reflect the new curricula.   Specific activities to be implemented under
this component were:   (a) design of curriculum and development of syllabi
in each project state for grades 1-4, assisted by the Coordinating Unit for
Primary Education Curricula (COEPE); (b) preparation of textbooks and
teaching guides in each project state, with assistance from the National
Foundation for School Materials (FENAME, later FAE); (c) printing, purchase
and distribution of 5,070,000 textbooks and teachers' guides to schools in
proyct municipalities, with the assistance of FENAME;  (d) purchase and
distribution of 4,071,000 learning materials packages, with the assistance
of FENAME; (e) assistance with the use of new curricula/textbooks/guides
and subsequent monitoring activities; (f) preparation of annual reports on
student flow and achievement under the new curriculum.
2.11     MEC's assistance to the states for curriculum work through COEPE
and 4he Secretariat of Primary and Secondary Education (SEPS) was delayed
by about one year due to difficulties in transferring resources between
levels of government.  It was later interrupted in 1983 due to changes in
the structure of MEC, and assistanr-e was finally provided through the
Coordinating Unit for Technical Resources (CRT) under the Secretariat for
Tasic Education (SEB).
2.12     Curriculum design was conceived as  a phase  in the ongoing
cuoperative process initiated in Brazil as early as 1976, and aimed at
adapting basic education to rural conditions in terms of content and
methods, structure end duration of the school year, composition and flexi-
bility of timetables, and student distribution by grade. As a consequence
of MEC's belated and interrupted assistance, the nine participating states
did not design curriculum for rural schools in a coordinated fashion, and
the resulting state curricula differed in content and form.  These varia-
tions reflect the technical preferences and competence of experts available
in each state,  and can be found in the:   (a) level of detail of the
instructional content (list of topics by areas and/or by grade versus
packages covering several areas for more than one grade); (b) mixing o.
common core content and specific local content; (c) specification of
general and/or instructional objectives; and (d) practical suggestions such
as teaching activities, items for evaluation, alternative school calendar,
Otc.
2.13     Delays in MEC assistance prevented the on-time completion of
curriculum work that was to have formed the basis for textbook production



-7-
and teacher training. As a result, states carried out teacher training and
textbook development independent of the curriculum work, and relied on
available evidence as to the desired content of rural textboolts and guides,
and appropriate in-service teaching for teachers in rural schools.   The
delays also shortened the amount of time available between curriculum work
and textbook development (content/definition/presentation/editing) reducing
the scope for community and teacher participation.
2.14     The SECs made considerable progress in tackling basic issues such
as lefining a specific curriculum which was appropriate for rural areas,
defi.aing the role of the rural teacher (especially the unqualified teacher)
in zural schools, and uncovering and emphasizing the importance of text-
books and guides adapted to rural conditions. The annual technical meet-
ings on curriculum development for rural schools enabled specialists from
all nine states to share experiences and exchange proposals and questions,
and contributed to the formulation of realistic practical proposals for
adapting textbooks and guides to rural conditions.
Preparation. Printing. Acguisition and Distribution of Textbooks/Guides
(Annexes 9 and 10)
2.15     The productichn and distribution of textbooks and teachers' guides
were to be undertaken by the states, with the assistance of FAE. The proj-
ect design called for the production and distribution of textbooks for
grades 1-8, but because of considerable delays, the project eventually
restricted textbook development to grades 1-4. Although the project design
called for the testing of all materials and their utilization in teacher
training courses, the materials were only partially tested and were used
only in in-service training courses. In preparing textbooks, each state's
SEC was to follow specific rules for content, methodology, and vocabulary.
In Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco, however, textbook production was the
result of an earlier self-financed program, and the states were not able to
agree on a uniform standard.   In addition, some states grouped grades,
subject areas, and teaching/learning activities into a single volume.
Paraiba produced four volumes, while Bahia and Ceara produced 12-13 each.
There are also differences in textbook design across states since (with the
exception of Volume 3 in Rio Grande do Norte) FAE did not provide assis-
tance to the states as planned, although FAE made a generally acknowledged
contribution to textbook purchasing and distribution. There were frequent
delays when materials were not distributed to aach municipality. Finally,
FAE's approved list of textbooks and guides did not include EDURURAL
mater'als because they were of inferior physical quality; these materials
were therefore excluded from FAE financing.
2.16     While states were supposed to test the prototype textbooks and
teachers' guides for a full academi'c year, most states carried out this
testing only informally, without applying the proper procedures and ensur-
ing the accountability usually required for quality evaluation.  Further-
more, only a few states carried out the appropriate in-service teacher
training prior to the testing and implementation of the modified curriculum
and the new printed materials. Few states had the institutional procedures
in place to benefit from the pre-testing of textbooks and to ensure conti-
nuity in the successi-e phases leading up to production:   definition of



criteria for design, drafting, revision, updating and expansion.   In the
future it may be appropriate to consider combining the efforts of various
states as well as getting more assistance from commercial textbooks
publishers.
Distribution of Learnins Materials (Annexes 9 and 10)
2.17     The distribution of learning materials is a national, centrally
financed programme executed by FENAME and continued under FAE following the
restructuring of MEC in 1985/36.  The financial resources of the EDURURAL
project made it possible to provide classroom materials for all municipal
project schools even though federal restrictions imposed in 1986 limited
the size of such packages for other schools.   However without clearly
defined standards for the content of the project's three packages of educa-
tional materials, the physical quality of the learning materials was inade-
quate. In addition, arrangements for distribution of the packages did not
always coincide with the school year.
2.18     The PMU's records report a much higher number of packages of
learning materials and of textbooks and guides delivered under the project
than FAE's records. On the one hand, the SPMUs' record-keeping systems are
inadequate and, early In the project, the FAE distributed materials direct-
ly to the OMEs. These two factors led to an undercount of about 9 percent
in the SPMUs. On the other hand, about 22 percent of the 6.1 million text-
books and guides recorded by the SPMUs came from non-FAE sources, and FAE
did not include these materials on its list because of their low durability
and poor timing of product availability.  In addition, the states did not
complete the textbooks and guides for grades 3 and 4 in time for their
inclusion on FAE's list during the project.  Consequently, teachers could
not always order project materials from FAE, but l.ad to order them through
their SPMU.   The absence of clearly defined quantitative and qualitative
norms for production of teaching materials led inevitably to the production
and distribution of physically and pedagogically inferior packages in order
to serve a larger number of schools and students.   As a result of an
increase in 1986 of the number of municipalities included in the project,
the number of students served rose from 156,000 to 258,000.
2.19     The project sponsored three  types of materials distribution
schemes (directly by the FAE, the SECs, or the OMEs).  Because of changes
in state educational administration in all states, however, no scheme was
adequately tested for a sufficient length of time. There is a need during
preparation of any future project to review these alternative schemes
carefully.
2.20     Expenditures for textbooks and guides and for learning materials
were considerably lower than those estimated at appraisal because:  (a) the
costs were partially borne by other programs, e.g., PRONASEC; (b) textbooks
costs fell by 30 percent when designed to serve two or more grades in a
single volume; (c) the low quality of the materials, delivery of fewer
notebooks than planned, and FAE's late delivery reduced the unit cost by 40
percent; and (d) the delay in distributing the materials to the schools led
to a build-up of stocks from one year to the next (reducing student
coverage).



- 9 -
2.21     The project provided funding for about 860 person-months for local
consultancies and technical services for curriculum design and development,
and the preparation of syllabi, and 240 person-months for preparing text-
books and guides. The states used these resources to: (a) hire temporary
staff to enlarge a SEC unit or to make a specific contribution to regional
meetings on matters relating to rural education curricula and textbooks;
(b) gather information from rural communities and teachers for rural curri-
culum development; and (c) provide assistance for textbook editing, etc.
2.22     It is difficult to determine precisely the actual number of
person-months used for both types of technical assistance because of the
absence of clear accounting procedures at each SPMU and the fact that
states reported technical assistance expenses by function or actions
performed rather than by person-months.   Estimating person-months on the
basis of expenditures is difficult because the funding arrangements for
these services were quite flexible, and because the exchange rate during
much of the implementation period was extremely variable.
In-service Training of Teachers. Administrators. Supervisors and SupRorting
Staff (Annex 11)
2.23     Each SEC conducted a training program with assistance from the
Institute for Human Resources Joao Pinheiro (IRHJP).  In order to serve a
larger number of trainees than originally estimated, the SECs needed to
adopt flexible criteria and procedures enabling them to make rapid deci-
sions (particularly in 1985 and in 1987) regarding areas of training, num-
ber of trainees, and training methodology.  The project design called for
training for the following rural basic education teachers: (a) unqualified
("lay") teachers who had not completed primary school--in most cases these
teachers have less than a fourth grade education (51 percent); (b) unquali-
fied ("lay') teachers who had completed primary school (7 percent of
trainees); and (c) qualified teachers (42 percent).  This planned mixture
of teachers was not achieved in the actual. training programs--only 17 per-
cent of the teachers trained had not completed basic education, 4 percent
were "lay" teachers that had completed primary education, and 79 percent
were qualified teachers who enrolled in supplementary and upgrading
courses.  Although the overall number of participating teachers was about
twice that anticipated, the absolute number of unqualified teachers with
incomplete basic education who participated was about 20 percent lower than
planned in all six states that had planned such courses.   This trainee
profile is in marked contrast to MEC's 1986 official statistics showing
that in the nine northeastern states the percentage of unqualified teachers
teaching in rural municipal schools ranged from 65 percent in Alagoas,
Bahia, Pernambuco, Rio Grand do Norte, and Sergipe to 75 percent in Piaui,
80 percent in Maranhao and close to 90 percent in Ceara. The lower number
of unqualified teachers trained was due to a high rate of drop-out stemming
from the apparently excessive length of the course, the inappropriateness
of the methodologies used, and the competition with a multitude of other
training programs targeting this group of teachers (including Logos II and
Hapront, both distance programs outside IRHJP's control, and "Pedagogico
parcelado" coordinated by neighboring northeastern states).



- 10
2.24     The supplementary and upgrading courses for qualified teachers
were the main channel for familiarizing teachers with innovations in the
curriculum, the use of new teaching materials, textbooks and guides, and
new evaluation methods.
2.25     From discussions with project parUlcipants and review of project
documents, the mission learned of the following criticisms of this project
component:   (a) liaison with the agencies and specialists responsible for
related project components (curriculum, textbooks and teaching guides) was
difficult and inadequate; (b) the global theoretical design of a common
frameuork for the content of the several types of in-service courses for
teachers and educational staff provided by the SECs was inadequate; and (c)
course content, length, and teaching methods were inappropriate to the
working conditions of municipal rural basic education teachers (partic-
ularly unqualf  ed teachers).   The IRHJP noted in its evaluation of the
program that the professional trainers did not adequately identify and meet
the needs of "lay" teachers due to confusion over the specific characteris-
tics of these teachers.
2.26     In addition to providing assistance for course planning and prepa-
ration, technical assistance to the SECs under the training program sup-
ported four regional meetings for SPMU staff on training of rural education
teachers, aimed at clarifying specific issues and seeking solutions through
professional exchanges between the nine SPMUs involved in the project. In
addition, the project supported activities relating to evaluation of the
programs implemented, the theoretical review and clarification of their
content, coverage and purpose, as well as the methodology and other condi-
tions and inputs essential for their execution.
2.27     The IRHJP procedure of assigning a permanernt group of its staff to
provide technical support to EDURURAL proved professionally rewarding for
the project staff and helped to provide continuity in the face of high
turnover of personnel in the SECs.
2.28     Expenditures for the training program were lower than estimated at
appraisal because of the following factors: (a) per diem for trainees was
approximately one third of the expected level and far lower than actual
training expenses;  (b) instructor fees were low, frequently half of the
appraisal estimate; (c) course duration was reduced, in some states by as
much as 25 percent; (d) there were fewer applicants than foreseen, owing to
drop-outs;  (e) simpler and cheaper methods were used; (f) classes merged
groups of trainees, e.g. teachers and supervisors.   The cumulative effect
of these savings was a reduction of between 25 and 40 percent of the costs
below appraisal estimates.
School Meal Program
2.29     All EDURURAL schools received school meals under the National
School Meal Program, which did not receive project funds, and was adminis-
tered and executed by FAE.   The project did, however, successfully con-
tribute to improving the system of food distribution by:   (a) providing
facilities and equipment for meal storage and preparation in all project



- 11 l-
schools; (b) contributing, in Piaui, to the construction of nine sub-
regional warehouses and supplying six vehicles for meal distribution, as an
experimental alternative to the FAE's practice of periodic direct distribu-
tion to schools; and (c) contributing, in Pernambuco, to a four-year pilot
program to test three alternative food purchasing arrangements (direct from
local farmers, through regicnal cooperatives, and from larger commercial
firms) combined with direct distribution by the SEC to 50 percent of
EDURTRAL schools, and training of 35 general staff members responsible for
the meal program in as many schools.   The experiment,  conducted in 30
schools in nine project municipalities (three schools for each of the three
alternatives), concluded that no alternative held a clear advantage nver
the others.
Establishment or Strenzthening of OMEs
2.30     EDURURAL provided assistance to 400 rural municipalities to help
them to improve their education systems, which provide the majority of
basic education services (over 65 per cent of schools, students, and
teachers) available in the rural areas of the nine n)rtbeastern states.
With the exception of one extremely large municipality (Imperatriz in
Maranhao), each municipal rural basic education system served less than
12,000 students, employed less than 560 teachers, and operated under 490
classrooms. All of the project components were instrumental in improving
the municipal education systems and contributed to the strengthening of
their corresponding OME.   Specific assistance to the OMEs consisted of:
(a) construction of buildings, and provision of equipment and transport for
the OMEs; (b) training of OME coordinators, technical, and general staff;
(c) development and implementation of administrative procedures, planning
techniques, and Teachers' Charters; (d) participation of OME staff in plan-
ning teacher training (particularly for unqualified teachers) conducted by
the state; (e) provision of trained supervisors and vehicles to facilitate
school supervision; and (f) mapping of school districts to strengthen
school location planning. In addition, the state provided the municipali-
ties with curricula, textbooks, and guides that had been adapted to suit
the needs of rural schools, and which could be distributed to the rural
schools without cost to the municipalities.
2.31     The original design of the project was overly restrictive in
identifying actions for strengthening municipal education systems. Project
activity in this area was initially confined to:  (a) the training of an
average of three staEf members per OME; (b) the equipping of the offices of
400 OMEs; (c) the construction, furnishing, and equipping of new physical
facilities for 13 OMEs in Alagoas; and (d) the offering of fellowships to
OME staff members. Eventually, the project provided training for 4,000 OME
staff members (rather than 750 as originally planned), and built new
facilities for 199 OMEs in eight of the nine states.  Actual expenditures
on this component were about twice expenditures planned at appraisal. This
reallocation of project expenditures illustrates the gradual realization of
the key role played by the municipal administration in improving rural
education. However, stretching support for new facilities to more OMEs led
to a reduction of between 10-20 percent in expenditures for equipment, in
the salary component, and in the remaining support for operational costs.



- 12 -
2.32     Municipal corpliance with the agreements reached with the states
as a condition of inclusion in the project varied greatly.   It was not
until 1988 that oLU project municipalities finally adopted Teachers'
Charters.   Although specific data are not available, anecdotal evidence
indicates that some municipal authorities appointed OME directors who
lacked the required professional qualifications, and recruited unqualified
teachers recruited to work in project schools who had not undergone the
required training and had not reached r minimum grade 4 level of education.
Finally, it was reported to the mission that in a few municipalities the
physical facilities (including water, electricity, handpumps, etc.) in
several school buildings financed by the project are not yet complete, and
the municipalities are not repairing and maintaining the facilities as
required.
Studies and Evaluation
2.33     The appraisal mission estimated the cost of studies and the impact
-         evaluation at US$ 0.8 million.   Because of substantial alterations and
expansion of the impact evaluation, and the expansion of school mapping to
include the state of Bahia and a total of 400 municipalities rather than
the initial 250, the actual cost of these activities was almost five times
the appraisal estimate (US$ 3.85 million).
2.34     Under the original project design, the SECs of three states were
to carry out several studies.  Pernambuco conducted three studies on the
effectiveness of the in-service teacher training program, the feasibility
of preparing low-cost teaching materials with local participation, and the
cost efficiency of alternative food purchasing arrangements for the school
meal program (para. 2.24).   Ceara originally planned a joint study with
Pernambuco on the adequacy of the new rural basic education curricula.
This study ended up as two independent studies in Ceara on the efficiency
of rural supervision under municipal and state supervision schemes, and on
the multi-grade one-teacher schools.   Alagoas conducted a study on the
effect of over-aged students on learning effectiveness. With the expansion
of the impact evaluation, some of the above studies were changed and
carried out, while others were implemented with some delay because of an
irregular flow of resources, insufficient interest on the part of the
responsible SEC staff, and limited staff time and professional competence.
2.35     The school mapping exercise, originally conceived as a planning
act..vity to be performed by the OMEs with assistance from the SECs, was to
include the collection of data, diagnosis of educational and physical faci-
lities needs, and recommendations for meeting these needs.  Overall, the
exercise was quite successful. It covered 30 percent of all municipalities
in the nine project states and was the first school mapping and planning
exercise ever conducted in any of them, and it led to the joint development
by all nine SECs of a valuable, functional and manageable school planning
instrument adapted to the rural conditions of the Northeast.   About 880
other municipalities are currently using this school planning instrument.

ImRact Evaluation
2.36     The project's most expensive study (equivalent to 1.4 percent of
the total project costs), and the most ambitious study ever undertaken
under a Bank education loan, was the impact evaluation of the project,
which was conducted by the Federal University of Ceara (UFC) and its re-
search foundation (FCPC) in cooperation with the SECs of Ceara, Pernambuco
and Piaui.   The Carlos Chagas Foundation (FCC), the Bank, and the State
University of New York at Albany provided substantial technical assistance
to the UFC.   The SAR described the impact evaluation as one study which
would be part of a three-pronged (monitoring, evaluation and supervision)
implementation process.   Early in project implementation, however,  the
researchers adopted a survey research methodology with standardized
achievement testing and other data collection to occur in three project
states in 1981, 1983, and 1985. In each round, data were to be collected
from about 6,000 students and their families, and 1,000 teachers, from 600
rural schools in 70 municipalities.  Supplementary funds (US$ 307,000) were
provided from the Bank's own research budget.
2.37     The aim of the evaluation was to assess the impact of the project
components on access to basic education (at the municipal level), on the
internal efficiency of rural grades 1-4 (at school level), and on the
students' achievement in Portuguese and mathematics in grades 2 and 4 (at
the individual level). The evaluation was also intended to build capacity
within the University of Ceara for employing such evaluation techniques,
and to increase the Bank's understanding of rural primary education in
northeastern Brazil.
2.38     The UFC researchers prepared and pre-tested four sets of instru-
ments (questionnaires for schools, teachers, students, and families). The
Carlos Chagas Foundation prepared the student achievement tests. Specially
trained field workers of the three SECs involved, as well as some 1,000
teachers in the 600 rural schools, and 200 additional secondary school
graduates and university students conducted the interviews and administered
the tests.
2.39     Three unexpected problems cropped up during data collection:  (a)
there was a significant delay (about 15 months) in the implementation of
several project components (curriculum and textbook development, and in-
service teacher training); only 35 percent of the implementation targets
had been met by October 1983 and barely 70 percent by October 1985; (b)
there was a considerable reduction in the value of nin-EDURURAL schools as
a control group, since other municipalities were implementing similar pro-
grams with other sources of funding; and (c) because the theoretical con-
cepts underlying the development of curricula and textbooks, and teacher
training were not elaborated jointly, and because there were delays in
developing the curricula, the resulting materials and training were often
contradictory.



- 14 -
2.40     Interim results of the impact evaluation were available and are
described in para. 4.02.  Final results were not available at the time of
this writing.Y The conclusions of the impact evaluation should be tempered
by several qualifications.   In the first place there are methodological
problems in using multivariate analysis as an instrument for arriving at
conclusions regarding the impact of individual project components on the
variations in enrollment, school efficiency and students' performance.
Many of the benefits of the project (e.g., attitude change, institutional
development, etc.) are difficult to measure.   There are also a number of
fundamental questions which are not addressed in the research (but which
are difficult to answer in any circumstances). For example, is repetition
a financial and management problem or is it a legitimate educational alter-
native for slow learners? Are the unqualified Brazilian teachers mainly a
negative factor for the rural municipal school or are they a valid alterna-
tive for the provision of schooling in rural areas?  Does adaptation of
curricula for grades 1-4 to rural areas require developing different basic
cognitive contents, skills, and values from those taught in urban schools
or merely a different strategy, sequence, and time-span for inculcating
them in students less used to these means of progress than urban children?
Is basic education in itself beneficial to rural children or only when
associated with comprehensive, integrated rural development programs?
/  [The Unesco team completed its main work before the results of this
research,  which will eventually be published in book form, were
available.   The most important conclusions now available are the
following: (a) the survivability of rural schools varies directly with
the level of investments they receive; (b) student learaing as measured
by achievement tests is an important determinant of promotion; (c)
teacher command of subject matter, availability of teaching materials
and textbooks, and investments in school facilities and furnishings
positively affect student achievement; (d) teacher education,
experience, or salaries are poor proxies for teachers' knowledge of
subject matter; (e) investments in teaching materials and textbooks
offer significantly higher returns than investments in facilities and
furniture; (f) small class sizes, in-service teacher training, and the
use of standard graded classrooms do not improve student performance;
and (g) the EDURURAL schools and students did not perform significantly
better than other schools and students, probably because other inputs
were being provided to these schools under separately funded programs.
The conclusions with regard to research methodology for education
programs are the following: (a) cross-sectional studies of educational
performance may yield very misleading results; (b) longitudinal "value-
added" research, using "panel" data (e.g., tracing students over a
period of time) is the preferred methodology; and (c) evaluation of
specific programs should be built around theoretical constructs of the
educational production process.   With funding from the Bank's own
research budget, the ongoing research program will examine, over the
next six months, issues related to: (a) measurement errors in the
achievement tests; (b) the effect of peers and school organization on
students' educational performance; and (c) improved estimates of
student flows and determinants of school variables on student flows. A
book manuscript on the research will be completed by the end of 1989.

3.02     Although the total project cost was only  '.5 percent below the
original estimate, there was considerable variation among components. The
costs of the studies and evaluation, strengthening the OMEs and project
administration, were significantly above the appraisal estimate, while the
costs of civil works remained virtually unchanged.   For the remaining
components, actual costs were about 25 percent lower than the appraisal
estimate.
3.03     In general, the works largely surpassed SAR quantitative targets
since unit costs were substantially lower than originally estimated.  The
table below shows the comparison of actual and estimated civil works unit
costs.

3.04     In the case of civil works, the main reasons for the difference in
unit costs were:   (a) the reduction of the quality of the buildings (70
percent of acceptable quality, 24 percent of fair quality, and 6 percent of
poor quality); (b) the high participation of the municipalities during the
construction process, providing transportation facilities, local materials
and labor; (c) the decreased value of the dollar in the international
market since 1985, which affected the last half of the project implementa-
tion period; and (d) the small price increase in US dollar terms, which,
despite the delay of project implementation, increased costs by only 7.9
percent rather than by the 25.3 percent price contingency ustimated in the
SAR (Annex 15).  The result was that project implementation largely sur-
passed the physical targets estimated at appraisal (see below and Annex 6),
though at some cost to quality.

Financing and Disbursements of Loan Proceeds
3.06     The World Bank loan of US$ 32.0 million represented 35 percent of
the total cost of the Project estimated at appraisal.   The loan was com-
pletely disbursed and was equivalent to about 36 percent of the actual
total cost. Table 3.4 below summarizes allocation of financing:

3.07     The project was very complex, and, due to early implementation
problems only 26 percent of the loan had been disbursed three years after
the date of project effectiveness.   Starting in March 1986, the pace of
implementation increased, meeting the pace projected in the SAR (see
Annexes 12 and 13).  In addition, starting in March 1986 the disbursement
percentage of all project components was increased from 35 percent to 50
percent.   Because of the extension of the project as well as higher than
anticipated costs, disbursements for administrative costs were more than
twice as high as originally estimated.

IV.  PROJECT RESuLTS AND IMPACT EVALUATION
4.01     In its discussions with the various groups related to EDURITRAL,
the mission encountered widely different assessments of the project.   On
the whole, however, those directly involved in the project, at the school,
municipal and state levels, hold a positive view of the project.   The
specialized agencies, such as CRT, FAE, liHJP and CEDATE, have been criti-
cal of the weaknesses in project implementation, though generally positive
regarding institutional results.
4.02     TRhe impact evaluation carried out by the Federal University of
Ceara (UFC) concentrated on improvements observed in the municipal schools
(coverage, efficiency, student achievement) in three different years (1981,
1983, and 1985). According to the 1985 UFC report, EDURUJRAL schools exhi-
bited the following characteristics: (a) a significant increase in enroll-
ment in Ceara, compared to enrollments in non-EDURURAL schools; (b) a
sliglhtly more even distribution of students through grades 1-4 in Piaui,
compared to the distribut5on in non-EDURURAL schools; (c) a slight reduc-
tion in the average number of student-years taken to reach grade 2 Ln Ceara
and grade 4 in Pernambuco;  and (d) significantly higher achievement in
Portuguese and mathematics  for students in grades 2 and 4 in Ceara,
Pernambuco, and Piaui.   In addition,  the study found rhat teachers in
EDURURAL schools performed only slightly better than their students on
standardized Portuguese and mathematics tests.
4.03     The project's efforts to strengthen municipal capacity to run
rural basic education schools show the following results:
(a) all 400 project municipalities, and many non-project municipali-
ties, have formally created rural municipal education offices;
(b) all 400 project municipalities, as well as 880 non-project
municipalities throughout the Northeast, have adopted the school
mapping instrument that was adapted to the capacity of rural
municipal education offices to improve education planning;
(c) all 400 project municipalities, and many non-project municipali-
ties, have adopted municipal Teachers' Charters (which define
variously professional structure, rights and duties, opportunities
for professional advancement, and entitlement to an appropriate
professional salary). Although adopted, these Teachers' Charters
have not been effectively enforced;
(d) the IRHJP and the SECs increased their awareness of the complex
theoretical and practical issues involved in the role and training
of the unqualified teacher;
(e) the CRT and the SECs increased their understanding of the theore-
tizal and practical issues involved in adapting basic education
curricula to rural areas; and



- 22 -
(f) the SECs' experience in local textbook production for rural basic
education increased their understanding of the advantages and
disadvantages of this approach for supplying the municipal rural
schools.
V. IBRD PERFORMANCE
Prolect Preparation
5.01     Project development started with the March 1974 sector analysis.
At that time the Government was not interested in borrowing for education
in the Northeast. After informal discussions in the context of the educa-
tion component of the rural development projects, the Government agreed to
proceed with an education project.   Project preparation began February,
1976, and the post appraisal mission took place in Febrlary 1980.  Overall
the Bank devoted approximately 112 staff-weeks on missions to identify,
prepare and appraise the project--two missions for reconriaissance, one for
identification, two for preparation, and two for appraisal.   This longer
than average preparation period was the result of the instability of
Brazil's political and economic situation in the late 1970s, as well as the
complexity of the Brazilian education system and the ambitious project
goals and targets. Overall, however, the results have been pj.sitive. The
Bank developed an in-depth knowledge and institutional memory of issues in
education in the Northeast, as well as an awareness of the complexity of
and education system based on numerous autonomous municipal networks, which
will have a positive impact on the design of future education projects in
Brazil.
Proiect Implementation
5.02     The project was implemented over 93 months rather than the 61
months estimated at appraisal.  This delay of almost 2.5 years was due to
difficulties faced during the early implementation period; by December 1983
only 16 percent of the loan had been disbursed rather than the 62 percent
estimated at appraisal.  During the three years of project implementation
prior to December 1983, the Bank devoted an inadequate 23.5 staff-weeks to
supervision.   The project experienced particular difficulty in the prac-
tical application of a new decentralized management system, with the parti-
cipation of three decision-making levels (federal, state, and municipal).
Despite the Bank's efforts, the responsibilities of staff and participating
institutions were not clear and explicit during the first project period.
Beginning in 1984, however, the situation improved; both the Bank and the
Government streamlined disbursement procedures (from IBRD to the Government
and from MEC to the States), and the pace of disbursements came into line
with the appraisal estimates.   In addition, Bank staff began to be more
actively and effectively involved in project activities.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     The Northeast Basic Education Project (EDURURAL) was administra-
tively, legally, and financially more complex than originally expected.
The project covered schools in hundreds of municipalities and nine states,
and required the concerted efforts of three levels of government.  While
considerable foreign and local human resources went into project design,
the Brazilian government and the Bank should have considered devoting addi-
tional administrative and supervisory resources to ensure that such a
complex project could be adequately implemented.
6.02     The EDURORAL project was saddled with delays in the transfer of
financial resources from federal to state and municipal governments.  The
effects of these delays were exacerbated by frequent and sometimes marked
devaluations of the local currency.  Future projects must have sufficient
mechanisms to ensure the timely transfer of federal financial resources to
the state and municipal levels.
6.03     The municipal education authorities played an essential role in
coordinating the delivery of reasonably complete packages of inputs to the
schools.  Tlerefore, municipal education secretariats should be created or
strengthened in all municipalities within each state.   Similarly,  the
school mapping exercise carried out under this project was generally suc-
cessful.  The exercise should be updated and extended to all geographical
areas within each of the northeastern states.
6.04     Salaries in the rural Northeast are not high enough to attract
teachers with a minimal acceptable level of skills.  Teacher compensation
policy should tie a teachers' salary to professional achievement, such as
the acquisition of additional teaching skills or better use of textbooks
and other reaching materials, rather than to length of service.
6.05     Tne experier.ce of the EDURURAL project demonstrates the difficulty
of systematic collection, analysis, storage, and diffusion of data in most
of the social sectors in developing countries, where the techniques, proce-
dures, instruments, and competent staff are frequently lacking. In visits
to some of the former state PMUs six months after the closing of the proj-
ect,  it was found that much information on project implementation had                 i
either never been obtained and systematized, or had not been retained.
Systematic collection and storage of data are essential for monitoring
project progress,  and for contributing to project sustainability.   The
permanent availability of this data contributes to project continuity and
progress in a country with a high rate of turnover at all political and
technical levels.   Special attention should be given to the selection,
collection, storage, up-dating, and use of project data at the federal,
state, and municipal levels.
6.06     CEDATE conducted a survey of more than 500 project schools that
generated reliable data that showed significant differences by state in
terms of student attendance, shift systems, and infrastructure quality.



- 24 -
Because of the heterogeneity of the northeastern states in these areas, all
working papers and project documents should be prepared and analyzed on a
state-by-state basis.
6.07     Before the EDURURAL project the Northeastern states had little or
no tradition of working together. The project was able to establish inter-
state coordination and to build an esprit de corps, although both areas
still require considerable improvement.  In the future these institutional
changes will result in better use of limited human resources in the North-
east to tackle education problems. In this regard, a future project should
not divide states into separate projects, since this could make the project
vulnerable to political pressures and negative influences by states not
participating in the first follow-up project.
6.08     Two complementary requirements have proved important for imple-
mentation of the EDURUJRAL project which should be taken into account in
preparing future projects:   the first is the definition of a long-term
educational policy or perspective, and the second is the preparation of
detailed working papers.   Both requirements contributed greatly to the
continiuity of objectives and actions during project implementation, despite
the unavoidable, frequent, and significant turn-over of staff in political
and technical positions at all levels of goverrment.  Although there may be
resistance to defining a long term educational policy, because of the
ambiguity of the term and its functional scope, and because ef frustrating
past experience with educational plans, it provides the main Lource of
direction for education systems seriously exposed to various and influen-
tial pressure groups..  In order to be effective, Bank staff and national
counterparts must reach agreement early in project discussions on what is
meant theoretically and functionally by "long-term," 'educational policy,"
and "perspective.'
6.09     The working papers that were prepared during project preparation
specified criteria for each state for selecting amcng alternatives, and
identifying the pre-cr.nditions for actions, deadlines for commitments,
quantitative and qualitative intended outcomes, structural/managerial/
procedural requirements, and the resources to be secured.  They have been
criticized as a source of rigidity and inflexibility to emerging condi-
tions, yet they have contributed to the systematic conformance of project
components and actions to the features, denands, and conditions typical of
each state.  Furthermore, they have provided the methodological basis for
effecting the eventually required adjustments to the project that emerged
during implementation. They proved to be one of the most decisive factors
for continuity, despite important administrative changes at the federal and
state levels, the reform of the national educational structure, and the
significant turn-over of municipal, state, and federal staff.
6.10     By focusing on the impact of the measures taken under the project
on student enrollment, retention, and achievement, the evaluation component
neglected the opportunity to achieve a fuller understanding of the process
issues involved in effecting the intended reforms to the municipal rural
education systems. A process evaluation would have determined the degree
to which the various reforms were implemented, and identified and analyzed



- 25 -
the factors inhibiting successful implementation.   Specifically, such an
evaluation would have included an exploration of: (a) the development and
application of the municipal Teachers' Charters; (b) the evolution in the
number and qualifications of lay teachers; (c) the delays in project imple-
mentation; (d) the operation of the OMEs; (e) the quality of the textbooks
produced by the states; (f) the results of adapting curricula and syllabi
to rural conditions;  and (g) the adaptation of teacher training to the
experience, educational level, and working conditions of the lay teacher.
6.11     The process of reform of tne municipal rural education systems is
not complete, and future loans to Brazil should build upon the foundations
already laid by the project, either by reinforcing the achievements of
EDURURAL with complementary activities, or by extending the programs to
other municipalIties, or both.   The most appropriate project to continue
the process begun by EDURURAL, would be to provide continuing support to
rural areas, as well as to improve, reinforce, and generalize the reforms
by initiating activities in the urban municipal schools and in the state
education network, taking advantage of the experience and materials deve-
loped under EDURURAL (the school mapping instruments, textbook develcpment,
and adaptation of teacher training).
