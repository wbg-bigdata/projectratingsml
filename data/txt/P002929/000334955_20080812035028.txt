    IEGWB Mission: Enhancingdevelopment effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:first, to
ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation processand to verify that the Banks work is producing the expected
 results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies,and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex;those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for which Executive Directorsor Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local
offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the
document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are
consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is
consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are
expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance; The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance; Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency (ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance; Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

The cooperation andassistance ofthe government and energy sector officials is gratefully
acknowledged.

This assessment was undertakenfor three main reasons. First, Uganda's electricity supply
i s in a dismal state, partly due to the continuing drop inthe water level inLake Victoria,
whichhas reducedthe ability to respondto power demand-as only 120MWfrom the
380 MW installed capacity is currently usable. Second, the design andimplementation o f
the project hadmultiplemajor problems, includingnonperformance ofthe national utility
(UEB), risk assessment issue, acost overrun of about $26 millionfor the civil works, and
a delay of more thanfour years inproject completion. Third, Regional Operations and
IEGdisagreed onthe performance ratings for the project at completion. This assessment
intendsto shed some light onthese issues, mainly to draw lessonsfrom the Bank
experiencethat could helpthe design o f future sector operations andto discern a way
forward.

Following standardprocedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for review. Comments from the government have beenattachedto
this report as Annex C.

 Summary

The economic performance o f Ugandaover the past two decades has been strong. However, poverty,
though reduced, still remains very high, particularly inrural areas. The highlevel o f poverty and
 lackluster private sector interest, together with a highpopulation growth rate (averaging 3.2 percent
between 1991 and 2006), have affected the performance o fthe power sector. Demand is increasing
rapidly, the affordability o f electricity has become a major issue, and the absence o f major private
 investment has heavily burdened the government's finances inthe form o f direct or contingent
 liabilities.

Uganda is poorly endowed with hydrocarbon resources and its landlocked location adds substantial
costs to the importation o f energy, particularly for petroleumproducts. The country has almost no oil,
gas, or coal reserves and its commercial energy resources are limited to hydropower and some
untapped geothermal potential. Hydropower is heavily dependent on Lake Victoria, whose level has
been declining rapidly and is now so low that only less than a third o f the installed capacity is usable.

As a resulto fall these circumstances, increased accessto reliable and affordable electricity supply
has been at best marginal inUganda. Today less than 4 percent o f the total population (and less than 1
percent o f rural population) has access to electricity, but the supply i s unreliable and o f poor quality.

The UgandaPower I11project and its Supplemental Credit, approved in 1991and 2000 respectively,
aimed to enhance the performance of the state utility and to expand generation capacity. The quality
o fthe project at entry was weak, which affected its implementation and, ultimately, project outcome.
The project design was unrealistic about the level o f tariffthe market would bear and about the
benefits to utility performance that would accrue from an expected improvement in the utility's rate
o f return. Further, the project appraisal had identified the criticality o fthe hydrological risk related to
the water level inLake Victoria, but concludedthat the likelihood o fthis riskwas less than 1percent.
That risk has now been realized.

While the project delivered many o f its physical outputs, the achievement o fthe key developmental
objective-to    enhance the performance o f the state utility-was    negligible. The key financial
covenants were not met duringthe entire 1O-year project implementation period, and arrears climbed.
The state utility (UEB) ultimately was dissolved and the sector was restructured. The efficiency o f the
project inmeeting its performance targets was negligible, as system losses have continued to be high.
Based on current utilization o f the project's assets, the EIRRis below the opportunity cost o f capital.
Also, the project suffered from a completion delay o f more than four years as well as substantial cost
overruns due to the need for rebiddingthe civil works contract. Thus, the Outcome o fthe project is
rated unsatisfactory. Inthe end, UEB succumbed under the weight o f its poor financial
performance, escalating arrears, high system losses, and other inefficiencies.

Duringits remainingeconomic life, the project will continue to face major uncertainties. Among
these are the hydrological behavior o f the Lake Victoria and the financial viability o f the sector. Thus
the Risk to DevelopmentOutcome is rated significant.

The quality at entry is ratedhighly unsatisfactory based on unrealistic expectations on the financial
improvement o f UEB, inadequate analysis o f risks and the lack o f readiness o f the project for
approval. The Bank's supervision o fthe project was moderately satisfactory, with the supervision

                                                     xii


efforts being focused on implementingthe project "as is." No innovative or adaptive measures were
introduced to restructure or formally change the objective(s) o f the project, in spite o f numerous
implementation issues. Further, the Bank should have more carefully scrutinized the qualifications of
the maincontractor, who hadto be terminated due to its inadequate qualification, resulting in
substantial delays and cost overruns. Inlight o f these shortcomings and o f the above-mentioned weak
quality at entry, overall Bank Performance i s therefore rated unsatisfactoryduringthe
implementationperiod o fthe project (199 1-2001).

Overall Borrower Performance(combining that o fthe government and o f the implementing agency)
i s rated as moderately unsatisfactory,given the context in which they operated, including their
limited institutional capacity.

Among the lessons emerging from this assessment are:

     Power sector reforms need to be very country-specific in order to produce improved sector
     performance and increased access to electricity by the poor. The Bank's power sector policy and
     lending strategies o f the1990s,with their strong emphasis on unbundlingand privatization, did
     not lead to better performance o fthe sector and increased access, because they were not applied
     with due considerationto the country's characteristics.
     Private sector participation in major power projects can create significant contingent liabilities for
     the governments. Therefore, the Bank needs to encourage and help governments to develop an
     appropriate framework for risk sharing with the private sector.
     The Bank needs to carefully scrutinize contractor prequalification. Insome cases, the Bank might
     be better o f fusingthe services o f outside consulting firms instead o f relying on its own expertise.
     Timely midterm reviews (and project restructuring ifwarranted) are particularly important in
     infrastructure projects with long implementationperiods duringwhich the original objectives and
     project design are more likely to require changes.
     Conditions for effectiveness and disbursement need to be minimized. Inthe event that a condition
     for disbursement is necessary, the condition should be designed such that failure to comply does
     not delay the project's implementation or jeopardize its overall viability.

Uganda's power sector is in a critical situation and the options available to it over the next 15 to 20
years are mostly unattractive. The sector i s facing a complex set o f issues that will take considerable
time and effort to overcome. Further, the trade-offs among various alternatives have substantial
economic, social, and environmental implications. These have produced a daunting task for policy
makers.

As the sector embarks on a new strategy, including the recent approval
supported) Bujagali Hydropower project, the sobering lessons from the
should be borne inmind.

1. Introductionand Context

Introduction

1.1     For the past 20 years the Bank has beencontinuously involved inUganda's power
sector, including through several lending operations. The Bank-supported projects (Power I1
[approved inMarch 19851, and Power 111, SupplementaryCredit, and Power IV [closed in
December 20061') were closely linked to one another-their               implementationperiods
overlapped and the primary objective o f each was to increase the electricity generation
capacity at the Owen Falls at Lake Victoria.' This PPAR only assesses the performance o f
the Power I11project and its SupplementaryCredit. The two projects are treated as one
becausethe Supplementary Credit was primarilyto finance the cost overrun o f the civil
works contract under the Power I11project. The Power I1project was excluded from the
assessmentbecause its main activities were too far inthe past, and the Power IV project was
excludedbecause it had not closed at the time o f the assessment.

1.2     Increased access to reliable and affordable electricity supply has been at best marginal
inUganda. Today lessthan4 percent o fthe total population(andlessthan 1percent o frural
population) has access to electricity, butthe supply i s unreliable and o f poor quality.

Economic Performance, Development Priorities, and Assistance Strategies

1.3     Uganda was one o f the most promising countries inAfrica at its independence in
1962 and it continued to prosper until 1971. However, between 1971 and 1986 its economy
declined sharply due to political turmoil and internal strife. In 1987, the National Resistance
Movement (NRM) took control and launched the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP). Economic
growth, which had been less than 1 percent in 1970s and early 1 9 8 0 rose       ~ ~ to average 5
percent between 1987 and 1992, although inflation was still about 65 percent and the reforms
proceeded slowly. Growth accelerated between 1992 and 2002 to average 6.3 percent over
the period.

1.4     The government's development priorities since the mid-1980s have focused on
reducing poverty, ensuringthat economic growth would be sustained, and that the benefits o f
that growth would be more evenly distributed than they had been inthe past. The government
articulated these priorities ina series o f Poverty Eradication Action Plans (PEAPs) starting in
1995.

1.5     World Bank assistanceto Uganda has been definedthrough four Country Assistance
Strategies (CASs), summarized inBox 1.


1. The Bank also fmanced the Power Iproject, approved inMarch 1961 and closed inMarch 1964.
2. In2000, the government formally changed the name o f Owen Falls to Nalubaale and changed the Owen Falls
Extensionto Kiira. Bujagali is about 7 kilometers downstream o f the Nalubaale dam.

                                                      2



Box 1. Country Assistance Strategies, 1995-Present
The Banks' first fill CAS was approved inJune 1995 andcoveredFY95-98.This CAS focusedon increased
investment by the privatesector to stimulaterapidgrowth andthereby to reduce poverty. While the
performanceofthe economy duringthis CAS periodwas good, povertyremainedhigh (60-70 percent). While
the share ofthe private investmentrose from 8.2 percent of GDP inFY87-FY93to 11.7percent inFY94-FY96,
the share of foreign investmentremainedinsignificant.

The second full CAS (approvedinApril 1997) coveredFY98-FYO1.It continuedto focus on economic growth
andpovertyreduction. The economygrew at 6.9 percentand inflationdeclinedto virtually nilby 1999.Poverty
remainedhigh, however. Improvement inthe performanceofthe state utilities, includingthe power sector, was
also an objective ofthis CAS, inparticularby increasingprivatesector participation,competition,and
regulation.Despitesome progressinreformandprivatizationduringthe CAS period, investors didnot show an
interest in investinginUganda's major infrastructure projects.
The third full CAS was preparedduringthe latter part of2000 and coveredFYO1-FY03. The objectivewas to
support Uganda's economictransformationandpovertyreductionstrategy as outlinedinthe PEAP (andthe
PRSP), by maintainingmacroeconomic stabilitywith an emphasis on the sectoral level. The fourth (and most
recent) CAS was a Joint Assistance Strategy(JAS) preparedtogether with seven other developmentpartners in
the latter part of2005 and it coveredFY05-FY09.The economy has continued to grow, averaging5.4 percent
over the most recent five years.



1.6       Overall, Ugandahas experienced strong growth over the past two decades, but though
poverty has been reduced it i s still very high, especially inthe rural areas, and poverty
disparities have widened since the mid-1980s.The government's ambitious planto reduce
poverty to 10 percent by 2017 now seems unrealistic. Further,private investors have shown
little interest inUganda. The disappointing results on poverty reduction and the stimulation
o f private sector investment, together with a highpopulation growth rate (averaging 3.2
percent between 1991 and 2006), have affected the performance o f the power sector.
Demand is increasing rapidly, the affordability of electricity has become a major issue, and
the absence of major private investment has heavily burdened the government's finances.

Sectoral Context

1.7       Uganda i s poorly endowedwith hydrocarbon resources and its landlockedlocation
adds substantial costs to imported energy, particularly petroleum products. The country has
no oil3, gas, or coal reserves, and its commercial energy resources are limitedto hydropower
and some untapped solar, wind, and geothermal p~tential.~          Biomass-the       most important
energy resource inUganda-accounts            for over 90 percent o f the country's energy
consumption. Biomass meets the cooking and heatingneeds o fthe majority o f Ugandan
households as well as the commercial requirements o f small and medium enterprises.5

3 The Ministry o f Energy and Mineral Developmentreportsthat commercial discoverieshavebeenmade, but
these have notyet been developed.
4. The geothermalpotentialis estimated at 450 MW, butthere is no commercial production.
5. ESMAPestimatedwood fuel consumption of 13.6 milliontons versus a sustainableyield of 10.9 milliontons
per year.

                                                        3


 Consequently, the Ministry o f Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) i s supporting
 reforestationprograms, improvements inbiomass end-use efficiencies, indoor air pollution
 control, and biomass-based power generation including gasification. Per capita energy
 consumption in 1993 was 1.2millionBtu, and reached to 1.5 million Btuin2003, compared
with the average of 15.6 million Btufor Africa in2003. The country's large hydropower
potential i s estimated at 2,000 MW, corresponding to a production o f 12,500 GWh o f
 electricity. The installed hydropower capacity currently i s 380 MW, but the effective
 capacity i s only 120 MW. Small hydropower sites, ifdeveloped, could add an aggregate
 capacity o f 200 MW and serve rural communities through decentralized systems. The
 government has also initiated measures to promote energy efficiency and demand-side
management.

 1.8     Government Strategy. The government's strategy for the power sector was
 articulated inthe MEMDpaper submittedinSeptember 1989. The strategy, based on
development o f a least-cost supply to meet the demand, was to increase the hydropower
capacity, accelerate electrification, increase the export o f the electricity to neighboring
countries and increase the autonomy of the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB).This broad
strategy remainedineffect untilJune 1999, whenthe government, faced with increasing
UEBperformance problems, approved the Power Sector RestructuringandPrivatization
strategy (para.3 S).

 1.9     BankSectoral Strategy and Support. Despitethe Bank's extended involvement in
Uganda's energy sector, it hadno cohesive, free-standing energy sector strategy for Uganda
during the project's 1O-year implementation.6

 1.10    The Bank's first Country Assistance Strategy (Box 1) includedonly the ongoing
Power I11project and the preparation o f an energy sector assessment in FY95. Duringthe
third CAS, the electricity situationhadbecome critical as frequent load shedding, power
failures, and voltage fluctuations had forced many to invest inprivate generation. This CAS
therefore prominently emphasized the power sector and included three power projects: Power
IV ($58 million), Energy for RuralTransformation ($30 million), and Bujagali ($100
million). Further,the CAS identifiedpower and transportation as the two priority sectors for
infrastructure impr~vement.~

1.11     The Bank's support for Uganda's energy sector has beenextensive and sustained. The
first power sector loan, for $8.4 million, was approved inMarch 1961,a year before the

6. Several energy-relatedstudies were conductedafter appraisalof the project, including ESMAP's Energy
Assessment and RuralEnergy Strategyin 1996 and 1999.Each articulated some aspects ofthe sector's issues.
The Energy Assessment study provided abroad direction for the electricity sector-the     needfor institutional
change, participation by the private sector, expansionof systemcapacity, and widening access to electricity.
The Rural Electrification study suggested an approachthat would achieveahighlevel of electrification without
government, donor, or national utility investments.
7. Although power sector priorities were outlined inthe CAS, there was no mention of energy or the power
sector inthe "progress with Sector Plans for Implementingthe PEAP," though there were specific references to
roads, rural development, education, health, water, and other sectors. Further, while the CAS statedthat access
to energy was the key constraintto rural development,no target was set for rural energy.

country's independence, to support the extension of transmission and distribution facilities.
Then, in 1984, the Bank supported the first energy assessment o f the country. Since then, the
Bankhas been continuously involvedinUganda's power sector through four power sector
loans and a supplementary credit, energy for rural transformation project, Bujagali hydro
project (cancelled), a petroleum exploration promotion project, as well as many energy-
related studies. The Bank has lent a total o f about $350 millionto Uganda's power sector
since 1984. Annex C1 lists the Bank's energy-related activities inUganda.

1-12     Donors' Support. Many bilateral donors have been(and continue to be) involved in
Uganda's energy sector includingthe British,Danish, Finnish,Japanese, Norwegian,
Swedish, and Swiss aid agencies, as well as multilaterals includingAfrican Development
Bankand Islamic DevelopmentBank. Annex C2 providesthe list ofthe donors andthe
amount of the grant /loan provided by each for the energy sector.


2. The Project

Objectives

2.1      The Bank's appraisal report didnot provide specific objectives for the Power I11
project. However, since the project was part o f UEB's five-year (1992-96) investment
program, the objectives o fthat program are pertinent. The investment program was to
continue and build upon the rehabilitation work undertaken by the Power I1project to prevent
power supply bottlenecks.' Specifically, it was to (a) provide urgentlyneeded least-cost
capacity additions to Uganda's power generation, (b) increase the safety o f the Owen Falls
dam, and (c) expandthe transmission and distribution facilities "to satisfy the requirements
o f all the productive sectors o f the economy." The program was also to (d) enhance the
utility'soperating and management capability and improve its financial performancethrough
policyreforms and institutional strengthening which, among other things, include (i)                 the
establishment o f realistic tariffs, (ii)   agreement on a sector investment program, and (iii)           a
linkwith autility ofa developed country to provide technical andpracticalon-site and
overseas training and experience inmodernpractices inplant routine and preventive
maintenance and operation, load forecasting and planning, accounting and computer
procedures, and managerial skills. The program objectives were not revised during project's
implementation.

2.2      The objectives o f Power I11as statedinthe Credit Agreementwere to (a) assist the
borrower with the continued rehabilitation o fthe power system inUganda; and (b) develop its
hydropower resources and expandthe transmissionand distribution system, to provide reliable,
least-cost energyto Uganda's growing population. These objectives remained unchanged for

8. The objective o f the Power I1project was to "prevent the development o f abottleneck inpower supplies."
This was to be achievedthrough upgrading and rehabilitating existing generationcapacity at the Owen Falls
power stationand the capacity ofthe existing transmission and distribution system. The project had also the
objective of strengtheningUEB's operationalcapability.

                                                     5


the Supplementary Credit that was approved eight years later.' Although the project's
objectives were stated somewhat differently indifferent documents, the thrust basically remain
unchanged from the four objectives outlined for the overall program.

Origin, Description, and Components

2.3       Power I11originated from a 1990 feasibility study funded under the Power I1project.
The study concluded that the next component inthe least-cost expansionprogram o f
Uganda's power generation development should be a 102M W extension o f the Owen Falls
plantto utilize the energy resources available from the highwater levels inLake Victoria that
hadprevailed since 1960s.

2.4       The main components o f the project were (see Annex C3 for a full listingo fthe
components o f the program);


          Civil works associated with the construction o f a canal (which begins at the existing
          Owen Falls dam and terminates % kilometers downstream at the newextension dam
          where the new power plants are housed), the extension dam, and spillway.
         Newpower generation equipment and facilities at the Owen Falls Extension (OFE)
          dam, consisting o fthree turbo-generator units o f 34 M W each (Le., 3X34MW), and a
          double circuit 132kV transmission line about one kilometer longto connect the new
         powerhouse to UEB's grid at the existing dam.
          Employment o f consultants and a panel o f dam experts to advise on the condition o f
         the existing Owen Falls dam, andthe measures to strengthen the stability ofthe
         existing dam.
         Institution-building activities including a training workshop and provision o f
         associated training equipment, a four-year technical assistance link with an
         established overseas electricity utility to provide training and experience inthe areas
         o f operations, financial control, management systems, and modern methods o f routine
         maintenance, and training; other technical assistance and in-house and overseas
         training for UEB employees.
         Support to the Ministryo f Energy; and engineering design for the next hydro site to
         be developed inUganda's least-cost power development plan.

Original Cost Estimate and FinancingArrangements

2.5      The total estimated cost o f the Power I11project at appraisal was $335 million, o f
which $300 million was foreign costs. About 93 percent ($3 13 million) o f the total cost was
for the development of the Owen Falls extension dam and strengthening o fthe existing dam,
which includedmajor civil works for the canal and the spillway, and the electrical and
mechanical equipment associated with 3x34 MW power plants.The remaining $22 million
was for technical assistance for UEB and MOE, a study for the next hydro site, and about $8

9. Since there was no project appraisaldocumentfor the SupplementaryCredit, the objective o fthe project as
stated inthe MOP for the SupplementaryCredit was also consistent with the legal document.

                                                         6


millionfor several small transmission and distribution components originally plannedto be
implemented under Power I1project (see footnote 9). The Supplementary Credit was for $33
million, 87 percent ofwhich was to finance the cost overrun o fthe civil works contract under
the Power I11project, and $3.5 millionwas mainly to fundtechnical assistancefor the
Ministry ofFinance for restructuringthe power sector. Annex C4.1 providesthe detailed cost
estimate and financing planfor the Power I11project and Annex C4.2 provides a summary o f
the original cost estimate andfinancing arrangements for the Power I11project and for the
 Supplementary Credit.

2.6      The total cost o fthe program was estimated at $450 million." Inaddition to the Power
111project's components (discussed above), the balance of $123 millioninthe program
included $100 millionfor transmission and distribution and $11million for rural electrification.
Thus, the entire transmission and distribution components o fthe program (including the
transmission and distribution that were neededto transport the power generated through the
project) were not included inthe project financing. Annex C5 provides the cost estimates for
UEB's five-year investmentprogramfor 1992-96.

On-Lending and ImplementationArrangements

2.7      The government was the borrower ofbothPower I11(SDRequivalent of $125
million) andthe Supplementary Credit (SDRequivalent o f $33 million). Ittransferred $40
million o f the Power I11credit to UgandaElectricity Board (UEB) as equity, and on-lent
$113.4 million to UEB on a non-concessionary basis. The balance of $4.6 million was
provided to the Ministryo f Energy and Ministry o f Finance to fund technical assistance.
UEBwas responsible for project implementation and management. It was assistedby Acres
o f Canada, the international engineering and consulting firm that had conducted the
feasibility study for the project.

Monitoring and EvaluationDesign

2.8      The project had no formal provision for monitoring and evaluation. It was to be
monitored through standard quarterly reports (submittedto the Bank by UEB), similar to
those submittedunder the Power I1project. The appraisal report did include an annex
(Monitoring Guidelines) that provided several performance indicators (reproduced as Annex
C6 o fthis report).

RiskAssessment

2.9      The project's risks, accordingto the appraisal report, consisted o f (a) hydrological
risks (the risk that the water level o f Lake Victoria could recede to the low level prevailing
between 1900 and 1961); and (b) institutional and financial risks, consideringthat the
improvements made to UEB's poor operating and financial performance andmanagement

10. The total cost o f the program is shown as $458 million. This includes $8.1 million for several small
transmission and distribution works, mainly 33 and 11 kilovolt facilities, which could not be completed under
Power I1due to shortage o f funds, and therefore were refinanced under Power 111.

                                                          7


control under the Power I1project were still precarious. The appraisal report had concluded
that the hydrological risks would be less than 1percent, and the institutional and financial
riskscould be mitigatedthrough various covenants.

Quality of the Project at Entry

2.10      The quality o fthe project at entry hadmajor shortcomings. These included an
unrealistic target for tariff increases; unrealistic expectations on the contribution o f an
improved rate o f return(hadsuch an ROR beenachieved) to enhancing the performance o f
the UEB; weak analysis o fthe probability that the single most critical risk o f the project
would occur; inadequate preparation o fthe project prior to its approval by the Board; and
absence o f any requirement for a midterm review. Consideringthe negative impacts o f these
shortcomings on project implementation-andy                as a result, on the project outcome-these          are
each discussed inmore detail below.

2.11      Tariff,RateofReturn,and UEBFinances.The project design was unrealistic with
respect to the level o ftariffthe market would bear and the expected benefits that would
accrue from an improved (8 percent) rate o f return. The likelihood that the related covenants
would succeed should have beenmore carefully considered inlight o f the fact that similar
covenants had been requiredunder Power I1(already six years into implementation) and
were falling short o f their targets as the project approached its close."

2.12      Tariff. One ofthe objectives ofPower I11was to increasethe tariff, not only to the
level o f economic c o d 2butto a level that would ensure an 8 percent rate o freturn on UEB's
assets. This was to be done by raisingthe tariff from 2.4 cents (equivalent) per kWhat
appraisal to 4.8 cents per kWhby the effectiveness date, and to 7.2 cents per kWhon January
1 1993, Then, the tariff was to be increased at 5 percent per year, inreal terms, beginning
January 1 1994, and more, ifneeded to ensure a minimum return of 8percent on UEB's
revalued assets. Revaluation o fUEB's assets was also part o fthe condition o f effectiveness,
considering that the value o fthose assets according to the appraisal report was only 1percent
o ftheir worth.

2.13     The increase intariffdidnot take into account a realistic assessmento f its
affordability for consumers. The appraisal had concluded that domestic (residential)
consumers were willing to pay up to about 17 cents per kWh. This was based on three
assumptions: (i)     the electricity i s used by higher-income urbanresidents with $3,000 per year
income; (ii)   electricity expenses generally represent 10 percent o f householdincome; and (iii)
an average household consumption was assumed to be 1,800 kWhper year. With respect to
commercial and industrial sectors, the appraisal report had concluded that users were willing

11. Under Power 11, the government was to take appropriate measures (a) to implement the necessary actions
for UEB to earn a rate of return of 5 percent in 1986, 6 percent in 1987, 7 percent in 1988 and 8 percent in 1989
and thereafter; (b) to review the tariffquarterly and revise as required to earn the ROR covenanted; and (c) to
collect the payments o f arrears.
12. The appraisal report indicates that the long runmarginal cost of electricity inUganda in 1990 was 7 cents
per kWh, based on a Bank-financed study under the Power I1project.

                                                        8


to pay up to 19 cents per kWhand 11 cents per kWh, respectively. Therefore, inthe
calculation o f the EIRR, the benefit stream was represented by valuing electricity at 15 cents
per kWh, the weighted average of the willingnessto pay figures for the three ~ectors.'~

2.14      Consideringthe Ugandaneconomy o f 1990-income                     per capita o f only about $180
and a poverty rate of about 60-70 percent-the             approach taken to the valuation o f
willingness-to-pay entails many subjective assumptions.Implicit inthis valuation was that
the average tariff could beraised up to 15 cents per kWhandstill be affordable. Inreality,
this was not the case.

2.15      InJanuary 1990the tariff was raisedto 2.4 centsper kWh, whenthe exchange rate
was 440 Shillings to the dollar. InJune 1992, when the exchange rate was 915 Shillingto the
dollar, the tariff was raised to 4.8 cents per kWh inanticipation o f meeting the condition of
effectiveness. When the tariffwas raised to 7.2 cents per kWhinJuly 1993, the exchange
rate haddeclined further to 1,195 Shillings to the dollar. Ineffect, the average tariff to a
typical Ugandan consumer had increased eightfold, from 10.5 Shilling per kWhto 86
Shillings, over a three year period, and it was expected to continue increasing at 5 percent in
real terms thereafter.

2.16      As the tariff increased, so did the UEB's delinquentaccounts payable (arrears) from
the customers. By December 1990, as a result o f the January 1990 tariff increase, arrears had
climbed to UGS 3 billion and by September 1992, as a result of the second tariff increase, it
had risen to UGS 14.5 billion. By September 1993, after the thirdtariff increase, the arrears
reached UGS 22.7 billion. By that time the government was reluctant to further increase the
tariff, andthus declinedto implement the 5 percent annual real increase after January 1994.
By August 1994, less than 25 percent o fthe energy billedwas paid for and by 1997the
arrears climbed to UGS 60 billion even though the government had written off about UGS 11
billion inarrears. By then the Bank had concluded that UEB's financial problems were no
longer a tariff issue. AlthoughUEB launchedvarious initiatives intendedto reduce its
arrear~,'~ arrears issue was not resolveduntilthe government restructuredthe sector.
            the

2.17      While establishinga "realistic tariff' level was one o fthe objectives o fthe project at
appraisal, the target level was not realistic. Despite the implementation of tariff increases
(except for the 5 percent annual real increase) the finances o f UEB continued to deteriorate,
to the point that by 1999 UEB had to be dissolved.

2.18       Rate of Return. The tariff was belowthe long runmarginal cost (LRMC), so raising
the tariffto that level was justified. Butthe mainjustification for the increase was to achieve
a minimum ROR o f 8 percent for UEB. Achieving the targeted 8 percent minimumRORwas
considered essential to enhancing the efficiency of UEB.However, even if such an RORhad
been achieved, this would not have ensureda turnaround inUEB's poor performance.

13. It also concluded that the economic value o fthe electricity for domestic consumers was also 15 cents per
kWh.
14. Operation Thunder was launched in 1996 and Operation Omega was launched in 1997,both aimed to
accelerate collections.

                                                   9


Improvements inUEB's finances might have helped but did not guarantee the effective
management and efficient operation o f the utility. Attention to other parameters would also
have beenneeded (such as control o f unit costs, improved productivity, effective budgeting
andplanning, and a management information system). Although the appraisal report
provided some strong indicators for enhancing performance o f the utility, very little was
accomplished toward achieving those objectives. For example, the link with a "developed
country" utility, which was meant to help enhance UEBperformance, was ineffective. With
respect to receivables, the only covenant was related to ensuringthat the ministries and
parastatals would pay their arrears to UEB, which represented less than 10percent o f UEB's
total arrears.

2.19     The appraisal did not consider taking a phased approach to achieving the desired
returnand set out a strict schedule for meetingthe target. Further,duringimplementation, no
action was takento adjust the rate o f returnto a more realistic value.

2.20     Thus, while the appraisal reporthadprojected robust performance for UEB's future
finances, including generating a large amount o f internal cash and achieving an overall ROR
o f 7-10 percent, the project fell substantially short o f meeting any o f its financial objectives.
Duringthe period, UEBdidnot meet(or even come close to meeting) the covenanted rate o f
return o f 8 percent, nor did it meetthe debt service coverage covenant, despite an eightfold
tariffincrease and an equityinjectionof$40 millionbythe government. Figure2 shows the
tariff increases, the arrears, and the rate o f return performance duringthe implementation o f
the project.

2.21     Assessment of Risks.The appraisal report identified the hydrological behavior o f
Lake Victoria as the most critical risk facing the project. Though the assessment o f this risk
(conducted by UEB's consultants, Acres) was challenged by the firm that originally
constructed the Owen Falls dam (Box 2), a consultant hiredby the Bank validated crucial
findings by Acres that ledthe Bank to accept the risk. This risk has now beenrealized.
(Annex C7 provides the Bank's recent statement on this issue).

2.22     The Bank's appointment o fathird-party consultant to assess two disagreeing views
regarding the future hydrological risks, was a sound approach to resolvingthe dispute.
However, the conclusion that the Bank derived from these analyses was basedon a patchwork
ofjustifications rather than a rigorous further analysis. The main issue was the conclusion that
the probability ofthe water level revertingto the lowlevels ofpre-1961was only 1percent.
Considering the potential impact o fthis risk on the viability of the project andthe
qualifications o fthe entities that had argued against taking this risk, the Bank should have
carried out more than a brief review o fthe issue by an individual consultant. Further, the
Bank' justification for accepting the risk was basedmostly on the assumption that even under
the worst scenario the EIRRwould not be below 8 percent. But this EIRRwas based on the
assumption that the willingness-to-pay for the tariff is UScl5 per kWh(paras. 2.13 & 2.14).

                                                               10




Box 2. Hydrological Crisis of Lake Victoria-Summary Background

Until 1990the total generation capacity at the Owen Falls dam was 180MW, comprising 10unitsthat hadbeenupgraded
from 15 M W to 18 M W each under the Power I1project. InMay 1990, Acres completeda feasibility study (funded under
Power 11) for the extension of the Owen Falls dam, concluding that the least-cost alternative for development of Uganda's
power sector would be extension of the existing OwenFalls dam, increasingthe capacity by 102M W (later 200 MW). This
conclusion was based on the availability of substantial additional water resources at the Lake Victoria that had"gone un-
hamessedhitherto." Acres argued that the outflow from the lake recordedprior to 1961was low, and that the actual flow
prior to 1961hadbeen closer to twice that volume. Further, Acres questioned the accuracy of the the "Agreed Curve" (the
flow rate agreed between Ugandaand Egypt). However, Acres also concludedthat ifthe future flows were at the previous
levels, an extensionto Owen Falls would not bejustified.

Acres analyzedtwo scenarios: (a) a basecase, which usedthe same average annual outflow as for the period from 1961to
1989; and (b) a low case, which usedthe lowest average outflow for the period from 1899 to 1961. Acres further calculated
the probability the low case would occur at less than 1percent.

The Gibbs Company of the UK, which had designedthe existing Owen Falls dam in 1948 andhadvast experience in
Ugandaand the Nile, had previously studied the possibility of extendingthe Owen Falls dam in 1978 and 1986, and had
concludedthat the expansion o fgeneration capacity could only be limited to an upgrade of the existing 10 units from 15 to
18 M W each. They had indicatedthat althoughthe lake level had dramatically risenbetween 1961 and 1964, the extension
was not economicallyjustified since the long-term lake outflow would be about the same as the average outflow between
1900 and 1961. Further, Gibbs indicatedthat the Agreed Curve was correct.

The Britishaid agency also asked Kennedy and Donkin to review the Acres study and intheir report of July 1990, K&D
indicated that the Acres "evidence is not tenable and there are significant concerns over the approach adopted by Acres.
There is a real possibility that the level could go back to what was from 1900-1960. K&D do not agree that the Agreed
Curve was inaccurate." Norway also raised questions about the water level in its project appraisal.

The Bank employed an individual consultant to review the discrepancies and arrive at a solution. The consultant's report of
January 1991concludedthat (a) "the Agreed Curve...is confirmed; and (b) since the record of Lake levelsextends from
1900 to 1990, the apparent probability that any average yearly flow will be equal to or less than the lowest value
experienced is 1to 90 or about 1.1%. Thus, the apparent probability that the lowest flows used inthe firm energy analysis
will be exceeded is 1 h . l or 98.9% which is in agreementwith Acres assumption of 99%."

InFebruary 1991the Bank concluded that (i) Acres's assertion that the pre-1960datawas in error was not correctbut that
(ii) the risk of reversionto the pre-1960 hydrology was small and worth taking. This wasjustified basedon (a) even ifthe
hydrology revertedimmediately as construction began (the worst case), the project would still have an ROR of 8 percent; (b)
ifpost-1960 hydrology persisted,theprojectwould havearelativelyshort payback period ofeight years, assuminga
discount rate of 12 percent.

As Figure 1 shows, except for some brief intervals,the level of Lake Victoria has been dropping since it reached its highest
level in 1961-64, due to drought in its catchment area and the amount of water released at Owen Fallsto meet power
generationrequirements. At the time of the assessment mission inAugust 2006, only 120M W of generatingcapacity was
used. InOctober 2001, the lake reached its lowest level since 1923.The government had set a limit of 850 cubic meters per
second allowable discharge (135 MW) but later had to reduce it to 750 cubic meters per second (120 MW). Currently the
capacity utilization of the power plant is between 70 M W and 145M W depending on the peak and off-peak requirements.
This compares with atotal of 380 M W of currently installed capacity (180 M W of which was already existing, 160M W of
which had been installed through the Power 111and Power I V projects, and 40 M W of which hadbeen installed for Unit 13
through the financing by Norway and Sweden). Unit 13 has already been withdrawn from the concessionaire to use its
transformer to evacuatepower from the recently installed thermal power plant.

2.23         Status of Preparedness.The preparedness o fthe project prior to implementation
was not adequate. This was evident inthe number o f conditions for effectiveness and
disbursement, andthe substantial cofinancing gaps. Further, the designo f some o f the key
conditions was flawed.

2.24        Conditionsfor Effectiveness.There were six major conditions for effectiveness,
including converting a $40 million government loan into UEB equity, doubling the tariff to
4.8 cents per kWh, revaluation o f UEB's assets, evaluatingthe safety o f the existing dam,
and preparingthe biddingdocuments to carry out the necessary work, appointment o f a panel
o f experts, and availability o f counterpart funds. The large number o f conditions had the
potential to prolong project implementation, add to borrower costs through additional
commitment charges, and force the Bank to compromise on a condition inorder to accelerate
implementation. Inthe end, while the project was approved on June 13, 1991,the project still
could not meet all the conditions o f effectiveness even after 16 months and three extensions.
Thus, two ofthe conditions were changed to conditions of disbursement, and the project
became effective inOctober 1992.

2.25        Conditionsof Disbursement.The project also hadtoo many conditions for
disbursement,including the availability o f supplemental financing o f at least $130 million (or
50 percent o f the project's estimated base cost), progress inidentification o f another $45

                                                         12


millionincofinancing to fundtransmission anddistribution components, implementation of a
resettlement action plan, as well as the two conditions o f effectiveness that were added.

2.26      Inadditionto beingtoo numerous, the designofsome conditions was flawed. The
conditions for disbursement inan investment lendingoperation needto bejudiciously selected
so that failure to meet them would not delay the entire project or putthe viability o fthe project
at risk.Inthis case, all of the conditions were to be met prior to disbursement for the civil
works, the largest and most critical component o fthe project. Also, the timeframe for the
activities related to the consultants for dam safety was unrealistic.

2.27      The numerous conditions did result indelays, butthe overall importance o fthose
delays was diminished by the four-year delay due to the rebiddingofthe civil works contract.
Infact, had compliance withvarious conditions of disbursement beenadheredto as originally
required, the project would have hadto start 5 years later, or by the original closing date of
the project. However, by March 1994, disbursement for civil works hadbegun, even though
some o f the key conditions o f disbursement had not beenfully met.

2.28      Absence of Provisionfor MidtermReview.Considering the complexity o fthe
project and the number o fpendingissues at entry, the design should have included a formal
midtermreview. The legal documentsmade no provision for a formal midtermreview.l5

2.29      Based on the foregoing analysis the quality of the project at entry i sjudged to have
beenhighly unsatisfactory.


3. ProjectImplementation

Actual Costs and Financing

3.1       The total actual cost o fthe Power I11project and the SupplementaryCredit was about
$313 million. The total actually disbursedby the Bank for bothwas $144.9 million (in
original U.S.dollar amount) against the total credit o f $158 million. Approximately $4
million from the Power I11project and $10million from the Supplementary Credit were
cancelled. Annex C8 provides the amount o f the Bank credit disbursedper category, and
Annex 9 provides the amount disbursedper beneficiary. About $22 million was disbursedto
beneficiaries whose names do not appear on the disbursement tables, and for which this
assessment was unable to find relevant documentation.l6



15. The Project Status Report o f 6/27/1997 indicatedthat MTR i s scheduled for 6/01/1998. The same statement
appeared inthe PSR o f 01/29/1998, and o f 06/30/1998, although there are no indications o f the MTR having
beencarried out inJune 1998 mission. The PSR of 5/14/1999 also indicatedthat the MTR was scheduled for
6/01/1998, and the PSR o f 06/30/1999 indicatedthat the MTR was scheduled for 10/04/1998.
16. This should not be construed as questioning the legitimacy o fthe transactions or the beneficiaries; simply
that at the level o f this assessmentthe information could not be found.

Implementation Issues

3.2       CivilWorks Contract. One ofthe most problematic issues duringproject
implementationwas the poor performance o f the civil works contractor, Sietco o f China. The
cancellation o f the Sietco contract, and subsequent rebiddingand mobilization of a new
contractor resulted ina delay o f about 4 years and additional costs o f $26 million. Box 3
summarizes the key events inthis situation.

Box 3. Delay and Additional Costs of Civil Works Contract
InMarch 1992,UEB'sconsultantadvisedthe Bankthat 40 companies hadsubmittedprequalificationpackages
andrecommendedthat 23 be accepted. InApril 1992,the Bank clearedthe prequalifiedcompanies andthe
biddingdocuments.Tenderswere receivedfrom 13 companies.InMay 1993 the Bank receivedthe bid
evaluationandrecommendationproposingthat the contract be awardedto Sietco, the lowest evaluatedbidder
(the differencebetweenSietco andthe next higher bidder was about $15 million). The Bankprovideditsno
objectioninOctober 1993 andthe contract with Sietco was signedinNovember 1993.

Sietco encountereddelays andfinancial problemsalmost from the start. To help avoidhrther delay, the Bank
agreedto advance $10 millionto Sietco. However,by March 1996,some 29 monthsafter awardof the contract,
the contractedworks were only 26 percentcompleteversus a planned70 percent.UEB finally calledfor new
bids on January 1997,andthe contractwith a new contractorwas signedin September 1997.An additionalcost
o f $26 millionhadbeenincurred,andthe civil works contract was only completedin 2001, about 4 years
behindthe originalschedule.


3.3      Although responsibility for contractor prequalification remains with the borrower
(and inthis case, withthe borrower's engineering consultants as well), the Bank should have
more carefully scrutinized the qualifications o f Sietco, giventhe importance o f the civil
works components and their share o fthe total cost and the time neededto complete the work.
Further, a long time passedbetween when it became evidentthat Sietco's qualification was
an issue and the time that the new contactor was selected and mobilized.

3.4      Engineeringand ConstructionSupervisionContract. In 1989,UEBselected the
Acres consulting firm to examine the feasibility of extendingthe Owen Falls dam under the
Power I1project. UEB (and Acres) insistedthat the Bank extend Acres' initial contract under
Power I1to cover the detailed engineering and construction supervision of the project under
Power 111, without going through competitive bidding. Their argument was based on the
potential delay (6 months) that could result. While the Bank agreed to extend the Acres
contract untila bidder had been selected to construct the civil works, it did not agree to
proceed with Acres on "single source" basis due to the size o f the contract (an estimated $20
million). The contract was eventually awarded to Acres who emerged as the winning bidder
from a "two envelope" competitive bid inline with the Bank's procurement guidelines for
the selection ofconsultant~.'~ thetime the contract was signed, three years had elapsed.
                                    By


I'Two-Envelopeprocurementis when bidders submittheir bids intwo envelopes:one containsthe

                                                       14


There is no evidence that the resultingcontinuity with Acres helpedthe implementationo f
the project.

3.5       Reform.By late 1996, the government faced numerous issues stemming from UEB's
poor performance and was considering a fundamental change inits approach, such as seeking
a strategic partner or puttingUEB under a management contract. The Bank was advising the
government to move toward privatizing the sector, arguingthat substantial private capital
flow would lessen the government's financial burdens.The government's sector restructuring
activities were inpart funded through $3.5 million o f technical assistance to the Ministry o f
Finance, a component under the Supplementary Credit.

3.6       Severalpositive steps inthis direction were taken toward the end o f the project
implementation, including the passage of an Electricity Act, the establishment o f a new
Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA), and the corporatization o f the generation,
transmission, and distribution functions (Box 4). While the Bank encouraged the government
to reform the sector, it i s not clear whether the new structure o fthe sector arose from the
Bank's advice. Regardless, private sector participation inUganda's power sector might
improve technical and managerial efficiency, but it i s unlikelyto relieve the government of
much o f its financial liability. Private investors have shown very little interest ininvestingin
Uganda's power sector without substantial government guarantees, which would subject the
government to significant real or contingent liabilities.

Box 4. Sector Reform
InJune 1999, the cabinetapprovedthe Power Sector Restructuringand Privatization Strategy, andanew
Electricity Act was passed inNovember 1999.The Act establishedthe Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA),
which became operationalin2001, InApril 2001the governmentunbundledUEB's functions into generation,
transmission, and distribution, and subsequentlyformed UEGCL, UETCL, and UEDCL respectively. UETCL
was to remain a state-ownedbulk single-buyer entity.
The governmentwas reluctant to sell its assets andviewed privatization as a long-term prospect ratherthan an
immediate solution to the problems inthe sector. InNovember 2002, Eskom of SouthAfrica negotiateda 20-
year concessioncontract to leaseUEGCL's generationassets under aPower Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under
the terms ofthe PPA, UETCL is obligatedto purchasecapacity(MW) from Eskomon atake-or-pay basis,
irrespectiveofthe market requirementsinto which it has to sell, and irrespective of hydrological behavior ofthe
Lake. Eskom is obligatedto maintain generatingcapacity availability of 95 percent, and invest arelatively small
amount ($6.8 million) and to receive arate of return of 12percent on this investment.
Subsequently, Eskom, in ajoint venture with Globeleg of UK, formed Umeme. The new entity startedoperation
inMarch2005 andundera20-year concessioncontractleasedUEDCL's assets for distribution. Umeme is
requiredto provide aminimum of 15,000 new connections per year inthe first four years and then 25,000 per
year thereafter, with atotal investmentof up to $350 millionover the concessionperiod, depending on the tariff
level.



3.7      Itis too early to judge the long-term sustainability ofthe current concession-type
contracts for generation and distribution, which are presently dependent on Bank support and
the government's assumption of contingent liabilities. Inthe distribution sector, inaddition to
re-lending $11 million (from the Power IV project) to finance investments inthe system, the

                                                     15


Bank provided a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) o f about $5.5 million (reallocating from the
Privatizationand Utility Sector Reform project) to Umeme, the concession holder, to
mitigate electricity payment risks. Thus, the government's contingent liabilities continue to
increase as Umeme will have recourse to a liquidity facility ifthe Uganda Distribution
company defaults on its obligation. Overall, it i s estimated that under current concession
contracts, the government i s expected to subsidize the sector for $400-$450 million over the
next 4-5 years.

3.8      InspectionPanelandEnvironmentalIssues.InJuly 2001, about 6 months before
project closing, the Bank's Inspection Panel received a complaint from several NGOsl' o f
failures and omissions o f the project's designand implementationthat negatively affected
their rights and interests. The projects referredto were Power I11andBujagali. Management
responded to the complaint in September 2001 and the Panel decided to launch a formal
investigation and issued its investigation report inMay 2002. The investigation report
covered the Power 111, Supplementary Credit, Power IVYand Bujagali projects. Box 5

Box 5. The InspectionPanel'sFindingsand the ManagementResponse
The Panelconcluded(andthe Bank's Managementhadresponded)that:
(a) Power I11project shouldhavebeenfully subject to OD 4.00. Nonetheless, the Panel agreedthat the
environmental analysis "largely accords" with the requirementsof OD 4.00. However, the proceduresoutlined
for environmental evaluationby OD 4.00 were not "complied with inregardto boththe involvement ofthe
affected groups andthe use of an environmental advisory panel." It also agreedthat no additional EA for the
Supplementarycredit would be required, given that both Power I11and the Supplementary Credit hadthe same
objectives. Thus, the Panel found the Managementinpartial compliance with this policy.
(b) While OMS 2.36 did not mandatethe use of SectoralEnvironmental Assessment (SEA), OD 4.00 of
1013111989had introducedthem. The project appraisalreport for Power I11called for SEA but it was never
carried out. According to the Panel, "the failure to perform SEA for the Power I11project was aviolation ofthe
terms and conditions under which the Board approvedthe Credit." Inthe Panel's view, this led directly to many
of the concerns relatedto the Bujagali project. Managementagreedto this shortcoming and statedthat the
rationale for not pursuing a SEA during supervisionshould havebeendocumentedand discussed. However, it
should be notedthat the project intendedto carry out a SEA, and eventhe TOR for the SEA had beenprepared
andincluded inthe project's documents.
(c) Although cumulative effects analysiswas not included inthe Bank's directives at the time, but since good
practice required such analysis,the Panelarguedthat such analysis shouldhavebeencarried out as part of the
Power I11project (Le., to assess the potential cumulative effects of various schemes under considerationat the
time). The Panel further arguedthat since the TOR for the SEA statesthat SEASare particularly suitable for
reviewing the cumulative impacts of many relative small investments which do not merit individualEA,
therefore by not doing the SEA, the Managementis not incompliance with OD 13.5 on project supervision.
(d) The Panelfurther argued that the change inthe project's configuration from original 3x34 M W to 5x40
M W was not discussed at the time ofthe Board presentationof the project andthus did not meet the
requirements of OD 10.00on InvestmentLending. The Management agreedthat there shouldhave been"a full
and frank disclosureofthis situation."

(e) The requesters also had assertedthat Power I11project was not in compliancewith OP10.04 (which was
issuedin 1994, or over two years after the project was approved), by not including the costs of externalities in
the EIRR.The Managementrespondedthat inaddition to the fact that such inclusion was not required at the
time, the cost of externalitieswere insignificant incomparisonwith the capital costs ofthe project. The Panel
agreedthat the OP 10.04didnot apply to Power I11project but nonetheless notedthat the requiredprocedures
were not observed"since the only way to c o n f i i that the magnitudesof externality costs are significant or
insignificant is to prepareand include'' the estimatedcost of externalities.


3.9      Although the Panel raised several valid points regarding procedural compliance, there
are two substantive issues. First, the Bank neglected to follow up on the sectoral
environmental assessment (SEA). The Panel found that although the Bank hadprepared the
TOR and allocated the budget, it did not implement the assessment. Second, the Bank failed
to investigate the potential cumulative effects o f other smaller schemes. Both issues, as well
as lack o f disclosure to the Board o f changes made to project configuration, further enforce
this assessment's findingregardingthe poor quality ofthe project at entry.

4. ProjectPerformanceand Outcome

Relevance

4.1       The two project objectives related to improvingthe safety o fthe existing dam and
expandingUganda's transmission and distribution system were and continue to berelevantto
the developmentpriorities o fthe country andto the Bank's country and sector strategies. One
o fthe five pillarso fUganda's most recent statement o f development priorities, the 2004 PEAP,
i s to increase investment, including inthe energy sector.

4.2       However, the key development objective-enhancing the performance o fthe now
defunct UEB-is no longer relevant. Further, it i s unclear that increasingthe generation
capacity at Owen Falls would remainrelevant to the future developmentpriorities o f the
country as the least-cost alternative. Owen Falls currently has a highlevel o f unutilized
generation capacity and it i s highlyuncertainthat the full capacity could be utilized through
the remaining economic life o f the project. Inaddition, system losses continue to be high (35-
40 percent), suggestingthat extensive rehabilitationand renovation of the system's
transmission and distribution network should inany case take precedence over further
expansion o f its capacity. (MEMD i s o f the view that capacity expansion i s o f equal
importance to system loss reduction, and the two shouldbe handledsimultaneously through
short- and medium-termmeasures.)

4.3       Consideringthe above, the overall relevance o f the project i sjudged to be modest.

Efficacy

DAMSAFETY
4.4      Improvingthe safety o f the existing Owen Falls dam was achieved. The problem
proved to be less difficult to solve than originally envisioned. The estimated cost o f this item
at appraisal was about $32 million, but the actual cost was about $10 million.

PHYSICALOBJECTIVES
4.5      Constructionof FeederCanal,ExtensionDam, andthe Spillway.This objective
was achieved. This itemwas primarily financed by the Bank. From the total amount o f $152
million disbursed by the Bank underthe project, $135 million was usedfor this component,
including for the financing o f engineering and construction supervision.

4.6      Installationof 3x34 MW Turbo-GeneratorSets andAssociated Equipment.The
configuration o f the new power plant was changed from 3x34 MW units and the associated
civil works that would have accommodated 5x34 MW units infuture, to 3x40 MW and the
civil works that would have accommodated 5x40 MW units infuture. Norway provided
cofinancing for two o f the turbines (Units 11 and 12). The units were eventually installed in
May 1998 and end-1999. However, Unit 13 was financed by Norway directly. Although it
was scheduledto be commissioned inOctober 2001,it was commissioned inMay 2002,

                                                        18


about 6 months after the project close. Dueto the low level o f Lake Victoria, Unit 13 is no
longer under the concession as its transformer is beingusedto evacuate power from a
recently installed thermal plant.

4.7      Thus, the additional generatingcapacity installed underthe project was only 2x40
MW (Units 11 and 12), and not 3x34 MW.I9This objective was therefore partially achieved.

4.8      TransmissionandDistribution.None ofthe transmission and distribution
components described inthe project appraisal report's third objective were included inthe
project. Rather, they were part o fthe program and financed directly through bilateral funding
and were completed indifferent timeframe. Therefore, it i s difficult to assumethat the
physical completion o f these components was fully achieved as a result o f the project, and as
described inthe project. The physical achievement o fthis objective therefore i s not rated.

4.9     Although one o f the objectives was partially achieved and one was not rated, the
achievement o fthe physical objectives o f the project i s assessedto be substantial due to
completion o f the civil work which was an important physical component o f the project.

DEVELOPMENTALOBJECTIVES
4.10    UEB's Performance.UEB's finances and arrears didnot improve at all underthe
project. The appraisal report provided two key financial covenants: (a) earning an annual rate
o f returno f not less than 8 percent from 1993 onward; and (b) not incurring any debt unless
UEB'snet revenue is at least 1.5 times its debt service requirements.20Neither o fthe two
covenants was met duringthe entire 10-year project implementation. Arrears climbed from
UGS 8 billion in 1991to UGS 69 billionin 1997. UEBwas dissolved mostly as the result o f
its unmanageably burdensome finances, including arrears,

4.11    Losses continued to be highthroughout the project implementation period, dropping
from 40 percent in 1990 to 36 percent in 1997, but they remained at 36 percent when the
project closed in2001. Figure2 shows the percentage o f system losses, the tariffs increases,
the arrears, andthe RORduringproject implementation.

4.12    The number of registered customers per employee did not improve duringUEB's
time. The number ofUEBemployee increased by 50 percent between 1991 and 1993.
Further,the linking ("twinning") arrangement with a utility ina "developed country" did not
prove to be effective.




19.Units 11 and 12 currently have vibration problems, as reported by the Eskom (see Annex C10).
20. The project's monitoringtargets included additional financial indicators such as operatingratio, internal
cash generationrequirement, debt-equity ratio, and current ratio. However, except for the currentratio, which
measuresthe liquidity ofthe entity, the debt-equity ratio and debt service covenant requirementsare substitutes,
and therefore do not have to be usedtogether. Likewise, the operatingratio and net internal cash generationare
both revenue-typecovenants, similar to the rate of return. Thus, the principal financial covenants basically were
the ROR and DSCR.

                                                      19


  4.13      Increasing access. The total electrification rate inUgandai s about 4 percent, with
  about 1percent o fthe rural populations having access to electricity." The increase inthe
. number o f connections duringthe 10 years o fproject implementation averaged about 5
  percent. The number o f customers increased from 130,000 in 1991 to 165,000 in 1997 and
  200,000 in2001. The increase was mainly inthe number o f urban consumers. Whentaking
  into account the persistent losses, including nontechnical losses, and the current
  underutilization o f generation capacity, while connections have increased at 4-5 percent
  annually, the effective increase inaccess to electricity as the result o f the project was
  marginal. The government's target i s a 10percent electrification rate by 2012. However, this
  i s not likely to be achieved because it implies doubling the number of connections over the
  next six years, or adding about 50,000 connections per year, or twice the current rate-
  providedthe generation capacity would be available.

  4.14      Insummary,the achievement ofthe developmental objectives ofthe projectwas
  negligible. Therefore, despite some achievement o fphysical objectives, the overall efficacy
  o f the project i s rated as modest.

  Efficiency

  4.15      The efficiency o fthe project inmeeting its development objectives is negligible. The
  project failed to achieve any o f its critical efficiency objectives-improvement       inUEB's
  finances and operating and management capability, reductions inthe high system losses, and
  increased collection o f arrears. The improvement inUEB's finances fell significantly short o f
  targets to the extent that the entity was dissolved, the system losses did not decline, and the
  arrears increased.

  4.16      Further,the project suffered significant delays anda substantial cost overrun. The
  project's original closing date was June 1997 but it closed on December 2001, more than four
  years after the original closing date. Dueto the inadequate qualifications o f the main civil
  works contractor, and the resultingrebiddingo f the contract, the cost o fthe civil work
  contract increased by $26 million.

  4.17      With regard to economic analysis, the calculation (or recalculation) o fthe EIRR
  would not be meaningful. Ifit was based on current level o f asset utilization, the EIRRwould
  be significantly below the opportunity cost o f capital. Also, the future use o fthe project's
  assets i s not certain given the uncertainty surrounding the future water level o f Lake Victoria.
  The appraisal report provided an EIRR o f 16.5 percent, assuming a benefit stream
  corresponding to the sales o f electricity generatedby 3x34 MW units (102 MW),22as well as
  assuming substantial decrease insystem losses. However, at the time o f the assessment
  mission the project assets were significantly underutilized, and only 120 MW from a total o f
  380 MW installed capacity was beingused.Although units 11 and 12 (part o fthe project)
  were inoperations and generating a share o f the120 MW, the two unitscould theoretically be

  22. An emergency diesel unit was assumedto be the standby.

                                               20


considered redundant-since    the 120MW capacity couldbe met by the original 10units.
Since this implicitly questions the rationale for the Kiira Power Station project, MEMD inits
comments dated June 13, 2008 (see Annex C) clarified that the main consideration for
increasingthe capacity at Kiira was the physical condition o f the Nalubaale Power Station.
MEMDindicatedthat the 1997Hydropower Development Master Plangave Nalubaale a life
expectancy o f 25 years given its huge cracks and the movement o f concrete which affects the
alignment of the shafts. MEMD further clarified that the Kiira Power Station (base load
plant)i s a new installationmeant to replace the the ageing Nalubaale Power Station (peaking
power plant).

Outcome

4.18    Based on the foregoing assessment of relevance, efficacy, and efficiency the outcome
o fthe project i s rated unsatisfactory.

                                                      22


4.19    The quality o fthe project at entry was highly unsatisfactory, and the shortcomings o f
its design affected its implementation. Few substantive actions were taken during
implementation period to remedy the shortcomings. Moreover, it i s unlikely that the
shortcomings o f this project will be reversedor mitigated infuture ina manner sufficiently to
alter the outcome o f the project.

4.20    The designo fthe project was only modestly relevant to its developmentobjectives,
focusing almost entirely on constructing an extensiondam and achieving financial soundness
for UEB. Considering the highlevel o f systemlosses and UEB's substantial inefficiency, the
design should have focused more on reducinglosses and enhancing the overall performance
o f UEB rather than focusing primarily on improving its finances.

4.21    The efficacy o fthe project was modest. Some o fthe key development objectives o f
the operationwere not achieved at all. O fthose that were achieved, most ofthem physical
outputs, some were only partially achieved. The extent to which the objectives were achieved
efficiently i s negligible, since the system losses continued to be high.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

4.22    The Risk to Development Outcome i s significant because o f two related uncertainties
that the project faces over its remaining economic life. The first i s the uncertainty associated
withthe future hydrological behavior o fLake Victoria, andhence the water level andthe
usable generation capacity. On October 21,2006, the lake reached its lowest level since 1923
(at approximately 10.41 meters). Except for some brief intervals, the water level has been
continuously dropping since its highestlevel in 1961-64, andthe drop has particularly been
steep since 1999 (Figure 1). Although there has been a slight recovery very recently (the
result o f unusual rains in late 2006), the drop inthe lake level has been persistent. The
government first set the discharge level at equivalent o f 135 MW generation capacity (850
cubic meters per second) but inAugust 2006 hadto reduce it to 750 cubic meters per second,
equivalent to 120 MW o f continuous capacity.23Infact, Unit 13 has been withdrawn from the
concessionaire for a period o ftwo years to use its transformers to evacuate the power
generated from the recently installed 50 MW thermal plant. It i s uncertain whether the lake
level could rise enough to ensure the viability o f the project for the remainder o f its economic
life. This assessment concludes that there i s significant risk that the water level will not rise
enough to allow utilization of the project's assets as originally envisioned. However, inits
comments (see Annex C), MEMD indicated that a very low level for Lake Victoria and a
returnto the low hydrology ofthe 1900-1960period should not be assumed, given(a) the
paucity o f authoritative literature that can predict with a high degree o f certainty what the
lake's hydrology will be inthe next half century and (b) the protracted drought o f 2003-2006
which also affected Tanzania, Rwandaand Kenya.

4.23    The second uncertainty facing the project is the financial viability of the sector. To
meet the electricity demand when the lake level i s low, the country has to rely on thermal

23. Because o fthe peak and off-peak variations inelectricity demand, the capacity use changes between 70
MW and 145 MW.

                                                  23


power generation, as currently i s the case (50 MW Aggreko Iand 11). The cost o f thermal
generation inUganda i s high, and its mix with hydropower raises the level o f tariff. The
current tariff at about 18 cents per kWhi s already high.Considering the prevailing poverty,
any further tariff increase would exacerbate the affordability issue, resulting ineither much
lower rate o f electrification, or higher nontechnical losses due to increase inthe number o f
unregistered customers. This would further undermine the finances o f the sector. Giventhe
current concession contracts for generation and distribution, which are linkedto the volume
o f electricity sold andthe level of tariff, the government would have to assume substantial
financial liabilities.

4.24    These uncertainties presentsignificant risksto the operation o f the project assets over
its remaining economic life. The nature o f these risks i s such that it i s difficult to implement
cost-effective measures to mitigate or avoid them.

Bank's Performance

4.25     Quality at Entry. The quality at entry is ratedhighly unsatisfactory based on
unrealistic expectations on the financial improvement of UEB,inadequate analysis o f risks
andthe lack o freadiness o fthe project for approval (see paras 2.10 onwards).

4.26    Quality of Supervision.The Bank put inconsiderable efforts duringsupervision,
given the number o f issues related to the quality o f the project at entry, which consumed
substantial supervision time. The supervision missions were regular, frequent, and well
documented (Annex 11). The mission team aggressively followed up with the issues before
them, and management was regularly informed ofthe issues. Management also actively
participated intrying to resolve issues such as arrears, UEB's finances and poor performance,
and project delays. Particularly notable was the Bank's encouragement of sector reforms,
though those efforts came towardthe end o f the project with most o f the reform-related
activities taking place under the Power IV project.

4.27    There were two areas inwhich the Bank's performance during supervisionfell short.
First, the supervision focused on implementingthe project "as is." No innovative measures
were introduced to restructure the project, or formally change its objectives to mitigate or
remedythe project's poor quality at entry. Evenafter six years o fimplementation, and
continuously poor financial performance of UEB, poor collection records, and highlosses, no
consideration was given to restructuringthe project, or to a comprehensive midterm review.
Second, the Bank cleared the prequalification o f a civil works contractor who hadto be
terminated due to inadequate qualifications. Althoughthe borrower (and inthis case, its
engineering consultants) bears responsibility for contractor prequalification, the Bank should
have more carefully scrutinizedthe qualifications o fthe contractor and shouldhave
expedited the rebidding process.

4.28    The quality o f the Bank's supervisionperformance duringthe implementationo f the
project is rated moderately satisfactory. However, due to poor quality o f the project at entry
and its impact on project outcome, the Bank's overall performance for the project period as a
whole (1991-2001) i s assessedto be unsatisfactory.

                                               24


Borrower Performance

4.29     The government raisedthe tariff twice, approximately within the timeframe agreed
withthe Bank, thoughit did not take the final step of increasing it by 5 percent annually in
real terms. By then it hadbecome obvious to all parties that tariff increases were not enough
to overcome UEB's poor performance. Further,the government helped to improve the
finances o f UEB by converting $40 million o f its loan to UEB into equity. Also, the
government, within its capacity, facilitated the resolution of key implementationissues and
its relationships with the donors were cooperative. However, the government did not provide
the enabling environment to improve the collection o f arrears-particularly   the 10-15 percent
owed to UEB by government ministries and parastatals. Thus, the government's overall
performance duringproject preparation and implementationi s ratedmoderately
unsatisfactory.

4.30     Some o fthe same points apply to UEB, the implementing agency. Although UEB did
not meet the agreed financial covenants, the arrears were mostly the product o f an unrealistic
tariff. Nonetheless, UEB shouldhave raised concerns about (or rejected) the unrealistic
financial covenants at the time o f loannegotiations. Hadthe lessons o f the Power I1project
been taken into account, it would have been obvious that UEBcould not have met the
financial covenants underthe Power I11project. While it can be argued that UEB must also
bear some responsibility for misjudgingthe qualifications o f the first civil works contractor,
which resultedinsubstantial delay and cost overrun, it was difficult for UEB itself, givenits
weak institutional capacity, to conduct a detailed prequalificationanalysis, a task that should
have beenconducted by its engineeringconsultants. Takingthese factors into account, the
performance o f the implementing agency duringthe preparation and implementation o f the
project i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

4.3 1    Overall Borrower performance i s thus ratedmoderately unsatisfactory duringthe
project's implementation period.

Monitoring and Evaluation

4.32     The project hadno formal requirement for monitoring and evaluation. To the extent
that M&E was carried out during implementation, it was only partial. Further, as shown in
the appraisal report, the monitoring guidelinesprovided indicators for the periodbetween
1990 and 1995 but the project closed inDecember 2001. Therefore, for half of the project's
implementationperiod there were no monitoring or performance targets. With the dissolution
o f UEB, many o f the indicators were rendered meaningless. The losses and RORare shown
inFigure2.

5.     Lessons and Perspectives

Lessons

5.1    The lessons emerging from this assessmentare as follows:

    9 Power sector reformsneedto bevery country-specific inorder to produce improved
       sector performance and increased access to electricity by the poor. The Bank's power
       sector policy and lending strategies o f the1990s, with their strong emphasis on
       unbundlingandprivatization, didnot leadto better performance ofthe sector and
       increased access, becausethey were not applied with due consideration to the
       country's characteristics.
    9 Privatesector participationinmajorpower projectscancreate significant contingent
       liabilities for the governments. Therefore, the Bank needs to encourage and help
       governments to develop an appropriate framework for risk sharingwith the private
       sector.
    9 Riskanalysis needsto be subject to awide array ofsensitivitiesto potentialrisks,
       rather than measuringthe sensitivity only with respect to changes inthe economic
       rate o f return.
    9 The Bankneedsto accept some responsibility for contractor prequalification. Insome
       cases, the Bank might be better off usingthe services o f outside consulting firms
    >  rather than relying on its own expertise.
       The project restructuring andmidterm review ininfrastructureprojects should be
       usedmore liberally, considering that most infrastructureprojects have long
       implementationperiods during which the original objectives and project

   >   configuration could change.
       Conditions for effectiveness and disbursement need to be minimized. Inthe event that
       a condition for disbursement i s necessary, design o fthe condition needs to be such
       that failure to meet it does not delay project implementation or jeopardize the
       project's overall viability.

Perspectives

5.2    The options available to Uganda's power sector over the next 15 to 20 years are
mostly unattractive. The sector i s tangled ina complex set o f issues that will take
considerable time and effort to overcome. Further, the trade-offs among various alternatives
have substantial economic, social, and environmental implications. Against this overall
dismal picture, however, it should be noted that there are generation projects at different
stages o f development, namely the Bujagali project, a 50-MW heavy fuel oil plantto be
commissionedin October 2008, andthe Kaiso Tonya 50-MW plant based on locally
produced oil that i s due for commissioning in2010.

5.3    Uganda's endowment o f commercial energy resources i s very limited. The
exploitation o f its hydro resources i s capital-intensive, subject to interruption by drought, and

                                                   26


 influenced by environmental and social factors. The importation o f petroleum fuels i s very
 expensive and any thermal-based power generation would result ina very hightariff.
Therefore, when the hydro-based generation i s supplemented with thermal-based, as
currently i s the case, the cost o f electricity supply becomes expensive. Evenifthe entire
generation i s hydro-based, the cost o ftransmission and distribution i s still high, considering
(i) poorconditionsofthetransmissionanddistributionassets,withtechnicallosses
    the
ranging from 15-35 percent (average o f 17percent), and (ii)          characteristics o f the residential
consumers, most o f whom (88 percent) are rural, have low consumption levels, and who
require lengthytransmission lines far from the load center. While the incremental cost o f
only the distribution connections for each consumer ranges from $100-$150, the average
revenue from a typical rural household i s inthe order o f $2-$3 per month.

5.4      Uganda i s still one o f the poorest countries inSub-Saharan Africa and the cost o f
electric power i s out o f reach for many o f its people. Despite its strong economic
performance over the past two decades andpoverty reduction achievements, poverty remains
a persistent problem particularly inthe rural areas. With income per capita o f only $280, the
average tariff inUganda i s currently 18 cents per kWh, compared with average tariff o f 9
cents per kWhinthe United States. Considering that the average consumption ina residential
household in2006 was 1,090 kWh, the share o fthe electricity expense as percentage o f
income ina typical householdi s 12-13 percent, compared with 2 percent inthe United
States.24When the electricity cost represents such a highshare o f the income ina poor
population, it results inhigharrears and highnontechnical losses (17-20 percent), and slows
the electrificationrate.

5.5      The highcost o f supply and the low level o f affordability are further complicated by
the major constraint on power production-the         low level o f water inLake Victoria, partly
due to persistent drought andpartlybecause of increasingwater drawdown for power
generation. The challenge therefore i s to supply electricity to a population whose average
income per capita i s about 4 percent o f the world average income per capita, and at a price
which i s about twice the average world price. Policy makersface a daunting task: ifthe high
tariff is passed on to consumers, a large segment o fthe population cannot afford to pay; ifit
i s not passed on, thenthe government has to undertake huge financial burdens, either directly
or through the private sector, to subsidize the sector.

5.6      There have been substantial discussions regarding the role o fthe private sector to
alleviate these problems. However, it i s unrealistic to expect the private sector to invest in
Uganda's power sector without shifting almost all risks to the government. Private investors
so far have shown little interest inUganda's power sector. Duringthe IO-year project
implementation period (1991-200l),       the foreign direct investment rose from $50 million to
$250 million, but mostly related to projects for food and agro industries. Despite enactment
o f an electricity law, establishment o f an energy regulatory authority, and privatization o f
generation and distribution, the power sector has attracted only a few investors. Infact, there
was only one serious bidder for the concession contract. Evenat that, the nature o f both

24. The governmentsubsidizesthe first 15 kWhat 3 cents per kWh. Consideringthe balance at 16 cents per
kWhandthe fixed monthly of about $1.1,the averagetariff is still is about 16 cents per kWh.

contracts i s such that the government has to bear significant costs (estimated at $400-$450
million over the next four to five years) to sustain the power supply.

5.7     Itis outside the scope ofthis assessmentto provide detailed discussions regarding
above issues or a future strategy for the sector. However, to pave the way for a viable, well-
performing power sector inUganda, elements o f a strategy could include:

     9 Reducingthe systemlosses.Giventhe current highleveloflosses, thiswould provide
        50 MW to 60MW o f capacity. Inaddition, reducingthe nontechnical losses would
     >  sendthe correct signal to the nonpaying consumers.
        Expanding off-grid rural electrification, along the lines of some o fthe components o f
        the ongoing Energyfor Rural Transformation project (independent grid connection
        and photovoltaics), but without the expectation o f vast private sector parti~ipation.~~
        Other sources of concessionary financing should be pursued including substantial
        contribution by IDA.
     9 Developmentofacascade-type hydroproject suchas Bujagali or Karuma, basedon
        (i)comprehensiveandrigorousmultisectoralstudytoaddresstheoptimum
            a
        utilization of Lake Victoria; and (ii)     a realistic framework for risk sharingbetween
        the government and the private sector; and (iii)        a transparentPPA which would be
        publicly disclosed at the initial stages o f the project.
     9 Creating acadre ofexperts (inenergyeconomics, financing, markets,pricing,
        forecasting, and institutional aspects) to support policy makers. With the
        concessionaires taking over the distribution and generation functions, and UEDCL
        andUEGCL virtually having ceasedto exist, the know-how andthe expertise have
        beendispersed. The M O E does not have the capability to address the various energy-
        related issues to ensure its value added involvement.
     9 Bringingexpectations regardingthe power sector's performance inlinewith
        Uganda's context, with respect to social, economic, and sectoral indicators.
     9 Preparing acoherent, free-standingjoint (betweenthe GOUandthe Bank) energy
        sector strategy for Uganda that could be renewed periodically.
     P Conducting a detailedassessment ofthe performance ofthe Power IV project.

The following comprises the components o f the UEB's development program for 1992 -1996, as
provided inthe APPRAISAL REPORT.

(1) a canal-fed extension o f power generating facilities at the Owen Falls site consisting o f three 34
MW units, a double circuit 132 kV transmission line linkingit to the rest o f the UEB grid; the canal
will have a throughput capacity o f 4,200 cubic meters o fwater per second, and with gates at its down-
stream will have the capacity to draw-down the lake inthe event o f heavy rains to ensure that the
Owen Falls dam is not overtopped;

(2) the employment by the UEBo f consultants and a panel o f dam experts to advise on the condition
and steps required to strengthen the existing Owen Falls dam;

(3) measures to strengthen the Owen Falls dam;

(4) a structured rehabilitation, by UEB staff, usingmainly indigenous poles to replace unsound ones,
o f the existing 132 kV transmission line from Kampalavia Kabulasoke to Masaka, and a supply and
erect contract for a new (285 km) 132 kV transmission line from Masaka via Mbararato the western
region including the Hima cement factory, together with substation reinforcements at Masaka, and a
new 132 kVl33 kV substation at Mbarara;

(5) institution-building activities including a training workshop and provision o f associated training
equipment, a 4-year technical assistance link with an established overseas electricity utility to provide
training and experience inthe areas o f operations, financial control, management systems, and
modem methods of routine maintenance, and training, other technical assistance and in-house and
overseas training for UEB employees;

(6) supply and erect contracts for the rehabilitationo ftransmission and distribution systems and
substations at 132 kV, 33 kV and 11kV on the UEB grid throughout the country;

(7) support to the Ministryo f Energy including interventions in the household energy sector;

(8) rehabilitationo f the fabric o f two o f UEB'sbuildings-its head-office and the Owen Falls power
station;

(9) electrificationo f selected rural and semi-urban areas resultingfrom the recommendations o fthe
recently completed National Electrification Planning Study;

(10) an environmental impact review o fUganda's least-cost hydroelectric plan;

(11) an engineering design for the next hydro site to be developed inUganda's least cost power
development plan; and

(12) a study to pre-feasibility level o f hydroelectric sites with medium-sized (about 10 MW) capacity.

Annex B7-World Bank Statement on LakeVictoria
Water Level

March 16,2006-The        World Bank is concerned about the decrease in Lake Victoria's water level.
This is a very complex situation, given the environmental, social and economic importance o fLake
Victoria, the prolongedperiod o f regional drought, and significant hydropower shortfalls throughout
the region.
Recent reports, including a report o f the East African Community (EAC) Regional Technical
Working Group in January 2006, as well as Bank analysis o f available data, attribute the falling water
levels to the extended 3-year period o f drought inthe region and over abstraction o f water for power
generation. The Bank continues to work with partner states on improving water management, and
addressing the prevailing power shortages as a matter o f urgency.
Water management: Through the regional Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project
(LVEMP) and the Nile Basin Initiative, the Bank is supporting improved environmental management
o fthe Lake Victoria and the Nile basin. Specifically, LVEMP has assisted the countries to:

         better measure stocks o f fish
         reduce infestation o f water hyacinth to manageable levels through biological and other
         controls
         understand issues o f hydrology o f the lake and water quality
         react appropriately to a temporary ban on exports o f fish imposed by the EU
         improve the livelihoods o f selected lakeside communities through micro-investments,
         lay the foundation for enhanced regional management o f the lake through establishment o f
         the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

Partner states-   Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya-       continue to monitor the Lake levels and are
implementing short term measures recommended by water experts. On World Bank advice, these
countries commissioned a situational analysis o f Lake Victoria and its catchment hydrology and
meteorological regimes, which was discussed by a technical working group in January 2006. Heads
o f State will come together on April 5 to discuss this critical issue. The World Bank will continue to
provide technical support to this process. Affected countries are also looking to establish regional
mechanisms for more effective water management, expected to be supported by a second phase o f the
Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project. Inaddition, there are World Bank projects under
preparation that will contributeto better water management in upper catchments close to the Lake,
thereby benefiting the Lake indirectly.
Power: The World Bank has proposed to assist countries for the loss o f hydro-power, by installation
o f thermal and gas as well as accelerating regional interconnectivity. The quickest wins will come
from improving overall efficiency and performance, followed by environmentally sustainable
investments in least-cost generation and relatedtransmission and distribution. Inparallel, the World
Bank i s helping countries meet the energy needs o f unserved rural populations.
To respondto the prevailing energy situation inthe region, the Bank and other partners are discussing
a number o f options with the affected Governments, including:

         procurement o f short-term generation capacity;
         institutingmeasures for accelerated efficiency in electricity transmission and distribution,
         with the objective o freducingpower losses; and
         the development o f longer term, least-cost power generation.

Backround

Installationsat Kiira Power station constitutes the major equipment installed underpower 111.
ItincludesGenerating sets of Units 11and 12, all civil works, the water control equipment
Gantry cranes and the power house crane. Also included is the switch gear, the overhead
powertransmission line and the booms; Trash booms, safety booms and the water Hyacinth
booms at the source o fthe Nile. All this equipment was commissioned by year August 2000.
This report the effectiveness o fperformance o fthis equipments and highlightsonly defects
which are regarded as major and or reported during guarantee period. The report describes
the performance o fequipment inthe order inwhich the equipmentwas commissioned.

Gantry Cranes
The gantry cranes were almost the first to be commissioned. The first failure was reported on
the powerhouse crane when it failed to lift turbineequipment duringfirst date o finstallation.
The problem was identifiedas defective control systemand was solved by replacement ofthe
complete electrical controls. Both intake and tail race gantry crane operations have been
characterized with multiplefailures. One cannot be sure o ftheir continuous operation during
any one activity. Below are major defects registeredon each o f this equipment;
-       Intake gantry crane
Thiscranederailedlatein2002 dueto astrongstorm. Its frame was deformedandwas repaired.
Frequent trip of the control circuit during operation, no loss o f any component has been
experienced as yet.
-       Tail race gantry crane
Loss o fwindingo fthe two traverse travel electric motorswas registered inNovember2004. The
motor winding burnt due to malfunctiordingress o f water and moisture.
-       Power house crane
Only failure of the gear box seal was recorded and breakage o f the 2 Ton wire rope have been
recorded.
-      Mechanicalservices
These are equipment installedto facilitate proper station drainage, ventilation, compressed air
and water supply, sanitation and fire fighting. The performance is good apart from defects
indicated.
-      Dewateringand drainage system
Failureo fthe stationpumpwas registered in2000. Thepumpwas replacedwith a spare one and
thefailedonehaditswindingrewoundlocally. Dewateringpumponehashadfailureofthe shaft

by shear twice in both case the shaft was renewed. The microprocessor o f the complete
dewatering mode also failed last quarter o f 2004.

Generator Transformer
All are running at relatively hightemperatures. One o f the disc insulations on Unit 11,Blue
Phase on 132KV side was shutteredinAugust 2005.

The turbine
The turbine operation i s good. The turbine consists o f the Governor system, Wicket gate
apparatus, the runner andthe imbeddedparts.The followingdefects havebeenregisteredonthe
turbine.
-       Runner
Loss ofprotective paint coating onthe turbinepartsandwicket apparatus was observed onboth
Unit 11and 12in2002 duringguarantee inspection.
Extensive damage o f the lower turbine cover due to cavitation observed during inspection of
Unit 12Shaft
-       inAugust 2006..
               seal cooling system
The shaft seal pump couplings have registered failure and have beenreplacedtwice.

The generator
The generator i s composed o f the stator winding, the rotor, 11 KV switch gear, the excitation
equipment andall the associated protectionand Control equipment.

The VIMOS
The VIMOS equipment (vibration monitoring) on Unit 12 i s completely failed.
-      Excitation equipment
The field switches o f both Units 11 and 12 are under rated and failure o f the copper bars has
beenrecorded. Failure o f the Transducers is beingexperienced to date.

The 11KV circuit breaker of Unit 12 exploded inNovember 2005,

Water control eauipment
Water control equipment consists o f all the spillway gates, stop logs, emergency control gates
and trash racks. Major problems have beenencountered especially with the gate controls. The
workmanship was poor, the components look old and all control panels are not water proof.
Specific defect are highlighted below.
-      Emergency control gates
Multiple failures of the electrical components have been experienced. The Main a/c supply
contacts have burnttwice onUnit 12.BothUnit 11and 12eachhave losteachabrakeclutchdue
to burning. The hoist rope on Unit 12 passage4 rolled over the drum inNovember 2004.
-      Spillway gates
One contactor was lost during its operation.
Generally all the gates have lost the protective paint.

                                               55                                     Annex B

-       Booms
The booms consistoftrashbooms, safety booms andwater Hyacinthbooms at the source o fthe
Nile. The performance has not beenreliable especially for the water Hyacinthbooms. Specific
defects recorded are indicated below;
-       Trashbooms
Failure o f the boom clamps was registered. The wire rope is rusty shall require replacement.
-       Safetv booms
Has broken three times. The boom link fatteners are necked and rusted, resulting into joint
failure due to bolt shear.
-       Water hyacinthbooms
Completely failed, All the booms have broken off at some stage or the other. The wire rope i s
broken. All the wire rope i s rusty and has hardly worked for 5 years.

Failure o f equipment due to normal aging or lack of maintenance i s expected, however the
equipment which was suppliedunderOFE 5, has exhibitedfailure rightfrom the commissioning
stage. Itnow appearsnormal to operated inthis "ABNORMAL" operation. The steel wire ropes
for bothtrash andwater Hyacinthbooms are of inferior quality, in5 years time o foperationthey
are all rusty. In fact the one for water Hyacinth booms is broken and they are all due for
replacement.

    102MVi (3 x 34     MW:i to 201) h1W     i5 x 4U MW) was the 3hyi cill condition of
