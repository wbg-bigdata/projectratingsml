F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main purpose of the project (prepared as a LIL) is to test the effectiveness and
sustainability of a development learning centre in Kenya as part of a global knowledge-
sharing network to strengthen the capacity of public, private and civil society decision
makers and implementers to design, plan, and manage social and economic development
policies and programs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The newly revised Project Development Objective aims to improve the capacity of public
servants, private individuals and institutions in specific public sector management areas
targeted by the development learning center (DLC).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

A Distance Learning Center (DLC) was a new concept for Kenya. The Center was
intended to offer a wide variety of training to build the capacity of the state and support
the country’s development efforts, promote peer-to-peer learning on policy
implementation through sharing of experiences with other countries and serve a larger
audience, including civil society and the private sector.            Through the Global
Development Learning Network (GDLN), the Center was expected to reach a larger
number of civil servants, and other stakeholders in the country at lower cost than
traditional face-to face training; thus expanding impact and reach. The Center’s internet
services, rare in the public service, would complement the video, audio, and data services
to deliver course material, to allow virtual discussion and e-mail and World Wide Web
access. The Center would strive to match demand for training to the most appropriate
local or international supplier institutions, both in terms of content and schedule of
availability. It would also bring into the country a unique regional and global live
interaction amongst policy makers from other countries, disciplines, and sectors,
regardless of national boundaries or time zones. The Center would serve to support the
World Bank operations in the region by providing ICT services for project
implementation. It would serve as a one-stop-shop for south–south knowledge exchange
services. The Government was keen to pilot this new knowledge tool as a means of
promoting capacity development and enhancing regional and international policy and
strategy dialogue.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The main purpose of the project (prepared as a LIL) was to test the effectiveness and
sustainability of a Development Learning Center (DLC) in Kenya as part of a global
knowledge-sharing network to strengthen the capacity of public, private and civil society
decision makers and implementers to design, plan, and manage social and economic
development policies and programs. The project was approved on October 17, 2003 for
a grant in the amount of US$2.7 million (H0650-KE) and was signed on November 10,
2003. The project became effective on February 2, 2004 and was scheduled to close on
December 31, 2008. However, the project closed on December 31, 2011, three years
after the original scheduled closing date.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
In October 19, 2007, the project was restructured (See Report No. 41179-KE). The
restructuring led to a new PDO “to improve the capacity of public servants and private
individuals and institutions in specific public sector management areas targeted by the
DLC (See Annex 9, Table 1 for original PDO).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The target group of the DLC as indicated in the original PAD was: “Decision makers
from the public sector and civil servants in general?. The target beneficiaries were


                                            1
revised in the restructured paper as: “public servants, private individuals and institutions
in specific public sector management areas targeted by the development learning center?.

1.5 Original Components

The project had three components:
   (i)     Construction and Installation
   (ii)    DLC Operations Support
   (iii) Monitoring and Evaluation

Component 1 aimed at setting-up the institutional, physical and human resource
requirements for the DLC.

   •   Construction of facilities for the DLC, including: (a) a video-conference room
       (30-person capacity) (b) a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations
       (hardware, software and Internet hook-up); (c) technical and administrative
       center; and (d) electrical and telephone installation.

   •   Purchase and installation of equipment, including: (a) a small aperture terminal
       (VSAT – satellite communication terminal) (b) video, telecommunications, and
       microprocessor equipment; (c) office and classroom furniture; and (d) equipment
       for operations and security.

Component 2 aimed at assisting the DLC with (i) institutional arrangements; (ii)
business planning; (iii) stakeholders/training institutions/development partners; (iv)
training courses; (v) development of a M&E system, (vi) promotion of efficient use of
resources; and (vii) reporting.

Component 3 aimed at setting up a Monitoring and Evaluation system that will assess
the impact of the project.

1.6 Revised Components
The project components were not revised. However, just as the components, the sub-
components were broad and unclear. It is unclear what the performance indicators were
measuring. The ICR team spent a great deal of time discussing some sub-components and
found them confusing for a pilot project of which the Government had no prior
experience in implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes
In October 19, 2007, the project was restructured leading to an amendment of the project
development objective (PDO) to better articulate the project’s specific intention, scope
and results. The revised PDO was to: “(i) improve the capacity of public servants, and
private individuals and institutions in specific public sector management areas targeted
by the development learning center; (ii) revise the results framework indicators to
improve alignment with PDO and project activities; and (iii) specify the project years
eligible under IDA’s decreasing financing for operating costs?. Part B, category 4(b) was



                                             2
revised as follows: “80% up to June 30, 2008; 60% from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009;
and 40% thereafter; and (iv) extend the closing date of the project by 18 months from
December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2010, in order to allow sufficient time to achieve the
project’s objective? (See Development Grand Agreement Number H065KE; and Project
Paper H065-KE, Report No. 41179-KE). The project’s results framework (PRF) was
also revised as follows:
        •       At least 75 % of participants should be satisfied that, their capacity in
                specific public sector management areas has improved following the
                course (PDO) outcome indicator;
        •       At least 75% of participants are satisfied with the quality of the range of
                services and facilities offered at the DLC (construction and installation of
                facilities component, component A);
        •       The DLC achieves 100% cost recovery of its operating costs (DLC
                operations support component, Part B); and
        •       At least 80% of adjustments considered and/or incorporated in the
                program are based on the M&E feedback received on each of the Project’s
                results indicators (M&E component, Part C).

(See Annex 9, Table 1- for the original PRF). In addition to the above, the project
closing date was also extended for 18 months. The reasons indicated for the extension
were to allow additional time, given the investments already made, to achieve the project
objective. Before restructuring of the project, 50 percent of the grant amount has been
disbursed; and building and registration of the center has been achieved.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation: Since the Kenya DLC project is similar to past and on-going DLC
operations in other African countries, the project design took into account lessons learned
from eight countries in Africa and in more than 15 DLCs centers around the world. In
Africa, lessons were taken from the DLCs in Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda, including
visits to the Tanzania and Senegal DLC facilities.

A series of consultations with other donors (UNAIDS, WHO, EU, DANIDA, DFID,
UNDP, Fad and GTZ.) and human resources departments within key ministries (Ministry
of Education, Ministry of Communication and Ministry of Finance were also carried out
in different phases of project preparation. The following issues were raised during project
preparation: "The project team will have to give careful attention to ensuring that civil
servants have sufficient access to the DLC’s training, especially in light of the DLC
prices for training, which are relatively higher than the prices for training offered by local
civil service training institutions, and the Government’s low training budget allocations.

Use of Project Preparation Facility (PPF): A PPF of US$ 150,000 was used to fund
various types of preparatory activities, such as (1) consultant services and training
(Market study, including needs assessment, conducting of a legal study to establish the


                                              3
DLC as an independent entity, preparing Architectural designs, Initiating M&E system
and training, preparing Project Implementation Manual and Manual of Procedures,
Installation of a Procurement and Financial management system, Study Tour (within
Africa) by the project coordinator and the architect to an established DLC); (2) Purchase
of equipment & software; and (3) Operating costs for the Project Coordination. March 7,
2003 was specified as the last date for the withdrawal, use, and repayment of the PPF.

The project development objectives (PDOs) as stated in the original project appraisal
document (PAD) were broad, vague, ambitious and unrealistic. There was inconsistency
between the original PDOs in the PAD and in the Credit Agreement (CA) and the same is
true for the performance indicators. The project team, on the Government side, had
difficulties translating these PDOs into intermediate and concrete short-term outcomes.
The PAD does not give any indication of how the expected outcomes could be
integrated/and or mainstreamed into policy reform processes. There were no short term,
medium term and long term performance indicators. In addition, the indicators were
only quantitative, very difficult to measure and, most importantly, not appropriate
to assess the overall impact of the project on capacity development and
strengthening, which was stated as the overall objective of the project.


Project Design: The design of the project was based on a model developed during the
GDLN Program Pilot Phase (2000-2002). It was envisioned that, the DLC in Nairobi
would be part of Anglophone African Development Learning Network (AADLN)
including Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. In combination, these four centers
would benefit from a close relationship with the World Bank Institute (WBI) Global
Development Learning Network (GDLN) Secretariat in Washington, D.C. Although the
project design rightly assessed capacity building needs of the country, demand for the use
of the center was underestimated. The center was designed to only accommodate: (a) a
video-conference room 30-person capacity; and (b) a computer room outfitted for 30
computer stations. However, two years after the center became operational, and by the
close of the project, over 70-person participants were attending training courses on a
typical day. In addition, the construction did not make provision for handicap access; and
not equipped with enough rooms (offices, rest rooms, and dining facilities) to
accommodate the number of participants visiting the center. Due to lack of space and
low seating capacity, KDLC had to reject some of the participants and/or use KIA
facilities resulting in lost revenue for the center. Additionally, there was insufficient time
between the construction phase and the start-up of operations. The design did not take
into account that it is only after the completion of construction and start of operations that
the outcome indicators could be measured.

Although it was a LIL, the project lacked an M&E framework, even though an M&E was
proposed in component 3 of the project. Given that LILs are by nature pilot projects to
“test new approaches?, M&E is critical to assess the success of pilot projects and draw on
lessons for future operations. A few concrete objectives and indicators of success should
have been defined so as to allow building a knowledge base for future similar operations.
The “one size fits all? approach should have been avoided. Evaluations of other DLC



                                              4
projects in the region have confirmed that LIL’s are not the right instrument for the
establishment of DLC’s in Africa. The construction of isolated centers contradicts the
principles of supporting public sector capacity development and of building capacity of
state institutions dedicated to capacity development like the schools of public
administration.


2.2 Implementation
Several issues directly affected project implementation resulting in three years delay in
project completion. Specifically, project implementation was affected by: (i) delays in
procurement of civil works, component 1 - construction of the DLC and Installation of
equipment due to: (ii) market shortages of building materials, inappropriate building
specifications and standards; (iii) delays in procurement of specialized equipment
(Computers, Video Conference Equipments) (iv) MSPS took far too long to evaluate
designs, purchase local inputs, etc. in part due to an ongoing reform in procurement
throughout the government. Some of the equipment changed, and in few cases, some
components were no longer being manufactured; and (iv) transition from the World Bank
Information Solutions Group (ISG) to private connectivity service providers of GDLN
Centers in Africa (par 1.7). It took twenty four months of delay in the selection of a
new operator after ISG decided not to continue to support GDLN centers in Africa but to
transfer the service to the Association of African Distance Learning Centers (AADLC).

Specifically, the major causes of this delay were:

   1. From 1999 to 2003, ISG provided a comprehensive package of services to support
      DLCs. This comprised (i) the design, purchase and installation of the technical
      equipment in DLC’s and (ii) the bandwidth and maintenance of the satellite link
      was carried out through a contract that the Bank has with its satellite service
      providers. This arrangement was an exception to the rules of the Bank. The
      waiver that supported this exception expired in 2003 which meant that ISG could
      no longer purchase the equipment or provide satellite services to the upcoming
      DLCs. In order to help the GDLN Program in Africa, ISG and GSD launched in
      2003 through ICB which identified a potential vendor that could replace ISG by
      providing one component of the package of services, namely, the purchase and
      installation of the equipment. The company CIBER (a US based firm with office
      in McLean, Virginia) was identified by AADLC as the most appropriate vendor.
      However, the Government of Kenya (GOK) disputed the selection of CIBER.
      According to GOK, it seems, the selection of CIBER was not based on
      competitive bidding but rather through a single source procurement method
      (Single source was against the IDA’s Development Grant Agreement for the
      project (See Report No. H065-KE, November 10, 2003). In addition, GOK was
      not happy with CIBER’s terms of contract which seems to be in favor of the
      supplier – (CIBER) rather than the customer – (GOK). The Bank responded to
      the Government’s letter and recommended CIBER modify the contract (See
      Annex 9).




                                             5
   2. In June 2005, IDA commissioned a consultant to identify the available technology
      options for the GDLN Program in Africa. The objective was to determine the
      best communication services providers that could replace the then providers:
      Intelsat and Hughes Network Systems (HNS). The outcomes of this search for
      alternative sources for a technology package for GDLN,              results, and
      recommendations would not be known until the end of October 2005 (5 months
      delay). KDLC’s procurement of generator, PABS, UPS, and voltage stabilizer
      also stalled for over two months due to MSPS ongoing procurement reforms
      throughout the government.
   3. In addition to the above, Component 3 - setting-up of M & E system, AADLC
      recruited an independent consultant to design an M&E module for the DLCs in
      Africa. The model, known as, “Uniform Monitoring and Evaluation System?
      (UMES) was designed by the consultant. However, it was later found that the
      UMES was not compatible for all the DLCs in Africa. In addition, the model
      could not be used as a management tool. The Project team had no means to access
      the level of its customer satisfaction, analyze surveys results and draw on
      conclusions for efficient management decision making. The KDLC team had to
      convert to use its simplified module of Microsoft Access Package. This
      conversion also resulted in several months of delay.

Risks: The PAD predicated the following external risks as substantial and modest (See Report
No.24513-KE, Annex 1): (i) Government ministries and agencies would not have access to
adequate training funds for DLC training; (ii) the Government, civil society, and training
institutions would not collaborate actively or contribute to the program; and (iii) Government
counterpart funds flow, procurement, and other critical procedures and processes would be
delayed and unreliable.

In order to reduce the risks of Government ministries and agencies not having adequate training
funds, and civil society and training institutions, not contributing to the program, KDLC
collaborated with government ministries in the design, development and delivery of the training
programs. Government counterpart funds were regular and were on time during project
implementation. However, as mentioned in par. 2.2., procurement of civil works and technical
equipment was delayed due to: (i) market shortages of building materials; and (ii) delays in
technical inputs from the Ministry of Public Works. Also, the transition from the ISG to
AADLC; and the design of inefficient UMES module affected project implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

 In order to capture and assess the impact of the project on capacity building as early as
possible, KDLC Information Technology Team (ITT), designed its own simple database
system using Microsoft Access Package. With this system, KDLC was able to record the
following data: (i) number and type of training sessions; (ii) number of participants and
by gender; (iii) regional and global participation by sector; (iv) rate of utilization; and (v)
a survey questionnaire to assess the quality and the volume of the services of the center.
However, sometime in 2008/9, under IDF Grant, AADLC contracted an independent
consultant to develop an M&E system for the entire DLCs in Africa. The objective was
for all the DLCs in Africa to have a uniform monitoring system. However, it was later



                                              6
found that the DLCs have different needs based on their local conditions. For example
the results framework in Senegal was not compatible with that of Kenya.

In the end, KDLC had to abandon using UMES and go back to use its old system. In
order to catch up on the time lost by adopting the UMES system, KDLC recruited college
students to help input data in to the old system which also delayed project
implementation.

The ICR mission team conducted an overview of KDLC’s M&E system and found the
system to be reliable and appropriate for the types of data KDLC was collecting.
However, the ICR mission suggested the following. Since, the M&E system is KDLC’s
in-house developed model, (i) it is important to train other staff members so as to have a
back-up in case the current Information Technology (IT) staff are unavailable; and (ii)
KDLC IT department should prepare an operational manual of the M&E system so other
staff members or new IT staff can follow the operational procedure of the M&E system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project is rated category C and no safeguard policy was triggered. KDLC is located
in the same compound and adjacent to the Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA), a
suburb of Nairobi. It is about 12 kilometers from the commercial center in Nairobi (the
Central Business District (CBD) and the Government’s ministries. Accordingly, the
distance in location of KDLC from the commercial center and away from Government’s
ministries, commands a discipline for training participants, since participants cannot
easily walk away from training to their offices and never return to complete their courses
as is normally the case in other training facilities in the country. The center is equipped
with a back-up generator, and there were no environmental issues during project
implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
For post completion, the Government has a strong ownership of the center which makes
sustainability of the center quite strong. The Government intends to continue operations
of the center after the close of the project. Government budgetary contribution to KDLC
since inception of the center is over KESM1.03 (Millions of Kenyan Shillings). For the
current financial year, the Government has allocated KES317,073 towards the center, and
has also pledged a minimum of KES240,000 for subsequent financial years. In addition
to this, KDLC is expected to raise sufficient revenue to support its operational expenses.

Also, the Government intends to open similar facilities across the country. In order to
attract customers to the center, KDLC is forging partnership with development partners
such as ILO, USAID, CIDA, the Cardno International Development Associates,
AUSAID and academic institutions around the globe. The Government of Kenya will
also continue to support the center by using it for its staff training programs. In addition
to the above, due to the project, KDLC has established an efficient filing and a reliable
database system, which would be beneficial for future operations. The World Bank
country program in Kenya has used the center for procurement training

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

In 1999, the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) was established as a
technology and connectivity provider for training and capacity building of development
practitioners. With the development of technological and connectivity capacity, the
GDLN’s comparative advantage now lies in the international expertise developed across
the network, the potential for partnerships with the national Research and Education
Network in Africa and in other regions, the convening power of the GDLN affiliates
worldwide, the design and delivery of learning events, the dissemination of good
practices in development topics and the facilitation of South-South knowledge exchanges
among peers.

Although the PDOs as defined in the PAD were vague, and unrealistic (See Par.2.1),
DLC is relevant today as it was when the project was launched in October 2003. The
Kenya Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 18391-KE (IDA/R98-137); dated
09/24/1998; and the most recent CAS (Report No. 38055-KE dated February 16, 2007,
included explicitly, reference to capacity building in the prosecutorial and judicial service
sectors.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Despite three years delays (par.2.2), KDLC has achieved the Project’s Development
Objectives. From 2008 -2011, KDLC offered over 364 capacity development training
events of which 80 are Multimedia; 271 video conferences; and 13 face-to-face events.
These skill development and capacity building programs, addressed learning programs
such as: (i) Financial Management; (ii) Micro-Finance; (iii) Electronic Records
Management; (iv) Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers; (v) Combating
Corruption in Procurement; (vi) Fraud Investigation, Detection and Prevention; (vii)
Strategic Environment Assessment; (ix) Development Policy; and (i) Project Monitoring
& Evaluation.

The training events reached over 5188 participants in the Public and Private sectors and
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), of which 36 percent were females. 1This is an
achievement not envisioned during project preparation and not targeted in the outcome
indicators (See Table 1, Annex 2). The following learning institutions and industries
used the center for some of their learning programs: (i) United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR), (ii) Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA), (iii) East African
Flower Industry, (iv) Kenya Flower Council, (v) Tanzania Development Learning Center
(TDLC), (vi) Uganda Development Learning (UDLC), and (vii) Madagascar
Development Learning Center (MDLC) used the center for some of their learning
programs. In addition to the above, the China Development Assistance Committee, the

At the close of the project in 2011, KDLC’s financial performance presented to the ICR
mission is the following: (i) KDLC’s capacity utilization was only 58 percent compared
to 70 percent projected; (ii) the number of days per year when the center was in use was
197 compared to the projected of 260 days; and (iii) the average cost per participant was
US$73 compared to the projected of U$55. As per data provided by KDLC, the demand
for the use of the center averaged 70-persons (2008-11) compared to the 30-persons seats
the center was designed for.

KDLC cost recovery is shown in Table 2 below and also presented in Table 4 - Result
Framework. As shown, the first two years (2008-9) into operation were the only periods
when cost recovery exceeded the projections in the PAD: (i) an actual of 33 percent cost
recovery compared to the projection of 20 percent in 2008; and 79 percent compared to
the projection of 60 percent cost recovery in 2009. Thereafter, the center did not meet the
cost recovery projection of 100 percent at the close of the project.

counterpart funds, the center’s operating cost exceeded its generated revenue from 2007
to 2010.

KDLC Financial Projection as per its Strategic Plan Report for the period 2010-2014 is
presented in Table 4 below. As shown in the table, it is projected that from 2012-14,
KDLC total receipts will almost equal it total expenditure thus breaking-even. The ICR
team finds these financial projections unrealistic due to: (i) KDLC could not meet the
projected cost recovery of 100 percent at the close of the project; and (ii) without
Government counterparts’ funds, KDLC generated revenue was insufficient to meet its
operational expenses.

According to the Government’s data, the project’s output results exceeded most of the
projections set-up in the PAD as shown in Table 5 below. At the close of the project, (i)
93 percent of the participants were satisfied their capacity has improved; (ii) 94 percent
of the participants were satisfied with the quality range of services offered in KDLC; and
(iii) the percentage of adjustments considered and/or incorporated into KDLC program
based on M&E feedback received, on each of the project’s results indicators was 80
percent (See Annex 2, Graphs 1 and 2).

3.3 Efficiency
The average cost of training (practitioners and decision-makers in the public and private
sector, and NGOs working on development issues) in KDLC were far less than sending
staff abroad or bringing an expert from abroad. Specifically, in 2011, the average cost
per participant attending a similar training (as KDLC) delivered by an institution abroad
was estimated at US$5,100. At the close of the project, KDLC average cost for the same
training was about US$3,740 – far cheaper than sending the participants abroad or
bringing an expert from abroad 4. Also, KDLC’s actual average cost goes below US$55
per participant when three or more GDLN sites are connected as is the case of KDLC
frequent connections with Tanzania Development Learning Center, and Uganda
Development Learning Center. This means that the average cost per participant per day
is below US$55 as indicated in the PAD. In addition to the above, KDLC‘s fee rate
includes, transportation and meals, which is a cost savings to both the government and
the participants.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The project’s overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory because the project
development objectives, albeit broad have been largely achieved (See Annex 2 on
outcomes). Over 360 capacity training events were offered to over 5,180 officials in mid-
level or managerial positions. In addition, it cost less to train an official in KDLC than
sending an official abroad for the same training offered in KDLC. Although with delay,
all three of the project’s components were implemented. Also, some of the delays were
beyond the control of KDLC (procurement reforms within the Government).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There is no data that confirms the impact of the KDLC on the level of poverty in the
country. .

On gender aspects, out of over 5,180 participants who attended KDLC training programs,
36 percent were women. The following training courses encouraged women
participation: (i) Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers; (ii) Jobs and
Opportunities for all; (iii) Global Transformational Leadership for Women’s
Empowerment; (iv) Task force on Citizenship; (v) Fundamentals of eLearning; (vi)
Leaders of Change; and (vii) Value added Agriculture production. The high attendance of
the above courses, by middle level women managers, brought to the government,
awareness of training needs of women in the country’s work force. The ICR team
recommends the implementation of a training needs assessment for women in the
working age group of the population.

On social development aspect, KDLC’s ability to bring people from all sectors (public
and private), regional and international to share knowledge and ideas, not only enhanced
skill and capacity development, but also promoted intercultural exchange between Kenya
and the participating countries of Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana, China, New
Zealand, Greece, and England. These additional achievements were not envisioned
during project preparation (See Para. 3.2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

KDLC provided training to public servants, thus contributing to government’s capacity
development efforts. However, there are no qualitative indicators that proved how the
training impacted institutional strengthening and change.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

It was projected in the PAD that due to: (i) the high cost of KDLC’s fees compared to
other training institutions in the country, participation would be low; also that (ii) low
Government budget for training; and (iii) in-country training by KDLC, instead of the
usual system of sending staff abroad for training, would discourage participation in


                                              12
KDLC. At the close of the project, over 5,180 participants from the public and private
sector; and NGOs participated in the training programs compared over 45 percent higher
than projected (See Annex 2, table 1). Of these, as mentioned above, 36 percent were
women and 20 percent were from NGOs. Both achievements were unintended during
project preparation and augur well for the project’s achievements.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
As mention above, over 5180 participants attended training courses in KDLC during the
period 2008 – 2011 5. Customer satisfaction survey carried out by the center in July 2011
with a population size of 573 from 16 courses held between July 1, 2009 and December
31, 2010 registered a highly satisfactory rating with KDLC training program. A sample
of 172 participants was also randomly selected representing 30% of participants from
each course, 90 percent of the participants were satisfied with the quality of the range of
services and facilities offered at the DLC. The ICR team also met with the Deputy
Director, Human Resource Management Department (HRM) Policy, in the Ministry of
State for Public Works and Service. According to the Deputy Director, KDLC programs
fulfilled the training needs of her department. She also regularly attends KDLC’s
training program. She rated her experience with the KDLC as highly satisfactory (See
Annex 9)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The risk to development outcome of the Kenya Development Learning center is moderate.
As mentioned above, this project has succeeded in attracting participation in the training
courses by 45 percent higher than projected in the PAD. Second, KDLC’s strategy of
working with Government ministries in designing training courses tailored to the training
needs of the country’s labor force resulted in an efficient use of resources by both the
Government and the center. Thirdly, on the average, and taking into account, other
benefits offered (transportation, refreshments, meals and stationery) by KDLC, its service
rates are far cheaper than other training centers in both the country, the region or
compared to sending staff abroad or bringing an expert from abroad to give the same
training that is offered by KDLC.

Despite the above achievements, however, there is a risk of high staff turn-over in KDLC
due to lack of salary incentives. Low salaries for qualified professionals may jeopardize
the sustainability of the center over the coming years. At the close of the project, the
center did not have a training coordinator. The coordinator left the center in March 2012
for a better paying job. In addition to the above, due to the lack of enough rooms (offices,
rest rooms, and dining facilities) to accommodate all participants (See Par. 2.1), there is a
risk that Government ministries may soon be discouraged from using the center.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Unsatisfactory.
The Bank’s lending performance is unsatisfactory. The choice of a LIL as the funding
instrument for this operation allowed the fast-tracking of its implementation but the
design of the project should have paid more attention to the local institutional context and
realities. The assumptions on the prospects of a GDLN center were mostly based on
lessons learned in countries around the globe, however, the design of KDLC, did not take
into account the capacity needs of the country. This resulted in the construction of a
building without adequate capacity to accommodate the number of participants attending
training courses at the center (See Par.2.1).

Also, as mentioned above (Par. 2.2) the implementation delays coursed by (i) ISG
transition to AADLC; (ii) procurement of specialized/technical equipments; and (iii) the
hiring of an incompetent M&E consultant to design UMES model had a negative impact
on the Bank’s Performance.

In addition to the above, there were frequent changes in task management of the project.
During the period 2007- 2010 the project did not have a full time task manager (TTL). A
retired former staff was acting as the TTL. The Government sent a letter to the Bank
requesting for a full time TTL. According to the Government, there were often long
delays in receiving “No-objection? from the Bank, and they had problem identifying
which department in the Bank was responsible for the project, whether it was the World
Bank Institute (WBI) or the African Region. For the above reasons, the Bank’s
performance is unsatisfactory. For future operations, the ICR team recommends that a
TTL is assigned by the Bank and based at the country office who will maintain a closer
institutional relationship with the client. The Bank also failed to fully utilize the services
of the center as initially expected during the design phase of the project. As noted in the
PAD: “the center would serve to support the World Bank operations in the region by
providing ICT services for project implementation. It would serve as a one-stop-shop for
south–south knowledge exchange services?; this never happened


(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Unsatisfactory
The quality of supervision was rated unsatisfactory because of inconsistency of follow-
ups, the supervision team maintained frequent contact with the Government and the
center. However, the quality of information collected was unsatisfactory and inconsistent.
Project supervisions were partly conducted by the TTL and or acting TTLs, and this
hampered continuity. The last two supervision missions were conducted in combination
with visits to other multilateral agencies such as ILO, USAID, CIDA so as to bring
awareness and benefits of the center to these agencies. The last Audit and Financial
Statement were submitted to the Bank on December 30, 2011. The report noted that “No


                                             14
major accounting and internal control weaknesses were noted during the audit that may
affect the project implementation?. However, as mentioned above, there were frequent
changes in TTLs which adversely affected project supervision. Also, apart from the
project component 1 - construction of the center; and sub-component 3 - setting up of
M&E, there was little or no reporting on other important aspects of the project. For
example, there was no reporting on: (i) institutional arrangement; (ii) promotion of
efficient use of resources; (iii) testing and/or evaluation of KDLC in-house designed
M&E module and (iv) there was no data collection during supervision missions. There
was hardly any mention on these in either the back to office reports (BTOR) or in the
Aide Memoires.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
The Bank’s overall performance is rated unsatisfactory because of the shortcomings of
the Bank in project design and supervision. The supervision aide memoires, back-to-
office reports and Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) missed out on reporting on some
of the project’s sub-components, and there were delays due to the transition from ISG to
AADLC due to IDA internal issue, procurement and M&E as mentioned above.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. Despite the 24-month delays in
project implementation, the borrower seemed to overcome all odds and took control of
the project. Since, this was its first DLC project, the borrower consulted with (and
included visits to) other DLCs in the region and outside the region. For lessons learned,
the borrower connected with and shared training courses with other DLCs around the
globe. The borrower sent a letter to the Bank expressing its dissatisfaction for the
selection of CIBER (Par.2.2) and for hiring the consultant that designed the inefficient
M&E module. Despite a poor project design, the borrower turned the project around in a
successful direction.

During the ICR mission, the team observed that the Center was overcrowded with
participants during a training session and this was considered a normal, and not
exceptional, occurrence. This suggests the Center should have been expanded. However,
the team noticed, that the construction of the Center did not give room for an expansion.
Despite these shortcomings, however, KDLC seemed able to manage the overcrowding
problem by using its hallways for coffee breaks and meals.

It seems, the borrower concentrated more on quantitative outputs rather than on
qualitative outputs of the project. There were no records of follow-up consultations with
participants trained. There were no records on: (i) trainees’ performance: and (ii) no
feedback or evaluation of trainees. The survey questionnaires were irrelevant for an
evaluation of the subject courses taken by the participants. There were no indications
suggesting that KDLC requested for feedbacks on staff performance from the various


                                           15
ministries or institutions that sent staff for the training. For the above reasons, the
borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.
The Ministry of State for Public Services (MSPS) is the implementation agency. MSPS’s
performance of the project is moderately satisfactory. The project documents showed
that the MSPS has full ownership of the project through its regular consultation with
board members, KDLC staff and IDA. According to the Permanent Secretary, skilled
development and capacity building is a high priority for the Government and the
Government will continue its budgetary support to the center. The MSPS’s intension is
for sustainability of the Center after the close of the project. The Director of the Kenya
Institute of Administration also supports KDLC’s mission which is: “To sustainably
enhance human resource capacities and global knowledge sharing on development
through innovation learning solutions.? According to the Director, KDLC has brought
added value to KIA’s training programs by both sides renting and sharing each other’s
facilities. For lessons learned, she suggested, KDLC enhanced its consultations with the
government ministries to increase the number of clients. However, at the close of the
project, KDLC has no training coordinator due to limited salary incentives and
contractual terms (less than one year).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The government took the initiative to design its own in house M&E framework. However,
more in-depth analysis is required to determine the impact (quality) of the trainings
offered by the KDLC on institutional strengthening.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learned from the project can be divided into the following: (A) Project design
(B) Implementation history; and (C) lessons from both the Government and Bank’s
performance.

   A. Project design

The design of a DLC or GDLN center is context specific.

The First lesson learned is that a more careful assessment of the conditions on the ground
should have been carried out and considered during the design phase. The Kenya DLC
was under designed with respect to prevailing needs. The one-size-fits-all approach to
capacity and construction design that was used for all other DLCs was unsuitable for the
Kenya context, and proved inappropriate, especially since this was an innovative project.
The design team should have studied the Kenyan context more and consulted with the
government and local stakeholders (rather than use a supply driven approach) to
determine if such a facility will work out adequately, given the available demand.




                                           16
Secondly, a multi-disciplinary team should have been assembled with the right technical
skills. For this particular project, there were no technical experts with the know-how
required to participate with the Bank team during the design phase (or they were not
identified by the project team) 6. For this reason, it seems, the Government of Kenya,
(GOK) put all its trust on the Bank team to design both the project and the infrastructure
(building). The DLC was a new concept and a complex project for the country to
undertake without adequate expertise representing the Government.

    B. Implementation History – IDA

Although the LIL may not have been the right instrument; yet, in this case, it succeeded
because of the Government of Kenya’s commitment and ownership, provision of
government budgetary support, and support of the right skill mix in the project team (i.e.,
the KDLC staff) during implementation. These subsequent factors proved adequate for
the Learning and Innovative Loan project to succeed

Another lesson learned is that the borrower should have been allowed to continue using
its own designed M&E module and the Bank task management team should have been
more hands-on with the client’s M&E module by evaluating and providing direction on
the indicators. This would have saved time on both sides. Bank management could also
have assigned an ISG expert to be based in the country office to work with the
Government in implementing the project or at least provided adequate supervision
resources to enable local hire of the desired expertise.

The Bank could have been more proactive in engaging with the KDLC and in using its
services to support the implementation of operations, through the use of the different ICT
tools provided by the Center and to promote South-South knowledge exchanges.

    C. Implementation History - Government

Government and implementation agencies should not only focus on quantitative outcome
indicators but also on qualitative outcome indicators. For example, there is no evidence
that KDLC has feedback mechanisms in place to evaluate the quality of the training and
the impact of this training on enhancing the capacity of the participants or on the overall
impact of the trainings on institutional strengthening and change.


    D. Sustainability of DLCs




6
          According to the Government, during design phase of the infrastructure they did not have
          an expert to guide them. In addition the grant amount did not allow the construction of a bigger
center.



                                                     17
For sustainability of the DLC, the government of Kenya could consider continuous
support of the DLC as it has proven to be a useful tool for knowledge dissemination and
capacity development.


Recommendations

   •   KDLC should set-up a system whereby it can follow-up with participants, after
       their training.
   •   KDLC’s accounting system should include: (i) upgrading and replacement of
       spare parts; (ii) depreciation and maintenance and etc.
   •   For the M&E module, KDLC should: (i) prepare an operational manual of the
       module so other staff members or new IT staff can follow the operational
       procedure of the module; (ii) train other staff members on how the module works;
       and (ii) conduct a regular evaluation and update of the M&E module.
   •   For technology enhancement, KDLC should make provision for technology
       improvement and purchase of spare parts since its current contract with AADLC
       does not include purchase of spare parts

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Projected Output Indicators vs. Actual Output

Due to the delays as indicated in par.2.2, the key performance indicators in measuring the
project outcome did not take effect until 2008 when KDLC became operational. Also, as
mentioned in Section 2.1, the original closing date of the project was extended from
December 31, 2008 -2011. Since the original PAD’s outcome indicators were only up to
2008, the projections in Table 1, Graphs A - D below are based on the projections in the
Restructured Paper (Report No. HO65-KE).

On the whole, most of the project’s target has been met. Specifically, 93% of mid-level
managers who participated in KDLC courses indicated an improvement in the
management of their work and are satisfied with the quality of range of services and
facilities offered at the KDLC (See Graph B). 80 percent of adjustments considered
and/or incorporated into the program were based on M&E feedback. The percentage of
indicators (from output to PDO), measured and for which the data collection mechanisms
were in place was 100.

In addition to the above, (i) the number of days in a year when KDLC basic services were
operational was 197 (See Graph C); (ii) 95 percent of training courses offered by KDLC
corresponded to the identified needs of the market study. In line with this, (iii) the
number of participants trained by type of organization, public, private, none-
governmental organization (NGO), and by gender was 5,188 (Graph D). Of this, 39
percent were female participants; and 20 percent were from NGOs. Gender and NGOs
participation were not envisioned during project preparation. Also, the (i) total number
of training hours delivered by KDLC was 1159; (ii) the number of training events (video
conference, multimedia and face-to-face training was 100; and (ii) the total number of
courses offered or delivered in the various disciplines was 30.

Output by Project Components: The project outputs by components are presented below:

Component 1 – Construction and equipment of the Distance Learning Center

This component aimed at:

       (i)     Construction of facilities for the DLC, including: (a) a video-conference
               room (30-person capacity (b) a computer room outfitted for 30 computer
               stations (hardware, software and Internet hook-up); (c) technical and
               administrative center; and (d) electrical and telephone installation.
       (ii)    Purchase and installation of equipment, including: (a) a small aperture
               terminal (VSAT – satellite communication terminal) (b) video,
               telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment; (c) office and
               classroom furniture; and (d) equipment for operations and security.

This component is rated moderately satisfactory

The construction is of high quality and the equipment is perfectly adequate to carry out
the mission of DLC. However, the center was built to accommodate only 30-persons, too
small for the current demand of about 70-persons. As mention in par. 2.1, the design of
the center benefited from the experience of other GDLN centers and took into account
lessons learned from the DLCs in Tanzania, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Uganda and Senegal.
Accordingly, KDLC is one of the few learning centers in the country with the following
technical equipments: (i) Video Conferencing Equipment, Computers and
Communication Equipments; (ii) Servers, Desktops and Laptops; and (iii)
Communication Equipments (See Annex 9 for a detailed list of KDLC Technical
Equipments). KDLC’s training rooms and offices are well equipment with classrooms
office furniture.

However, as mentioned in Par. 2.2., construction of this component was delayed due to
delays in procurement of civil works; market shortages of building materials;
inappropriate building specifications and standards which delayed the operation of the
center for three years. The actual total cost of this component was US$1.34 million
compared to US$1.38 allocated at appraisal.

Component 2 – Support for Distance Learning Center

This component aimed at assisting the DLC for (i) institutional arrangement; (ii) business
planning; (iii) stakeholders/training institutions/development partners; (iv) training
courses; (v) development of M&E (vi) promotion of efficient use of resources; and (vii)
reporting.

This component is rated moderately satisfactory because at the close of the project, there
was no Training Coordinator (TC). The TC left due to a better offer job with another
company (See Table 2 below for KDLC staff list).




                                           22
Institutional Arrangement: As requested in the PAD, KDLC is a legal independent
institution with board members from the public, civil and the private sector as follows:
(i) Ministry of State for Public Service (MSPS); (ii) the Association of Professional
Societies of East Africa (APSEA); (iii) Kenya Institute of Management; (iv)
Commission for Higher Education; (v) Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and
Analysis; (vi) Directorate of E-Government; (vii) Department of Human Resource
Development of the Ministry of State for Public Service; (viii) KDLC, and (ix) Kenya
Institute of Administration.

Accordingly, board members meet at least four times in a year to discuss: (i) the general
educational training of the center; (ii) its place in educational training policy of Kenya
and (iii) the training curriculum of the center. KDLC is staff by: (i) Director, (ii)
Information      Technology     specialist;      (iii)  Accountant       and    (iv)   Six
Support Staff.

See Annex 9 for Executive Summary of KDLC Business Plan. A copy of the Business
Plan and other documents are in project files.

Stakeholders/training institutions/development partners: This sub-component was
satisfactory implemented. As mentioned above, KDLC stakeholder includes the Ministry
of State and Public Services (MSPS), Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA), Ministry
Finance (MF), Crown Agents, UK, Ote Academy Greece, Uganda Management Institute
and Tanzania Institute of Finance Management. KDLC established partnership with the
following: Tokyo DLC, Tanzania DLC, Uganda DLC, China Development Assistance
Committee, the University of Manchester - department of Business School, IP
Communications of New Zealand, and the World Bank Country office.

Training courses: Under this component, KDLC offered thirty training courses in the
following subjects: (i) Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers; (ii) Jobs and
Opportunities for all; (iii) Global Transformational Leadership for Women’s
Empowerment; (iv)Task force on Citizenship; (v) Fundamentals of eLearning; (vi)
Leaders of Change; and (vii) Value added Agriculture production (See annex 9 for
Training courses) to 5188 participants from the public and private sectors and NGO of
which 1871 and 1029 are females and NGOs respectively.

Development of M&E: Under this sub-component, as mention in par.2.3, KDLC
designed its own model using Microsoft Access Package. With this system, KDLC build
a database on the following: (i) number and type of training sessions; (ii) number of
participants and by gender; (iii) regional and global participation by sector; (iv) the rate
of utilization; and (v) a survey questionnaire to assess the quality and the volubility of its
services. The actual total cost of this component was US$1.61 million compared to
US$1.90 allocated at appraisal.


Component 3 – Monitoring and Evaluation of the Distance Learning Center

This component is rated moderately satisfactory with the following suggestions. Since
KDLC designed its own in-house module, the ICR mission team recommends the
following: (i) train other staff members on how the module works; (ii) prepare an
operational manual of the module so other staff members or new IT staff can follow the
operational procedure of the module; (iii) conduct a regular evaluation of the M&E
module. Also, due to the fast changes in technology, KDLC should make provision for
technology improvement and purchase of spare parts since its current contract with
AADLC do not include purchase of spare parts.

A brief overview of KDLC‘s M&E System as presented by the Government to the ICR
mission is as follows:

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
According to Government data, at the close of the project (December 2011), the average
cost per participant attending training in KDLC was estimate at US$3,740. Also,
according to World Bank study conducted on DLCs on Africa, in 2005, it would cost an
estimated US$5,100 to send a participant abroad (Europe or the United States) to take the
same training that is offered in the DLCs in Africa 9. In April 2012, the Kenya World
Bank Resident Mission (Procurement Department) which uses KDLC facility for some of
its training courses, conducted in-country study and came out with the same estimated
figure of US$5,100 if a participant was send to an institution abroad or an expert was
brought from outside to give the training that is offered in KDLC 10.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

According to the Bank’s projects files, a beneficiary survey was conducted by the center
in July 2011 with a population size of 573 for 16 courses held between July 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2010. Of this population, 90 percent of the participants indicated highly
satisfied with the quality and the range of KDLC courses. During the same period, a
sample of 172 participants was also randomly selected representing 30% of participants
from each course. Of this, 90 percent of the participants were satisfied with the quality of
the range of services and facilities offered at the DLC.

The ICR mission also received the following historical survey results from KDLC.
Accordingly, the percentage of participants who were satisfied with the quality of
services and range of facilities offered by KDLC in 2008 to 2010, ranges from 72% -
98% for a sample of 748 and 1129 participants. The percentage of participants satisfied
with video conference and multimedia services, ranges from 95% to 96% for the same
sample. However, it should be noted that these figures should be treated with cautious
due to inconsistencies in the Government data compared to data in the Bank’s project
files.

Introduction and Background
The Kenya Global Development Learning Centre (KDLC) located at the Kenya Institute
of Administration (KIA) was established under the Ministry of State for Public Service
(MSPS) in 2003 through an order of the Minister of Education, Science and Technology
under section 10 of the Education Act Cap 211 of the laws of Kenya. KDLC is an
affiliate of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) a worldwide partnership
of over 120 learning centers in 80 countries around the world that use advanced
technologies and distance learning techniques innovatively to connect people working on
development around the world for capacity building events. The Kenya DLC is also a
member of the Association of Africa Distance Learning Centers (AADLC).

KDLC was established through a joint funding Agreement between the Government of
Kenya and the World Bank (International Development Association) in November 2003.
The center is equipped with state-of-the art information communication technologies that
includes an air conditioned and sound proof video conference room and multimedia
laboratories with high internet speed which provides a good learning environment in
addition to the green and serene surroundings of the KIA, the renowned government
training institution for senior officers where the centre is hosted.


Project Objectives and Expected Outcomes
The initial objective of the DLC project in Kenya was to test the effectiveness and
sustainability of a development learning centre as part of a global knowledge sharing
network aimed at strengthening the capacity of the country’s public, private and civil
society decision-makers and implementers to design, plan and manage social economic
development policies.
In order to clarify and better articulate the Project Development Objective (PDO) in 2007
the Government made a request to the World Bank for a review of the PDO. The request
was approved and the PDO was amended and since then has been “To improve the
capacity of public servants, and private individuals and institutions in specific public
sector management areas targeted by the development learning center".



                                              35
In amending the PDO it was considered that the viability of the center would depend on
its ability to focus on building the capacity of public servants as its mainstay and
identifying specific public sector management areas guided by the government's specific
priorities. In addition, in the request for the modification of the PDO, the Government
was aiming at utilizing the DLC services to enhance government plans outlined in the
country’s Vision 2030 setting as a priority, the expansion of the telecommunications
sector, access to information technology, introduction of e-government services as well
as improving public sector performance and service delivery through access to world
class training for the public sector.


Key Project Outcomes and Indicators
The period 2003 to 2006 involved the construction and equipping of the centre. The
DLC’s business operations commenced in July 2007 and by 1st July 2012, the centre will
have been in operation for a total of five years. Since commencement of its business the
DLC has made significant progress in several areas as articulated by the following
performance indicators and achievements:

    (i)     Establishment of Partnerships
    KDLC has forged mutually beneficial partnerships with various institutions and
    companies both locally and internationally. The purpose of the partnerships is to
    enhance capacity building activities within the country and regionally in areas where
    gaps have been identified. Some of these areas include; enhancement of e-
    government ICT skills, electronic records management, policy formulation, fraud
    detection, investigation and prevention, Critical skills development, eLearning
    production & management, leadership development and governance, combating
    corruption, project management, among many others.
    Some of the notable KDLC partners include: The Ministry of State for Public Service,
    Kenya Institute of Administration, Ministry of Finance, World Bank country office,
    Crown Agents UK, OTE Academy, Greece, Uganda Management Institute, Institute
    of Finance Management (Tanzania), Tokyo DLC, Uganda and Tanzania DLCs among
    others.



                                           36
These partnerships have contributed significantly in the provision and access of world
class training to the country without participants having to travel for studies abroad
while delivery of training from Kenya to other countries in the East African region
has become a reality. The partnerships established with the Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of State for Public Service has enabled the identification of training needs
for specific groups of officers leading to the design, development and delivery of
training programs as an on-going initiative expected to continue for the next three
years in order to cover all the target groups in the public sector.

(ii)      Programs/Events
From very humble beginnings of just 2 training events in the first month of KDLC’s
operations whose duration on average was about three hours per day, KDLC today
handles almost a hundred (100) training programs annually. Majority of which are
one or two weeks offered through video conference and full day events offered
through the multimedia facility. Of these trainings;
   •   Eight are offered from the KDLC (through video conferencing) to other
       countries in the region in partnership with KIA, the host institution while four
       others are received in Kenya through partnerships with the host institutions of
       the Tanzania and Uganda DLCs.
   •   About 3 are offered regularly (through video conferencing) in conjunction
       with International organizations like Crown Agents (UK), Leading Initiative
       World Wide (Australia) OTE Academy (Greece)
   •   Every year not less than 20 Inter-Country dialogues are organized (through
       video conferencing) and delivered enabling Kenyans to learn from the
       experiences of other countries and share Kenya’s experiences with other
       countries without leaving the country.
   •   Eight courses are designed, developed and delivered by KDLC in conjunction
       with specific partners. These are full day trainings offered in the multimedia
       laboratories.
   •   Duration of training has increased from just a few hours per day to a week and
       some case two weeks per training event.

                  •     Apart from the inter-country dialogues, a certificate of attendance is awarded
                        after successful completion of the training for all other courses offered at the
                        DLC, This is important to the Kenyan market.

(iii)     Design, Development and Delivery of Training
        KDLC has designed, developed and delivers eight programs for specific
        groups based on identified needs of target groups. Four of these courses are
        offered through a partnership with the Ministry of Finance and World Bank
        country office and another two in partnership with the Ministry of State for
        Public Service while two are in e-learning development and management and
        have been introduced to address a growing need in this area.

(iv)      Number of Participants
The progress made by KDLC over the years can be seen through the increase in the
number of participants. In 2007, KDLC had 748 participants attending mostly short
two to three hour VC dialogues while in 2010 KDLC had 1525 participants attending
various training activities at the centre majority of which are one or two weeks events.
With more than three and a half months to go before the end of the current financial
year (2011/2012), already 1228 participants have attended different programs offered
at the centre. KDLC is increasingly attracting very senior participants even from other
parts of Africa. In the current financial year 258 participants from different African
countries have attended various courses developed and delivered by KDLC.

(v)       Facility Utilization
With the growth in the number of participants, the facilities have also seen a rise in
utilization hours. In 2007, KDLC had a total of 449 training hours while by the end
of 2010/2011 financial year utilization had increased to 1159 hours. In the current
year that ends in June, total training hours are already at 958 as of 13th March 2012.

(vi)          Training Hours
       Since inception the training hours have increased from four hundred and forty
       nine in the first year to one thousand one hundred and fifty nine last year to nine
       hundred and fifty eight (This year up to March 15th with more than three months
       to go before the end of the financial year)

               (vii)   Establishment of Secondary Site
               KDLC has embarked on the establishment of the first secondary site in Mombasa at
               the Government Training Institute (GTI) Mombasa. It is planned that the centre will
               benefit from the already existing government infrastructure. This move has received
               the approval of the Board of Governors of the DLC and Government. A contract has
               been awarded for the refurbishing of the training rooms allocated by the GTI to
               KDLC for this purpose and the Government in the current financial year has provided
               an amount of approximately USD 159,000 for the refurbishment and procurement of
               the equipment.

               (viii)     Revenue Generation
               In the 2007/8 period, KDLC funded 80% of its expenditure through grants from the
               World Bank and the Government and generated only 33% of its expenditure
               requirements.             By 2010/2011 the institution was generating 73% of its revenue
               requirements and received grants from WB and Government of Kenya that covered
               the balance of 27%. During the current financial year KDLC has generated 102% of


                                                                                  44
its expenditure requirements including depreciation cost which has been factored in.
The total costs shown below have factored in depreciation but has excluded the
capital investment made on procurement of new equipment. It is expected that the
Government will continue to assist the DLC with a budget for capital investments and
related costs. Below is a financial summary on the performance of the centre since it
started its business operations. It should be noted that in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) page 19, the target set for cost recovery in terms of operating
expenses, excluded amortization. The expenditure for the current financial year
2011/2012 however includes depreciation since the project has officially closed.

Key Challenges during Implementation
     (i)                One of the key challenges experienced by the Ministry of State for Public
                        Service (MSPS) and the DLC has been implementing component three of the
                        project which is on Monitoring and evaluation. MSPS had overall
                        responsibility but the monitoring in terms of data collection and analysis was
                        done at the centre since this required the registering and processing of data on
                        a daily basis. The oversight authority has always been with the Ministry.
                        The difficulty experienced was in monitoring some of the key project
                        performance indicators because they were vague and not clear on what exactly
                        was expected to be monitored and evaluated. It is therefore proposed that for
                        future DLCs the indicators are discussed with the project team and a clear
                        understanding be established on what is expected from the onset. Project
                        implementers should not be left on their own to decide the formula to apply.
                        Some examples of this are as follows;
     •            “Number of days per year where the DLC basic services (VC, MM) are
                  operational. For future DLCs it should be clarified exactly what this indicator is
                  aimed at. Is it the number of days the DLC is operational meaning the equipment


                                                              46
    is up and running or is it the days when there is an event utilizing either the video
    conference or multimedia facilities. For Kenya DLC what was monitored was the
    number of days when either the VC or MM was underutilization.
    KDLC recommends that the indicator focuses on monitoring the days per
    year when the equipment is functioning well and connectivity is up and
    running. This is because no other indicator captures this important
    information.
•   “Utilization rates (based on the total capacity of the infrastructure)? For this
    indicator there was no clarity provided on how the indicator was to be measured.
    For future DLC’s there is need to clarify what total capacity or 100% utilization
    is; is it based on the total hours available for utilization per day or should it be
    based on the number of participants? If you work with participants and the VC
    facility is charged per hour whether you have one or forty two participants, does
    this make sense? KDLC therefore worked on the basis of the total number of
    hours available per day for utilization of the facilities taking into consideration
    that some of the services are charged per hour and not per participant.
    But this also presents a problem because if you are booked for a two hour event in
    the morning (looking at 8.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon). What is 100% utilization when
    you consider most events will probably start at 9.00 am? So what should be
    considered as total capacity or 100% utilization for that part of the day and indeed
    the whole day? If you have a two hour VC in the morning and another two hours
    in the afternoon (total of 4 hours a day), is that 100% utilization? One needs to
    consider that it might not be possible to fix another event in between the two due
    to varied reasons.
    KDLC recommends that 100 percent utilization be based on the realistic
    number of events that a DLC can have in a day and not on the number of
    hours per day or the number of participants. Capacity should also be
    assessed not just based on available sitting capacity in the training rooms but
    should look at support facilities like washrooms, break out rooms and
    catering when calculating the total capacity of the Centre. This is because
    although the total sitting capacity in both training facilities is for example



                                         47
       sixty, if the support facilities are not adequate for this number then the result
       is a congestion problem that makes learning uncomfortable.
•      Number of training events (VC, MM,) There is a need to set the parameter for
       this indicator so as to be clear what a training event is. For instance does a one-
       time off, three or two hour inter-country dialogue qualify to be a training event?
       What if it is a series of six with one per month do you count that as a single
       training event or several depending on total number of days offered? In Kenya we
       have introduced a number of certificate courses which are offered jointly with
       Tanzania DLC and sometimes include Uganda DLC and other international
       partners. Majority of these courses usually take twenty of fifteen hours which
       means VC sessions of 3 to 4 hours every day for five or more days. Is each of
       these sessions one training event or should they be counted as one training event?
       Whether the training takes one day or two weeks KDLC registers such training as
       a single activity even though many of the courses could have more than five VC
       sessions. When setting the indicators for new DLCs it is therefore important to
       have a clear understanding of what constitutes a training event.
       KDLC recommends that every training activity with a definite start and end
       time be considered as a training event whether it takes one hour or two
       weeks.
(ii)      During project implementation one of KDLC’s greatest challenges was the
          frequent changes of Team Task Leaders (TTLs) from the World Bank. In
          many instances this affected the smooth flow of project implementation
          because the replacement sometimes took place many months after the TTLs
          had left and the new one would require sometime to understand and respond
          to the needs of the project.
(iii)     Limited Facilities at KDLC is currently proving to be a big challenge and the
          DLC has resulted to hiring additional training rooms and IT laboratories from
          KIA the host institution due to increased activities. This has increased the
          operating costs considerably. For future DLCs it will be important to take into
          consideration an expansion plan especially during the construction phase to
          enable the centre increase its facilities as the business increases.



                                            48
  (iv)    Changes in technology remains a challenge because of the need to keep
          upgrading the equipment on a regular basis. It is therefore important that
          government commits to continue supporting the Centre after the funding
          agreement with the World Bank expires.

Key Lessons Learnt
  (i)     KDLC has adopted a strategy which has positioned the DLC more as an
          “innovative training solution provider? and not as a facility for hire of training
          rooms and equipment. At KDLC the hire of facilities has been a secondary
          line of business. The reason for this being that there are a number of private
          sector institutions that are already doing this as their main business and it was
          important for KDLC to distinguish itself from the rest and a align itself to
          capacity building which is where the most value can be realized.
  (ii)    Inter-country dialogues funded by development partners e.g. the World Bank
          Institute, African Development Bank, Africa Capacity Building Foundation
          etc. form an important part of the DLC’s activities but on their own are not
          adequate to lead to sustainability of the centre. The DLC must therefore look
          at other viable business options and opportunities in the country. In addition
          the DLC has to find some balance between its revenue generation needs and
          being a public institution established not for a commercial purpose but for a
          public good.
  (iii)   Although the market in Kenya values inter-country dialogues and considers
          them important, any attempt to charge a fee for this has always been met with
          some resistance. Inter-country dialogues therefore will always require some
          sponsorship from the World Bank Institute or a similar International body. It
          has also been noted that Kenyans seem to be more interested and willing to
          pay for training where a certificate is awarded after successful completion of
          training.
  (iv)    One of the objectives of establishing a DLC is to make world class learning
          available to Kenyans. However training accessed from the developed
          countries remains very expensive even when offered through video
          conference. For this reason Kenya DLC together with Tanzania and Uganda


                                           49
           DLCs have partnered to share training from their respective host institutions,
           in a move aimed at making video conference training more affordable. Such
           training though of high quality is not as expensive as what comes from the
           developed countries and is seen to be more responsive to the needs of the East
           African region.
   (v)     DLCs could work well with their host institutions if a partnership agreement is
           entered into from the onset. Host institutions get a lot of value when they use
           the DLCs to reach and train people in other countries. The activities enable
           them to market themselves in the region as regional knowledge hubs hence
           increasing their regional and international visibility. When the host institution
           can attribute value to the presence of the DLC this becomes the foundation for
           enhanced collaboration. Many of the DLCs do not have their own facilities for
           accommodation and catering and must therefore relay for these services from
           the host institution. Establishing a good working and mutually beneficial
           relationship with the host institution should therefore be a primary and
           strategic objective for any DLC that is housed by another institution.
   (vi)    Ownership by a Government Ministry especially the one charged with the
           development of the Human Resource in the public sector is very important
           and so is the oversight of an effective and supportive Board of the Centre with
           a clear legal framework.
   (vii)   The establishment of in-country satellite or secondary centres is very
           important so as to increase access and ensures participation of officers from
           the regions and counties to the DLC’s activities. Sending participants to the
           capital city where the DLC is located is often seen as expensive and therefore
           only participants from Nairobi and its environs attend regularly events
           organized by the DLC.


Future of the Kenya DLC
It is expected that KDLC will continue its operations as a semi-autonomous institution
under the Ministry of State for Public Service. KDLC will focus on the realization of its
current strategic plan (2010-2015) reviewed annually as guided by its Board of


                                            50
Governors. The centre will generate revenue to cover its operations while the
Government will continue to support through a budget provision for the DLC’s capital
and related expenditure.

1.1       About Kenya Development Learning Centre (KDLC)
The Kenya Development Learning Centre (KDLC) was established under the Ministry of
State for Public Service in 2003 by an order of the Ministry of Education, Science and
Technology. KDLC is an affiliate of the Global Development Learning Network
(GDLN), a worldwide partnership of over 120 learning centres in 80 countries that use
technologies and distance learning techniques innovatively to connect people working
around the world for capacity building events.

1.2       Overview of KDLC Strategic Plan
An innovative and holistic best practice approach has been applied in the development of
this plan to ensure that all organisational perspectives have been recognised.

The strategic direction of KDLC was defined at the corporate level through use of the
Balanced Scorecard Approach; a widely recognised best practice approach to strategic
planning that integrates all operational aspects of an organisation. Using this approach,
the mission, vision and strategic objectives were developed for KDLC at the corporate
level.

The vision of KDLC is “To be a leading global centre of excellence for capacity
building and innovative learning solutions?.

The mission is “To sustainably enhance human resource capacities and global
knowledge sharing on development through innovative learning solutions.?

The core values that underpin KDLC’s culture include integrity, customer focus,
creativity and innovation, openness and responsiveness and professionalism.

In addition, strategies were developed to support achievement of the defined strategic
objectives, along with appropriate key performance indicators. Strategic objectives,
strategies and key performance indicators were developed under the four perspectives of
the Balanced Scorecard which include the customer perspective, financial perspective,
internal business process perspective and people and innovation perspective. Strategic
themes and objectives that support the overall vision of the organisation were defined.

The strategic themes of KDLC and the expected results arising from each theme were
defined as:

      •   Exceptional Service: This will lead to KDLC being a centre of excellence with a
          growing market share.


                                             54
   •   Sustainability: This will lead to an autonomous centre capable of supporting its
       growth in the long run.

   •   Strategic Partnerships: This will lead to increased business and KDLC being a
       Benchmark for standards.

   •   Innovative Learning Solutions: This will lead to market leadership and
       customer satisfaction

The strategic objectives of KDLC were defined as:

   •   Customer Objectives: The objectives include increasing customer base,
       improving stakeholder relationships, increasing customer satisfaction and
       understanding customer needs.

   •   Financial Objectives: The objectives include expanding the market, increasing
       revenue and reducing cost.

   •   Internal Process Objectives: The objectives include to increase efficiency,
       continuous monitoring and evaluation and to improve internal systems and
       processes.

   •   People and Innovation: The objectives include improving technology and
       systems, enhancing employee performance and enhancing human resource
       capacity.

The strategic objectives and themes above were derived from the four integrated
organisational perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard illustrated in the diagram below.
