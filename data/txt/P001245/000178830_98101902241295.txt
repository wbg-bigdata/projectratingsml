REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
KENYA PIPELINE COMPANY LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR THE
MOMBASA-NAIROBI OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) with the guarantee of the Republic of
Kenya for the equivalent of US$20.0 million to help finance construction of
an oil pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi. The proposed loan is for a term of
20 years including four years of grace with interest at 8-1/2 percent per
annum. In addition, KPC has obtained letters of intent for financing from
export credit institutions and suppliers totalling about US$35.0 million.
The terms range from 7% to 8-1/2% of annual interest and repayment periods
of ten to twelve years including a grace period of about two to three years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Second Decade:   A Basic Economic Report on
Kenya" (Report No. 201-KE, dated January 15, 1974) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on February 20, 1974. It was followed by an agricul-
tural sector survey on Kenya (Report No. 254a-KE, dated December 20, 1973)
distributed on March 13, 1974. A special mission visited Kenya in February
1974 to review the economy's prospects and aid requirements in the light of
the changes in international prices. The mission reported to the Consultative
Group meeting held in Paris in April, 1974. The dialogue on economic and
social development strategy has been further intensified since. The acceler-
ated world inflation, including the oil crisis, had a serious impact on the
Kenyan economy. In response, the Government formulated an action program to
restructure the economy. We have had extensive discussions with the Govern-
ment about this action program in the context of our program loan negotiations
and in coordination with the IMF staff. Country Data Sheets are attached as
Annex I.
3.        Kenya's remarkable economic performance during the first decade of
independence was fully acknowledged in the Bank's 1974 Basic Economic Report.
Between 1964 and 1972, GDP grew by about 7 percent in real terms, which
allowed significant gains in per capita income despite a 3.5 percent popula-
tion growth rate. Less satisfactory aspects of development in this period
were lack of progress in distributing the benefits of development more
equitably and, in particular, growing unemployment and persistent poverty
at the lower end of the income scale. The dualistic nature of the economy
at Independence in 1963, with its concentration of wealth in the European
and Asian communities and serious poverty in the rural areas where 90 percent
of the population lived, was at the root of this unequal development, since
it proved difficult to change rapidly.



- 2 -
4.        In looking ahead into the second decade of Independence, the Basic
Economic Report concluded that Kenya did not really have the option to con-
tinue the past pattern of growth and that in order to maintain the momentum
of growth an essential restructuring of the growth process would be necessary.
The past growth rate has been supported by a high and growing investment rate
both in the public and the private sectors (with fixed capital formation
reaching as much as 25 percent of monetary GDP in the early 70s). Kenya's
domestic savings rate, about 20 percent, is also one of the highest in the
developing world. There were some signs, however, that savings were level-
ling off, which raised doubts whether resource mobilization would be able
to keep up with the pace of investment. Moreover, there were some indications
of a falling efficiency of resource use (in terms of rising capital output
ratios as well as the disappointing growth of employment).
5.        The most critical constraint, however, is the external resource
gap. Although Kenya's export performance, including the growth of tourism,
has been very satisfactory, the pattern of past development has made the
economy heavily dependent on imported raw materials and capital goods. With
increasing production and investments, imports have grown rapidly. Rising
import prices exacerbated the problem and a resource gap emerged which
could not be filled by available capital inflows from abroad.
6.        Thus even before the upsurge in world inflation experienced
during 1974, it had become clear that the Kenya economy would eventually
run into an unmanageable balance of payments problem, unless growth were
to be based on greater use of domestic factors of production, and more
efficient use of available resources. The Basic Economic Report advocated
first a restructured pattern of growth in favor of the directly productive
sectors, most immediately to agriculture but also to resource-based industry.
Second, it recommended factor price adjustments to move market prices closer
to real scarcity values and thus increase the efficiency of resource use
throughout the economy. This would hopefully permit to continue rapid
growth in the long run, a first prerequisite for an effective attack on
unemployment and rural poverty. At the same time, it would directly
promote growth of income in the rural areas.
7.        The Third Development Plan, 1974-1978, published in early 1974,
contains a development strategy which is broadly consistent with the Bank
recommendations; the Plan also reflects the findings of the major UNDP/ILO
mission which visited Kenya at the Government's request in 1972 and pub-
lished an innovative report on employment, incomes and equality. By re-
structuring the economic growth pattern, the Government hoped to achieve a
7.4 percent growth rate, which would exceed previous performance; employment,
rural development and more equitable distribution of income were to receive
more attention than in previous years. Employment would grow by 3.2 percent
per year. However, in 1974 the Kenyan economy was hit by unprecedented up-
surge in world inflation and a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade,
which precipitated a balance of payments crisis.



-3-
8.        The terms of trade deteriorated by about 9 percent in i974
(preliminary figures) as a result of soaring import prices which were
only partly offset by higher export prices especially during the earlier
months of the year. The volume of imports rose owing to stock buildup
while the volume of agricultural exports was depressed by drought. An
extraordinary trade deficit of nearly $450 million and current account
deficit of about $325 million (1973: $75 million) resulted.
9.        Although Kenya was one of the most seriously affected countries,
it managed to absorb the balance of payments effects of world price changes
without too much disruption during 1974. This was in part due to the
facts that initial foreign exchange reserves were at a comfortable level
and there was no shortage of the major staple food, maize. Net capital
inflows increased considerably and, moreover, the country got a favorable
response to its application for special financial assistance, especially
from the IMF, which provided $38 million under its oil facility. The
drawdown of reserves could thus be limited to $84 million. However,
the world inflation strongly affected the domestic price level through
the upsurge of prices of imported products. Serious domestic inflation
had occurred for the first time in 1973 when the cost of living went
up by 13 percent after a long period of average annual increases of
just over 2 percent. In 1974, the imported inflation reinforced the
internal pressure on the price level which resulted from reductions
in Kenya's crop and livestock production following prolonged drought;
the overall price increase may well reach 15 percent in 1975. GDP
growth in real terms slowed down to about 5 percent.     The country's
external position is expected to worsen considerably during 1975, owing
to a steeper decline in the terms of trade than in 1974, which would
result from a levelling off or a fall of export prices and a continued
increase of import prices. Under these assumptions, the current account
deficit in 1975 will exceed that of 1974, probably by about $40 million.
10.        The basic objective of the Government's action program is to
restructure the economy as fast as possible, so as to achieve maximum
economic development in the future under much more stringent balance of
payments conditions. The aim is to restrain imports in a way that has
a minimum impact on production in the next few years and to direct more
production into exports. It will therefore be necessary to compress
public and private consumption and to channel investments into the most
productive and quickly yielding uses, in particular into appropriate
import substitution and export promotion. In both activities the agr-
icultural sector will have a major role to play; by further improve-
ments to its already good performance in previous years it will also
have to absorb more labor and maintain incomes in a period of possible
slowdown of urban employment. Manufacturing, which will possibly become
the most dynamic sector in the long run, faces a difficult adjustment
process in the next few years. It will have to improve its resource
utilization and reduce its heavy import dependence in favor of a more
domestic resource based production.



- 4 -
11.       A crucial component of the Government's strategy is the attempt
to hold down the domestic rate of inflation to well below world inflation
so as to help bring about import substitution and export promotion by
price differentials. This decision implies that real incomes have to
fall; this hardship will be distributed between income groups in such
a way that the lowest income groups receive full compensation for cost
of living increases, while better-off members of society are made to
bear a proportionately larger share of the burden by partial compensa-
tion or no compensation at all.
12.       In addition to the income policy, the action program relies
mainly on global monetary and fiscal policies reinforced by agricultural
pricing policies and some specific administrative measures. Not only is
the oversee money supply limited by increases in interest rates and
direct restrictions on credit expansion, but the Government is also
directing credit into agriculture, manufacturing, export business and
tourism. On the fiscal policy side, Kenya's already good tax perform-
ance as well as the measures introduced in 1973 and 1974 to make the
system more progressive does not leave much room for substantial tax
increases. The Government nevertheless intends to raise some taxes
on non-essential domestic and imported products and to further improve
tax administration and revenue collection. Some other envisaged tax
measures (capital gains tax, improved inheritance tax and increased
urban property tax) seek to promote equity as well as revenue increases.
The discussion continues with the other Partner States in the East African
Community about a modification of the common external tariff towards more
uniform rates for consumer goods and capital goods.
13.       A revised three-year budget for FY76 to FY78 has been adopted,
which aims at reducing the growth of government consumption, promoting
exports, increasing production of agricultural commodities for import
substitution and use of more labor-intensive techniques. Recurrent
expenditure growth in real terms has been reduced to 6 percent from
11 percent projected in the 1974-1978 Development Plan, and expenditure
growth included in the Development Budget is set at 7.8 percent (as
against 12 percent). This required the politically difficult decision
to bring the rapidly accelerating recurrent expenditure for education
under control; the Government has now decided to allow only a 6 percent
annual increase, freezing education's share of recurrent expenditure at
32 percent. In the Development Budget, the share of agricultural and
water development was increased from 22 to 35 percent while that of
road and building construction was brought down from 22 percent to 18
percent; moreover, a significant shift away from trunk roads to second-
ary and rural access roads was incorporated within the road construction
program.
14.       In addition to these domestic measures, the Government is seek-
ing to accelerate disbursements under existing foreign financing commit-
ments and to obtain additional commitments, including quickly disbursing
assistance, in order to maintain some momentum of growth while the restruc-
turing policy is taking effect. Thanks to generally positive reactions



-5-
from donors, the external financing plan for 1975 is anticipating that
the larger part of the overall deficit can be covered through higher
inflows of conventional financing plus additional special inflows from
several bilateral sources as well as the IBRD; Kenya will also use sub-
stantial drawings on various IMF facilities. A similar effort would
have to be made for 1976 and following years to close the residual
balance of payments gap.
15.        In the past the Kenya Government has followed a conservative
policy with regard to external borrowing. Since Independence, Kenya has
accumulated new commitments at a rate of about 8.5 percent per year, or
somewhat less than the rate of growth of the economy as a whole in current
prices. As a result, Kenya's debt service burden is still comparatively
light (4 percent of exports in 1974, excluding Kenya's share of East
African Community debt), and the country could if necessary resort to
moderate borrowing on commercial terms during the next few difficult
years, without impairing long-term creditworthiness. At the end of 1974
total debt outstanding amounted to $722 million, of which $455 million had
been disbursed. About 36 percent of total external debt is now held by
the Bank Group (IBRD: 18.4 percent, IDA 17.7 percent), but because Bank
Group lending has only recently become a significant proportion of Kenya's
debt, debt service to the Bank Group in 1974 was still only about 13 per-
cent of all debt service payments (IBRD: 11.7 percent, IDA: 1.4 percent).
In addition to its own external public debt, Kenya is also jointly respon-
sible together with the other two Partner States for debts incurred by
the East African Community and its institutions, which amounted to some
$300 million (including undisbursed) at the end of 1974. Allowing for
a nominal one third of service payments on these debts, Kenya's total
debt service ratio is about 6 percent.
16.        In spite of the much greater need for external capital now
facing the country, Kenya is still following a cautious policy in her
external debt management, although the Government is making greater
use of suppliers' or export credits on favorable terms to finance some
of the larger projects now ready for implementation.     Under the assump-
tions made by the Bank staff about balance of payments developments,
Kenya's external debt will have to increase considerably over the next
decade if the expected balance of payments gap is to be filled. While
Kenya's economic performance certainly justifies substantial amounts
of concessionary financing, including IDA credits, these are available
in limited amounts only. It can therefore be expected that the terms of
borrowing would be on the average less favorable than Kenya has enjoyed
in the past. However, since export earnings will increase during the
period as well, barring major unforeseen developments in Kenya's terms
of trade, the debt service ratio would probably not exceed 11 percent
by the end of the 1970s. By that time it is estimated that the Bank
Group might hold about 35-40 percent of total disbursed debt and receive
over 20 percent of debt service payments. Beyond 1980, creditworthiness
will depend on Government ability to take action in the near future to
increase the productivity of investments, to reduce the import propensity
and to increase exports. The revised public investment program of Kenya



-6-
for the next few years represents a major step in this direction. Tem-
porary higher.debt service payments in the early 1980's may be followed
by a fall in debt service ratio in the latter part of the decade if the
Government's action program is successful. However, in spite of the
considerable efforts of the Government to improve domestic resource
mobilization, limitations on domestic resources are such that a sub-
stantial part of the costs of the program, including limited amounts
of local costs in the case of projects with a low foreign exchange com-
ponent may have to be financed from external sources.
17.       Kenya is one of the three Partner States belonging to the East
African Community. The 1967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is one
of the most far-reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agreements
in existence among sovereign states in the developing world. However, in
practice the degree of economic integration and cooperation among the
Partner States is much less than what was envisaged in the Treaty. Poli-
tical developments in the Partner States have created tension within the
Community and impaired the growth of interstate trade.      These difficul-
ties have been compounded by the balance of payments crisis which currently
faces all three Partner States.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYA
18.       Kenya has to date received thirteen Bank loans and seventeen
IDA credits amounting to $184.9 million and $135.7 million, respectively.
In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries of nine loans total-
ling $229.8 million which have been extended for the development of common
services (railways, ports, telecommunications and finance for industry)
operated regionally for the three Partner States of the East African
Community -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Annex II contains summary
statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya and the East African
Community Corporations, a summary of IFC investments in Kenya, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       Ongoing projects in Kenya are on the whole progressing satis-
factorily, but manpower constraints in engineering and other technical
fields continue to present problems and have slowed down progress on
some projects. Because of the difficulties in attracting qualified
expertise, no immediate remedy can be expected. However, the gradual
increase in suitably trained Kenyans to fill such positions should
eventually alleviate these problems.
20.       While our past lending to Kenya has been dominated by support
for infrastructure, our lending in recent years marks a departure. Last
year Kenya was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to obtain Bank Group
support for a population project. Recently, as a first step in providing
low-income dwellers in Nairobi with suitable housing, a site and service
project was presented to the Executive Directors. In support of the action
program adopted by the Government to restructure the economy and maintain



-7-
the momentum of growth in a period of serious balance of payments con-
straints, a Program Loan was recently presented to the Executive Direc-
tors. Our agricultural lending has been stepped up mainly as a result
of an expanded program of technical assistance both through our Regional
Mission in Eastern Africa and direct technical assistance to the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Government has now launched with assistance from
the Association, Canada, United Kingdom and United States, a five year
beef development program utilizing the grasslands in the Northeast of
Kenya. This project is expected to benefit some 170,000 people many
of whom are nomads. A tea factories project to ensure adequate process-
ing facilities for Kenya's high quality tea is under construction and a
project aimed at rehabilitation of some 130 group-owned farms is about to
start. A broadly conceived integrated crop production project, designed
to benefit a large number of small farmers, is about to be appraised and
preparation is now under way for an irrigation project in the Lower Tana
River Basin and for expansion of sugar production.
21.        Concurrently with efforts to support agricultural production,
we foresee a need for complementary development of rural infrastructure
and hope to assist rural access roads and rural water supply schemes in
the near future. We shall also shortly appraise a wildlife and tourism
project which will help provide infrastructure for new tourist circuits
and help spread benefits to rural communities.
22.       While the major emphasis will continue to be on agriculture and
the development of the rural economy, there is also a need for continued
support to infrastructure and services necessary for continued growth
of the economy. Apart from the proposed Project, a hydroelectric power
project is being presented to the Executive Directors shortly, and a loan
for a water supply scheme to provide Mombasa and surrounding rural areas
with safe water has been negotiated. In addition, a second tranche for
the Industrial Development Bank has been negotiated.
23.       The difficulties facing the East African Community Corpora-
tions referred to in paragraph 17 have affected the Bank's lending pro-
gram for the Community. The East African Railways Corporation (EARC)
has been the most severely affected. As a result of long delays by
the Partner States in approving increases in tariffs and restrictions
placed on the interstate transfer of corporate funds, the Corporation
has been unable to order essential spare parts and supplies with the
result that its operational capacity has deteriorated drastically. In
July 1974 the Partner States agreed on a package of financial measures
designed to rehabilitate the EARC including transfers of funds and in-
jection of additional capital. However, this agreement has been only
partially implemented. Restrictions have continued to be placed on the
interstate transfer of EARC and other Community Corporations funds, and
EARC's position has deteriorated further. Since EARC corporate funds are
not being transferred in accordance with the formula agreed, and Sh 60
million out of a total of Sh 150 million the Partner States agreed to
inject into EARC have not been paid, the EARC's right to make withdraw-
als from the Loan Account (from Loan No. 674-EA) has been suspended pend-
ing action on both these issues. Furthermore, in the current state of



-8-
uncertainty regarding the future of the Community Corporations, appraisal of
further proposed community projects for Corporations which may have structural
changes has been postponed until the issues mentioned above have been clari-
fied.
24.       IFC has committed a total of $25.9 million for three companies
in Kenya (Pan African Paper Mills, Ltd.; Kenya Hotel Properties, Ltd.: and
Tourism Promotion Services (Kenya Ltd.). As of April 30, 1975, IFC held for
its own account $17.9 million comprising $13.3 million of loans and $4.6
million of equity. IFC is discussing with the technical partner, SEDITEX,
and the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation a proposal to set
up a new textile mill and is also considering support for a sugar processing
plant.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Consumption
25.       During the past decade, Kenya's rapid economic growth has caused
a heavy demand for energy to serve the growing needs of the transport, agri-
cultural, power and industrial sectors. Agriculture, which accounts for
one-third of the GDP, and tourism, which ranks third as an earner of foreign
exchange, require a reliable and efficient system of transportation which
in turn depends on petroleum for energy. Industry, while still small in
relation to other sectors in the economy, is growing rapidly and is most
directly dependent on fuel and electricity.
26.       Kenya's principal sources of energy, as of 1973, were:   petroleum
products (including oil-based thermal power stations), 45 percent; hydro-
electricity, 7 percent; other fuels (firewood, charcoal, bagasse), 48 percent.
The latter is the principal source of energy for people in the rural areas,
almost wholly for cooking. Petroleum products and hydroelectricity provide
power for the modern sectors of the economy -- industry as well as transport-
ation (rail, road and air). In the absence of any known domestic crude oil
reserves and in view of the relatively small share of electricity consumption
in the energy sector, Kenya will have to depend on increasing volumes of
petroleum imports (mainly crude) to meet her energy requirements in the
modern sector of the economy.
27.       The recent increases in oil prices have drawn attention to the
possibility of using cheaper forms of energy. But Kenya has limited options.
The Government is now promoting industrial consumption of charcoal rather
than using it for exports. Nevertheless, environmental constraints will
eventually reduce its role. Bagasse, the waste of processed sugarcane, is
a cheap source of energy but is now being used increasingly in the production
of hard board pulp and paper and its role as a source of energy is therefore
limited. Electricity consumption is increasing, but, because Kenya has



-9-
already developed much of its hydroelectric potential for energy production,
she will have to rely on other forms of generating electricity, including
thermal, possibly geothermal, plants.
28.       Kenya is also considering measures that may change the consumption
pattern of energy, such as introducing appropriate pricing policy for elec-
tricity to reduce peak consumption and allowing the higher price of petro-
leum products to be passed on to the consumers so as to curtail unnecessary
consumption. But these measures are unlikely either to reduce consumption
substantially, nor alter the consumption pattern drastically in the short run.
29.       Recognizing that the present lack of domestic energy sources is a
serious constraint upon its economic development, the Government has, in the
current development Plan (1974-78), assigned priority to the search for oil,
natural gas and geothermal energy to guide the work of the Mines and Geolo-
gical Department in the Ministry of Natural Resources. However, no known
crude oil and natural gas reserves have been found and the geothermal energy
is still in its early stage of exploration. Although the recent exploration
program indicates that Kenya may have a large reservoir of geothermal energy,
its large-scale development may not be commercially available until the early
1980s.
Petroleum Products
30.       Petroleum products are by far the most important source of energy
in the modern sector. Today they account for almost 80 percent of all energy
consumed in the industrial, comercial and transport sectors. With the
growing role of these sectors in Kenya's economy, petroleum products are
likely to increase their share in the total energy consumption of the country.
31.       The demand for petroleum products includes (i) motor gasoline,
kerosene and diesel, known as "white products" and (ii) fuel oil known as
"black products". The demand for "white products" has been growing faster
than the 7 percent real growth of the Kenyan economy. During the period
1969-73, the consumption of white products grew by about 12 percent a year.
Because of the probable impact of increased prices on the Kenyan economy
and given the high consumption level already reached, forecasts indicate a
slowdown in petroleum products consumption. Between 1975-79 growth in
consumption of white oil products in Kenya is expected to decrease from the
high 12 percent annual average to about 7 percent, and then taper off to
about 5.5 percent by 1996. Uganda, which is expected to consume some 20-30
percent of refined output in Kenya, is expected to average about 7 percent
rate of growth of consumption in the earlier years and then fall to about 4
percent in the latter period.
Present Refining Facilities
32.       As Kenya produces no crude oil, all requirements have to be imported.
Kenya does, however, refine its oil. The East African Oil Refinery (EAOR) at
Mombasa, which is owned 50 percent by the Kenyan Government and 50 percent by



10 -
major oil companies, has an annual capacity of 4.3 million tons.   Because of
the lack of sufficient facilities at the refinery, the distributors have to
import certain products in small quantities to supply the market, while re-
exporting unwanted heavier fuels. EAOR plans to install a cracking facility
in the future to meet the demand. The refinery will then be fully able to
meet demand for several years.
Transport of Petroleum, Products
33.       Most of the refined oil products find markets in Nairobi and up
country in the populous southwestern part of Kenya. About one third of the
products are carried on beyond Kenya to destinations in Uganda and a small
portion is transported on to Rwanda and parts of Zaire and Southern Sudan.
34.       Until 1967, the East African Railways Corporation (EARC), a Com-
munity-owned railway, carried almost all petroleum products from Mombasa to
Nairobi and up country destinations. This near monopoly was protected by
the poor condition of the Mombasa-Nairobi road. However, between 1967 and
1969 the road was paved and the tanker-trucks began competing with EARC in
carrying petroleum products. In 1970 EARC reduced its tariff for petroleum
products for the Mombasa-Nairobi trip to about KSh 90 per ton, as compared
with about KSh 120 per ton by truck. Nevertheless, EARC was not able to
carry all the petroleum products traffic offered, and by 1973 its share of
the oil traffic, for both black and white oil on this route has settled at
about 50 percent. As a result of growing petroleum traffic, the highway has
been carrying far larger numbers of heavy tankers than it was originally
designed for.
35.       Recent petroleum price increases have pushed up trucking costs
more than rail costs, but EARC is still unable to increase its share of the
oil traffic due to shortage of wagons and lack of line capacity. This is
exacerbated by its financial problems and consequent inability to order
purchases and make other investments in time. In the absence of an oil
pipeline the EARC would have to make substantial investments to increase its
capacity by completing its dieselization program, lengthening passing loops
and strengthening wagon couplings. These improvements would enable the EARC
to cope with the oil traffic up to 1985, by which time a costly centralized
traffic control system would have to be installed, a system which would
otherwise not be required until the late nineties.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The Government of Kenya has for a long time considered the pos-
sibility of constructing an oil pipeline between Mombasa and Nairobi.    In
the sixties, a study was undertaken of the feasibility of an oil pipeline
extending from Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda. As this proposal would yield
a low return to the project, the alternative of constructing the pipeline
to Nairobi only was considered. A feasibility study carried out for the



Kenya Government by Pencol Engineering Consultants, in association with the
Economist Intelligence Unit and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., found that
the project would provide for the most reliable and least costly means of
transporting petroleum products from Mombasa to Nairobi. On the basis of
these findings, the Government of Kenya requested Bank Group assistance and
the project was appraised in June/July 1974. The mission's report entitled
"Kenya: Appraisal of Mombasa/Nairobi Oil Products Pipeline Project" (No.
740a-KE, dated June 6, 1975) is being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. A Loan and Project summary is given in Annex III. Negotiations
were held in Washington in April, 1975. The delegation was led by Mr. S.
Ogembo, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power and Communications.
Project Description
37.       The proposed pipeline project consists of (i) a pipeline from
Mombasa to Nairobi, 452 kilometers long, 14 inches in diameter; (ii) four
electric powered pump stations, with related instruments, one of which will
be located in Mombasa and the other three at approximately equal distances
along the pipeline route; (iii) a 2 kilometer lateral pipeline, 14 inches in
diameter, from the main pipeline to the new Nairobi Airport at Embakasi;
(iv) storage facilities at Nairobi; (v) a supervisory control and communications
system; (vi) buildings including depots and operating staff living quarters
at pump stations located some distance from populated areas; and (vii) staff
training.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
38.       The cost of the project, including interest during construction,
all contingencies and local taxes, is estimated at US$82.9 million, of which
US$61.2 million, or 74 percent, is the foreign exchange component; local taxes
are estimated at about US$7.0 million, or 9 percent of the estimated project
cost. The estimated cost includes contingencies of 31 percent of the basic
project cost. Interest during construction is estimated at $7.0 million.
39.       The project would be financed by the proposed Bank loan, export/
suppliers' credits and the Government. The proposed Bank loan of US$20 mil-
lion (about 24 percent of the total project cost and about 33 percent of
the foreign exchange cost) would be used to finance the foreign exchange
costs of the line pipe and related pipe materials and interest during cons-
truction on the Bank loan. The main civil works and sophisticated hardware
would be financed through export/suppliers' credits. The Borrower advertised
internationally for interested contractors and suppliers and has contacted
appropriate export credit agencies for stand-by financing in case its
national wins the bid. Six countries have now offered commitment in a total
amount of about $35 million meeting about 80-85 percent of the total foreign
exchange costs of the main civil works and the materials and equipment for
depots and pump stations. The terms, which range between 7 to 8-1/2% of annual
interest and repayment periods over eight to ten years after commissioning,
are acceptable. The remainder of the project cost of US$27.9 million will be
financed locally by Government equity participation of about $11.2 million,
and the balance by a subordinated loan of US$16.7 million equivalent.

40.       Because of the uncertainties concerning supply and price of the
line pipe, the Government and the Kenya Pipeline Company decided to tender
for line pipe prior to Board presentation. The bids, which were invited
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on International Competitive
Bidding, are now being evaluated and the lowest evaluated bidder would be
awarded the contract shortly after Board consideration of this project. The
bids are within costs estimated by the appraisal mission.
The Borrower
41.       The Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (KPC), the Borrower, was in-
corporated on September 15, 1973, under the Companies Act of the Laws of
Kenya. The capital of the Company is presently Kh50,000 divided into 50,000
shares of Kbl.O each. Of this 49,999 shares have been taken up by the
Treasury and one share by the Ministry of Power and Corumunications. The
Government has agreed to augment its share capital to K L 4 million
(US$11.2 million) and will-be the sole shareholder of the company.   (Section
2.02 of Guarantee Agreement). KPC is expected to operate like a commercial
undertaking, and, as stipulated in its Articles of Association, the civil
servants on the Board will be aided by directors having appropriate technical
and business experience.
42.       The Government has already appointed competent key management staff,
including the Managing Director and the Technical and Administration Managers,
who all received training in the U.K. under a program worked out jointly by
Pencol and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA). Semi-skilled and unskilled
staff will be recruited later and given on-the-job training during the
construction period of the project.
Execution of the Project
43.       KPC will carry out the construction work, with the assistance
of consultants (Pencol). The construction schedule is tight, but a great deal
of the engineering, geological survey and the associated work has already
been carried out. Detailed engineering for the civil works has been completed
and tenders are currently being invited.
44.       KPC has agreed to make the necessary arrangements, prior to the
commissioning of the project scheduled for the end of 1977, for the following:
(i) lease of the necessary radio channels from the Mombasa-Nairobi microwave
link with East African Post and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPT); (ii)
turnkey operation by a specialist organization of the hydrant fueling system
being built at Nairobi International Airport; (iii) agreement with East African
Oil Refinery Limited, covering products receipts, custody transfer, quality,
accountability, volumes to be transported, monthly and daily transport fore-
casts and other operational matters; (iv) agreements with East African Railways
Corporation and the oil companies concerned, covering transport and delivery
of products at Nairobi, financing of line field, custody transfer, product
quality, loss and accountability and other operational matters (Section 4.06
of Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
45.       Provision has been made in the project for training specialized
maintenance personnel and for purchasing specialized equipment to maintain
and repair the facilities. The pipeline right-of-way will be maintained
under service arrangements with local contractors as this requires standard
earth-moving equipment; this is an acceptable arrangement which will mini-
mize maintenance costs. The project also provides for construction of two
maintenance depots in Mombasa and Nairobi.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Procurement for line pipe and related materials to be financed
from the proposed Bank loan is being undertaken on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. A margin of
preference of 15 percent or the level of customs duties and other import
taxes to be paid by non-exempt importers, whichever is lower, will be granted
to domestic manufacturers of line pipe in Kenya. Procurement of the main
civil works, equipment and mmaterials, to be financed by export/suppliers'
credits, is being undertaken on an international competitive bidding basis
but will be confined to those suppliers or countries offering financing.
47.       Disbursements under the Bank loan will be made on the basis of
100 percent of the CIF of imported or 90% of locally produced line pipe and
related materials and interest during construction on the Bank loan.
KPC Finances
48.       The average financial cost of transporting white petroleum products
is estimated at KSII 25 per ton (KSH 20 per m3) over the project period (20
years) including depreciation and interest, compared with the average long-
run variable rail cost estimated at KSh 56 per ton (KSh 45 per m3). There
is, therefore, a wide range within which KPC can fix its tariff for the
±lombasa-Nairobi movement. An important consideration in deciding the exact
level of tariff is Kenya Government's expressed intention not to allow the
savings in the transport of white oil products to be passed on to the oil
companies or white oil products consumers. The tariff is therefore set at
KSh 90 per m3 or only slightly lower than the present rail tariff (Ksh
95 per m3). (Section 3.04 of Guarantee Agreement.) Apart from ensuring
KPC's financial viability, this tariff should yield a net profit, after taxes,
of US$5.6 million in KPC's first year of operation and increase to about
US$33.6 million in 1997. Being the sole shareholder of the Company, the
Government will obtain KPC's surplus funds in the form of dividends. The debt:
equity ratio is relatively low(87:13) However, in view of the low market risks,
the high tariffs and a reasonable debt service coverage, this ratio is accept-
able.
Impact on EARC
49.       Although the marginal cost of transporting the oil by the pipeline
is much lower than by the Railways, the completion of the oil pipeline
will have some important implications 'or EARC's overall operations.    The



- 14 -
Mombasa-Nairobi line carries the heaviest traffic of EARC, with a freight
volume of about 3.5 million tons in 1972, compared with 2.6 million tons on
the Nairobi-Nakuru route, the second most heavily used section. Profits on
the Mombasa-Nairobi line have in the past enabled the railway to offset
losses on some of the uneconomic sections and services of the system, and
to maintain relatively lower tariffs on low-value bulk commodities which
have benefitted all three Partner States of the Community. Construction of
the proposed pipeline will reduce EARC's ability to continue cross-subsidiza-
tion within the system, unless EARC increases its tariffs.
50.       Differences among the Partner States liave prevented EARC from in-
troducing measures that may improve its operat'ons, and the Partner States
are now reviewing and preparing for partial decentralization with a view to
ensuring that each Partner State will be responsible for its own section of
the Railways including financial results. It is expected that by 1978,
when the proposed pipeline is scheduled to go into operation, EARC will have
completed its decentralization. In any event, the authority responsible for
the Railways operations in Kenya is expected to take steps necessary to
alleviate the financial impact stemming from the loss of white oil traffic,
estimated at Kb1.5 - 2.0 million in the first year of pipeline operation and
declining to about Kh 0.5 million by 1981. These steps include: (a) utili-
zation of the rolling stock released by the pipeline for carrying black oil
on the Mombasa-Nairobi section now being carried by road and increased oil
traffic beyond Nairobi; (b) utilization of line capacity released between
Mombasa and Nairobi to carry an increasing share of other commercial traffic;
and (c) further selective tariff adjustments, particularly on services and
sections which do not cover costs. These measures should enable the railway
to make up for the loss of white oil traffic on the Mombasa-Nairobi Section.
Ecological Aspects
51.       The pipeline will lessen air pollution inasmuch as it will reduce
fuel consumption by some 425,000 tons over 20 years of rail and road traffic,
now hauling the white oil products.   The pump stations will be electrically
powered, thus transferring the air pollution problem to large power-generating
stations where the problem can more effectively be dealt with than in loco-
motives or road vehicles. Furthermore, since the pipeline will be buried and
will follow the natural contour of the ground, it will not create drainage or
animal migration problems. It will be a silent, nearly invisible and clean
means of overland transport. There are only two relatively minor river
crossings and the pipeline will be buried at safe depth under the riverbed.
Project Justification
52.       When the proposed pipeline goes into operation, it will provide
a much less expensive and more reliable means of transporting most white
oil products as compared to the current mode of oil transport by rail/road
from Mombasa to Nairobi. The long-run economic cost of moving one ton of
white oil products from Mombasa to Nairobi by pipeline has been estimated
at only KSh 22 as compared with about KSh 56 by rail and KSh 140 by road.
In addition to this direct benefit, the pipeline will also release substantial



capacity on the Mombasa-Nairobi section of the railways for other traffic
whose volume is expected to continue to grow.
53.       Without the pipeline in operation, a major program of reconstruc-
tion on rail and road would be necessary if the forecast petroleum products
demand is to be met. The construction of the proposed pipeline will help
avoid some of these investments and defer others for some years. These
avoidable investments due to the construction of the pipeline, together with
savings in operating costs, yield a 37% economic return on the investments
in the project.
54.       The proposed project will make an important contribution to Kenya
Government's budgetary resources. The project will contribute to the Govern-
ment's revenues about US$1.7 million in 1979, rising to US$50.0 million in
1997> in the form of dividends and income tax on KPC's operating income.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Kenya Pipeline
Company Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Kenya and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Special features of the draft Loan and
Guarantee Agreements are referred to in paragraphs 39 and 61. Except as
noted the draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for pipeline project
loans.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Loan 639 - Highways: $23.5 million Loan of October 10, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Construction is substantially completed. There
has been a 45 percent increase above original cost estimates due mainly to
design changes.
Loan 641 - Forest Plantation: $2.6 million Loan of November 7, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. Progress is satisfactory and disbursements
proceeded faster than envisaged. The Loan was almost fully drawn down a year
before Closing Date. Planting and technical aspects are satisfactory.
Credit 185 - Education: $6.1 million Credit of ILay 20, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. Construction is proceeding at a slower
rate than anticipated. As remedial action has been taken, it is expected
that all project institutions except two,will be completed prior to the
Closing Date. An extension of the Closing Date of about 12 months is likely
to be required in order to complete the two project items lagging behind.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems whicli are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 714 - Water Supply: $8.4 million Loan of November 7, 1969;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976. Good progress has been made on the main
project items, and water was delivered in Nairobi on schedule in March 1974.
A twelve-month postponement of the Closing Date, however, was required to
enable completion of ancillary items.   The Water and Sewerage Department is
still experiencing staffing shortages in its engineering and commercial
sections due to inability to attract and retain staff. The financial results
of water operations are generally satisfactory and water tariffs have now
been increased. Cost overruns, which are mainly due to local cost increases,
are about 31 percent over the appraisal estimates.
Credit 224 - Road Maintenance:   $12.6 million Credit of December 2S,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977. This project is progressing well, although
its final completion is now expected to be delayed till December 1976 -
eighteen months behind the original schedule. The delay is due to some
unforeseen difficulties experienced in acquisition of land and procurement
of steel required for construction of the workshops. Most of the equipment
has been received and installed,and the Highway Training Center is in opera-
tion. While the majority of the senior posts in the Roads Branch have been
filled, a few are still vacant due to difficulties in finding suitably qual-
ified specialists.
Loan 745 - Kamburu Hydroelectric: $23.0 million Loan of June 7,
1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The project was commissioned in
August 1974 and there are only a few minor details outstanding. Cost escala-
tion was 7 percent, principally the result of currency fluctuations, the
imposition of a sales tax in 1973 and an increase in engineering costs. The
Closing Date has been postponed from June 30, 1975 to December 31, 1975
because some retention monies are not due till then.
Credit 276 - Highways: $22.0 million Credit of June 5, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976. This project, which is jointly financed by
a Swedish Credit of $6.0 million, made a slow start due to a review of paving
standards undertaken by Government and consequent delays in obtaining govern-
mental approvals to issue tenders. Because of high bid prices and specifica-
tion changes, total estimated cost of the project may exceed the appraisal
estimates by over 25 percent.
Loan 826 - Nairobi Airport: $29 million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The major contracts have been awarded,
and work has commenced. Inadequate supervision by the key contractor and
administrative delays by the Government have led to delays in the physical
execution of the project. Financial and organizational problems persist.
There is likely to be a cost overrun of about $10.5 million. Some key
positions,including that of the Airport Mana,er,still remain unfilled.     The
project is now expected to be completed by December 31, 1976 rather than by
December 1975 as originally anticipated. The Closing Date of this Loan may
have to be extended to December 31, 1977.

Credit 344 - Agricultural Credit: $6.0 million Credit of
November 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. The Agricultural Finance
Corporation has started a second phase of lending operations, following the
completion of the first under Credit 105. Progress is satisfactory and
disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Loan 932 - Hlighways: $29.0 million Loan of September 6, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977. This Toan was made effective on November 9,
1973.  Owing to a review of paving standards, bids have yet to be invited for
about 30 percent of the works. Cost overruns are likely to be substantial.
Loan 946 - Industrial Development Bank: $5.0 million Loan of
November 29, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1976. The Loan has been fully
committed and negotiations for a second tranche have been substantially
completed. So far about $3.5 million has been disbursed.
Credit 468 - Population: $12.0 million Credit of April 1, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This Credit became effective on July 31, 1974.
The construction for this project is estimated to be about 6-8 months behind
schedule. There have also been some delays in the employment of technical
experts.
Credit 477 - Livestock: $21.5 million Credit of June 5, 1974;
Closing Date: December 21, 1980. This Credit was declared effective on
December 2, 1974. Work on the ranching component is now proceeding, but the
project is behind schedule.
Loan 993 - Tea Factories: $10.4 million Loan of June 5, 1974;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1980.   This Loan became effective September 23, 1974.
Contracts for the first four tea factories have been let but the tendering
for remaining tea factories is behind schedule.
Credit 537/Loan 1093 - Group Farms Rehabilitation Credit and Loan
of March 27, 1975; Closing Date:   December 31, 1981.   This Credit and Loan
is not yet effective.
Credit 543/Loan 1105 - Site and Service Project of May 6, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980. This Credit and Loan is not yet effective.

Loan No. 674 EA - Third Railways Project: 42.4 million Loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976.    This Loan was suspended on
February 13, 1975. The reasons for suspension and conditions for lifting
the suspension are discussed in para. 23 of this report.
Loan No. 638 EA - Second ilarbours Projects: $35.0 million Loan of
August 25, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975. The Harbours Corporation
is in a healthy cash position although there have been problems in transfer-
ring funds from regional offices to headquarters. Damage to a partially
completed pier has delayed project implementation. It is now expected that
the construction will be finished in mid-1975. Legal questions resulting
from the damage are under study by the Government.
Loan No. 865 EA - Third Harbours Project:   $26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. A delay of six months is
expected in completing civil works under this project. Cost overruns have
been experienced in some project items. The situation is under study by
the Corporation, which will shortly issue a plan for speeding implementation.
Loan No. 843 EA - East African Development Bank: $8.0 million
Loan of June 28, 1972; Closing Date: Mlay 31, 1976. Operations of the Bank
have been decentralized with a resulting strengthening of the Bank's super-
visory capability. Management problems associated with decentralization have
largely been rectified so that the pace of bank operations is expected to
quicken in FY76. Nearly $6.5 million of the loan has been committed.
Loan No. 675 EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million
Loan of May 25, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Probleris within the EAC
have only marginally affected the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
due to the considerable existing decentralization of operation authority.
Deterioration of the corporate cash position and rate of return has been
slight in comparison to other Community Corporations; the situation will be
improved by a pending rate increase.
Loan No. 914 EA - Third Telecommunications Project:    $32.5 million
Loan of June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Procurement is
generally on schedule with $20 million committed and the balance near tender
stage. All major items are expected to be completed by mid-1975, except two
microwave links which, due to long lead time for delivery, will be delayed
by 18 months.
