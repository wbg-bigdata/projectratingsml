KENYA
APPRAISAL OF MONBASA-NAIROBI OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        During the past decade Kenya's rapid economic growth has caused a
heavy demand for white petroleum products to supply the energy needs of the
transport, agricultural, power and industrial sectors. Agriculture, which
accounts for a third of the gross domestic product, and tourism, which now
earns more foreign exchange than any single commodity, require a reliable
and efficient system of transportation which depends on petroleum for energy.
Substantial investments, including 14 transport-related Bank Group loans and
credits to Kenya and the East African Community, have been directed towards
improving the railways, ports, highways and aviation. All growth trends
indicate increasing demand for white petroleum products since these have no
ready substitutes as energy sources.
ii.       It is the Kenya Government's intention, and the objective of this
project, to provide for the most efficient, reiiable and least costly means
of transportation for petroleum products from Mombasa to Nairobi which, for
the volumes involved, is provided by a pipeline, not the least because a pipe-
line will use far less fuel than alternative modes. By relieving the railway
and the highway of the white oil traffic, the project will enable these
modes to improve their capacity for handling other traffic which is forecast
to increase substantially. It will also allow the railway to carry con-
siderable volumes of other traffic (including oil traffic the proposed pipe-
line will not serve) which might otherwise have to move by road at much higher
cost.
iii.      The project will provide a 452 km, 14" diameter pipeline from
Mombasa to Nairobi, four pump stations initially with3a total of 20,800 hp,
additional storage tank facilities of about 100,000 m in the Nairobi area,
and automatic and manual telecommunications and control systems.
iv.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, local taxes
and interest during construction, is estimated at K1 29.6 million (US$ 82.9
million equivalent), of which KU 21.9 million (US$ 61.2 million) will be the
foreign exchange component. Most of the contracts are expected to be let to
foreign contractors in view of the technical expertise required and lack of
local experience in pipelines.
v.        The Bank loan of US$ 20.0 million represents 24% of the total pro-
ject cost and will finance almost 33% of the total foreign exchange cost.
The Borrower will be the Government-owned Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), with
the Government as guarantor. The pipe supply contract to be financed from
the loan will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
vi.       The average economic cost of transporting petroleum products through
the pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi is estimated at KSh 22 per ton over the



- ii -
assumed 20-year project period, compared with a rail cost gf about KSh 56 and
the present rail tariff of KSh 119 (equivalent to KSh 95/m ). The Kenya
Government has indicated its intention not to pass on any part of the trans-
pqrt cost savings either to the oil companies or to the consumers, but to
maintain a tariff close to the present rail tariff and to use the budgetary
rqivenues generated by KPC for national development purposes.  When KPC goes
into operation, the revenues generated by it annually could amount to KI 0.6
million in 1979, rising to Kn 18 million in 1997.
vii.      Financial projections indicate that KPC will generate substantial
piofits and cash surpluses. The savings in economic costs yield an economic
return of more than 30%, even on the assumption that the railway will be able
to achieve operational improvements much faster than is likely in practice.
vi,ii.    On the basis of the agreements reached during loan negotiations and
summarized in Chapter VII, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$20.0 million to the Kenya Pipeline Company, guaranteed by the Government
of Kenya, at 8-1/2 interest, for 20 years, including a grace period of four
years.



KENYA
APPRAISAL OF MOMBASA-NAIROBI OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (KPC) has requested a Bank loan
of US$ 20 million (KE 7.i4 million equivalent) to help finance construction
of a white oil products pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi, a distance of about
452 km. KPC is a Government-owned corporation recently set up under the
Kenya Companies Act to construct and operate oil pipeline facilities in Kenya.
KPC will only transport white petroleum products through the proposed pipeline,
while title and ownership of the products will remain with the individual oil
companies which distribute them. The total cost of the project, including
contingencies and interest during construction, is estimated at K1 29.6 million
(US$ 82.9 million equivalent).
1.02      The proposed Bank Loan will cover about 24% of the entire project
cost or nearly 33% of the foreign exchange cost, estimated at US$61.2 million
equivalent, including US$ 0.44 million for the overseas training of suitable
management and senior technical staff and on-the-job training for other operat-
ing staff. To help meet the balance of the foreign costs, the Government has
arranged export financing and/or suppliers' credits amounting to US$35.0 mil-
lion equivalent. It will help finance the remaining expenditures of US$27.9
million equivalent, partly as equity and partly as loan.
1.03      The Bank loan, which will be guaranteed by the Government of Kenya,
will be made to KPC which will implement the project. The loan is on the
usual Bank terms with 8-1/2% interest and repayment over 20 years, including
four years of grace.
1.04      This report is based on a feasibility study carried out for the
Kenya Government by Pencol Engineering Consultants (U.K.) in association
with Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.
(PMM), and the findings of an appraisal mission in June-July 1974 consisting
of Messrs. J. Ristorcelli (Engineer), M.S. Parthasarathi and D. Ngangmuta
(Economists) and K. Rodley (Financial Analyst). Mr. B. Rollins (Financial
Analyst) participated in completing the appraisal.
*
II. BACKGROUNI)
A. The Economy
2.01      Although the economy of Kenya is largely based on agriculture,
which provides about 30-35% of GDP and about 40% of export earnings, trans-
port and industry are of growing importance accounting for 7% and 12% of GDP,
respectively. Another important sector is tourism which has grown at an



-2-
annual compound rate of about 20% since 1963 and is the most important
single foreign exchange earner; there were about 400,000 foreign visitors
to the country in 1973. Despite the higher fuel prices and world economic
uncertainties, Kenya's income from tourism has held up remarkably well, and
Nairobi airport is being modernized and expanded to handle this increasing
traffic (under Loan 826-KE).
2.02      Like most developing countries, Kenya is highly dependent on for-
eign trade. The port of Mombasa, which is the country's only international
deep-water port, is administered as a joint East African Community (EAC)
service by the East African Harbours Corporation, which also administers
all other ports in Kenya and Tanzania. Most exports of primary products
and imports of fuel, equipment, machinery and consumer goods for Kenya as
well as for neighboring Uganda, Rwanda, and parts of Zaire, pass through
Mombasa.
2.03      Kenya's major inland transport facilities are concentrated in
the 1,000-km corridor between Mombasa and the border with Uganda, passing
through Nairobi and the populous southwestern area of the country. The rail-
way system (a Community service) consists of about 2,000 km of line in Kenya,
1,200 km in Uganda and 2,500 km in Tanzania; the road network in Kenya is
about 47,000 km. The country is also well served by international and domestic
air transport.
2.04      During the past decade, Kenya's economy has maintained a sustained
real growth of close to 7% per annum. Growth of light industrial production
and of transport sector services has matched the general economic trend, and
the demand for petroleum products 1/ increased from 680,000 tons in 1963 to
about 1.39 million tons in 1973, an average annual growth of 7.5%. Of this,
some 300,000 tons and 860,000 tons respectively were white oil products,
with an annual growth of 10.5%.
B. Sources of Energy Supply
2.05      Kenya's principal sources of energy, as of 1973, were:  petroleum
products (including oil-based thermal power stations) 45%; hydro-electricity
7%; and other fuels (firewood, charcoal, bagasse) 48%.  The latter are the
principal sources of power for people in the rural areas, almost wholly for
cooking. Petroleum products and hydro-electricity provide power for the
modern sectors of the economy - industry as well as transportation (rail,
road and air). A small volume of imported coal is used in cement manufac-
ture. A recent "Analysis of the Energy Situation in Kenya" by the Govern-
ment concluded that, in the absence of any major hydroelectric potential
1/   Includes (i) motor gasolines, kerosene and diesel oils, known as "white"
products; and (ii) fuel oils known as "black" products.



-3 -
beyond those already known and with no known domestic crude oil reserves,
Kenya would have to depend on hydroelectric power from Uganda and on in-
creasing volumes of petroleum imports (mainly crude) to meet her energy
requirements.
2.06      At present the principal source of supply of petroleum products
to Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda is the East African Oil Refinery (EAOR) at
Mombasa, which has an annual capacity of 4.3 million tons. The refinery,
owned 50% by the Kenya Government and 50% by Shell, B.P., Esso and Caltex,
refines imported Arabian crude on behalf of all the oil distributors. Be-
cause of the lack of cracking facilities at the refinery, the distributors
have to import certain products in small quantities to supply the market
while re-exporting the surplus of some products. EAOR plans to install a
cracking facility which will help to reduce both the import of finished
products needed by the domestic market and the re-export of unwanted heavier
fuels. The refinery will then be fully able to meet area demand for several
years.
C. Past Consumption and Forecast Requirements of White Petroleum Products
2.07      The products to be transported by the proposed pipeline are:
motor gasoline (premium and regular), kerosene (including aviation jet fuel),
and automotive and industrial diesel oils. The market area includes all of
Kenya (except the coastal area, served directly from the refinery), Uganda,
Rwanda, eastern Zaire and southern Sudan, with Kenya accounting for about 70%
of the market and Uganda for another 20%.
2.08      The consumption of pipeable white products in the market area of
the proposed pipeline increased from about 350,000 tons in 1963 to about 1.05
million tons in 1973. Of the total, about one-fourth is motor gasoline,
another two-fifths kerosene (including jet fuel), and the remainder diesel
oils.
2.09      For forecasting purposes, the market was divided into three areas:
Kenya; Uganda; and other countries. Between 1975 and 1979 consumption is
expected to grow at close to 7% per year in Kenya and Uganda, and at 6% in
the adjacent areas served from the depots in Uganda. These expec-tations are
based on detailed oil company forecasts which provide the basis for their
marketing operations. Beyond 1979, the appraisal mission expects growth rates
to decline gradually to 5.5% for Kenya and 4.0% for Uganda and the other areas
(Table 1). These compare with a cumulative growth of 7% overall forecast by
the consultants in their feasibility study.
2.10      Total annual demand in the areas to be served by the pipeline will
increase from 1.2 million tons in 1975 to almost 4.4 million tons in 1997.
Details are given in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The forecast is conservative in
relation to the basic projection of a 7.5% GDP growth rate per year discussed



-4-
in the most recent Basic Economic Report on Kenya (201-KE of 1/15/74) but
quite realistic in the light of recent developments on the oil front and
their probable impact on the economies of Kenya and her neighbors.
D. Transport of Petroleum Products
2.11      Until 1967, the East African Railways Corporation (EARC) carried
almost all petroleum products from Mombasa to upcountry destinations. This
near-monopoly was protected by the poor condition of the Mombasa-Nairobi road.
Between 1967 and 1969 the road was paved and the Kenya Government also began
issuing licenses freely for tanker-trucks on this route. Up to 1970 road haul-
iers offered competitive rates for this traffic, but in that year EARC re-
duced its tariff for petroleum products for the Mombasa-Nairobi trip to about
KSh 90 per ton, compared with about KSh 120 by truck. However, EARC was unable
to carry all the traffic offered, and by 1973 its share of the oil traffic,
both white and black products, on this route had settled at about 50%. As a
result, and with growing petroleum traffic, the highway has been carrying far
larger numbers of heavy trucks than it was designed for, resulting in its
rapid deterioration. The riil rate has since been revised to KSh 119 per ton
(equivalent to KSh 95 per M ).
2.12      Recent petroleum price increases have pushed up trucking costs
more seriously than rail costs, but EARC is unable to increase its share of
the oil traffic due to operational shortcomings and shortage of rolling stock.
These are compounded by its financial problems and consequent inability to
order purchases and make other investments in time. For the future, although
the railway can be expected to achieve operational improvements, it may at
best be able to hold its present share of 50% in forecast oil traffic in the
absence of a pipeline.
III. THE KENYA PIPELINE COMPANY
A. Organization and Administration
3.01      .he Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (KPC) was incorporated on
September 15, 1973, under the Companies Act of the Laws of Kenya. The capi-
tal of the Company is KSh 1 million divided into 50,000 shares of KSh 20 each.
Of this, 49,999 have been taken up by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury
and one share by the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Communi-
cations. During loan negotiations, the Government agreed to increase its
participation in equity capital to KSh 80 million and not to permit any
private equity participation without the agreement of the Bank (para. 6.12).



- 5 -
3.02      KPC's Articles of Association are almost entirely based upon Table
A of the Companies Act, which effectively regulates limited liability companies
in Kenya. There will be not less than three and not more than seven directors.
KPC is expected to function on commercial lines and, as implied in its Articles,
civil servants on the board will be augmented by directors having appropriate
technical or business qualifications. The proposed organization structure is
given in Chart 1. The management team is headed by a Managing Director who
is assisted by a Technical Manager and a Finance and Administration Manager.
B. Staff Recruitment and Training
3.03      All three top management positions in KPC, including the post of
Managing Director have been filled. The candidates selected underwent an
initial program of training in the UK organized jointly by Pencol, the British
Pipeline Agency (BPA) and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell (PMM). The candidate for
the post of Operations Superintendent has also completed his training in the
UK. Appointees for the remaining supervisory posts and for skilled jobs will
undergo training in Kenya and abroad, under a program worked out by the con-
sultants and utilizing the facilities of BPA and others in the UK and of
technical institutions in Kenya. KPC expects to have them trained and in
place before the pipeline goes into operation.
3.04      Semi-skilled and unskilled staff will be recruited later.  Their
training will include on-the-job training during construction of the project
and at EAOR. All these training schemes are integral parts of the project.
C. Budget, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
3.05      Under their terms of reference, the consultants are to recommend
and implement the most suitable financial and accounting systems covering
budgetary controls, commercial and cost accounting, documentation methods,
procedures and internal checks as well as management information systems. In
this work, close coordination and consultation will be maintained with KPC's
external auditors.
3.06      The qualifications of auditors to registered companies are specified
in the Kenya Accountants (Designations) Ordinance. Their rights and duties
with regard to limited companies are regulated by the Companies Act. Whinney
Mlurray, a firm of chartered accountants, is now responsible for the annual
audit. During negotiations it was agreed that KPC will continue to retain as
external auditors a qualified and independent auditing firm acceptable to the
Bank.



- 6 -
3.07      In their financial forecasts the consultants have not itemized
insurance premia, but include them under general overhead costs, which are
based upon the past experience of other oil pipeline organizations. The
consultants are expected to advise KPC on the extent of cover required.
It was agreed during negotiations that, before pipeline operations
commence, KPC will arrange insurance for such risks and in such amounts
as are consistent with good commercial practice.
D. Maintenance
3.08      Provision has been made in the project for training specialized
maintenance personnel and for purchasing specialized equipment to maintain
and repair the facilities. The pipeline right-of-way will be maintained un-
der service arrangements with local contractors as this requires standard
earth-moving equipment; this is an acceptable arrangement which will result
in minimizing maintenance costs. The project also provides for construction
of two maintenance depots in Mombasa and Nairobi. These will be the head-
quarters for the maintenance staff and will house equipment, shops and stores.
E. Operational Arrangements
3.09      As soon as practicable, but in any case not later than six months
before commissioning the project, i.e. March 31, 1977, KPC has undertaken to
enter into contracts or make other suitable arrangements *to cover the fol-
lowing areas of operation:
(a)  Telecommunications - For the lease of the necessary radio
channels from the newly commissioned Mombasa-Nairobi micro-
wave link with the East African Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (EAPT). KPC should provide reasonable standby
facilities for radio links between the EAPT towers and the
pump stations.
(b)  Aircraft Fueling Facilities at Nairobi Airport - For the
turnkey operation of the hydrant fueling system being built
the new Nairobi International Airport.
(c)  Product Supply - With EAOR covering products receipt, cus-
tody transfer, quality, accountability, volumes to be trans-
ported, monthly and daily transport forecasts and other
operational matters.
(d)  Pro-!uc: Delivery - With EARC and the oil companies covering
t-ransport and delivery of products at Nairobi, custody
eranstf_, product quality, loss and accountability and other
cp at ,'oaI matters.



(e' TLine Fili - With the oil companies for financing the line
fill, the cost of which is approximately K7 1.6 million.
3.10      A two-km lateral pipeline will transport jet fuel directly from
the main pipeline to storage tanks at the new Nairobi International Airport.
Suitable instrumentation and valving will insure that only uncontaminated jet
fuel is delivered. From the tanks the jet fuel will be pumped into the
hydrant fueling system being built at the airport. A modern fueling in-
stallation dispensing with road tankers will thus be available to service
aircraft. Although the fueling 17acilities will be owned by KPC, they are
being financed separately from the project and will be operated by a spec-
ialist organization, probably one of tne oil companies.
3.11      As the different oil products arrive at the Nairobi depot, suit-
able instrumentation and valving will direct each type of fuel to segregated
storage. From the depot storage tanks the products will be pumped into the
oil companies' tanks located in depots adjoining the pipeline terminal, for
distribution to Nairobi and upcountry areas .Metering and recording facilities
will be provided at the terminal to ensure accurate product accountability
and custody transfer from KPC to the oil companies.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description of the Project
4.01      The proposed pipeline will initially transport in uncontaminated
batches 1.5 million tons of petroleum products per year. It will be able
to handle some 3.0 million tons p.a. without additional investments. When
this volume is reached, around 1989, additional pumps and storage tanks
will be provided for an ultimate annual capacity of some 5.0 million tons.
4.02      The project includes:
(a)  A 452 km pipeline, 14" in diameter, of high strength
(API 5Lx52) steel pipe of 0.280"/0.250" wall thick-
ness, including cathodic protection, starting at the
Mombasa refinery and terminating in the industrial
*                          area southeast of Nairobi.
(b)  Four electric powered pump stations, one of which
will be located in Mombasa and the other three at
approximately equal distances along the pipeline.
Each pump station will have two pumping units of
2,600 hp each (giving a total installed hp of 20,800)
and a building to house the control and electrical
equipment. Power will be supplied by the East
African Power and Light Company.



-8-
(c) A 2 km lateral pipeline, 14" in diameter, from the
main pipeline to the new Nairobi airport at Embakasi,
where a hydrant fueling system (not part of the pro-
ject) will be built to service the aircraft from
the pipeline storage tanks described in (d) below.
Although a smaller diameter pipe would suffice here,
design, construction and operational convenience
favor the 14" size.
(d)  Storage capacity of about 40,000 m3 for jet fuel at
Nairobi airport and about 64,000 m3 for gasolines,
general purpose kerosene, and diesel oils at the
Nairobi receiving depot.
(e) Meters and related facilities near pump station No. I
at Mombasa which, together with the refinery tankage,
will provide accurate accounting and custody trans-
fer of the products from EAOR to KPC.
(f)  A receiving and transfer depot in the industrial
area of Nairobi adjacent to the oil companies'
distribution depots. This will comprise: (i) meter-
ing and related facilities for proper accounting
(in conjunction with the storage tanks) and custody
transfer from KPC to the oil companies, (ii) pumps
and connecting pipelines to deliver products to the
adjoining oil company depots, and (iii) an office
building which will accommodate the administrative and
Nairobi operating staffs.
(g) Two maintenance depots, one at the Mombasa pump
station and one at the Nairobi depot, which will
accommodate maintenance staff, spares, workshops
and maintenance equipment.
(h) Living quarters for operating staff at pump sta-
tions 3, 5 and 7 since they will be located some
distance from populated areas.
k-)  A supervisory control and telecommunica _  io_system
which will provide operational control from Nairobi
and will use exclusive radio frequency channels pro-
vided by EAPT's newly commissioned micro-wave system.
(j) Staff training (para 3.04).
4.03      The proj ect will require constructio-n of ad- izinal storage
capacity and suction booster pumps within the EADR compoun;d to move the
products from Z.-L. tanks to the first pump staLt.on on :Ue pipeline.  These



facilities are estimated to cost Kfi 300,000 and will be operated by EAOR.
The Government, as 50% shareholder, has already instructed EAOR to finance
and carry out these works.
B. Cost Estimates
4.04      The total cost of the project, including contingencies, local taxes
and interest during construction, is estimated at KE 29.6 million, or US$82.9
million equivalent, in 1974 prices. Of this amount, Kb 21.9 million (US$61.2
million equivalent), or 74%, is the foreign exchange component. Local taxes
are estimated at Kb 2.5 million (US$7.0 million equivalent). Interest
during construction will amount to Kb 2.5 million (US$7.0 million).
4.05      A physical contingency allowance of 7% has been provided on all
items in the project except for pipe on which a contingency of only 1% has
been allowed, since detailed route surveys have already been carried out.
The price contingency amounts to 36% of the basic project cost, excluding
pipe cost, and is calculated by applying the following percentages of
escalation:
Year             Construction Costs              Material Costs
1974                      18                            14
1975                      15                            11
1976                      12                             7.5
1977                      12                             7.5
4.06      A large item in the total cost which poses price uncertainties is
line pipe. In early 1973 it was selling at approximately US$ 200-300 per
ton in world markets; by May 1974 the price had risen to about US$ 1,000
but has tended to fall somewhat since then. Under competitive bidding
pipe is currently available in world markets at prices ranging from US$600
to 700 per ton, CIF. The project will require some 26,000 tons of pipe and
a price of US$650/ton CIF Mombasa is used in the estimate, with a 6% pro-
vision for price escalation. An increase in the price of pipe to, say, even
US$1,000/ton would increase the cost of the project by only about 15% and
would not basically affect the justification for the project. (See also
Chapter V, Section C).

C. Design and Engineering Services
4.08      In late 1973 the Kenya Government appointed Pencol Engineering
Consultants (U.K.) to prepare technical, economic and financial studies
an the project. The studies were completed in May 1974 and provided the
basis for the appraisal. The Bank reviewed the designs proposed by Pencol
and found them to be sound.  The codes and standards to which the pipeline
will be designed are listed in Annex 1.



- 11 -
4.09      KPC has also appointed Pencol to provide complete project manage-
ment, engineering, accounting and training services for implementing the
project and during the initial operating stage. The services to be provided
by the consultants comprise: pipeline route selection and survey, preparation
of detailed designs and specifications, issue of tenders, prequalification
of contractors, recommendation on contract awards, inspection of equipment
at suppliers' plants, inspection and supervision of construction, and super-
vision of commissioning of the facilities. The consultants will also advise
on staff recruitment, training, company organization, and setting up and
operating financial controls and accounting systems until KPC staff is ade-
quately trained and the facilities are fully operational. These arrangements
are satisfactory.
D. Procurement, Project Schedule and Disbursements
4.10      Procurement of line pipe and related materials will be by inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines, and the
proposed Bank loan of US$ 20.0 million will finance 100% of the CIF Mombasa
cost or 90% of ex-factory cost in the case of contracts won by local bidders.
Procurement of the other materials such as pumps and storage tanks, as well
as award of the main construction contract, will be by competitive bidding
limited to firms from countries which offer financing.
4.11      A tentative schedule of project implementation is given in Chart 2.
The main construction contract is expected to be awarded in December 1975.
Construction could commence in February 1976 and be completed by April-May
1977. It should then be possible to have the facilities in commercial opera-
tion by October 1977, in any case no later than January 1978. The timing of
other activities such as recruitment and training is not critical and can be
planned to suit the construction schedule.
4.12      Disbursements under the loan will be on the basis of 100% of the
CIF Mombasa cost of line pipe. Table 6 shows the estimated schedule of
disbursements based on award of contract in October 1975 and completion of
delivery by December 1976. Any funds remaining undisbursed on completion of
the project will be cancelled.
E. Ecology and Employment
4.13      The pipeline will reduce air pollution as it will reduce transport
fuel consumption by some 425,000 tons over 20 years when compared to a 50/50
road/rail modal split. Further, the pump stations will be powered electric-
ally, thus transferring the air pollution problem to large power generating
stations where ft can be dealt with more effectively than in locomotives or
road vehicles.



- 12 -
4.14      Since the pipeline will be buried, and will follow the natural
contour of the ground, it will not create drainage or animal migration
,problems. It will be a silent, nearly invisible and clean means of over-
land transport. The only visible signs of the pipeline will be its storage
tank farms and pump stations, and the former are required in any case by
road and rail systems while the latter will be noiseless, clean and unob-
trusive. The pipeline will cross the Tsavo National Park through a service
corridor largely alongside the existing highway, railway, power line and
water pipeline; it will also cross the Nairobi National Park for a short
distance at a point very near the northeast Park boundary. There are only
two relatively minor river crossings and here, as in other smaller water
courses, the pipeline will be buried a safe depth under the river-bed.
4.15      During construction the project will provide direct employment for
.some 700 persons. When completed it will employ some 120 persons in 1977
Tising to 150 when the four additional pumping stations are set up around
1989. These numbers are, of course, smaller than those needed by EARC for
white oil products transport from Mombasa to Nairobi. However, the employ-
maent that could be generated by developmental projects financed from the
additional Government revenues could certainly be more significant than the
employment foregone on EARC (para 5.15).
F. Land Acquisition
4.16      The pipeline route traverses private, Government and Trust land.
Negotiations are underway for the purchase of private land with the mediation
df the Commissioner of Lands. Some of the Trust and Government land is at
present being farmed with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture and
compensation for possible crop loss is being negotiated; the easements through
these lands will be granted by the Commissioner of Lands. The Government has
given assurances that no delays to the project will result from these
negotiations.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Project Benefits and Economic Return
5.01      When the proposed pipeline goes into operation it will provide
a much less expensive and more reliable means of transporting most white oil'
products which now move by rail or road from Mombasa to Nairobi at consider-
ably greater cost. The long-run economic cost of moving one ton of white oil
products from Mombasa to Nairobi by pipeline has been estimated at only
KSh 22, compared with about KSh 56 by rail and KSh 140 by road. The pipeline
will also release substantial rail capacity on the Mombasa-Nairobi section for
the carriage of other traffic whose volume is expected to continue to grow.



- 13 -
5.02      Due to the general inadequacies of EARC and the present limited
capacity on the Mombasa-Nairobi section, the two competing modes - road and
rail - each carry about 50% of the white oil traffic. Substantial invest-
ments will be needed to increase EARC's capacity to a level at which it could
continue to carry its 50% share of the forecast oil traffic. These include:
(i)  completion of the dieselisation program already
underway;
(ii) lengthening of passing loops to enable the running
of longer trains, also partly underway;
(iii) strengthening of wagon couplings essential to the
operation of longer trains, at a cost of about
Ki 6 million;
(iv) introduction of centralized traffic control at the
appropriate time at a minimum cost of about KE 3
million;
(v)  purchase of tank wagons and locomotives in step
with traffic growth (Table 7); and
(vi) construction of more storage tanks than would be
needed with a pipeline.
Item (i) will increase daily line capacity on the Mombasa-Nairobi section
from the present 26 trains (13 in each direction) to 32. Items (ii) and (iii)
will help increase average train sizes from the present 1,200 tons trailing
load to 1,600 tons for general freight trains and 1,900 tons for oil tank-wagon
trains. Item (iv) will raise daily capacity further to about 56 trains.
5.03      To enable the Mombasa-Nairobi road to carry its 50% share of the
oil traffic, a major program of reconstruction would be necessary, and pro-
vision would also have to be made for improved highway maintenance.
5.04      The pipeline will allow elimination or deferment of all these items
of road and rail investment, and the substantial savings thus achieved repre-
sent economic benefits resulting from its construction. These, together with
savings in operating costs, yield a return of 37% on the economic costs of
the project over the 20-year forecast period (Annex 2 and Table 8).
5.05      The costs considered for purposes of estimating the return are the
economic costs, including physical contingencies, but excluding all taxes and
duties as well as the contingency provision for price escalation and the cost
of land (since most of the pipeline route traverses land with little alterna-
tive economic use). Also included are essential investments inside the EAOR
compound in Mombasa (para 4.03). Foreign exchange costs have been shadow
priced at 130% and labor at 75% of actual costs. It must be emphasized that



- 14 -
the cost-benefit comparison makes optimistic assumptions about EARC's ability
to achieve operational improvements, as otherwise many of the investments
would be needed even earlier to enable it to continue to carry the white
products traffic (para 5.11); in that case, the return on the pipeline project
would be even higher.
5.06      Approximately 30% of the pipeline traffic will be for destinations
outside Kenya, with about 20% going to Uganda and the balance of 10% to Zaire,
Rwanda, etc. In the event that the Kenya Government were to pass on to these
countries all of the transport cost savings on their white oil traffic, the
economic return to Kenya could drop to 26%, although the economic viability
of the project will be unaffected.
B. Economic Return under Conservative Assumptions
5.07      If EARC could overcome its deficiencies and provide adequate capa-
city in, say, five or six years' time and attract all the white oil traffic
on the Mombasa-Nairobi section by about 1982, to carry the oil traffic offered
from then on, it would have to make even larger investments in new locomotives
and tank wagons, as well as undertake signalling and other improvements ear-
lier. Construction of the pipeline would either relieve EARC of the need to
make some of these investments or help to defer their timing to a later date
when general traffic growth necessitates such improvements. In addition it
would eliminate the direct rail operating costs of the oil traffic transferring
to the pipeline. During the period up to 1982 it would also help to avoid
road transport costs involved in moving white oil traffic which the railway
will be unable to handle. These volumes are assumed to decline gradually
from 50% in 1978 to nil in 1982 (Table 9). The benefits, in terms of all
these avoidable costs, would yield an economic return of 31% on the proposed
pipeline project.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
5.08      Several tests of the sensitivity of the economic return to changes
in the key variables indicate that the return could be as high as 44% under
favorable conditions, but could drop to as low as 24% under unfavorable
assumptions. If the foreign exchange and labor costs and benefits are not
shadow priced, the return would be even higher at 46%. The most important
variable is the volume of traffic: if the actual volume of traffic is only
75% of forecast levels, the return would drop to about 28%. Details of the
sensitivity analysis results are shown in Table 10.



- 15 -
D. Determination of Optimum Pipe Size
5.09       The consultants considered various pipeline sizes ranging from
10" to 20" in order to design an optimum project. On the basis of prelim-
inary analyses, they narrowed the choice to 12" vs. 14" pipe. The former
would involve slightly lower initial investment costs than the latter, but
higher operating costs and add.itional investments in pumping stations in
later years to handle the growing traffic. To determine the optimum pipe size,
the investment and operating cost streams for the two alternatives were dis-
counted at 10%, 12% and 15%, which showed that a 14" pipeline is more economic.
E.  Impact of Project on EARC
5.10       Construction of the proposed pipeline will have an impact on EARC
operations on this section, its tank wagon requirements, and its overall
finances and operations. These are discussed in turn below:
(i) Operations on Mombasa-Nairobi Section
5.11       On the assumption that EARC could quickly complete its dieselization
program, lengthen passing loops on the Mombasa-Nairobi section, and strengthen
wagon couplings (para 5.02), Table 11 shows the estimated volume of traffic
and the number of trains per day on the section from 1977 onward. If EARC
continues to carry its 50% share of white oil traffic, even with all the
improvements, the line capacity will be inadequate beyond 1991, when central-
ized traffic control will be needed to cope with the growing traffic. If, on
the other hand, EARC were to carry all white oil traffic, centralized traffic
control would be needed even earlier, by1985. In either situation, the pipe-
line project will help avoid substantial investments and, at the same time,
release capacity on the Mombasa-Nairobi section for the carriage of general
traffic, which will be to the overall benefit of the region. Otherwise, part
of the other traffic will have to move by road at higher cost, involving much
higher levels of fuel consumption.
(ii) Tank Wagon Requirements
5.12      On the assumption that it will carry little white oil traffic on
the Mombasa-Nairobi section from 1977, EARC's tank wagon requirements for
all petroleum products traffic on the Kenya-Uganda route are estimated at
about 400 in 1978, rising to 480 wagons in 1981. EARC's present fleet in
operation on this section numbers about 460 tank wagons. This means that
there will be a small temporary surplus in 1978 which normal traffic growth
will eliminate by about 1980. If, as expected, EARC attracts additional non-
pipeline oil traffic from road, the surplus will disappear even earlier.



- 16 -
(iii) EARC Finances
5.13      The proposed pipeline will mean a considerable loss of profitable
traffic to EARC on the Mombasa-Nairobi section. Tables 12 and 13 indicate
the forecast income and expenditure position with and without the white oil
traffic on this section. Although the loss of this traffic will result in
savings in operating costs, the loss in revenue is considerably larger.
EARC should be able to carry all the black oil products on this section which,
including the 250,000 tons or so going by trucks at present, would amount to
some 600,000 tons per year. Also, as the demand for black oil products grows
in Kenya and Uganda (Tables 2 and 3), the volume of black oil traffic available
to EARC will continue to increase, with volumes on the Mombasa-Nairobi section
surpassing present EARC oil traffic levels by around 1985. Meanwhile, volumes
of all oil traffic on EARC beyond Nairobi will increase steadily (even if the
present modal split continues ) (Table 14).
5.14      With the expected operational improvements and the rolling stock
that will be released by the pipeline, EARC should be able to capture most
of the long-distance non-pipeline oil traffic now going by road, particularly
in view of the recent fuel price increases which have affected road trans-
portation costs more seriously than the railway. This would enable it, with-
out any further change in tariffs, to break even by 1982, compared with the
possibility of breaking even from 1977 onwards if the pipeline were not built.
(iv) Overall Operations
5.15      The above analysis of the financial impact has some important impli-
cations for EARC's overall operations.  The Mombasa-Nairobi section is the
heaviest traffic section of EARC, with a freight traffic volume of about 3.5
million tons in 1972, compared with 2.6 million tons on the second most
heavily used Nairobi-Nakuru section. Profits on the Mombasa-Nairobi line
have in the past helped the railway to offset undetermined losses on some
other sections and services of the system, and to maintain relatively low
tariffs on low-value bulk commodities which have benefited all three Partner
States of the Community. Construction of the proposed pipeline will reduce
EARC's ability to continue to provide such services, without either an increase
in tariffs to reflect relative costs more closely and/or offsetting subsidies
from the governments concerned once losses are determined. (See also Annex 3)
F. Contribution to Government Finances
5.16      The proposed project will make an important contribution to the
Kenya Government's budgetary resources. The Government will be able to
obtain Kh 0.6 million in 1979, rising to Kh 18 million in 1997, in the form
of income tax on and dividend payments by KPC, which it can use to finance
other development projects.

VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Operating Expenses
6.01      Estimated operating expenses for tqe project are shown in detail
in Table 16. For determining the cost per m of throughput, operating ex-
penses are divided among the three activities: (1) the basic Mombasa-
Nairobi pipeline, (2) the delivery from Nairobi storage tanks into adjoining
oil company depots for delivery, in turn, to road or rail tankers for onward
shipment, and (3) the airport storage/hydrant system at Embakasi. Provision
for depreciation of capital assets and interest on long term debt is added
to arrive at the total costs (Table3l7), which are divided by the estimated
throughput to obtain the cost per m (Table 18).
6.02      Total costs for the basic pipeline and the road/rail terminal
tend to decrease through to 1986 as the interest on long term debt de-
creases at a greater rate than the increase in operating expenses. The
planned investments in 1990 to handle the growing traffic result in higher
charges for depreciation as well as increased operating expenses from that
year.
B. Tariffs
6.03      The average financial cost of transporti3g white petroleum pro-
ducts is estimated at KSh 25 per ton (KSh 20 per m ) over the project period
including depreciation and interest, compared with the present rail tariff
of KSh 119 per ton, equivalent to KSh 95 per ml. (See Table 18).
6.04      An important consideration in deciding the level of the pipeline
tariff is the Kenya Government's expressed intention not to allow the retail
price of white oil products to be reduced to reflect the saving in transport
costs when the pipeline goes into operation. At the same time, KPC should
so fix its tariffs as to ensure its own financial viability. During loan
negotiations the Governmeni and KPC gave assurances that the tariff will be
not less than KSH 90 per m , including any development surcharge or other 3
levies. For the purpose of financial evaluation, a tariff of KSH 90 per m ,
to be retained by KPC, has been used.
C. Revenues and Expenses
6.05      The projected statements of profit and loss for KPC for the years
1978 to 1997 are set out in Table 19. The results for 1978 to 1982 sum-
marized below, indicate that, even in the very first year of operation, the
return on net fixed assets would be 18Z.

6.06      Provision for depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line
basis. Approximately 80% of the capital costs are depreciated over their
estimated economic life of 30 years; the remainder over periods ranging
from four years to twenty years. Provision for depreciation begins in the year
of acquisition.
6.07      KPC is subject to corporate income tax, currentlv at the rate of
45% of taxable income. To arrive at taxable income, the profit before pro-
vision for depreciation and amortization of preliminary expenses is reduced
by capital cost allowances. These are 25% for vehicles, 2 1/2% for buildings
and 12 1/2% for the remainder, and are calculated using the reducing balance
method. Use of this method results in high charges to income for tax purposes.,
and consequently low taxes, during the early years of the life of an asset,
and lower charges with resultant higher taxes during the later years. (Taxable
losses, if incurred, may be carried forward indefinitely to offset future profits).

6.09      KPC's operations will provide sufficient internally generated funds
to finance new capital investments as needed, pay interest on and amortize
long term loans and debts, and provide for dividends. Profits exceed the
debt service coverage requirement of 1.5 times (para. 6.14) in 1985 and
thereafter dividends have been calculated at the maximum amount (para. 6.15).

E. Financial Plan
6.10      To finance the cost of the pipeline project estimated to be
KL29.6 million, including interest during construction (para. 4.04), the
total cash requirements are as follows:
Ki'000                US$'000
Local     Foreign   Total         Total

6.11      The main airport hydrant system itself is being financed separately
from the pipeline project by the Government of Kenya. It is proposed that the
remainder of KL 25.778 million (US$72.178 million) for the pipeline be financed
as shown below:

25,778          72,178



- 21 -
Of the local/other borrowings, the Government agreed during negotiations to
arrange to provide Kn 6.0 million on terms comparable to those on export!
suppliers' credits, with the balance to be borrowed by KPC from a local bank
to meet working capital requirements.
6.12      The present equity of KPC is KE 50,000.  As already stated in
para. 3.01, the Government agreed during negotiations to increase its equity
in share capital to KE 4 million. KPC's capital structure will then be as
follows:
K1'000          US$'000         %
Export and/or
suppliers' credits            12,518          35,050        39.42

- 23 -
6.14      As can be seen, the debt/equity ratio, which is high in 1978, the
first year of operation, rapidly improves and, by 1982, equity is larger
than debt. It was agreed during negotiations that KPC will incur no further
debt financing unless the net profit after tax, but excluding depreciation,
amortization and interest charges, is 1.5 times the debt service requirements.
6.15      It was also agreed during negotiations that dividends shall be
declared only if (i) the debt service coverage will not be less than 1.5
and, (ii) after the payment of such dividend, the current assets of KPC
will be at least 1.5 times the current liabilities.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment and/or KPC, as the case may be, that satisfactory arrangements will be
made or continue to be made on the following matters:
(a) equity capital of KPC (paras. 3.01 and 6.12);
(b)  audit (para 3.06);
(c)  insurance (para 3.07);
(d)  telecommunications facilities for KPC (para 3.09(a));
(e)  aircraft fueling facilities at Nairobi airport (para
3.09(b));
(f)  product supply (para 3.09(c));
(g)  product delivery (para 3.09(d));
(h)  line fill (para 3.09(e));
(i)  land acquisition (para 4.16);
(j)  pipeline tariff (para 6.04);
(k)  balance of costs of the project (para 6.11);
(l)  future debt financing (para 6.14); and
(m)  declaration of dividends (para 6.15).
7.02      On the basis of the above, the proposed project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$20 million to KPC at 8-1/2% interest for 20 years, in-
cluding four years of grace, with the Kenya Government as guarantor.

KENYA
MOMBASA-NAIROBI OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE PROJECT
Basis of Economic Benefits Analysis
1.        At present all white petroleum products traffic from Mombasa to
inland destinations is shared equally by railway and road. Table 4 shows
the anticipated future traffic volume to be transported from Mombasa.
2.        In the economic evaluation (Chapter V), it has been assumed that
the best that EARC can expect is to hold its present share of white products
traffic. To carry even this traffic, the railway will have to undertake the
investments listed in para 5.02.
3.        Thus the economic benefits attributable to the pipeline are the
avoidable railway investments, direct rail operating costs associated with
the transportation of white oil products, truck operating costs and additional
road maintenance costs (Table 8). The additional numbers of locomotives and
tank wagons needed by EARC to carry the white oil traffic on the Mombasa-
Nairobi section have been determined on the basis of incremental traffic,
the average tank-wagon capacity and the average train load and average turn-
around time. An average double-headed train is assumed to haul 1,900 tons
trailing load (35 tank-wagons, each of 35 tons capacity), compared with the
present 1,200 tons. Turnaround time is assumed to be two days for locomotives
and three days for wagons, compared with three days and four days respective-
ly at present.
4.        Table 7 shows the numbers of locomotives and tank-wagons required
(based on the above criteria) for each year for EARC to carry 50% of the
white products traffic.  To carry all the traffic, the investments needed
will be approximately double. Straight-line depreciation was applied to
determine the residual value of both locomotives and tank-wagons at the end
of the assumed project life of 20 years. Provision is made for equipment
write-off and/or replacement at the end of their useful life based on the
age of existing and new equipment. Thus the replacement cost of old tank-
wagons is shown as benefits, since these too are avoidable if the pipeline
is built. Wagon couplings need to be strengthened around 1979-80 to enable
the running of longer trains than at present, but a pipeline would postpone
this investment for over ten years. Investment in centralized traffic control
is also necessary when the number of trains per day reaches 32 as well as in
additional storage tanks periodically to handle the growing traffic.
5.        All these railway costs, together with the truck operating and part
of the road maintenance costs, are avoidable with the pipeline in operation
and have been regarded as the economic benefits of the project. The economic
return in Chapter V - Section A has been calculated on this basis.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
6.        The rail only situation, discussed in Chapter V - Section B, will
require, advancing of investments to strengthen wagon couplings and cen-
tralized traffic control and additional outlays for tank wagons and loco-
motives and for storage tanks at the Nairobi rail terminal (Table 9).



ANNEX 3

MOMBASA-NAIROBI OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE PROJECT
Impact of Pipeline on EARC
1.        Under the Loan Agreements relating to Loans 425-EA (in 1965) and
674-EA (in 1970), EARC is expected to "maintain its financial position in
accordance with sound financial and business principles and practices" and
to generate "revenues sufficient to produce an annual rate of return of not
less than 6% for fiscal year 1976 and thereafter, on the value of the net
fixed assets in operation". The East African Railway Act also requires EARC
to conduct its business according to commercial principles and secure a
return on investment.
2.        Under Loan 674-EA, EARC has also agreed to:
"a) Take all necessary steps within its power to revise its
tariff and rate structure in accordance with sound economic
and commercial principles for railway operations. To that
end, all rates for the Borrower's services shall be set:
(i) at least equal to the short-run marginal costs of
providing such services; and
(ii) to provide a contribution toward covering the full
cost of providing such services, taking into account the
elasticity of demand for transport of the commodity using
such services; provided, however, no rates shall be set
above that level which is generally competitive with efficient
road transport on paved roads, or where no such road has been
constructed, would be generally competitive if such construc-
tion had taken place.
"b) Establish a cost accounting system to determine the relevant
costs of the services provided by the Borrower"
3.        EARC's actual financial position since 1970 has been as follows:

1972      28,800           28,600                   200           3,900      -3,700

The EARC rate structure which prevailed until the late 1960's was largely
based on cross-subsidization, in that low-rated bulk commodities were
transported below movement costs, while high-rated goods such as petroleum
products paid substantially higher rates above movement costs, enabling EARC
to remain viable overall. But in recent years, due to growing competition
from road haulers, the supluses from the latter group have not been adequate
to cover the deficits of the former.
4.         Since that time, however, many tariff reductions have been intro-
duced in an effort to meet road competition. In early 1972, the management
of EARC also submitted to its Board and to the East African Communications
Council detailed proposals for selective tariff increases based on its
cost studies, but due to problems within the Community, the tariff increases
were not approved until May 1974, by which time costs had escalated further.
A further increase primarily to take into account fuel cost increases since
October 1973 was approved in October 1974. In a full year, these increases
will yield an additional revenue of about 30%, that is, K+ 10 million per
year (see also Table 13). However, since recent worldwide price increases
have added about KE 7 million annually to operating costs, EARC will con-
tinue to incur operating deficits until at least 1982, whereas, without the
pipeline, it is expected to show surpluses from 1977 onwards (see para. 5
and Tables 12 and 13).
5.        At 1973 traffic levels, EARC is estimated to have derived a net
operating income of KE 1.5 million per year from its 50% share of the white
oil traffic between Mombasa and Nairobi. With the construction of the
pipeline this contribution will cease to be available.
6.         To help meet this situation, EARC can:
(i)  utilize the rolling stock rleased by construction of the
pipeline to carry all black oil traffic on the Mombasa-Nairobi
section and more oil traffic of all categories beyond Nairobi.
This should be possible since surplus rolling stock will be
initially available, and in the last 15 months road costs have



ANNEX 3
Page 3
risen even more than rail costs. It is assumed that such move-
ments will in fact occur and that, in particular, EARC will
capture the 250,000 tons or so of black oil products going by
truck between Mombasa and Nairobi annually at present;
(ii)  utilize spare line capacity between Mombada and Nairobi
after the loss of white oil traffic to carry an increasing
share of other commercial traffic now being carried by road;
(iii)  seek further selective tariff increases, particularly on
services and sections which do not cover costs. This should
be based on continually updating the costing study already
completed which formed the basis of the 1974 tariff increases;
(iv)  request specific subsidies from the Governments of the Partner
States concerned, in the event that the latter feel that a
loss-making service or section should continue; and
(v) seek to reduce operating expenses by greater efficiency,
including increased staff productivity.
7.        Present thinking within the Partner States is that the railway's
current operational and financial problems can only be solved by decentraliz-
ing its managerial structure, to the extent that the regional management in
each Partner State is fundamentally responsible for t'ne operation and finaaecs
of its own region. In this event the impact of the pipeline, and the need for
the measures listed in paragraph 6 above, may well be confined to the Kenya
Region of EARC.

Assumptions Used for Financial Forecasts
1.        Interest charges during the construction period are capitalized
and amortized over the twenty year projection period.
2.        Staff training costs and initial consultants fees are capitalized
and amortized over the first four years of operations.
3
3.        The tariff for the pipeline has been assumed at KSII 90 per m,
close to the existing rail tariff from Mombasa to Nairobi.
4.        Capital expenditures, revenues and operating expense have been
calculated using a constant monetary unit (at 1974 prices).
5.        Provision has been made in the cash requirements for initial
