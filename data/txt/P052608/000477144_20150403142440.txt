F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to support the Borrower’s long-term vision to improve the employability of
young people and increase the competitiveness of the labor force by: (a) increasing equitable access to and
retention in upper secondary education; (b) improving equitable education achievement in upper-secondary
education; and (c) increasing the proportion of secondary education graduates who continue on to tertiary
education.

                  correspond to average results of the SABER 11 exam (designed by ICFES). Since
                  SABER 11 scores are not comparable across time because the content of the tests changes

                  areas. However, the values that are reported in the restructuring paper and here are those
                  of the 25 poorest municipalities.

1.      The Department of Antioquia had made significant progress in expanding education
coverage at the primary and lower secondary level, closing its gap with the rest of the nation.
However, access to upper secondary education and tertiary education was low and inequitable. In
2006, the gross enrollment rate in upper secondary education in Antioquia’s uncertified 1
municipalities was 56.4% and the net enrollment rate 30.1% compared to 69.8% and 36%
respectively at the national level. Uncertified municipalities were heterogeneous (gross enrollment
rates in 2006 ranged from over 100% in the wealthy municipality of San Pedro to under 30% in
Nariño), but on average poorer than the capital city of Medellín and the other four certified
municipalities. The Basic Needs Index (NBI or Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas) of the eight
certified municipalities was 34.5 (calculated in 2011 with data from the 2005 census), whereas for
the uncertified municipalities it was 38.8. The quality of education was low, as evidenced by
Antioquia’s performance on national assessments which showed scores below the national
average. For many poor families, upper secondary education was unaffordable. As a result, the
completion in upper secondary education was low and only 13% could access tertiary education
in Antioquia.

2.      Antioquia was also plagued by internal conflict and violence, which made the delivery of
public services to rural areas difficult. In 2006 Antioquia was the department with the highest
number of cases of violence reported, accumulating 53,455 cases, or almost 12% of the national.
It was also one of the top recipients of displaced victims, receiving 39,901 people in 2006 (9.7%
of the national total), according to Colombia’s Department of Victims (Unidad de Víctimas).

3.     Antioquia’s 2004-07 Development Plan aimed at increasing educational coverage focusing
on the needs of the rural sectors in uncertified municipalities. Objectives included: (i) increasing
the enrollment in lower- and upper-secondary education; (ii) reducing the number of students
performing poorly; (iii) better articulating the education system with the productive sector by
providing students with general labor competencies oriented toward market demand; and (iv)
improving educational opportunities for secondary school graduates by fostering access to higher
education.

4.     The rationale for Bank involvement included the strong link of the Project to the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2003-06, in particular the pillars sharing the fruits of growth. The



1 Since the 1990s, the national government began to decentralize public education to the departments and municipalities.
Municipalities that have been granted the ability to manage their education systems are said to be certified. There are 125
municipalities in the department of Antioquia. Five municipalities which met capacity requirements had been certified to deliver
public education services in their jurisdiction (Law 715 2001) by Project approval, resulting in 120 uncertified municipalities.
During Project implementation, three additional municipalities (Apartado and Rionegro in 2009, and Sabaneta in 2010) were
certified, bringing the total of uncertified municipalities down to 117. The department of Antioquia is responsible for the
administration and provision of educational services in the uncertified municipalities, as well as the provision of technical support
to certified municipalities.


                                                                 1
CAS explicitly mentioned the need to tackle the challenges of “enhancing equity in coverage,
quality and (…) efficiency” in basic education especially in areas with internal conflict and
violence, very much in line with the Project Development Objective. It was likewise aligned with
Colombia’s national development plan for 2006-10 as well as the Country Partnership Strategy for
2008-11, that was under preparation at the time, which emphasized support to the High and
Sustainable Growth and Peace pillars.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The PDO is to support the Department of Antioquia's long-term vision to improve the
employability of young people and increase the competitiveness of the labor force by: (i)
increasing equitable access to and retention in upper-secondary education, (ii) improving equitable
education achievement in upper-secondary education, and (iii) increasing the proportion of
secondary-education graduates who continue on to tertiary education. The PDO in the PAD differs
from the PDO in the Loan Agreement. The third objective in the PAD was: (iii) increasing the
proportion of public school secondary education graduates who continue on to tertiary education.

6.      Key indicators for rating Project outcomes were:
     1. Increase public upper-secondary gross enrollment from 46% to 66% and net enrollment
        rate from 22% to 36% in the poorest areas.
     2. Increase average mathematics and language test scores (national ICFES test) in public
        schools in the poorest areas. (Mathematics test scores from 44 to 47, Language test scores
        from 46 to 49).
     3. Increase upper secondary completion rate in the poorest areas from 81.2% to 90%.
     4. Increase transition rates from secondary public students to tertiary education from 13% to
        18%.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.     The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project. Three of four PDO
Indicators were changed in the 2012 restructuring:
    1. The second PDO Indicator was changed to reduce the gap in achievement test scores
       (national ICFES test) between public and private school students. The change was made to
       allow comparison of learning outcomes across time since student assessment tests change
       and are therefore not comparable from year to year.
    2. The baseline and target for the completion rate monitored by the third PDO Indicator was
       changed to 78.5% and 85% due to a change in methodology.
    3. The baseline and target for the fourth PDO Indicator that measured transition rates was
       changed to 23% and 31% due to a change in methodology.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.     The Project was intended to primarily benefit the upper secondary students (grades 10 and
11) of the uncertified municipalities of the department of Antioquia. This comprises the
approximately 260,000 students who were enrolled in upper secondary education at some time

                                                 2
during Project implementation. Beneficiaries by component were: (i) for subcomponent 1.1, the
students belonging to the Project specific private schools or NGOs selected to implement the
flexible pedagogical model in the 117 uncertified municipalities: approximately 8,937; (ii) for
subcomponent 1.2, students in grade 10 and 11 who belong to families in SISBEN 1 who received
direct subsidies (but do not already receive subsidies from the program Familias en Acción) and
students from families in SISBEN 22 in schools which are in 117 uncertified municipalities and in
municipalities with the highest rate of drop outs in grade 9: the number of subsidy beneficiaries
was 23,380; (iii) for subcomponent 1.3, the students who received conditional scholarships for
tertiary education belonged to the same targeted group and in addition meet a number of conditions
including graduating from 11th grade, reaching a minimum ICFES score and enrolling in a higher
education institution. These include at least 11,075 students. The school improvement sub-projects
in component 2.1 benefitted academic counselors, principals, coordinators and teachers who
received training. 3,014 teachers, principals and other school professionals were trained.
Component 3 benefitted administrators of the Secretariat of Education of the department of
Antioquia, which we assume to be around 100. This brings the total number of beneficiaries to
around 306,506.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9.      The Project consisted of three components:
Component 1: Equitable access and retention to upper secondary education and opportunities for
transitioning to tertiary education. This component financed: (i) on a competitive basis the
implementation of flexible pedagogical models in private schools or NGOs; (ii) direct subsidies to
upper secondary students from poor families in the uncertified municipalities to help with
expenditures such as tuition fees, transportation and foods; (iii) conditional scholarships to students
from poor families in the uncertified municipalities to increase access to tertiary education, and
(iv) a program for guiding and counseling students at the upper secondary level with respect to
vocational training and for providing employment prospects and access to tertiary education.

Component 2: Quality and relevance of upper-secondary education. This component financed: (i)
technical assistance to provide tools and instruments to the Department to develop competency
based curricula as well as training in management and collective leadership strategies and school
grants to strengthen upper secondary school management, implement competency based curricula
and improve the pedagogical practices of teachers; and (ii) technical assistance to carry out a
feasibility study for improving the effectiveness of secondary technical education and provide
financial transfers to eligible schools to implement selected subprojects.

Component 3: Institutional strengthening, monitoring and evaluation and Project management.
This component aimed at: (i) strengthening the capacity of the Secretariat of Education of
Antioquia (SEDUCA - Secretaría de Educación de Antioquia) to provide technical assistance to
the municipalities and schools; (ii) implementing an impact and evaluation strategy; and (iii)
strengthening SEDUCA to comply with its responsibilities for managing the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

10.     The 2012 restructuring modified component 1: (i) to include the design of a monitoring
system for conditional scholarships to increase access to tertiary education; and (ii) to specify that
the design for an impact evaluation of the conditional scholarship program would be developed,
instead of annual evaluations of the program as had been originally envisaged.

1.7 Other significant changes

11.     The 2012 restructuring: (i) assigned Project implementation responsibilities for component
1.3 to SEDUCA instead of Instituto para el Desarrollo de Antioquia (IDEA); (ii) revised eight of
the sixteen intermediate indicators to reflect changes of data sources and/or new methodologies
and expected progress during the extended Project period; (iii) changed Project costs to better align
with the Departmental Education Plan; (iv) modified the Disbursement Table to reallocate Bank
funds among categories of expenditure, and to clarify that under category (2) goods procured by
either the Eligible Schools or SEDUCA are eligible for financing under the category; and (v)
extended the Project closing date for 18 months from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2014 in order
to complete all activities and achieve the Project Development Objective.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

12.      The Project was prepared by SEDUCA (during the period July 2006 to December 2007)
with a series of six studies financed by a US$500,000 Japanese grant.3 It built on the experience
of the previous Antioquia Basic Education Project (P006891), which strengthened schools at the
preschool, primary, and lower-secondary levels, and increased local management capacity. It
incorporated lessons from previous decentralized projects in Antioquia, Pasto, and Cundinamarca,
along with the ongoing Rural Education Project and the cash transfer project Familias en Acción
in Colombia as well as on a series of consultations with stakeholders and lessons from international
experience. The main lessons learned included: (i) inclusion of school grants, (ii) application of a
participatory approach involving stakeholders at all levels of Project implementation to reduce
resistance, (iii) mobilization of additional resources for the sector, such as funds from
municipalities, (iv) use of cash transfers to stimulate demand (an approach that has proven
successful in a number of cases, such as Oportunidades in Mexico), (v) public-private
partnerships, (vi) empowering schools as the centers and agents of change, and (vii) reform
technical secondary education curricula. The preparation studies could have included an
institutional assessment for instance: (i) of the Gilberto Echeverri Fund to manage the conditional
scholarship program; or ii) to identify the Universad Católica del Norte and the SAT (Sistema de
Aprendizaje Tutorial) as major actors of a virtual platform for distance education.




3The studies were the following: i) Economic Analysis of the Project (Econometría Consultores), ii) Design of the Student Cash
Transfer Program (Econometría Consultores), iii) Profile of Upper Secondary Schools in Antioquia (Corpoeducación), iv)
Design of a Monitoring and Evaluation System (Luis Piñeros), v) Proposal for the Use of ICT (Álvaro Galvis), and vi) Design of
Competence-Based Curricula (Econometría Consultores).

                                                              4
13.     The Project was well designed technically with a good balance between measures to
improve the quality of the supply of upper secondary education through sub-projects presented by
the municipalities and the mobilization of additional resources for the sector and measures to
stimulate demand and improve equity and participation through cash transfers and scholarships to
students from low-income families. It used a decentralized and participatory approach to prepare
sub-projects within the School Improvement Plan framework. This approach empowered local
school communities, reduced the resistance to change, facilitated the dissemination of successful
education alternatives. The subprojects aimed at integrating the different categories of inputs in
order to generate a transformation process and to liberate creativity of all the stakeholders.

14.     Project management was fully integrated in the regular administrative structure of
SEDUCA. This facilitated implementation, ensured better compliance with Bank rules and
increased sustainability. Project components were well targeted on upper secondary schools in the
uncertified municipalities and on students from low income families.

2.2 Implementation

15.     Mining activities, drug micro-trafficking and violence with the support of some guerilla
groups impacted the education system and the Project in different ways: (i) lower student
participation and increase in the dropout rate; (ii) direct violence to students; (iii) forced
displacement of population; and (iv) money laundering in some NGOs related to education. In
response, Project activities which favored a school culture of peaceful coexistence and prevention
of violence became an important element of School Improvement Plans and were mainstreamed
in the Department’s education policy.

16.      In 2009, the Government of the Department of Antioquia established free public education
from grades 0 to 11. 4 In 2010, free public education was extended to the 17 teacher training
institutions. In the same year, stricter and more homogeneous rules for evaluating and promoting
students were implemented. This particularly affected the pass rate in grade 10.5

17.    The election and the first change of Administration in January 2008 did not affect the
implementation of the Project. The new authorities were supportive of the Project, the selection of
the Project coordinator took place at the Project launching and the Project implementation team
was quickly established and operational.6

18.     An election and second change of administration took place in January 2012 and
subsequent changes in the Project slowed down implementation. The Ley de Garantía avoided the
use of public budget during election time. As a result, all procurement was suspended during eight
months from January 2011 to the end of September 2011 and implementation slowed down. The
Project Coordinator and all the technical staff (3 financial specialists, 1 procurement specialist, 1
evaluation and monitoring specialist, 4 school advisors and the 3 advisors for peace and
coexistence) were changed after the election. As a result, there was no Project implementation


4 This decision was formally adopted by Ordinance 10 in August 2010 and at the national level in 2012.
5 The rules were approved through national level Decree 1290.
6 During the first semester of 2008, 23 workshops were conducted in the 9 regions of Antioquia with 440 school principals, 400

academic coordinators, 35 representatives of the Municipal education Board and the 22 Municipal Secretaries of Education.

                                                              5
team from January to July 2012 when the new nominations took place. The new team was trained
in the Bank’s financial and procurement procedures. The impact on Project disbursement was
minimal (disbursements picked up in 2012) because major contracts had been prepared in 2011
and launched during the last semester of 2011. The new Administration confirmed that education
was its top priority and its willingness to use the Project as the main channel to promote the
transformation of upper secondary education.

19.      The sub-component to provide conditional scholarships to increase access to tertiary
education was implemented only for two years starting in 2012. The Project mid-term review
identified the need to establish a new fund to replace the Gilberto Echeverri fund, which had been
initially considered to manage the conditional scholarships supported under the Project. In 2012,
this new scholarship fund was established, which was managed by IDEA and financed by the
Department of Antioquia (63%), with financing also provided by the City of Medellín (18.5%)
and the EPM Foundation (18.5%).

20.     While the Project’s direct subsidies to students attending upper secondary education began
in 2009, additional funding from the private sector was never raised as envisaged. EAFIT (Escuela
de Administración, Finanzas y Tecnología), a higher education institution focusing on
management, finance and technology, developed the training model for the school principals and
also provided support for it in 2013 and 2014.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

    21. The Results Matrix included four Project Development Indicators to monitor progress
    toward the achievement of the PDO, and 16 Intermediate Indicators to monitor implementation
    progress. It did not include any PDO Indicators to measure the employability of young people
    and increase the competitiveness of the labor force as these were long-term goals beyond the
    scope of the Project as indicated in the PDO itself.

    22. To monitor the objective of increasing equitable access to upper secondary education, the
    Results Matrix included a PDO Indicator that measured upper secondary gross and net enrollment
    rates in the 25 poorest municipalities. Monitoring of the objectives to increase equitable retention
    and improve equitable educational achievement was also only in the poorest of Antioquia’s
    uncertified municipalities. These indicators, however, were not good measures of Project impact
    since most Project activities targeted all of Antioquia’s 117 uncertified municipalities and not just
    the poorest twenty five. The Project did target students from low-income families, but there was
    no evidence that these families were concentrated in the 25 poorest municipalities. The PAD,
    instead, identified the need to close the gap between the lower gross enrollment rates in
    Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities and its certified municipalities and the gap with national
    rates.7 Reducing these gaps would have been more appropriate measures of Project impact on
    equitable access. An alternative option would have been to measure the percentage of poor
    students accessing upper secondary education (in all 117 uncertified municipalities) since the


7   See PAD, Annex 1, Section D “Coverage and Equity.”

                                                         6
direct subsidies that were expected to increase access and retention were focused on students from
low income families (but data is not available for this option).

23. A fourth PDO Indicator monitored the objective to increase the proportion of secondary
education graduates who continue on to tertiary education. A baseline was to be introduced based
on 2007 data of the transition rate from secondary to tertiary education. No plans were made to
introduce a baseline for the number of secondary education graduates even though the PDO in
the legal agreement included an objective to increase the number of secondary education
graduates. The PAD did not include a methodology to calculate the transition rate.

24. The intermediate outcome indicators tracked implementation progress of most activities
with the exception of the implementation of flexible pedagogical models, and the activities related
to school improvement sub-projects. Only, the number of subprojects signed, the amount of
financing per subproject and their percentage of implementation and achievement were to be
monitored during Project implementation but not their achievements. Most intermediate
indicators were designed to be monitored through percentages, with the methodology for
calculating them often unclear.

Implementation

25. SEDUCA closely monitored progress toward targets in the Results Matrix. Substantial
efforts were made to involve the municipalities and the participating schools. Indicators in the
Results Matrix were also tracked at the school level. Each school participating in the Project had
a score card that included key indicators.

26. There were some practical issues with collecting monitoring data for some indicators: (i)
it was difficult to measure on a yearly basis the transition rate from secondary to tertiary education
because individual students could not be tracked through their identification numbers (the number
of the identity card used at tertiary education level is different from the number used for the
identification of students in secondary) and universities do not publish data on their students; and
(ii) calculating gross and net enrollment rates relied on projections from a population census done
in 2005 that was not adjusted for high internal migration or other effects of violence that plagued
Antioquia during the Project period, resulting in inaccurate data. In addition, although the PAD
indicated that the completion rate was to be calculated based on the proportion of 9th grade
students who finished 11th grade, throughout Project implementation it was calculated based on
the proportion of 10th grade students that finished 11th grade. Data was not available to classify
and track students by level of poverty in all the uncertified municipalities. Finally, data on the
numbers behind the percentages used to track intermediate indicators was never recorded, making
it difficult to monitor Project outputs.

27. To measure improvements in equitable educational achievement, the Project relied on the
national student assessment test, SABER 11. SABER 11 is administered by Instituto Colombiano
para el Fomento de la Educación Superior (ICFES) in grade 11. The test is obligatory (but not
necessary to complete grade 11) and a prerequisite for accessing tertiary education. Since the
content of the test evolved with the curriculum, SABER 11 scores are not fully comparable from
one year to another. The Results Matrix was revised during the 2012 restructuring to provide an

                                                 7
alternative measure of equitable educational achievement through a reduction in the gap in
SABER 11 scores between public and private school students in Antioquia’s uncertified
municipalities. Since the Project supported activities in both private (i.e. the flexible pedagogical
models) and public (i.e. curricula reform, SIPs, language and math programs) upper secondary
schools in Antioquia’s 117 uncertified municipalities, a more appropriate measure of Project
impact on equitable educational achievement would have been to measure the gap between
SABER 11 test scores nationally and in Antioquia’s certified municipalities compared to
Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities. The 2012 restructuring also adjusted the baseline and
targets for the PDO indicators that measured completion rates and the transition rate and revised
the methodology for both. The PDO Indicators measuring equitable enrollment and retention were
not revised to measure Project impact in all 117 municipalities instead of just 25.

28. SEDUCA complemented its monitoring of the Results Matrix with specific evaluations: (i)
a diagnostic test to evaluate student readiness the SABER 11 exam (pre-SABER 11) was applied
in 2010 to grade 10 students (results were used for the Bank 2013 flagship study Building Better
Teachers); (ii) a classroom observation study (Stallings method) was done in 2011 in grade 11
(showing that pedagogical time in grade 11 was 63% compared to OECD average of 85%; the
data was later used in the book Great Teachers, published by the Bank in 2014); (iv) a review of
tertiary education led by OECD was done in 2011 with Bank participation; (v) a study was carried
out in 2013 by Econometría to measure the impact of subsidies on SABER 11 results; and (vi) a
study was done in 2014 on policy options to improve education quality in Antioquia (University
of Antioquia).

Utilization

29. School score cards were widely used not only by school principals and teachers but by
other stakeholders, including parents, the municipality and the policy makers in the Department
of Antioquia. They were used on a daily basis by a team of assessors. Two issues were identified
at the Project’s midterm review: (i) the devolution of information from SEDUCA to the schools
was considered to be insufficient to inform technical decisions at the classroom level; and (ii) the
information system needed to be improved to provide more reliable data. These two issues were
addressed in 2013 and some of the data that was previously inflated was corrected. The baseline
and targets for the transition rate from secondary to tertiary education (13% and 18%) were added
through the ISR in 2009.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental safeguards

30. This was a category C project because it included only minor school rehabilitation and
maintenance, mainly to improve sanitary facilities and adaptation of classrooms for computer
installation. Nevertheless, guidelines (including provisions such as basic health and safety
precautions for workers, management of dust and noise levels, and disposal of construction waste)
were incorporated into all bidding documents for contractors.




                                                 8
Social Safeguards

31. The Project triggered Operational Policy 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) and the Borrower
prepared an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) to address the needs of the Indigenous population
(0.48 percent of the population of Antioquia). It also prepared an Afro-Colombian Peoples
Planning Framework to address the demands of the Afro-Colombian population (23 percent of
the population of Antioquia). The Project financed the design and implementation of a
competency based curriculum that respected cultural identity and ethnic differences. Of the 140
upper secondary schools participating in the Project that had Indigenous and Afro- Colombian
populations, about 65% implemented a curriculum adapted to these populations.

Financial Management

32. At the preparation stage, SEDUCA’s and SHA’s (Secretaría de Hacienda de Antioquia)
financial management arrangements were appropriate. Several fiduciary measures were included
to mitigate financial management risk, particularly risk associated with the management of funds
at the school level. Still in the early years, there was inadequate monitoring of grants to the schools
and direct subsidies to the students. Audit reports done by the Contraloría Departamental de
Antioquia from 2008 to 2009 were unacceptable, and a private firm was hired by the Project to
carry out audits. During the life of the Project, the external auditors qualified their opinion on the
Project financial statements, but based on the Bank’s review of audit reports, the issues were
satisfactorily resolved, except for one aspect that did not have a material impact on Project
financial information. From June 2013 to the Project closing date, acceptable financial reports
were submitted to the Bank.

Procurement

33. Project procurement arrangements and action plans were adequate, reflecting the
recommendations of a Procurement Capacity Assessment. Antioquia has strong capacity in
procurement since it had experience with a previous Bank financed education project. However,
in 2010 the number of qualified staff assigned to procurement was insufficient. This issue was
addressed with the hiring of two procurement staff in 2011. In addition, there were issues with
the distribution of duties between the Procurement Specialist and the Project coordinator, and
with the procurement files system (SEPA system). The results of an ex-post procurement review
that took place in May 2013 were positive in general and the Project archives were fully updated.

Compliance with covenants

34. All legal covenants stipulated under the Loan Agreement related to institutional
arrangements, Project monitoring reporting and evaluation and procurement were met with no
delay.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35. While there is no follow up Bank-financed operation envisioned, several initiatives
supported by the Project continue to be supported by the Department of Antioquia: (i) the

                                                  9
    conditional scholarship to increase access to tertiary education; (ii) the vocational and
    professional counseling and guidance; (iii) the use of the School Improvement Plan to provide
    resources to make secondary school more effective; (iv) decentralization at the municipal and
    school level through structured and systematic technical assistance; and (v) school based
    management, monitoring of indicators and the management by results.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

    36. The objectives of the Project are fully in line with the priorities of the Country Partnership
    Strategy for Colombia for FY12-16, approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on
    June 12, 2011, to expand opportunities for social prosperity in particular by increasing enrollment
    in education in upper secondary education including vocational and technical education. The CPS
    explicitly mentions “pronounced disparities in access and quality of secondary” education as an
    obstacle for the country, and sets an increase in secondary enrollment of students from poor and
    rural households as an outcome. The Department of Antioquia Education Development Plan
    (approved in May 2012) included a specific orientation to improve the quality of secondary
    education. The objectives in this Plan which are similar to the ones of the Project are: (i) to
    increase equitable access and retention in upper secondary education; (ii) to improve the quality
    of learning; and (iii) to better coordinate upper secondary education with technical and vocational
    training and higher education in order to improve the transition to the labor market. The Project
    is also in line with the Colombian National Decennial Education Plan 2006-16 (Plan Nacional
    Decenal de Educación 2006-16), which set targets for, among others: (i) increasing net coverage
    in upper secondary education, (ii) improving the performance of students and schools in SABER
    11 scores, and (iv) increasing higher education coverage.

    37. The direct subsidies and scholarships that targeted public school students from low income
    families were an appropriate intervention to promote access of students from low income families
    and thus increase enrollment and improve retention in upper secondary education.8 Introducing
    flexible pedagogical models, such as online learning, is a good low cost option to improve access
    to education in remote rural areas with few students such as in Antioquia’s Bajo Cauca and Urabá
    subregions. There is emerging literature that school based management can improve learning
    outcomes, and thus equitable educational achievement particularly when it is introduced in
    tandem with training of school principals in schools with underperforming students as was done
    under the Project.9 Introducing a competency based curriculum that promotes healthy behaviors,


8 Attanasio, Meghir, ansd Santiago (2012) find, for instance, that the Mexican conditional cash transfer Progresa had a strong
impact on school enrollment, especially after primary school. Soares, Ribas and Osório (2010) also find increases in school
enrollment as a result of the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer program in Brazil.
9 Evidence of links between SBM and improved learning outcomes is mixed. Evidence from Kenya shows that parent-teacher

associations lead to better learning outcomes (Duflo et al 2014) when parents are empowered through specific capacity building.
In The Gambia, SBM was shown to reduce student and teacher absenteeism; SBM only had a positive effect on learning

                                                              10
 such as team work and responsibility, and critical thinking can also boost academic achievement.
 Scholarships to higher education, as well as offering workshops and support services to students,
 are key to increasing access to tertiary education for students that finish secondary school and
 receive a sufficient score on the SABER 11 exam. There were some minor shortcomings in design
 since the Project did not factor in the short supply of accredited higher education institutions in
 Antioquia. Over the long-term, the introduction of the competency-based curriculum in secondary
 schools, more secondary school graduates with improved test results, and more students enrolled
 in higher education could be expected to lead to improved employability of young people and
 increased competiveness in the labor force. The Project design remained relevant throughout
 implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Increase equitable access to upper-secondary education

Rating: Substantial

 38. Access to upper secondary education in Antioquia’s 25 poorest municipalities increased
 modestly. The gross enrollment rate reached 52.3% in 2013, falling far short of the targeted 66%,
 and the net enrollment rate reached 26.5% significantly less than the 36% target (Table 1). Since
 the indicators in the Results Matrix were inadequate to measure increases in equitable access in
 all of the 117 municipalities supported by the Project, the ICR introduces additional evidence of
 Project outcomes in these municipalities. Equitable access to upper secondary education in
 Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities did increase significantly, as evidenced by a reduction in
 the enrollment gap between the national level and Antioquia’s 117 uncertified municipalities.
 The gap between Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities and the national level was reduced from
 12.5 percentage points in 2007 to 9.9 percentage points for the gross enrollment rate and from 5.9
 to 4.0 percentage points for the net enrollment rate. Additionally, the selection mechanism for the
 25 poorest municipalities could have been improved. Ranking the uncertified municipalities in
 Antioquia by their NBI index10 (Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas, or basic unsatisfied needs),
 which is a standard poverty indicator in Colombia, shows that the 20 poorest, for instance, grew
 substantially in coverage and converged with the national average during Project implementation.




outcomes in communities with high literacy, otherwise the effect could be potentially negative in communities with low literacy
(Blimpo, Evans 2011). In Indonesia, SBM was found to have links to improved learning outcomes only when school based
management is complemented by linkages between the school committee (Pradhan et al. 2014). Evidence also shows that SBM
has improved social participation, governance, transparency, and accountability, leading to lower dropout and repetition rates
(Gertler et al 2012). A recent observational study suggests that school autonomy may lead to improved learning outcomes when
strong central institutions are in place, but otherwise possibly detrimental (Hanushek et al. 2012). Finally, another study argues
that SBM programs need to be in place for at least 5 years to achieve significant results and at least 8 years to “transform”
schools (Borman et al. 2003).
10 The NBI index is designed by DANE using 2005 census data and is based on a series of simple indicators, including dwelling

conditions, lack of services, economic insecurity, and school attendance for children. Data is available at the municipal level (as
the fraction of households falling under a chosen score).

 39. Both the gross and net enrollment rates in the uncertified municipalities also improved
 relative to the certified municipalities in Antioquia. The gap in the gross enrollment rate
 decreased from 26.9 percentage points in 2007 to 23.3 in 2013, whereas the net enrollment rate
 gap dropped from 12.5 percentage points to 11.2 in the same time period (Table 2).

41. The Project contributed to increased equitable access in public schools by providing direct
subsidies to upper secondary students from low income families in all 117 uncertified
municipalities. On average 3,897 grade 10 and 11 students received direct subsidies annually over
the period 2009-14. The number of beneficiaries varied every year because the subsidies were
awarded to students from families in SISBEN level 1 that did not already benefit from the national
funded program Familias en Acción and also to students from families in SISBEN level 2. The
implementation of School Improvement Plans also contributed to the attractiveness of public
upper secondary education in Antioquia through: a school more integrated in the community, an
improved school environment and better trained and motivated school principals and teachers.
Finally, the flexible pedagogical models provided under the Project by private organizations in
the remote subregions of Bajo Cauca and Urabá also contributed to increased access to upper
secondary education.

Increase equitable retention in upper secondary education

Pre-restructuring rating: Modest                 Post-restructuring rating: Modest

42. Retention in Antioquia’s 25 poorest municipalities decreased. The upper secondary
retention rate in these municipalities decreased from 78.5% in 2007 to 72.2% in 2013,
significantly missing the pre-restructuring target of an increase to 90% and the post-restructuring
target of 85% (Table 3). Since the indicators in the Results Matrix were inadequate to measure
increases in equitable retention in all 117 municipalities supported by the Project, the ICR
introduces additional evidence of Project outcomes in these municipalities. The upper secondary
retention rate in Antioquia’s 117 uncertified municipalities also declined, from 81.4% in 2007 to
72.5% in 2013. Most of the decline occurred in grade 10 retention (the grade 10 retention rate in
Antioquia’s 117 uncertified municipalities was almost 15 percentage points lower than the grade
11 rate in 2013), likely due to the 2010 introduction of the stricter evaluation and promotion rules.

43. However, there is some evidence of Project impact since the uncertified municipalities in
Antioquia performed better in retaining students than the certified municipalities, which saw an
even greater decrease. Without the Project, the retention rate in the uncertified municipalities
likely would have declined even more. To further account for the changes in the evaluation and
promotion rules, which affected the whole country, the ICR analyzes data on the percentage of
students enrolled in grade 11 as a percentage of students enrolled in grade 10 the previous year.
Since this data is available for both certified and uncertified municipalities (but the retention rate
in certified municipalities is not), it allows us to compare retention trends throughout Antioquia,
and therefore attempt to control for external shocks that affected all schools in the area, both
targeted and non-targeted. Using this methodology, the uncertified municipalities compare
favorably to the certified ones, according to the latest figures. The gap disappeared during Project
implementation, down from 2.9 percentage points in 2007.




                                                 13
44. Improvements in the graduation rate provide further evidence of Project impact. The
graduation rate in Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities (defined as the number of students who
graduated from upper secondary education as a percentage of the relevant total school-age
population) increased significantly during the implementation of the Project from 25.4% in
2007 to 30.8% in 2013. This is due to the increase in coverage in these municipalities during the
same period, which more than offset the decline in retention.

45. The Project contributed to softening the decline in the retention rate and improving
graduation rates in Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities in the same way that it contributed to
the impact on enrollment: through direct subsidies to low income students, an improved school
environment through the School Improvement Plans and support to the flexible pedagogical
models in Bajo Cauca and Urabá.

Improve equitable educational achievement in upper-secondary education

Rating: Modest

46. There is limited evidence of improvements in SABER 11 test scores in Antioquia’s 25
poorest municipalities. Average SABER 11 scores in public schools in these municipalities
increased from 41.28 in 2009 to 41.4 in 2014 in math, but decreased from 44.28 to 44.2 in
language though the declines could be due to the change in test methodology rather than to lower
achievement (Table 4). However, there is strong evidence of an improvement in the performance

                                                         14
 ratings of schools in these municipalities based on SABER 11 scores, as evidenced by the large
 drop in the number of schools rated low or below (9.7 percentage points in the 2009-2013 period)
 and the mirror increase in the percentage of schools rated medium or above.

 47.    Since the indicators in the Results Matrix were inadequate to measure increases in
 equitable educational achievement in all 117 municipalities supported by the Project, the ICR
 introduces additional evidence of Project outcomes in these municipalities. Equitable
 achievement improved modestly in language as evidenced by the narrowing of the SABER 11
 gap between Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities and the national average. Math scores did not
 improve in Antioquia’s uncertified municipalities relative to the national average. In the 117
 uncertified municipalities, performance ratings of schools based on SABER 11 scores improved.
 There was an almost 11 percentage point drop in the number of schools rated low or below in
 2013 than there was in 2009, and the same increase for those rated medium or above. Certified
 municipalities improved more during the same time period, with the fraction of schools rated
 medium or above rising 22.8 percentage points.

 48. The improvement in the percent of schools in the 117 municipalities that were rated
 medium or above is consistent with an impact evaluation carried out in 2013 to measure the
 impact on learning achievements of the beneficiaries of the direct subsidies program. The study,
 which used a differences-in-differences approach to analyze the effect of subsidies on SABER 11
 scores at the municipality level, concluded that the program had a positive impact on language,
 English and Physics scores while it had no impact on Math and Chemistry.11

 49. The Project also contributed to improved equitable educational achievement by financing
 School Improvement Plans (SIPs) in all 451 schools of the 117 uncertified municipalities of
 Antioquia. The SIPs, designed in 2009 and under implementation starting in 2010 with all schools
 implementing a SIP by 2011, supported: (i) the use of test results at the school level to provide
 incentives for better performance; (ii) process in which all stakeholders (at central, local and
 school level) participated and interacted to make the school more effective; (iii) the training of
 all school principals that improved their leadership and management of the change process; (iii)
 the improvement of the learning environment with equipment, laboratories, ICT and libraries; (iv)
 a program that favored peaceful coexistence and democratic participation to increase
 collaborative thinking among staff and students; (v) in 2013 the training of 2,593 teachers in the
 competency based curriculum and teaching practices and of all teachers in the core disciplines
 (language and mathematics) complemented by class room observations and support from the
 pedagogic advisors; and (vi) school based management and more specifically school
 accountability.

51. The transition rate increased from 13% in 2007 to 19% in 2013, which exceeded the
original 18% target. However, this indicator had limitations, since it only took into account
students entering higher education institutions in the department of Antioquia. The transition rate

 using the post-restructuring methodology increased from 23% in 2007 to 31% in 2010.12 The
 revised methodology was the following: the number of first-year students from uncertified
 municipalities enrolled in any higher education institution in Colombia who were enrolled in
 grade 11 the previous year (thus removing upper secondary graduates who took longer than a year
 to enroll in a higher education institution) divided over the number of students enrolled in grade
 11 in uncertified municipalities the previous year. No data using this methodology is available for
 2013 or 2014. This indicator, however, still understates transition.

 52. New evidence tracking individual students and brought into the ICR to ensure time-
 comparability shows that the proportion of upper secondary graduates enrolling in higher
 education institutions (mentioned in the PDO of the Project but not adequately monitored)
 increased by 8 percentage points from 48.9% in 2008 to 54.5% in 2012 for the uncertified
 municipalities. The number of first year students from uncertified municipalities enrolled in
 higher education institutions increased from 8,700 in 2008 to 10,552 in 2012, a growth rate
 (21.3%) well over that experienced by students from the certified municipalities (8%).

 53. The Project contributed to the improved transition rate by supporting workshops and
 support services for upper secondary students in 2010 and 2011, including on financing
 alternatives, higher education programs and life skills. It also supported the creation of a Fund in
 2012 to provide incentives for students to continue to tertiary education. The Fund
 (75,597,887.906 Colombian Pesos) is financed by the Department of Antioquia (63%), with
 additional funding provided by the City of Medellín (18.5%) and the EPM Foundation (18.5%).


12These numbers were established through a study done in 2011. The methodology used to calculate the transition rate post-
restructuring was the following: Number of first year students enrolled in a higher education institution in year n divided by the
number of students who enrolled in grade 11 in year n-1.

                                                                17
 It grants full scholarships for tuition and conditional support for the subsistence of students (food,
 transportation and/or housing). It provided 568 scholarships in 2012, 4,326 in 2013, and 6,181 in
 the first semester of 2014 to low income students (strata 1, 2, and 3) from the uncertified and
 certified municipalities enrolled in disciplines relevant for the economy. Of the scholarships
 granted in 2013 and 2014, 21% went to students belonging to stratum 3, 47% to stratum 2 students
 and 32% to stratum 1 students.13 The distribution by institution shows that the majority (67.5%)
 of beneficiaries were concentrated in 3 institutions: Universidad de Antioquia, Politécnico
 Colombiano, and Tecnológico de Antioquia. Finally, increased enrollment and graduation rates,
 combined with improved SABER 11 test scores, increased the pool of students from Antioquia
 that met university entrance requirements.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

 54. The economic analysis carried out at Appraisal left out several items that are now
 considered key and are routinely included in economic analyses in human development projects:
 i) public health and education externalities due to increased educational attainment, and ii) higher
 tax revenue for the Government due to increased incomes. To correct for this, the present analysis
 uses a revised methodology that takes into account and quantifies these factors. The reference
 point is, thus, the cost-benefit analysis and internal rate of return calculated using the original
 targets as expressed in the PAD, but under the new methodology. The actual observed cost-benefit
 analysis uses observed data collected through Project monitoring systems and Government
 databases.

 55. The cost-benefit analysis performed using projected targets provides a sound basis to
 estimate the actual economic results of the Project. The Project yielded a Net Present Value (NPV)
 of US$67.7 million (COP172.4 billion), compared to the forecasted US$76.9 million (COP195.9
 billion). The actual internal rate of return (IRR) stands at 11.9%, slightly below the projected IRR,
 which was 13.3%. The NPV was hampered by the modest improvements in retention, but this
 was more than offset by higher than expected results in transition to higher education. The actual
 IRR and NPV also compare favorably to those calculated at appraisal (10.8% and US$11.5
 million, respectively).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 56. The overall outcomes use a split rating to comply with ICR guidelines. The rating is
 Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) both pre- and post-restructuring. The rating is calculated on a
 6-point scale from 1 (Highly Unsatisfactory) up to 6 (Highly Satisfactory).




13   There are six strata (1 being the poorest and 6 the richest).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts

57. More years of schooling, as the result of direct subsidies and conditional scholarships, and
improved learning outcomes could have a lasting poverty impact. The direct subsidies supported
under the Project benefited upper secondary students from families registered in the lowest levels
of SISBEN. The conditional scholarships for higher education benefitted university students from
families in lower socioeconomic strata (which were originally created to distinguish which
household would get subsidized access to public services and utilities but are also used for
eligibility for other government benefits).

Gender Aspects

58. No specific activities related to gender were implemented.

Social Development

59. The Project response to the issues of violence and criminal activities was substantial. All
the activities that promote a school culture of peaceful coexistence and prevention of violence are
now mainstreamed in the education policy of the Department of Antioquia.

(a) Institutional Change/Strengthening

(b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)




                                                      19
60. In preparing and implementing the SIP through a participatory process involving all the
local stakeholders, the Project had a significant positive impact in the partnership between the
municipalities and the schools.

61. There was strong support from the Universidad Católica del Norte and the SAT (Sistema
de Aprendizaje Tutorial) to provide the virtual platform for distance education to train teachers
and school principals. This virtual platform can now be used for large scale in-service training of
the teaching staff.

62. EDATEL was used for the payment of the direct subsidies to upper secondary students.
This was particularly difficult for students located in remote areas and for such a small amount
(US$175 a year in monthly installments). EDATEL connected all the 451 schools participating
in the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest

63. The risks that the outcomes achieved under the Project might not be sustained are modest.
The Government of Antioquia continues to be committed through the Antioquia Education
Development Plan 2012-15 to improve access and quality of upper secondary education and the
transition rate to tertiary education. Gains in enrollment are likely to continue through Antioquia’s
continued support to flexible pedagogical models in rural remote areas. Antioquia plans to
continue the use of SIPs to provide resources to improve school effectiveness, including learning
outcomes. To continue to achieve increases in the transition rate to tertiary education, Antioquia
plans to expand the conditional scholarship program to include 9,000 beneficiaries in 2015 and
continue counseling and guidance. There is some risk that enrollment could taper off since the
provision of the type of direct subsidies to upper secondary students that were supported under
the Project are being discontinued. Risks to increased achievement include Antioquia’s plan to
integrate into policy, but scale down, teacher and school principal training.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

64. The Project benefited from a sound design that capitalized on the lessons learned from
previous Bank assistance to Antioquia. Innovative approaches were adopted to increase local
participation, to promote school based management, and to increase students’ competencies. The
direct subsidies were well targeted to the needs of low income families in Antioquia’s 117
uncertified municipalities. The Bank engaged in a fruitful dialogue with the national government
to ensure that the Project complemented the national development plan and with the government
of the Department of Antioquia to integrate the Project into the departmental priorities. A series
of consultations were carried out by SEDUCA between November and January 2007 with

                                                20
stakeholders, parents and the communities to improve Project design and ensure ownership. This
process was enriched by an international seminar where the experiences of Chile, Brazil, South
Korea and Spain were discussed. Bank performance had some significant shortcomings: (i)
Project monitoring was based on key indicators impacting only on a small subset of the 117
municipalities resulting in insufficient monitoring data to inform Project implementation; and ii)
the methodology for calculating baseline and target values of many indicators was unclear, further
exacerbating the usefulness of Project monitoring.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

65. The Project launch was successful and followed by an intensive program of workshops (23
during the four months following the launch) in the 9 regions of the department to provide
technical support and practical instruments to the schools. The Bank carried out a minimum of
two full supervision missions per year, well-staffed with highly qualified education and
implementation specialists and provided additional technical assistance in various areas. The
Bank encouraged additional studies to supplement monitoring and evaluation through the Results
Matrix. The Bank reacted promptly to potential issues that could affect implementation. That was
the case: (i) in 2009, when the Bank recommended that all the NGOs and private providers be
screened for possible affiliation with illegal groups (risk of money laundering and other); and (ii)
in 2012, when the new administration took office, the Bank was successful in developing a
dialogue that could ensure the continuity of the policy supported by the Project. Supervision had
the following significant shortcomings: (i) monitoring did not reflect the Project impact
accurately since it reflected impact only on a subset of municipalities supported by the Project;
and (ii) the indicators, targets and the methodology to calculate them should have been
revised/clarified during the restructuring. In addition, the Bank could have proposed the
restructuring much earlier.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66. Since Quality at Entry is moderately unsatisfactory and Quality of Supervision is
moderately unsatisfactory, overall Bank performance is considered moderately unsatisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67. The Project benefited from the constant support of the authorities at the national and
departmental levels. Even with two changes in Administration, the Project remained at the center
of the strategy to improve secondary education. The Government was open at the national and

                                                21
departmental levels to innovative activities and to participate in international assessments – i.e.
Antioquia volunteered to take part in the Better Teachers regional study in LAC, which included
classroom observations in 83 schools out of 452 and in the OECD assessment of tertiary education
– to learn from experience. However, there were moderate shortcomings; after the 2012 election
it took about eight months for the new Government to resume implementation of the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68. SEDUCA exhibited strong ownership of the Project and commitment to the achievement
of its objectives. The Project was staffed with qualified professionals. It was committed, proactive
and responsive to challenges. The issues, mostly in financial and procurement management, were
addressed in a timely manner. However, there were moderate shortcomings: (i) the data for the
monitoring and evaluation indicators was not always provided in time for supervision reports;
and (ii) the design of the impact evaluation was delayed and only completed after Project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69. Overall Borrower performance is considered moderately satisfactory given the moderately
satisfactory performance of the Government and the moderately satisfactory performance of the
implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

70. It is essential that Project Results Frameworks include indicators to measure the expected
impact of all key Project activities and not just a subset of activities. To ensure consistent
measurement, and ensure clarity on what projects are trying to achieve, it is also important to
spell out the methodology for calculating baselines and targets as well as the data sources.

71. SIPs and School Improvement Projects prepared through a participatory approach can be
powerful instruments of change: (i) promoting school based management and accountability; (ii)
stimulating creativity for better teaching and learning practices; (iii) involving the school
community and key stakeholders at the municipal level; (iv) combining all the resources allocated
to achieve a greater impact on school transformation; and (v) improving the school climate,
positively affecting the attitudes of teachers and students particularly with regards to peaceful
coexistence and democratic participation.

72. For SIPs and School Improvement Projects to be developed and implemented successfully
and effectively, they require: (i) structured and systematic technical assistance with highly
qualified local advisors; (ii) training of school principals and teachers to promote strong
leadership at the school level and team building; (iii) significant number of activities aimed at
exchanging experiences and best practices; and (iv) connectivity and ICT to facilitate distance
education and management and monitoring. The peaceful coexistence and prevention of violence

                                                22
projects supported under some SIPs financed by the Project were an appropriate and effective
tool for a conflict environment.

73. Improvements in school based management and competency based curriculum do not
translate to measurable improvements in academic results within a typical Project timeframe of
4-6 years. Expected outcomes should be tailored to what can be reasonably expected in the
timeframe of the Project.

74. A decentralized and participative process to elaborate and finance school subprojects is
compatible with a centralized management of procurement. Even when financial transfers are
allocated to schools it can be more cost efficient to consolidate the procurement of some of the
goods that are common to the schools such as computer equipment and teacher training.

75.      School profiles and the use of performance indicators at school level are important tools
to devolve responsibility to local stakeholders, to increase accountability and to manage by
results.

76. The management of projects by regular staff is not sufficient to mitigate political risk. In
countries where regular staff change during each election, a transitional period is recommended,
to allow time for the team from the previous administration to overlap with the newcomers in
order to ensure continuity of project management.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower had the following additional comments based on the draft ICR:

In accordance with the suggestions of the draft ICR sent for comments, the impact evaluation of
the Project will take into account the following indicators:

           o Gap in SABER 11 results between uncertified municipalities and the national
             level.
           o Gap between the gross enrollment rates of uncertified and certified municipalities,
             and the national level.
           o Intermediate indicators that tracked the progress of implementation, such as: i)
             percentage of students benefitting from scholarships, ii) percentage of year 10 and
             11 students that benefitted from professional counseling and were satisfied with
             the results, iii) principals and coordinators that use modern administrative skills to
             carry out their jobs, iv) teachers who have benefitted from Project activities have
             improved their pedagogical practices, and v) percentage of schools that have
             achieved at least 75% of the objectives of their school projects.

Additionally, although the preliminary impact evaluation does not include data from all 117
uncertified municipalities, it does include data from municipalities in all three levels of income
(poor, medium, and rich).

                                                 23
Regarding the impact of the subprojects, more research is currently being carried out, focusing
on the benefits derived by the schools, and whether they are sustainable or not.

Lastly, a preliminary impact evaluation was carried out during the fall of 2014 in the eastern
region of Antioquia; it provides additional evidence on Project impact by component, according
to the beneficiaries’ perception.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Equitable Access and Retention to upper-secondary and opportunities for
transiting to tertiary education

Sub-component 1.1. Implementation of flexible pedagogical models

1.      In 2013 the following activities were implemented: (i) school visits to present the flexible
models in 20 schools in 12 municipalities in Bajo Cauca and Urabá with the greatest percentage
of out-of-school youths and over aged students; (ii) the training of 218 teachers and 10 principals
for the duration of 3 days; and (iii) technical assistance to implement the flexible models, including
to reconfigure the curriculum. SEDUCA contracted private providers or Jóvenes con Futuro, a
technical vocational program, to offer flexible models. This was complemented by a strategy to
help municipalities to identify out-of-school youths and put them in contact with schools.

2.     Under the Project, the enrollment of students in flexible models in secondary education
increased from 1,032 in 2009 to 2,413 students in 2014. Enrollment in indigenous education
remained the same (105 students in 2009 to 106 in 2014).

  Total                     6,418    2,519

Sub-component 1.2. Direct subsidies to upper secondary-education students

3.      On average, 3,897 students received direct subsidies annually over the period 2009-14. The
beneficiaries of the subsidies were students in grades 10 and 11 from families in SISBEN 1 and 2,
who did not already receive subsidies from Familias en Acción and were less than 19 years old
(26 for the indigenous population). A priority was given to students whose families were victims
of conflict and to the indigenous population. The subsidy was about $175 per year. 335 upper
secondary schools participated in the program. SEDUCA contracted EDATEL to manage the
payment of the subsidies to the students.

Sub-component 1.3. Conditional Scholarship to increase access to tertiary education

4.      Until 2011 and part of 2012, scholarships for students to access higher education were
provided through the fund Gilberto Echeverri (COP 6,000,000,000) but not financed by the
Project. A new scholarship fund was established and managed by IDEA in 2012, to grant full
scholarships for tuition and conditional support for the subsistence of students (food, transportation
and/or housing) to allow more young people from Antioquia to access higher education in
disciplines relevant for the economy. The Fund (COP 75,597,887,906) was financed by the City
of Medellín (18.5%), the EPM Foundation (18.5%), and the Department of Antioquia (63%).

5.     In total, 6,085 scholarships were granted in 2013 and 2014. The distribution of
beneficiaries by socio-economic origin was the following: 21% of the students belonged to stratus
3, 47% to stratus 2 and 32% to stratus 1.

Sub-component 1.4. Vocational and professional counseling and guidance

8.       In 2011, two events (Fábricas del Futuro) were organized in La Ceja and Santa Rosa to
facilitate vocational and professional counseling and guidance of students. 3,500 students
participated in these events. Students had the opportunity to meet staff of higher education and
vocational training institutions, employers and organizations that specialize in youth guidance and
counseling.

9.      In 2012-13, the main activity of this subcomponent was the organization of incubators for
entrepreneurship (Semilleros de Emprendimiento). These indicators consisted of giving students
of grades 9, 10 and 11 50 hours of training organized in six sessions delivered during two months
to help them develop creative ideas for their future professional life. The training provided students
with competencies in creative thinking, analysis of the economic potential of their region and
opportunities, team work, conflict resolution, decision making and communication. It was
organized in 189 schools in 62 municipalities (of which 17% were in rural areas) in which 9,982
students participated in 2012 and 11,103 in 2013. The training included a competition for creative
ideas (3,131 were elaborated) with monitoring of student projects and job counseling.

10.     In addition, to facilitate the intermediation between students and employers and inform
students on job opportunities ten Feria del Bachiller events were organized in which about 78.6%
of the students in grades 10 and 11 in the uncertified municipalities under the Project participated.

11.     Finally secondary schools tracked their graduates. A methodology was established and
distributed to all the schools in which the school principal or the person delegated to this task
should call the parents of the student 6 months after his/her graduation to determine his/her status.
The information is reported in the Alphasig system and consolidated in SEDUCA. It is estimated
that 70% of the schools did the tracking of their graduates (this percentage was 17% in 2012).

Component 2: Quality and Relevance of Upper-Secondary Education

Sub-component 2.1. Strengthening Upper-Secondary School Management for Education
Quality through school grants

School Improvement Plans (SIP)

12.    The sub-component supported in the uncertified municipalities: (i) the training of teachers
in areas such as the design of a competency-based curricula, strategies to incorporate the
competency-based curricula into the teacher training colleges, and strategies to design and
implement incentives for best practices at the school level.

13.     At the school level, the sub-component provided financial transfers for SIPs directed to
address activities related to: (i) the competency-based curricula; (ii) pedagogical practices; (iii)
effective use of test results to manage quality; (iv) learning environments; and (v) education for
peaceful coexistence, among others. The provision of school grants was an instrument to help
upper secondary students complete their education and achieve higher test results to allow them to
gain access to tertiary education institutions or eventually enter the labor force.

14.    The steps to prepare and implement the SIPs were the following:

2008: Diagnostic done by Corpoeducación of each of the 451 schools.
2009: Establishment of school profiles for each of the schools and design/preparation of
subprojects.
2010: Implementation of the SIP (in June 2010, 50% of the schools had initiated the
implementation of the SIP).

16.    Of the total financing of the SIPs: (i) 35.1% was allocated to the 25 poorest municipalities
with an average cost per school of COP 86.7 million (ii) 30.2% to middle income municipalities
with an average cost per school of COP 78.3 million; and (iii) 34.7% to rich municipalities with
an average cost per school of COP 85.7 million. The level of execution in all municipalities was
over 98.8%.

Implementation of competency based curricula:

Curriculum assessment

17.     First, a study of the current status of the curricula in the schools was done, which included
an analysis of the pedagogic model, the internal evaluation system, the use of pedagogic resources
and the links of institution with the community and the productive sector. The study showed the
need to strengthen the curriculum, to revise teaching and learning practices, and to use a
competency-based curriculum. The final product was "A proposal for competency based
curriculum for secondary education in the Department of Antioquia," which provided the
principals and teachers with a clear structure to organize the key areas, to introduce elective
subjects related to the schools context and local needs, to develop initiatives related to citizenship
and vocational skills and to include cultural and sports activities.

Curriculum design

18.     For the design of the competency based curriculum six activities were proposed: (i)
organization of quality teams in schools; (ii) socio-cultural and educational diagnosis; (iii)
orientations for education; (iv) definition of achievements and competencies; (v) specific cultural
context and relation with the curriculum standards issued at the national level; and (vi) curriculum
micro design. The development of the curriculum was not a linear process, but the result of ongoing
reflection taking into account the progress made in teaching practices in which students and the
school community stakeholders were involved. The curriculum was not confined to the academic
and work competencies, but went much further to determine how educational goals respect cultural
identity, ethnic differences, citizenship, defense and promotion of human rights and the protection
of the environment.

Teacher training and student training

19.     Training to implement the competency-based curriculum included: (i) tools that principals
and teachers used to build a curriculum taking as references the vision and mission of the school,
the profile of the person to educate, the principles and values, the pedagogical model, the needs
and expectations of students, educational standards, curriculum guidelines and educational
projects proposed in the General Education Act; (ii) a tool for competency assessment and the
sustainability of the training process at the institutional level with principals and teachers; and (iii)
tools for adjusting the SIPs. In 2013, and the first semester of 2014: (i) 2,593 teachers participated
in training to implement the competency-based curriculum of which 492 were located in the
poorest municipalities; (ii) 16,398 students were trained in a program to strengthen their
competencies in Language and Mathematics.


                                                   30
Implementation

20.     For the implementation of the competency-based curriculum, Corpoeducación: (i)
established the education profiles of the schools (including the political , social, ethical, emotional,
and vocational dimensions); (ii) formulated the curriculum components including the enhancement
of knowledge and the skills/abilities and attitudes necessary for the students to interact in different
social and work contexts; (iii) included educational philosophy, learning purposes, conceptual
domains, competencies, pedagogical and assessment strategies, and logistical processes in the
curriculum; (iv) designed the curriculum with regard to knowledge content, indicators of
achievement, teaching practices and evaluation criteria.

Training for school principals leadership

21.     The training of school principals consisted of 4 modules: (i) one dedicated to staff
management of human resources; (ii) two dedicated to learning practices and pedagogical
management; and (iii) one dedicated to administrative and financial management. The duration of
the training was one week of intensive courses per module. During the weeks between each
intensive course, support was provided to the schools to help the principal and 4 staff from his/her
team to put learning content into the management practices of the schools. A monitoring and
evaluation system was implemented to provide feedback to improve the processes. It reviewed the
following: classroom teaching and learning practices, coexistence, staff participation, institutional
transformation. The Fundación Empresarios por la Educación y la Universidad (EAFIT
Foundation for entrepreneurship in education), which developed the training model for the school
principals help guide and the support the transformation process in schools for two years. In 2013,
EAFIT brought 52% of the resources of the program and 40% in 2014.

22.    In 2013, the program was organized in 126 schools and in 2014 in 119 schools. There was
strong support from the Universad Católica del Norte and the SAT (Sistema de Aprendizaje
Tutorial) to provide the virtual platform for distance education to train teachers and school
principals.

Provision of computers and interactive whiteboards to the schools

23.    In 2011, the following equipment was provided to 450 schools: (i) 6,900 computers; (ii)
400 interactive whiteboards; (iii) 400 laptop computers; and (iv) access points, software and AC
adapters.

24.     School training was organized for the use and management of the interactive whiteboard
in the classroom. A Help Desk for the management and support of the technology was created to
implement the entire process and coordinate requests from schools to suppliers. In 2012, the local
pedagogic advisers were trained in using the interactive white boards in order to bridge between
the schools and the Help Desk for technology management and support. From November to May
2013, preventive maintenance of the equipment was performed. In 2013 EDATEL was in charge
of the Help Desk.

Improvement of pedagogical practices

25.     Between February to April 2011, training sessions on designing the competency-based
curricula were organized by Codesarollo in which 3,014 teachers and school principals
participated. The activity followed the following steps: (i) designing three training modules for
teachers about managing a classroom by competencies, testing and vocational orientation; (ii)
designing the field strategy; (iii) providing the training (48 hours of training, of which 18 were
done through the internet) and monitoring the delivery of each module; and (iv) systematizing the
experience.

26.   The training modules were the following: (i) How I see myself in this project; (ii) Learning
from my peers; (iii) What I will do and how I will do it.

Classroom observations

27.    The Project financed a study of classroom observations: “Evidence on the practices of
teachers and the dynamics of the classroom in Latin America and the Caribbean.” The
methodology also known as Stallings method was used by the Bank in several countries and
reviewed the following: (i) use of time by teachers; (ii) use of instructional materials; (iii) key
pedagogical practices; and (iv) ability to keep students engaged. The information was collected
and analyzed in 89 educational institutions in grades 5, 9 and 11.

School profiles

28.     School profiles were designed to provide each of the 451 participating secondary schools
feedback about the data generated at the school level with the objective to improve schools’
interaction with SEDUCA. The school profiles were a tool to improve capacity of the school
community to make decisions, underpinned by statistics and indicators about their educational
work. Institutional Profiles delivered to each educational institution, information related to: (i)
description of the institutional structure; (ii) characteristics of enrollment; (iii) performance
indicators such as dropout, repetition, overage students, and achievement; (iv) quality of Education
(Results of SABER - 5, 9, 11); and (v) benefits of the Project (incentives, investment).

Effective use of test results to manage quality

29.    Since 2009, ICFES has been carrying out skills assessment in 10th grade. In November
2010, SEDUCA organized Pre-SABER 11 tests financed by the Project, during which 21,251
students and 363 schools participated (85% of the 451 schools that participated in the Project).

Improving learning environment

30.     As part of the subprojects, equipment was provided to 437 schools such as: laboratories of
physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and libraries. This was accompanied with training for
the teachers to promote the intensive use of this equipment.

Education for peaceful coexistence

31.    With the support of the Project, activities that promoted a school culture of peaceful
coexistence and prevention of violence became a key element that was mainstreamed in the
education policy of the Department of Antioquia.

Subcomponent 2.2. Improve the Effectiveness of technical upper-secondary education

32.     A study to improve the quality and relevance of technical upper secondary education was
done in 2013 and completed in 2014. It recommended: (i) to close 18 technical programs out of
65 which were not sustainable and not relevant to the labor market needs; (ii) to upgrade programs
in the health, commerce and agricultural sectors; (iii) technical training, when relevant, can be
useful to students when it complements a good academic education; and (iv) leadership and better
linkage with the productive sectors are necessary to transform technical upper secondary
education.

33.    No reform for the improvement of upper secondary technical education was formally
designed and adopted. Instead, some new orientations were implemented: (i) 9 schools with

                                                     34
technical programs were renovated; (ii) in 2012, an agreement was signed with SENA to ensure
eight hours of technical training in addition to the 30 hours of academic education (this agreement
is in place in 82 municipalities); and (iii) technical training for adults or out-of-school youths is
being provided in the Educative Park (Parque Educativo) to be created in 80 municipalities (4
have been recently inaugurated).

Sub-component 3.2. Impact Evaluation and Monitoring Strategy

35.      With regards to improving school based management and monitoring results at the school
level, this subcomponent financed: (i) in 2010 the design of the Alphasig software to monitor
school performance and Project activities; (ii) software installed in 2011 in all 450 schools and
staff training in its use; and (iii) in 2014, 100% of the schools used the software to publish their
results and to send their information online to SEDUCA (only 65% in 2012).

36.     An impact evaluation to conduct a systematic and objective analysis of the results achieved
by the Project was not done.

Sub-component 3.3. Project Management

37.     The Project management team was placed under the authority of SEDUCA and integrated
into the Department of Quality Improvement. Initially it consisted of a Coordinator, two specialists
to coordinate the technical assistance, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, a procurement
specialist, a financial specialist and an accountant. In addition, 12 local advisors were appointed
(9 were selected among the regular staff and 3 were contracted). In 2011, the financial management
team was strengthened. It consisted of one coordinator and three financial advisors (three were
contracted and one was from SEDUCA).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The purpose of this economic analysis is to compare the actual costs and benefits of the Project to
the forecasted costs and benefits at Appraisal. The economic analysis carried out at Appraisal,14
however, left out several items that are now considered key and are routinely included in economic
analyses in human development projects: i) public health and education externalities due to
increased educational attainment, and ii) higher tax revenue for the Government due to increased
incomes. To correct for this, the present analysis uses a revised methodology that takes into
account and quantifies these factors. The reference point is, thus, the cost-benefit analysis and
internal rate of return calculated using the original targets as expressed in the PAD, but under the
new methodology. The actual observed cost-benefit analysis uses observed data collected through
Project monitoring systems and Government databases.

     A. Income Profiles

The benefits derived from increased income are estimated based on the earnings profile for each
of the educational levels included in the analysis. These profiles were estimated using the
assumptions listed below.

     -    The income profiles follow the Mincerian equation estimated by Guerra et al (2009).
                                           Lnw  0  rS  0 E  1E 2  
Where S represents the educational level, E represents age, and r is the rate of return on education.

     The estimated earnings profile (following a Mincerian quadratic equation) predicts a growth
     in income as experience (age) increases, but at a decreasing rate. The coefficients estimated by
     Guerra et al are 0.0450 for 0 and -0.0008 for 1. This means that the initial yearly growth of
     individual income is 4.5%, but this rate decreases by 0.008 % times age squared every year.15

    The expected working life for an individual is 40 years, which, for the purpose of this study,
     is the 25 to 65 age range. This is in addition to the length of schooling, which varies depending
     on the type of tertiary education attained.

    Entry salaries were estimated based on the earnings of individuals aged 21 - 24, according to
     data from the 2012 Quality of Life Survey. Salaries were discounted to take into account the
     Consumer Price Index increase between 2007 and 2012, in order to calculate the income for
     the first year of Project implementation. These wages are COP561,626 for technical education,
     COP601,405 for technological education and COP944,638 for university education.



14 The internal rate of return calculated in the original economic analysis is 10.8%, with a total net present benefit of US$11.5
million. The opportunity cost of capital at the time was 8%.
15 Although the original Mincer equation includes experience as the main explanatory variable, in Guerra et al’s work, age is

included instead of experience. This does not represent major methodological inconveniences, considering that, in most of the
research on this subject, experience is estimated using the following formula: X = E - 18 - S. There, experience (X), is equal to the
age (E) of an individual under 18 years of age, which corresponds to the age when he/she presumably enters higher education,
minus the time it takes the individual to graduate from higher education, which is assumed to be 6 years.

                                                                39
Based on the above assumptions, the estimated earnings profiles for each level of education are
shown below.

                Upper Secondary                                                            Technical




                  Technological                                                            University




   B. Individual Benefits

The following equation summarizes the costs and benefits (BI) for an individual of continuing on
to tertiary education after graduating from upper secondary:
                                        =65
                          = ∑           ( −  ) − ( +  +  )
                                        =


Where,
   ( −  ) represents the increase in annual income, equal to the difference between the
       initial earnings associated with each educational level minus the earnings of an upper
       secondary graduate entering the labor market.
    represents the cost of tuition for each tertiary degree.
    represents the opportunity cost of tertiary education, which is equivalent to the (upper
       secondary graduate) income lost during the length of the program.




                                                              40
            represents living expenses and the cost of school supplies. They were estimated
            based on Gamboa 2007.16

The following table summarizes the different factors considered when estimating the costs and
benefits of each educational level and labor market choice.

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is, ultimately, the interest rate that makes the net present value
of future cash flows equal to 0, where the net cash flow (I - C) is equal to income minus costs.
The following equation shows how the internal rate of return was estimated.

                                                                ∑( − )

1.      Benefits

There are several benefits derived from Project implementation, both individual and social.
Individual benefits are related to the increase in individual income, while social include a number
of factors often difficult to measure in monetary terms.

The assumptions made for the calculation are shown below:
   - The projected data is the result of extrapolating the PAD enrollment rate targets to school
       age population numbers throughout the Project implementation period.
   - The benefits correspond to increased labor earnings for 11th grade students.
   - Enrollment data includes only public schools, for the sake of cost-benefit analysis.
   - These benefits are derived from the difference in earnings between those who finish
       upper secondary and those who do not.
   - Negative values shown in the table are a result of using preliminary Project indicator
       projections. For the purpose of this analysis, the values were set to zero.
   - The analysis spans a 40 year time period starting in 2014, the end date of the Project.
   - The discount rate used is 8% per year, which corresponds to the rate used at Appraisal.

         b) Transition to Higher Education

The following table shows the benefits derived from the increase of transition to higher education.
The benefits include the increases in individual income derived from graduating from a higher
education program.

The previous table shows higher education enrollment as forecasted according to the original
transition rate targets compared to the actual numbers achieved, by level of education. Benefits
include, in addition to the information displayed in the table, the difference in expected income
between students who graduated from their programs and those who did not. Dropout rates
reported by SPADIES for 2010 were used in order to estimate differences between those who
graduated and those who do not. Dropout rates are the following: 59.2% for technical degrees;
54.5% for technological degrees and 47.0 for university degrees. These rates correspond to dropout
by cohort according to the duration of the programs: 4 semesters for technical, 6 semesters for
technological and 10 semesters for university degrees.

The benefits in terms of higher earnings are given by the income differential between those who
graduate from a higher education program and upper secondary graduates. The analysis includes
both graduates (complete) and those who do not graduate (incomplete), applying the corresponding
wage scales.

As was the case for the enrollment in upper secondary, negative values were assumed to be zero
(0) in order to carry out the cost-benefit estimates.

       c)   Reduction of School Dropout

The benefits for the public education sector are given by the reduction of school dropout (and its
associated costs). The reduction of school dropout is understood as the increase of average
retention rates. According to the PAD, the Project’s goal is to raise the rate of completion of upper
secondary from 78.5% to 85.0%, which is equivalent to an increase of 6.5 percentage points. This
                                                    43
increase implies an increase of 3.6 percentage points in retention, equivalent to an annual average
rate of 0.59 percentage points.

The following table shows the estimate of the benefits of reducing the dropout rate, expressed in
the number of students who would have dropped out in the absence of the Project but do not. The
Project’s goal is to reduce the dropout rate from 5.8% to 3.5%, which is equivalent to a reduction
of 2.3 percentage points, between the beginning and the end of the implementation period. In
annual increments, the above would mean a reduction of 0.39 percentage points.

      d) Increased tax collection (BIM)

While the benefits of the Project are mainly shown as an increase in individual incomes, other
effects should also be considered. This is the case of higher tax revenues associated with
increases in individual income, for instance. For this calculation, we assume that the increase in
tax revenue amounts to 10% of individual income.

      e)   Externalities - Education (EE)

Although the Project indicators related to quality do not allow for inferences from a financial
standpoint, the calculations carried out here assume the existence of a direct relationship between
Project interventions and the development of the student competences. It should also be noted that
there is no evidence on the effects of improved quality of education on macroeconomic variables
such as economic growth in Colombia.

To assess the benefits that a possible improvement of the quality of education could have on
individual income we used research by Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann (2012) (“Do
better schools lead to more growth? Cognitive skills, economic outcomes, and causation”). Using
the results of PISA 2009, the authors conclude that an increase of one standard deviation in the
skill level of students would cause an increase of 2 percentage points in per capita income. The
Project assumes an increase in revenues equal to 1% (0.5 standard deviations).

      f)   Externalities - Health (ES)

Likewise, an increase in the earnings of individuals benefiting from the Project would also have
an effect on the health system. An increase in labor force formality means an increase in
contributions to the health system (the current amount contributed is 12% of income, which is
the figure we use in the analysis). While other indirect effects (for example, on the health on
beneficiaries) is to be expected, this falls beyond the scope of this analysis, to the extent that
there are virtually no studies attempting to measure the value of this kind of externality.

2.    Costs

      a) Costs for individuals

This is equal to the sum of the costs incurred by students to complete a tertiary degree. These
correspond to the sum of tuition (CM), which varies depending on the degree type; opportunity
costs (CO), which is equal to the average annual income of a worker with an upper secondary
diploma; and finally, the sum of living expenses and the cost of school supplies. The total cost
for all individuals is shown below.
                                    = ∑( +  +  )




                                                       45
         b) Additional costs

Additional costs are those related to the expansion of coverage. To increase completion rates,
more teachers, administrators, and supplies are needed. The cost estimate was made based on the
current upper secondary budget and financial framework (COP 1,517,209 per student year).

The analysis used the actual costs of the Project by component, as shown in the data sheet.

3.      Cost - Benefit Analysis

The cost-benefit analysis performed using projected targets provides a sound basis to estimate the
economic results of the Project. The Project yielded a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$67.7 million
(COP172.4 billion), compared to the forecasted US$76.9 million (COP195.9 billion). The actual
internal rate of return (IRR) stands at 11.9%, slightly below the projected IRR, which was 13.3%.
The NPV was hampered by the modest improvements in retention, but this was more than offset
by higher than expected results in transition to higher education. The actual IRR and NPV also
compare favorably to those calculated at appraisal (10.8% and US$11.5 million, respectively).

Project for the Improvement of High-school Education in Antioquia

   1. Project Objectives and components

The Project for the Improvement of High-school Education in the department of Antioquia, set as
primary targets: (i) increasing equitable access and retention in high-school education (ii)
improving the quality of high-school education, and (iii) increasing the proportion of graduate
students from public high-schools that continue to higher education. These objectives were set up
based on specific goals for the poorest zones of the department, using indicators such as:

   •   Increasing gross and net coverage in high-school education.
   •   Reduction of the gap between the results of official and private institutions in the language
       and mathematics areas.
   •   Increasing the completion rate of high-school education.
   •   Increasing the transition rate of students from high-school education to higher education.

Likewise, the Project was structured through 3 components: (i) Equitable access to high-school
education and opportunities to continue higher education; (ii) Quality and relevance of high-school
education; and (iii) Institutional invigoration, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management.

The implementation of the Project began in 2008 with a set of 451 educational institutions of the
department that provided high-school education. This set of institutions underwent a series of
interventions based on the components of the program, which sought to contribute to the
achievement of the Project’s core objectives as previously described.

In order to measure its development objectives, the Project contemplated clustering the
municipalities of Antioquia into 3 main groups based on a set of socio-economic variables.
Therefore, the central axis of the intervention in the department took place in 25 municipalities
considered to be the ones with the lowest socio-economic levels and mainly located in the sub-
regions of Urabá and Lower Cauca. Additionally, 41 municipalities were placed in a middle level
and 51 of them were considered as municipalities with high socio-economic conditions.

By 2014, 37 of these 451 institutions were located in municipalities that obtained their certification
in 2009 or 2010 (Sabaneta, Rionegro and Apartadó), which received a different type of care from
the certification of their municipality. The remaining 414 institutions correspond to the three
categories of municipalities: 174 are located in wealthy municipalities, 136 in middle level
municipalities and 104 in the poorest municipalities.

Reviewing the results of the Project in the department regarding coverage, the Project has achieved
a gradual increase in the gross and net coverage in high-school education, and municipalities or
zones with higher levels of poverty have been able to increase the number of students registered
annually at this level.

As far as gross coverage is concerned, this indicator increased from 60% in 2007 to 68.3% in 2013,
with a relatively constant increase every year. On the other hand the net rate coverage increased in
almost 6 percentage points going from 31.4% to 37.3%.

However, these increases have not occurred in the same way across Antioquia. When the gross
coverage is analyzed separately with respect to the groups of municipalities, it is clear that the
middle socio-economic level group of municipalities greatly increased its coverage rate that went
from 52% to almost 70% with an increase of almost 18 points; although it is highlighted that the
most significant progress took place during years 2012-13.

Regarding the wealthy municipalities, it is clear that their coverage level is superior to the other
municipalities and that it keeps a relatively stable trend to rise throughout the period going from
71.6% to 78.1% in 2013.

On the other hand, gross coverage in poor municipalities, maintains a trend to rise during the period
of 2007-09, reaching their maximum of 58% in this last year. From there on, the behavior was
variable and as of 2011 it seems to have a reduction in the coverage level at this level.


                                                   52
Nevertheless, when the behavior of the total registration at this level is analyzed, the behavior by
groups of municipalities allows some additional analyses. Therefore it can be observed that as of
2011 the level of registered students has had reductions in the three groups although it is more
severe in the group of wealthy municipalities and to a lesser extent in the group of poorer
municipalities.

                                                                                      Pobres

Additionally, between 2008 and 2014 the registration volume increased in almost 3,131 students,
that is to say, a percentage close to a 6% increase in the total number of registered students at this
level. Nevertheless, when this same behavior by groups of municipalities is analyzed, it is clear
that poor and middle level municipalities obtained increases in the number of registered students.
In this sense, between 2008 and the 2014 poor municipalities increased their registration by about
10%, middle level municipalities increased by about 8% and wealthy municipalities only obtained
an increase of 4%; this indicates that a good part of the increase in the department’s registration is
explained by the behavior of the poorest municipalities.

Thus, it can be seen that there is an important increase in the registration level in the poorest
municipalities of more than 1,000 students in the period considered, and considering that there are
few municipalities in this group and relatively less educational institutions, the increases can be
considered to be significant.

The above demonstrates that although the increases in the coverage rate do not show the expected
results, there is an important increase in the level of registered students in the poorest
municipalities and it will be necessary to make important assessments of the population numbers
to explain the behavior of this rate.

With regards to quality, the results for the department still show important challenges for both the
official sector and the non-official sector; the fundamental objective meant to narrow the current
gap between the results obtained. It can be observed that the results compared between official and
non-official institutions in the department in the language and mathematics areas do not show
important variations especially in the last two years.

In the case of mathematics, the results analyzed since 2007 show that between official and non-
official institutions there were important differences. Nevertheless, a relative improvement in the
results of the mathematics area is seen and, already for 2013, the results for both groups of these
institutions tend to be closer and therefore the gap between them has been reduced.


                                                                      54
In the case of language, it can be seen that although official institutions maintain a superior level
during the first period of analysis, it can also be observed that for the last two years, the results of
both groups end up being closer and gaps in this group are also reduced. However, it is necessary
to note that the SABER 11 test had some methodological changes during 2012 that may have
affected the historical trends.

Additionally, when analyzing the evolution of the individual results of the 25 poorer municipalities
it is clear that important progress was made in a group of municipalities in language and
mathematics. 21 municipalities obtained improvements in the language area and 16 of them show
differences of more than one point in the SABER 11 results, which can be considered significantly
high. In the case of the mathematics the results of these 25 municipalities are more dissimilar,
since almost half of them improved their results, while the remaining group maintained or reduced
its results, causing non-significant changes in the global results of this group in this area as
previously mentioned.

Another important aspect is related to the rate of high-school education completion, which during
2007-11 maintained a trend to decline in both official and private institutions, and in all of the
municipalities of Antioquia. In general terms, the completion rate measured through the
information of c-600 in Antioquia, had a declining trend and during 2007-11 it decreased in a total
of 10 points. Nevertheless, it is necessary to clarify that during 2009-10 the process to implement
Decree 1290 in charge of the regulation of the students’ institutional evaluation and promotion
system was carried out, which indirectly affected the students’ repetition rates and therefore the
completion rate was affected during the years of its implementation. Nevertheless, a slight increase
was seen in 2011, especially in the poorest municipalities.

Following there is a brief description of the implementation and the results achieved by the Project
in each one of the components and subcomponents of the Project during the 2008-14.

Component 1: Equitable access to high-school education and opportunities to continue onto
higher education.

1.1 Implementation of flexible pedagogical models



                                                  55
The government of Antioquia, within the framework for the implementation of flexible models for
high-school education, has concentrated its efforts in the promotion of the rural high-school
education by means, not only of the implementation of the model but of the education and
qualification of leading teachers in the application thereof, without having the supply of flexible
pedagogical models for high-school education compete with traditional education. In this regards
the main efforts in the supply of flexible education has concentrated in the rural areas of the
department.

In this front, almost 20 official educational institutions of 12 municipalities of the sub-regions of
the low Cauca and Urabá, were accompanied for the implementation in 2013 of the educational
model “pensar media” developed and operated by Corpoeducación.

Training was carried out in these institutions for the adequate implementation of the flexible model
and to guarantee the harmonization between its pedagogical proposal condensed in the Institutional
Educational Project – PEI - and the pedagogical model so that its installation in the educational
institution and its continuity is guaranteed to focuson the rural population. Additionally, this
coaching was supported by a strategy to link off-school students (those students outside the
educational system) aiming to achieve the identification of this population in these municipalities
and their future entailment to the system through a flexible model mode.

1.2 Direct subsidies to high-school students

The program of incentives for permanence had to do with the delivery of direct economic resources
to high-school students in the department of Antioquia. The graph below shows the number of
students that benefitted from the Project during its implementation, where it stands out that the
data for 2012 is lower since it corresponded to the Project’s transition period with the change of
Departmental Administration and year 2014 corresponded only to the first half of the year.

The incentives for the permanence program were developed during this period, making direct
transfers to high-school education students and also contributed, among others aspects, to improve
the performance of high-school education students. Therefore, during 2013 a preliminary
evaluation of the program was made in order to estimate its impact on the students’ academic
results behavior. A comparison of the results through the methodology of differences in differences
was carried out in this evaluation, to assess the impact of the program at municipal level, in the
results of the common core areas. There, it was found that the program had important effects on
the behavior of the language area since it was statistically proven that in the municipalities that
participated in the program there were no significant differences in the results in 2000-08, whereas
for the years subsequent to the implementation, significant improvements were seen in the
municipalities that had a greater number of students who benefited from the program, something
that can also be observed in the English and physics areas. 17

1.3 Scholarships conditioned to increase access to higher education

The government of Antioquia, has started different strategies that have allowed high-school
students access to higher education. Until 2011 and part of 2012, the operation of the Gilberto
Echeverri Fund with almost 6,000 million pesos, carried out actions to benefit the students with
credits and maintenance subsidies for their access to higher education. Subsequently, the
conditioned scholarship fund with the main purpose of supporting young people of low income
and excellent academic conditions in the department to access higher education of relevance and
good quality.18

The scholarship fund created in 2012, intends to grant full conditioned scholarships for registration
fees and support for maintenance (maintenance, transport and/or housing) that allows more young
people in the regions of Antioquia to access higher education with a relevant approach for the
regions of the department.

This has allowed young people in social levels 1, 2 and 3 and under 26 years of age in all the sub-
regions of the department to have true opportunities to access higher education in a set of
institutions prioritized by the government in in technical professional education, technological and
professional university education.

Thus, for 2012 the summoning for the first period of 2013 began, resulting in almost 568
beneficiaries who began their studies in 2013. On the other hand, in 2013 two additional summons
were carried out resulting in a total of 4,326 beneficiaries and for the first half of 2014 the total
beneficiaries corresponded to a total of 6,181 people with the investment of resources coming from
both royalties as well as from direct resources of the government of Antioquia for a total of 30,957
million pesos.

1.4 Professional, vocational orientation and project of life

Regarding vocational orientation and the project of life, the government of Antioquia implemented
different strategies that allowed providing information and assistance to high-school students on
the opportunities to continue towards higher education and, generally, for the construction of their
project of life.

In this order of ideas, several strategies such as Fábrica del Futuro were carried out between years
2010 and 2011, where different higher education institutions among other players, provided
guidance to high-school students on financing alternatives, educational programs available as well
as assistance on subjects such as sexual and reproductive health, prevention of psychoactive
substances consumption and healthy lifestyles.

10 sub-regional high-school shows were carried out in 2013, where 11th grade students from the
municipalities of Antioquia, with the exception of Medellín, received information on different
higher education programs by the institutions, as well as academic spaces for discussion and
financing opportunities that the students of the department could have through the department’s
scholarship fund.

Additionally, the government of Antioquia, through the summation of efforts between the
Secretariat of Education and the Secretariat of Productivity and Competitiveness, started the
entrepreneur seed program in 2013,which allowed the education of 9,982 students of grades 10
and 11 in the department of Antioquia in 2012 and 11,103 in 2013 with the aim of stimulating
leadership, developing creative ideas and building projects of life in high-school students, that is

                                                 58
also linked to the Antioquia E model for the promotion of entrepreneurship and enterprise
development in the entire department.

Additionally, the Project for the improvement of high-school education, through the sub-projects
formulated in an individual way by the educational institutions that belong to the program, handed
out resources so that the educational institutions would develop a vocational orientation and project
of life program for high-school students.

Component 2: Quality and relevance of high-school education.

   2.1 Strengthening school work management for the quality of high-school education

Under this subcomponent, the design and implementation of a competence-based curriculum that
incorporated both, basic competences, as well as scientific, citizen competences and human capital
formation in management and leadership, was started in the educational institutions that
participated.

In this regards, the design of the competence-based curriculum in all the institutions that
participated began in 2011, giving a characterization of the institutions and an initial design of the
competence-based curriculum. Teachers were accompanied in this intervention in the design of
most important curricular elements and later their implementation was accompanied.

This is how since 2012 until mid- 2014, all participating institutions have been accompanied in the
competence-based curriculum implementation through the on-site presence of a local pedagogical
adviser. This coaching has allowed for the refining, fitting or re-contextualizing of important
elements of their teleological component, elements of the curricular management
(macrocurriculum, microcurriculum and pedagogical model), classroom plan and quality plan,
achieving that more than 70% of them have currently made important progress in all the
components beyond existence and some of them show significant progress in their implementation
in agreement with the information collected by local advisers.

This work, was also supplemented with educational strategies for teachers for the implementation
of the competence-based curriculum and evaluation by competences carried out in 2013 where
almost 2,593 teachers from all the sub-regions of the department participated, of which almost 492
of them belonged to institutions of the department’s poorest municipalities.

This teachers’ education, was supplemented with education of teachers in charge of the “Rectores
Líderes Transformadores” program during 2013 that also continued in 2014. This education was
meant to strengthen the leadership of teachers who direct official educational institutions, which
allow the transformation in the medium and long term of the quality of education in their respective
institutions. Therefore the education concentrates on aspects related to the director’s personal
jurisdiction (in his life and actions) and the invigoration of the director’s competitiveness as a
pedagogical leader of their educational institution. In this program, 108 directors of 55
municipalities of the department were certified, of which 9 are from the poorest municipalities in
the department.



                                                 59
Additionally, the Project carried out an important coaching in the institutions of the department
for the implementation of the methodological route of school coexistence, that was developed in
all the institutions that participated and that was supplemented with the incorporation of law 1620,
which created the national school coexistence and education system for the exercise of human
rights, education for sexuality and prevention and mitigation of school violence.

In this order of ideas, the project accompanied the institutions in the creation of coexistence
committees, collecting and structuring a diagnosis of school coexistence in a participative way,
construction of a plan of action articulated to the plan for institutional improvement and the
execution thereof, as well as the incorporation in the educational institution of the citizen
competences approach for school coexistence, thus achieving that 60% of the Project’s institutions
declare to have reached a great part of the objectives set forth in their school coexistence plans by
2013, which demonstrates the progress made in the implementation of the route, in spite of the re-
statement that was necessary in 2013 due to the new legislation.

In this subcomponent, education strategies for high-school students on basic competences in
language and mathematics were also carried out through the program “reinforce your competences”
that took place in 2013 and the first half of 2014. Under this program around 16,398 students of
grades 10 and 11 were educated. This intervention was focused on the poor municipalities that
also had low results in the external tests SABER 11; students of 20 out of the 25 poorer
municipalities participated in this intervention. One of the most notorious results of this
intervention was observed in the results of the SABER 11 tests in 2013, during which this group
of institutions obtained significant progress in the language and mathematics areas. The institutions
that participated in the program, managed to increase their average scores in comparison to the
2012 scores in almost 1.7 points, whereas in the mathematics area, although there was a reduction
in all the institutions of the department, the results of these institutions do not have significant
differences.

Another important aspect in the intervention of this subcomponent is related to the resource
transfers to the set of educational institutions for their intervention in the institutional sub-projects
designed by the educational institutions with support of the local adviser. Such sub-projects had 7
lines of investment, that is to say:

    1. Implementation of the competence-based curriculum within the framework of the
       improvement plan.
    2. Education of teachers and school directors in the application of the competence-based
       curriculum.
    3. Coexistence and peace
    4. Professional, vocational orientation and project of life
    5. Improvement of School environments
    6. Pedagogical resources and information technologies
    7. School management.




                                                   60
On this point, the role of the financial advisers in charge of orienting the educational institutions
and their directors in relation to the transparent investment of the resources provided within the
framework of the institutional sub-projects, was particularly important.

   2.2 Technical high-school education reform (information pending of the evaluation of the
       supply of technical high-school education and technical education)

Component 3: Institutional invigoration, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project
Management.

      Pedagogical Technical advice and assistance

The technical assistance to the municipalities and the educational institutions was one of the main
strategies of the Project, in order to strengthen the same institutions and the entire official
educational system in the department. Therefore the group of local advisers was responsible for:

   1. Supporting the Director and the Board of Directors in the activation of the participation of
      the Institution’s educational players in relation to the project.
   2. Orienting, from a participative process, the identification of needs in goods, works, services
      and technical assistance for the invigoration of high-school Education.
   3. Accompanying the Institutions in the project’s planning, organization, execution, follow-
      up and evaluation.
   4. Orienting new policies and resources management for the project’s financing.
   5. Sensitizing municipal authorities, directors, teachers, students, parents and Boards of
      directors in the Project
   6. Reviewing in a participative manner the diagnosis of high-school Education, starting off
      from the existing baseline
   7. Checking the coherence of the sub-projects with the high-school Education Improvement
      Plan, the PEM, the PEI and the Project’s guidelines.
   8. Providing advice, support and technical assistance to the institutions in the design and
      implementation of the curriculum by competences and in general, the curricular
      management (macro and micro curriculum and pedagogical model) as well as the
      teleological component, the classroom plan and the quality or improvement plan.

What was achieved by this intervention was that the coaching was made very closely to the
directive teams in the educational institutions that participated as well as to the community in
general. Aspects that were observed in the behavior of the level of satisfaction of the educational
institutions, their teaching and directive staff with the work performed by the local adviser that
was satisfactory for almost 97% of the institutions that participated, growing in more than 10
percentage points since 2010, where it was closer to 87%.

In general, these results show success in the intervention of local advisors and in the generation of
installed capacity to the interior of the Secretariat of Education to provide counseling and technical
assistance to educational institutions and municipalities regarding educational management and
specifically academic management.

      Follow-up and assessment System

Finally, the Project had designed a follow-up and assessment system that allowed accounting for
the interventions performed at all levels in the department, and specifically in the institutions that
participated. As support to the follow-up and assessment system there was the Alphasig
information system that allowed to directly perform an important management of the information
for the topics of incentives to permanence, registration, follow-up for graduated students, follow-
up to the execution of institutional sub-projects and indicators. This software was implemented in
all the educational institutions that participated and supported the management of the information
between the Secretariat of Education and the educational institutions.

   3. Lessons Learned

Local Pedagogical advice

The extensive work developed by local advisors allowed to generate room for improvement in the
educational institutions. Therefore, it is important to highlight as a lesson that a direct approach
with the institutions generates important challenges with regards to sustainability in time so that
periodical revisions and adjustments to elements like the PEI, curricular grid, pedagogical model,
classroom plans and quality plans render the effects desired in the quality of the students’ learning.

Therefore, it has been observed that the generation of pedagogical spaces for participative work
around the academic processes, where the Secretariat of Education is present, will allow the
educational institutions to progress in institutional improvement.

The effective entailment of teachers and school directors in the design and implementation of all
these elements is also important so that its future sustainability and its true incorporation in the
classroom is guaranteed, which in turn assures an improvement of the students’ results and a their


                                                 62
better development as citizens and in the labor and academic world subsequent to high-school
education.

Technical education

Accounting and financial management of the project

The implementation of controls and strategies for the follow-up and control of the accounting and
financial information allowed performing a suitable control of the resources, not only those
originating in the credit but the own resources of the government of Antioquia invested in the
Project.

Regarding this aspect, the Secretariat of Education was able to obtain important progress that
allowed for the improvement of the quality and opportunity of the financial information for
decision making especially during the Project’s closing. These aspects were also confirmed by the
results of the last years in the Project’s external audit.

Follow-up and assessment System

The design of tools that allow a periodic follow-up to the actions developed by the Project allowed
an adequate accountability to a large extent of the interventions performed.

Nevertheless, it is important that the information management processes be increasingly improved
at all levels in the Secretariat of Education, making of this process a continuous aspect that allows
the flow of information and that will increase informed decision making on the educational
processes in the department’s municipalities and institutions.
