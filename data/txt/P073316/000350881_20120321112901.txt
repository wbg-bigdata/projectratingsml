           IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the Bank’s lending operations through field work. In
selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant
to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other documents,
visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country stakeholders, and interview
Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared internally,
the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower for review. IEG
incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are attached to the document
that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is
disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s objectives are consistent with
the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
        This is a multi-country Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for four
Development Policy Operations (DPOs) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the
Republic of Congo (RoC) during 2001 to 2006.1 Besides ensuring the integrity of the Bank‘s
self-evaluation process by verifying the Bank‘s work in producing expected results, the multi-
country PPAR provides an opportunity to compare processes and results at the cross-country
level and to extract lessons from them. In particular, this PPAR evaluates four credits
implemented in a setting of fragile2 post-conflict and resource-rich countries, with entrenched
lack of governance and transparency and therefore aims to inform the Bank‘s knowledge stock
that will inspire future dialogue and engagement with this category of clients.

        The two operations for the Democratic Republic of Congo are:

        The Economic Recovery Credit (P057293) in the amount of $450 million equivalent
was approved on June 13, 2002 and became effective two weeks later. It was slated to be
delivered in three tranches: the first on effectiveness ($410 million) and two floating tranches,
one for forestry ($15 million) and another for mining ($25 million).3 The credit was closed on
June 30, 2003.

        The Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit (P082443) in the amount of
$200 million equivalent was approved on February 26, 2004 and made effective on May 13,
2004, six weeks after its planned date of effectiveness. It was disbursed in four tranches: the first
on effectiveness ($85 million) and three floating tranches, to be released on condition of progress
in reforming the retirement program ($47.5 million), in clearing the debt to private creditors
($42.5 million) and in ensuring timely utilities payments ($25 million). The credit was closed on
December 31, 2005, six months after its planned closing date.

        The two operations for the Republic of Congo are:

       The Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit (P073316) in the amount of
$37.5 million equivalent was approved on July 31, 2001 and became effective one week later. It
was disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The credit was closed on June 30, 2004,
one year after its planned closing date.

       The Economic Recovery Credit (P083627) in the amount of $30 million equivalent was
approved on December 7, 2004 and made effective on March 16, 2005. It was to be disbursed in
two tranches: The first tranche of about $17 million was disbursed on effectiveness, and the

 In this PPAR, the four credits will be referred to as DRC-ERC-I, and DRC-ERC-II for the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and RoC-ERC-I, and RoC-ERC-II for the Republic of Congo.

 The term ‗fragile‘ is used throughout the text to describe these two countries, following current international
practice, rather than using LICUS (Low Income Countries Under Stress) or the more specific Post-Conflict that was
used in some project titles and certainly also correctly describes the country situations.

  While the approved credit amounted to US$450 million, the disbursed amount totaled US$481.10 million, owing
to SDR appreciation against the US$.

second, of about $13 million, was cancelled since most of the conditions for disbursement were
not met. The credit was closed on schedule in December 2006.

        This PPAR was prepared by Dusan Vujovic and Nestor Ntungwanayo (Task Managers),
based on contributions from John Sinclair, Consultant, under the direction of Ali Khadr and
Ismail Arslan. Martha Ainsworth provided thorough and useful comments. It is based on
relevant Bank and Fund documents and on interviews with involved staff. An Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited the two countries in February 2009 to discuss
performance with officials engaged with the projects, representative donors, staff of the Bank
resident mission and other stakeholders. Their cooperation and assistance in preparing the report
is gratefully acknowledged.

        This PPAR was shared with the Bank‘s Regional Management and the two governments,
but no comments were received from either party.

Executive Summary
1.       This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses four Development Policy
Operations (DPOs) that were used to support two fragile and post-conflict countries (Democratic
Republic of Congo [DRC] and Republic of Congo [RoC]) in their reengagement with the donor
community, and draws conclusions and lessons from the implementation results of the four
credits.

2.      The common feature of these four credits is that they were the early Bank operations
designed to support fragile and post-conflict countries, characterized by internal weak capacity,
reduced ownership, and a political leadership confronted to a wide-range of priorities. Moreover,
these countries are endowed with rich natural resources, and have had difficulties to ascertain
governance and transparency in the management of public resources.

3.      The immediate objective of the four credits was to help the beneficiary countries to clear
external arrears, and reengage with the donor community. The reengagement was also an
opportunity for the two post-conflict countries to regain access to bilateral and multilateral
financial support, and most importantly to benefit from extended debt relief. Moreover, the
operations aimed to unleash reforms supporting sustained growth through reviving the private
sector and increased management of public and natural resources.

4.      The two-pronged objective of helping to clear external arrears to the Bank and to
reengage with the donor community was achieved promptly and in a satisfactory manner in both
countries. However, these two results were not ends in themselves. They were intended to pave
the way for a larger dialogue between the respective governments and domestic and external
partners on the best ways to create the conditions for sustained economic growth, improved
management of natural and public resources, and poverty reduction. All four credits pursued
objectives falling under these three themes.

5.     This PPAR led to the identification of five findings which are summarized below.

6.      First, the four operations were timely and effective in reestablishing access to
development assistance (by helping to clear past arrears to the International Development
Association [IDA] and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD]) and
in securing critical budget support to governments during the initial post-conflict years. The
operations were also effective in mobilizing and coordinating donor support, and enabling both
countries to gain full access to substantial debt relief benefits extended under the enhanced
highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.

7.       Second, the design of DPOs was overly complex and displayed less-than-full consistency
between objectives and measures supported. The four operations covered a wide range of critical
thematic areas. They restarted the pre-war reform efforts or initiated critical policy and
institutional changes in the areas of macroeconomic stabilization and growth, governance, public
sector reforms, improved financial discipline, financial sector reform, private sector
development, and improved management of natural resources (in mining, forestry, and oil). In
some cases, the reform efforts were sustained over two or more operations in roughly the same
form; in other cases the focus of reforms shifted from general towards more specific sector
                                                viii


issues; and, in quite a few cases, entire policy areas were dropped after the first operation with
little or no justification, despite the fact that the objectives remained highly relevant, and
progress in achieving them was negligible. As regards to consistency, there was a mismatch
between the predominantly long-term structural and institutional reform objectives pursued by
the DPOs, and the short-tem nature of the policy measures undertaken in the context of the four
credits. Faced with the urgency to respond promptly to country post-conflict needs and realizing
that little could be done within a short time span in the immediate post-conflict situation, Bank
teams favored credit designs that were clearly skewed towards fast disbursements based on front-
loaded policies. In most instances, the short term measures and actions were not sustained and/or
followed up so as to reach the ultimate objectives.

8.       Third, the results framework underlying the four post-conflict DPOs was weak and
ineffective. This was partly due to the lack of recent analytical and advisory work or a reliable
knowledge base of country-specific circumstances, and partly due to inadequate focus and
coverage of the results frameworks followed in the four operations. Instead of being simple,
realistic, selective, and balanced across key dimensions of post-conflict recovery, with wide
national ownership and sufficient donor buy-in, the results matrices in the four DPOs were
almost the exact opposite. The proposed set of objectives was too wide and comprehensive in
thematic coverage, especially in the initial operations. The results frameworks were incomplete
in providing an integrated view of the results chain. They failed to provide evidence that the
proposed reform programs enjoyed broad national ownership among key political and social
stakeholders, and sufficient donor buy-in.

9.      Fourth, there was insufficient active coordination and synergy in sequencing policy and
reform actions undertaken in both countries in the context of the DPOs versus the enhanced
HIPC initiative agenda. In situations where DPO-supported reforms were well-defined,
coordinated, and sequenced with the forthcoming HIPC events, we observed positive synergy
both at the level of specific policy actions and related reform areas. In contrast, when DPOs
supported ambitious and unclear objectives that were not coordinated and sequenced with policy
triggers contained in the future HIPC events, the apparent gaps created mixed incentives and led
to delays in the implementation of important reforms.

10.     Fifth, the failure to secure sustained policy and institutional support as well as technical
assistance was a roadblock on the path towards improved governance and management of natural
resources. After almost a decade of attempts to improve governance, transparency, and
efficiency in managing natural resource sectors, the results are negligible and, more importantly,
have not been sustained. Less than six months after passing the HIPC completion point triggers
and receiving the largest debt relief in history, DRC awarded resource concessions in a non-
transparent manner, indicating that it has yet to take a critical and irreversible step in the
direction of improved governance and transparent natural resource management.

11.     Achievement of development outcome was rated unsatisfactory for both credits to the
Democratic Republic of Congo. For the Democratic Republic of Congo Economic Recovery
Credit (DRC-ERC-I), the rating was based on the following elements. The relevance of the
objectives was modest and the relevance of design was negligible. Regarding efficacy,
performance can be summarized as follows: (i) there were limited results in macro-stability,
financial sector reform, mining and forestry, and (ii) negligible progress was recorded in
                                                ix


governance and state-owned enterprises (SOE) reform. For the Democratic Republic of Congo
Post-Unification Economic Recovery Credit (DRC-ERC-II), the relevance of objectives was
substantial while the relevance of design was modest. As regards achieved results, there was
substantial achievement in the settlement of domestic debt arrears, modest achievement in
sustaining macro-stability, and negligible progress in defining a medium-term development
strategy, launching civil service reform, and reforming public utilities. In both cases, the main
reasons for poor performance were an ambitious reform agenda for the limited implementation
capacity and weak ownership of reforms.

12.     Achievement of development outcome was rated unsatisfactory for both credits to the
Republic of Congo. In the case of both credits, the relevance of objectives was substantial, while
the relevance of design was rated modest. For the Republic of Congo Post-Conflict Economic
Rehabilitation Credit (RoC-ERC-I), overall progress in achieving the credit‘s objective was
limited. First, privatization of targeted state-owned banks had limited impact. Second, there was
no progress in other privatizations (of water, electricity, and railway), and the reform of the
autonomous Port of Pointe Noire and the review of the labor code simply did not take place.
Third, the progress in reforming the postal service and telecommunications was at a preliminary
phase and has not reached a no-reversal point. Fourth, all attempts to increase transparency in
the management of the oil sector and forestry stalled, and procurement reform scarcely took off.
For the Republic of Congo Economic Recovery Credit (RoC-ERC-II), achievement of outcome
at the credit closure was as follows: (i) the majority of actions slated to address governance
issues in the oil sector stalled, (ii) none of the significant actions proposed by the credit to
improve the efficiency of the public investment program was completed, and finally (iii) there
were significant irregularities and corruption issues in the settlement of domestic arrears.

13.    The comparative analysis of the implementation of the four operations points to the
following lessons:

14.     First, in a post-conflict environment, a DPO instrument supporting an overly heavy
reform program yields weak results. Deep reforms changing the patterns of governance and
public sector management require adequate preparation, including political economy assessment,
consensus-building effort and wide political and social ownership. In the absence of such
thorough preparation, the likelihood of success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long run
gains for the country and society. Likewise, reliance on windows of opportunity of narrow
support for reform based on a single ―reform champion‖ increases the risks of setback and failure
if they are not supported by a strong political and social constituency. In both countries, and for
each operation, ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only assured fleetingly
by the lure of arrears clearance or debt relief. Engagement of the political leadership and
ownership of reforms by respective governments followed a pattern of temporary commitment to
reforms for immediate returns.

15.     Second, the absence of an up-to-date knowledge base and shared diagnostics handicaps
the design and the efficacy of a Development Policy Operation. The design of the four DPOs
was based on partial, imperfect, and sometimes outdated information due to lack of recent
economic and sector work (ESW) and poor statistics. The knowledge gap was acute in
practically all areas of policy intervention. This adversely affected the design of policies,
undermined capacity building efforts, and severely constrained a meaningful choice of priorities
                                                 x


and sequencing of reform steps within and across operations. Some prior engagement in
analytical and advisory work, and perhaps even providing for selected diagnostic work under the
credit(s), could have helped: fill the knowledge gap; inform sector policies; build political
consensus and social ownership of reforms; enable improved service delivery; enhance the
design of second round operations; and increase the overall likelihood of achieving desired
outcomes.

16.     Third, the principles of efficient operation and standard (or good) practice approach to
design and implement Bank operations cannot easily be ―transposed‖ to post-conflict
environments. When squeezed by time (both in project preparation and ESW), staff are likely to
replicate the known program design solutions with minimal (often superficial) customization.
First round and to some extent second round operations in DRC and RoC suffered from this
drawback. The scope of proposed reforms was very similar to standard practice, despite the
evident differences on the ground in DRC and RoC. The gap was further exacerbated by the
inadequacy of the standard supervision effort relying on Washington-based staff and limited
presence in the field. Post-conflict situations demand strong management and senior technical
staff presence to build quality of dialogue and support for reforms, and to nurture partnership
across a wide political and social spectrum.

17.     Fourth, selectivity in the choice of objectives and simple credit design are key to success
in post-conflict environments. The reform program supported by the four DPOs entailed a
comprehensive set of complex long run reform objectives that could not possibly be achieved in
a difficult post-conflict environment over the fairly limited life of the projects with severely
constrained set of mostly short-term policy instruments. If a small subset of objectives that
ultimately recorded modest achievements had received undivided attention, the results could
have been much better moving the credit outcome into the satisfactory outcome range of the
rating scale.

1. Country Context and Economic Performance
1.1      This multi-country Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers four
development policy operations (DPOs) implemented in two neighboring post-conflict and fragile
states over the 2001- 2006 period. Two operations were extended to the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) in 2002 and 2004, and two went to the Republic of Congo (RoC) in 2001 and
2004. The overarching objective was to assist the new governments in normalizing relations
with external creditors and in financing the post-conflict recovery. The first critical task was to
facilitate the repayment of arrears to multilateral organizations, including the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD). The framework for World Bank activities in DRC and RoC was provided through
successive transitional support strategies (TSS). The first TSS for DRC was discussed by the
Board in July 2001, and the second in January 2004. In the case of RoC, the first TSS was
discussed by the Board in January 2001, and the second in September 2003. The first post-
conflict country assistance strategies (CAS) were prepared in 2007 for DRC and in 2009 for
RoC, long after the second round of DPOs were closed.

1.2      A comparative assessment of the four credits will be developed in the next chapter and
the four annexes devoted to the evaluation of each credit. The rest of the first chapter is about the
country context and economic performance and will set the stage. The second chapter will
present an overview of the performance of the credits implementation in two sub-chapters. First,
it will present key results achieved in the context of the four credits, including the achievement
of objectives and outcome for each credit, but also the risk to development outcome, the
performance of both the Bank and the Borrower. Second, it will summarize key findings and
lessons distilled from the comparative analysis of the implementation of the four credits. The
four annexes (Annex A1 and Annex A2 for the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Annex B1
and Annex B2 for the Republic of Congo) will provide an in-depth assessment of the four
credits.

Democratic Republic of Congo
1.3     DRC, formerly Zaire, has a long history of poor leadership, gross mismanagement and
internal/regional conflict. Between 1965 and 1997, under the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, DRC
saw a gradual disintegration of the state, increasing human rights abuses and the loss of most
social infrastructure. In 1997, the Mobutu regime was overthrown by Laurent Kabila. The
ensuing civil war finally ended in early 2001, following the assassination of Laurent Kabila and a
strong international intervention. His son, Joseph Kabila, was selected to lead a ‗transitional‘
government. The fighting during the 1990s took (directly and indirectly) between 2 and 3
million lives, and caused immense suffering of too many, mostly women and children.

1.4    When the Bank resumed its operations in DRC in 2001, the country was faced with
enormous challenges. The population, estimated at 51 million, the fourth largest in Africa, was
exhausted by years of bitter war, starvation, and suffering. The capital city was flooded with
refugees. The private sector has nearly collapsed. The rural society was isolated and pushed
back into subsistence mode. The limited infrastructure was almost totally shattered. In 2000, the
average per capita income was $224, down from an estimated $380 in 1960. With 70 percent of
                                                       2


the population living below the poverty line and life expectancy estimated at 44 years, DRC is
one of the lowest ranked countries in the UNDP‘s human development index. The same adverse
factors that contributed to declining incomes, combined with severely limited internal
transportation capacity, led to exceptionally fast urbanization. Kinshasa, the capital of DRC, has
a population exceeding 8 million.

1.5     Basic functions of the state recovered slowly while the key sectors—mining and
forestry—operated far below potential, often controlled by local power-brokers who diverted
earnings for private gain or to finance ‗private‘ militias and war operations. During the early
post-conflict years between 1998 and 2000, DRC was a very fragile country burdened by
ongoing conflicts, extreme uncertainty and poor prospects of recovery. Piecemeal improvements
and partial normalization of government operations and modest economic revival were the most
one could hope for.

1.6    Despite many difficulties and grim prospects, the 2001-2006 period was also the time of
hope and new beginning for the DRC. Despite the readiness of Joseph Kabila‘s transitional
government to work with the international community, normalization was a hesitant, incremental
process. A key milestone was reached in June 2003 by forming a viable and legitimate
government of national unity led by Joseph Kabila.

1.7      The Bank and most donors had suspended economic assistance to DRC through a better
part of the 1990s. At the first sign of a viable peace prospect, the Bank made an extraordinary
effort to swiftly support the country along four dimensions: (i) developing a transitional support
strategy; (ii) preparing a substantial development policy operation that would help both clear
arrears and establish a policy and institutional reform footprint for years to come; (iii) leading
and coordinating multiple donors to secure sufficient external financing that would take DRC
safely to joining the ongoing highly-indebted poor countries (HIPC) process; and
(iv) reestablishing a credible World Bank field presence in order to maintain complex policy
dialogue under tense political circumstances and ongoing hostilities. The Bank initiated positive
actions on all the above fronts. However, unrealistic demands under multiple constraints with
limited resources adversely affected the quality of the first DPO, the $450 million Economic
Recovery Credit (2002-03), assessed in Annex A1. It is less clear why the same pattern was
extended to the second DPO, the $200 million Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit
(2004-05), assessed in Annex A2, as well as a third, follow-on DPO1 and parallel HIPC
initiatives (decision point in 2003 and completion point in 2010). Post-HIPC dialogue on the
sustainability of reforms briefly revived since mid-2009 was a welcome new opportunity to take
stock of institutional reforms and seek their continuation under the current partnership strategy.

1.8     Progress toward the HIPC completion point provided the authorities with a policy reform
framework that supported the country‘s efforts to enhance macroeconomic stability, address
weaknesses in public financial management and economic governance, and reform the social
sectors in the context of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Credit Facility
approved in March 2010. As a result, DRC‘s macroeconomic performance was strong in 2010.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was above 7 percent, inflation fell to below
10 percent for the first time in several years, and the external position improved. The above

    Transitional Support Economic Recovery approved on December 8, 2005.
                                                         3


positive developments were underpinned by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. However, the
country has yet to focus on structural reform priorities needed to consolidate macroeconomic
stability, sustain high growth, and improve the business environment.

Republic of Congo
1.9     RoC declined on the economic front since the 1960s. This decline occurred despite the
country‘s modest population size (estimated at 3.2 million in 2000) relative to the resource base,
its substantial endowment with arable land, rich tropical forests, important mineral resources,
and substantial oil production (the 5th highest in Africa). Gross national income (GNI) per
capita, which was about $1,100 in 1990, fell to about half that level by 2001 and only recovered
to the 1990 level in 2006. Human development indicators are below the averages of low-income
countries despite the fact that the country‘s income is in the lower middle-income range. The
population is plagued by substantial inequalities and is politically marginalized. Some 60 percent
of the population lives in urban areas, due to a continuing influx of the poor into the capital city,
many historically driven by war-related fear rather than opportunity.

1.10 RoC suffered three rounds of civil conflict in the 1990s. At the height of the crisis in late-
1999, an estimated 810,000 people, close to one-third of the population, were displaced.
Strikingly, the displaced population was mostly from urban areas, mainly from the capital,
Brazzaville, forced to take refuge in the forests. The fighting involved the army and four main
militias, some of which had links to the old Marxist regime and some to more centrist forces
aligned with the man who emerged as the (still current) president, Denis Sassou N‘Guesso. The
1990s were thus a decade of massive social dislocation and human suffering through hunger,
violence and sexual abuse, and destruction of large parts of the physical and economic
infrastructure.

1.11 The cycle of civil conflict was finally broken by a cease-fire in December 1999, leading to a
first stable government under President N‘Guesso. This peace has essentially survived until now,
despite local fighting with one remaining group, finally settled in March 2003 and also continuing
small-scale but disruptive fighting along the route of the main rail-line to the port at Pointe-Noire,
the second largest city, which remained the locus of most private sector activity, as well as the
centre for the key, all off-shore, oil sector (roughly 65 percent of GNP).

1.12 The early developmental challenge for ROC was to stop the economic decline and
instead build upon the ‗peace dividend‘ to create the foundation for a more diversified and
sustainable economic growth that would provide for accelerated poverty reduction, better
governance, and the consolidation of peace. The early results were at best mixed. Economic
activity has restarted and there was a very substantial reconstruction2 effort, largely financed by
the government with its oil revenues. The recovery has not been deep-rooted or broad-based.
During the period of civil war (1990-99) most of the social indicators declined, but by 2005
some had recovered roughly to their 1990 levels. The urban population continued to be plagued
by severe structural unemployment as the economy failed to diversify.

  This is evident in the capital with many new and modern key government buildings, in stark contrast with the
situation in Kinshasa.

1.13 Rising oil prices, combined with increasing production, has since accelerated economic
growth, surging by nearly 13 percent in 2005 and growing roughly 6 percent in 2006-07. The
natural resource driver of the economy, oil, has been for long subject to non-transparent
management. However, in the run-up to achieving the enhanced HIPC completion point,
progress was made in the quality of accounting, in the realized prices, and in reconciling
transfers with budget data. The oil sector is also volatile and vulnerable, even if earlier
indications of supply limitations have now been reversed with new wells coming on-stream.
Price growth in 2007/08 was high, but has fallen back with global price declines.

1.14 The country‘s performance under a recent IMF‘s Extended Credit Facility and the HIPC
framework has been threatened by domestic and global developments, including a presidential
election in 2009, the global financial crisis, and a plunge in world oil prices in 2009 which
reduced RoC‘s oil revenue by about a third. By the end of 2009, the country had made some
significant achievements. In January 2010, the IMF and World Bank approved the enhanced
HIPC debt relief in the amount of $1.9 billion, freeing up financial resources for health,
education, and other social services.

1.15 RoC still faces considerable challenges ahead, including: (i) an expected decline in oil
production over the next few years; and (ii) urgently needed structural reform to diversify the
economy and reduce its dependence on this commodity. RoC also needs to manage its debt
better, to continue raising the quality of its spending, and to ensure that recent efforts to bolster
oil sector governance and commercialization yield the highest possible returns to the people of
Congo. While the last few years have been ones of political stability, the root causes of civil
conflict (fragmentation of the social fabric among political clans, lack of voice and participation
in the use of oil) are still largely there. There is also growing poverty for many, limited
restoration of basic services and a burgeoning, largely jobless,3 young population.

2. Recovery and Rehabilitation Operations: Summary,
Findings, and Lessons
SUMMARY OF CREDITS IMPLEMENTATION
2.1     This PPAR reviews four DPOs delivered in DRC and RoC during the immediate post-
conflict period (FY2000-2007), in support of efforts to consolidate and sustain peace, restore
security, and revive economic activity after years of devastating civil wars.

2.2    In the absence of medium-term country programs, the four DPOs were designed as stand-
alone operations and funded by IDA credits under initial TSS presented to the Board in January
2001 for RoC and July 2001 for DRC.

2.3     Throughout the preparation and implementation of the four DPOs the two countries did
not have a full poverty reduction strategy or a medium-term country assistance/partnership
strategy. In the case of DRC, the first post-war CAS was presented to the Board in November
2007, seven months after the first poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) was submitted and
more than six years after the first TSS. In the case of RoC, the process was even longer: the first
post-war CAS was discussed in May 2009, almost a year after the submission of the first PRSP
in June 2008, and about eight and one-half years from the first TSS.

2.4    The total IDA resources committed to the four operations amounted to $717 million
equivalent at the time of negotiations. Due to SDR appreciation against the US dollar, the total
disbursed amount was higher ($736.2 million), even after allowing for the cancelled $13 million
tranche to RoC. About $681.1 million of the actual disbursements went to the DRC, and
$55.1 million went to RoC.

2.5     The four IDA credits were disbursed in multiple tranches following the achievement of
corresponding sets of policy and institutional actions. A large portion of the funding provided
under the first round of operations was intended for clearance of arrears to IDA and IBRD
accumulated during the war years. In the case of DRC, $338 million were directly earmarked for
that purpose, leaving $143 million for budget support. In the case of RoC, the funds provided
under the first DPO partially compensated the government which had already cleared $63
million of arrears to IBRD and IDA.

2.6     In addition to assisting the governments of DRC and RoC to clear arrears and, thus,
reestablish their access to external financing and, equally important, qualify for debt relief
extended under the enhanced HIPC initiative, the four DPOs also pursued a full range of priority
development objectives relevant in post-conflict fragile situations.

Achievement of Development Objectives
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO

2.7     The two-pronged objective of the Democratic Republic of Congo Economic Recovery
Credit (DRC-ERC-I) was to (i) help settle the outstanding bridge financing used to clear DRC‘s
arrears to IDA and IBRD and (ii) achieve progress in key policy and structural reforms.
Performance toward achieving the credit objective included the following:

      DRC-ERC-I operation helped to reengage with the donor community as a large share of
       resources made available under the first tranche was used to settle the outstanding bridge
       financing provided by the donors to clear the country's arrears to IDA and IBRD.

      Out of the seven policy objectives that the credit supported, the efficacy in achieving
       results was modest in five of them (macro-stability, public financial management (PFM),
       financial sector reform, mining, and forestry), and negligible in two (governance and
       state-owned enterprises [SOE] reform).

      The main reason for relatively poor performance was an overly ambitious reform agenda
       for the limited implementation capacity and the weak ownership of reforms, exacerbated
       by a mismatch between front-loaded short-term measures used and long-term
       development goals pursued.

      Based on the above results, this review rates the achievement of project objective as
       negligible.

2.8     Credit objectives of the Democratic Republic of Congo Post-Unification Economic
Recovery Credit (DRC-ERC-II) were pursued in five main policy areas: (i) national program
implementation, (ii) macroeconomic policy framework, (iii) civil service reform, (iv) domestic
debt, and (v) management of public utilities (water and power).

      The second operation did not benefit sufficiently from the experience acquired in DRC-
       ERC-I and faced many problems demonstrated earlier: complex and unbalanced design,
       with unclear priorities and weak implementation.

      The loss of reform interest due to competing priorities, and declining economic
       performance eroded the overall credit outcome, but renewed interest in reforms was
       triggered during the run-up to HIPC completion point in the last two years.

      Results included (i) the settlement of domestic debt arrears, (ii) modest achievement in
       sustaining macro-stability and improving public expenditure management, and (iii)
       limited progress in shaping and consistently implementing a well-structured and
       prioritized medium-term development strategy, in launching civil service reform, and in
       reforming public utilities. On the basis of the above elements, this review rates the
       achievement of credit objective as negligible.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

2.9     The objectives of the Republic of Congo Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit
(RoC-ERC-I) were to: (i) pursue and deepen structural reforms halted by the conflict and
(ii) improve governance and transparency in the management of the country‘s natural wealth and
public funds. Key achievements under the RoC-ERC-I include:

      Moderate advances in reforms enabling greater scope for private sector operations; and
       introduction of a new public procurement system. The reform agenda did not achieve its
       goal of privatizing public utilities (water, electricity, and railway), where few results were
       achieved.

      On balance, while recognizing the achievements in key areas of governance in the
       management of natural resources and public funds, this review notes a serious loss of the
       reform momentum in the 2004-2008 period caused mainly by the weak political ownership.

      Based on the above results, this evaluation rates the achievement of credit objective as
       negligible.

2.10 The Republic of Congo Economic Recovery Credit (RoC-ERC-II) aimed to achieve three
objectives: (i) help improve the quality of management and transparency in the oil sector,
(ii) assist in the design of a sound public investment program, and (iii) contribute to an orderly
resolution of large domestic debts.

      The political ownership of reforms during the active credit period (2005-2006) turned out
       to be weak, especially after the disbursement of the first tranche. A weak results
       framework and the absence of effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements
       affected most policy actions and reforms envisaged under the project, which were partially
       implemented, delayed or stalled, blocking the disbursement of the second tranche.

      As of the credit closing date, the only partial success was the clearance of the domestic
       arrears. Few measures were underway to ensure transparency in the oil sector, and no
       significant action was implemented to improve the public investment program. As part of
       a wider effort to meet the completion point triggers under the enhanced HIPC initiative,
       the government resumed many of the reforms and policies initiated under the second
       operation, after being dormant for few years.

      The contribution of the domestic debt resolution plan, the new accounting systems in the
       oil sector, and the improved appraisal rules and more stringent execution for public sector
       investment projects, started to show impact only in 2008-2009.

      On balance, while recognizing the importance of proposed reforms for improved
       governance in the oil sector, better public investment performance and improved
       financial discipline for private sector growth, this review notes the low outcome
       performance when the credit was active, and reiterates the weak political ownership of
       reforms during credit implementation.

      On the basis of the above evidence, this PPAR rates the achievement of credit objective
       as negligible.

Achievement of Development Outcome
2.11 Achievement of development outcome was rated unsatisfactory for both credits to the
Democratic Republic of Congo. For DRC-ERC-I, the rating was based on the following
elements. The relevance of the objectives was modest and the relevance of design negligible.
Regarding efficacy, performance can be summarized as follows: (i) limited results in macro
stability, financial sector reform, mining and forestry, and (ii) negligible progress in governance
and SOE reform. For DRC-ERC-II, the relevance of objectives was substantial while the relevance
of design was modest. As regards achieved results, there was substantial achievement in the
settlement of domestic debt arrears, modest achievement in sustaining macro-stability, and
negligible progress in defining a medium-term development strategy, launching civil service
reform, and reforming public utilities. In both cases however, the main reasons for poor
performance were an ambitious reform agenda for the limited implementation capacity and weak
ownership of reforms.

2.12 Achievement of development outcome was rated unsatisfactory for both credits to the
Republic of Congo. In the case of both credits, the relevance of objectives was substantial, while
the relevance of design was rated modest. For RoC-ERC-I, overall progress in achieving the
credit‘s objective was limited. First, privatization of targeted state-owned banks had limited
impact. Second, there was no progress in other privatizations (of water, electricity, and railway),
and the reform of the autonomous Port of Pointe Noire and the review of the labor code simply
did not take place. Third, the progress in reforming the postal service and telecommunications
was at a preliminary phase and has not reached a no-reversal point. Fourth, all attempts to
increase transparency in the management of the oil sector and forestry stalled, and procurement
reform scarcely took off. For the ERC-II, achievement of outcome at the credit closure was as
follows: (i) the majority of actions slated to address governance issues in the oil sector stalled,
(ii) none of the significant actions proposed by the credit to improve the efficiency of the public
investment program was completed, and finally (iii) there were significant irregularities and
corruption issues in the settlement of domestic arrears.

Risk to Development Outcome
2.13 Democratic Republic of Congo. The situation improved markedly in mid-2009 as the
country resumed the majority of reforms as part of an effort to meet the triggers for the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative which was achieved in mid-2010.

2.14 Going forward, the identified main risks (weak ownership of reforms and possible policy
reversals) to development outcomes will remain, especially if the country fails to complete
institutional reforms and embark on a sustainable growth path based on efficient use of its ample
natural resources. Dormant reforms for years were swiftly revitalized and implemented. This
fast approach to reach HIPC completion point triggers raises doubts about the broad ownership
of reforms and sustainability of policy changes recently implemented to comply with the poverty
reduction and growth facility (PRGF) and HIPC requirements. Because of the pressures and
                                                 9


incentives to reach the HIPC completion point that underpins actual performance, this review
rates the risk to development outcome as significant for both credits.

2.15 Republic of Congo. Initially, government incentive to swiftly implement policy reforms
was motivated by the need to obtain credit resources to finance budget deficit. Afterwards, the
policy reforms were short-lived and government incentive was lost with a substantial increase in
budget revenues from oil based on revived oil production and higher world prices. Most reforms
were stalled after the initial policy push during 2001-2003, and went dormant after achieving the
HIPC decision point in January 2006.

2.16 By January 2010, when the Republic of Congo acceded to debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), most risks to development
outcome had been mitigated. Going forward, the risk of another discontinuation or reversal of
institutional reforms remains present and increases as government incentives to sustain difficult
reforms start to wane once the incentives of the recent HIPC debt relief disappear. Given the large
remaining reform agenda in the areas of improved governance, public (investment) resource
management, and financial stability, the risk to development outcome remains significant.

Bank Performance
2.17 Democratic Republic of Congo. Overall, this review rates Bank‘s performance in
securing quality at entry and supervision in DRC as moderately unsatisfactory for both credits.
The design of both credits was heavily tilted towards early disbursement based on front-loaded
and process-oriented actions and policies, visibly at odds with the long-term nature of
development objectives pursued by most reforms supported under the credits. Quality at entry
would have benefited from a stronger results framework and chain, and sensible monitoring and
evaluation arrangements. As regards to supervision, the Bank office in Kinshasa was newly
opened and staffing on the ground was thin. Bank team was effective in developing good rapport
with the government, despite difficult circumstances on the ground, but the frequency and
effectiveness of supervision were hampered by dependence on few Washington-based staff.

2.18 Republic of Congo. This review rates Bank‘s performance in securing quality at entry
and supervision in RoC as unsatisfactory for both credits. Design of reforms involved complex
political economy issues. A technical assistance (TA) project to support the reform program was
launched with a one-year delay. The supervision effort was not sufficient to meet the
implementation challenges posed by the ambitious reforms program in a country with depleted
administrative resources and weak technical capacity. The second operation failed to develop an
appropriate results framework, to build critical capacity and step-up dialogue and advocacy so as
to mitigate possible obstacles to reforms posed by vested interests. Staff turnover created a
discontinuity in the oversight of operations. The Bank was at times slow in responding to
government‘s requests, and supervision missions were exceptionally infrequent. At times, the
policy dialogue became uneasy or it was stuck over important reform issues, with little
innovative ideas for solving the problems.
                                                10


Borrower Performance
2.19 Democratic Republic of Congo. Overall, Borrower performance in implementing both
credits is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. DRC authorities were cooperative in early reforms
and took pride in macro-economic performance successes. However, with the move to more
complex and often politically sensitive actions, the performance started to weaken, the prime
reason being weak political ownership and engagement. The Ministry of Finance was the main
implementing agency responsible for the overall coordination along with the Central Bureau of
Coordination (BCECO). The broad scope of reform objectives required the active role of other
ministries and agencies. A high-level inter-ministerial committee (ECOFIN) was responsible for
monitoring and evaluation. However, due to inadequate monitoring and evaluation arrangements,
key implementation problems went un-noticed until it was too late to correct them.

2.20 Republic of Congo. Overall, borrower performance in implementing both credits is
rated as unsatisfactory. The government actively collaborated with the Bank team during credit
preparation and appraisal, made timely policy and institutional changes to meet all Board
presentation conditions and tranche release conditions. However, following the disbursement of
the credit, the government could not secure continued ownership and shepherd the
implementation of an ambitious reform agenda. There was a lack of clarity in defining
leadership for the reform program supported under the second ERC. The negotiating Minister
was dismissed immediately after the credit approval, and replaced by a successor who had to go
through a steep learning curve before assuming leadership in the implementation of the credit
reform agenda. The two ad-hoc committees entrusted with implementing multiple complex
reforms did not have sufficient professional capacity or political and institutional leverage to
carry out the complex reforms proposed under the credit. The appointment of a senior staff from
the Ministry of Finance to improve coordination and enhance the leverage of implementing
agencies came late (two years after credit approval) and did not produce the expected impact.

KEY FINDINGS AND LESSONS
Findings
2.21 The four operations were timely and effective in reestablishing access to
development assistance (by clearing past arrears to IDA and IBRD) and in securing critical
budget support to governments during the initial post-conflict years. The operations were
also effective in mobilizing and coordinating donor support, and enabling both countries to gain
full access to substantial debt relief benefits extended under the enhanced HIPC initiative.

2.22 The design of DPOs was overly complex and displayed less-than-full consistency
between objectives and measures supported. The four operations covered a wide range of
critical thematic areas. They restarted the pre-war reform efforts or initiated critical policy and
institutional changes in the areas of macroeconomic stabilization and growth, governance, public
sector reforms (in particular public financial management, civil service reform, and state-owned
enterprises), improved financial discipline, financial sector reform, private sector development,
and improved management of natural resources (in mining, forestry, and oil). In some cases, the
reform efforts were sustained over two or more operations in roughly the same form (indicated
with straight arrows in Table 1); in other cases the focus of reforms shifted from general towards
                                                              11


more specific sector issues (for example, from general issues of governance to specific issues of
transparency in the oil sector in RoC); finally, in quite a few cases (four policy areas in DRC and
six policy areas in RoC) entire policy areas were dropped after the first operation with little or no
justification, despite the fact that the objectives remained highly relevant and progress in
achieving them was negligible (indicated with stop signs in
Table 1).

2.23 There was a mismatch between the predominantly long-term structural and
institutional reform objectives pursued by the DPOs and the short-term nature of the
policy measures and actions undertaken in the context of the four credits. Faced with the
urgency to respond promptly to country post-conflict needs—in restoring relations with the
international financial institutions and the donors, and in securing the necessary external
financing for economic recovery—the credit designs were clearly skewed towards fast
disbursements based on front-loaded policies. Realizing that little could be done within a short
time span in the immediate post-conflict situation, Bank teams favored easy short-term measures,
process steps, adoption of programs and action plans, and the preparation of laws and decrees.
These actions were suitable to initiate reforms, but provided a poor overall match for the
predominantly long-term structural and institutional reform objectives pursued by the DPOs.
                                                          12


The number of policy actions and reforms peaked around project effectiveness and tranche
release dates, and then descended to a low holding pattern7 until revived under the next DPO or a
drive to meet HIPC decision or completion point requirements.

2.24 The results framework underlying the four post-conflict DPOs was weak and
ineffective. This was partly due to the lack of recent analytical and advisory work or a reliable
knowledge base of country-specific circumstances, and partly due to inadequate focus and
coverage of the results frameworks followed in the four operations. Instead of being simple,
realistic, selective, and balanced across key dimensions of post-conflict recovery, with wide
national ownership and sufficient donor buy-in, the results matrices in the four DPOs were
almost the exact opposite. The proposed set of objectives was too wide and comprehensive in
thematic coverage, especially in the initial operations. The objectives lacked clear priorities in
policy and reform implementation. The results framework was incomplete and weak in
providing an integrated view across all critical dimensions of post-conflict recovery (security,
political, economic, and social dimensions). It failed to provide evidence that the proposed
reform programs enjoyed broad national ownership among key political and social stakeholders,
and sufficient donor buy-in. The results matrices were uneven in some places, incomplete, overly
complex, and non-transparent in relating predominantly short-term policy actions to intermediate
and final outcomes. Going beyond narrow monitoring of implemented policy actions, the results
matrices did not provide a consistent framework to promote the design and use of intermediate
and final outcome indicators, and a basis for effective M&E arrangements.

2.25 In retrospect, while there were common areas of reforms between the DPOs and the
enhanced HIPC initiative agenda, coordination and synergy was not always warranted.
Common areas covered by the ―floating triggers‖ included the finalization of a full PRSP, macro
stability, alignment of public expenditure priorities with poverty alleviation, public finance or
expenditure management, governance, natural resource management, social and rural sectors, and
external debt management. Additionally, in the case of the RoC, the triggers included one aspect of
structural reforms (adoption of a new regulatory framework for telecommunications). One would
assume some synergy in implementing the DPO reforms and the HIPC decision and completion
point triggers. In reality, however, acceleration of policy reforms in the run-up to HIPC decision
and completion points have had both positive and unintended negative effects. In situations where
DPO-supported reforms were well-defined, coordinated, and sequenced with the forthcoming
HIPC events, we observed positive synergy both at the level of specific policy actions and related
reform areas. A good example of positive synergy through coordinated reform effort was the
introduction of improved fiduciary arrangements for HIPC-financed expenditures under the first
DPO in DRC. It resulted in early implementation (September 2002) and had a positive impact on
related policies in public finance management area.

2.26 In contrast, when DPOs supported ambitious and unclear objectives that were not
coordinated and sequenced with policy triggers contained in the future HIPC events, the gaps
created mixed incentives and led to delays in the implementation of important reforms. A good
example of ―negative synergy‖ is procurement reform supported under the first DPO in DRC. A
vaguely-defined objective and misplaced emphasis on administrative steps (―appoint
independent observers in the public procurement commission‖) compromised the opportunity to
7
    In some cases policies went completely dormant or even experienced a reversal.
                                                13


pass and start implementing new procurement law before the HIPC completion point. As a result,
procurement reforms were put on hold after the DPOs, and the new procurement law was passed
only in April 2010, just before the HIPC completion point (June 2010). The first implementation
report will be produced well after the HIPC resources had been released.

2.27 Given the significant overlap between policy areas covered under the four DPOs and the
respective HIPC programs, there was surprisingly little active coordination in dividing and
sequencing policy and reform actions related to long-term development objectives such as
governance, improved public sector, and natural resource management. The most notable synergy
was realized through corrective interventions supported under the HIPC completion point as the
―floating triggers‖ revived, and invigorated reforms missed and/or dropped under previous DPOs
or PRGF operations. Paradoxically, there were even cases where significant incentives offered
through enhanced HIPC initiative sent mixed signals to governments in DRC and RoC and
possibly diminished the reform effort supported under regular operations.

2.28 The failure to secure sustained policy and institutional support as well as technical
assistance was a major roadblock on the path towards improved governance and
management of natural resources. After almost a decade of attempts to improve governance,
transparency and efficiency in managing natural resource sectors, the results are negligible and,
more importantly, have not been sustained. Less than six months after passing the HIPC
completion point triggers and receiving the largest debt relief in history, DRC awarded resource
concessions in a non-transparent manner, indicating that it has yet to take a critical and
irreversible step in the direction of improved governance and transparent natural resource
management.

Lessons
2.29 The review of the implementation of four development policy operations in DRC and
RoC focused on recovery and rehabilitation in the immediate post-conflict period and led to the
distillation of a number of lessons as described below.

2.30 In a post-conflict environment, a DPO instrument supporting an overly heavy
reform program yields weak results. Deep reforms changing the patterns of governance and
public sector management require adequate preparation, including political economy assessment,
consensus building effort and wide political and social ownership. In the absence of such
thorough preparation, the likelihood of success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run
gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict environment, a DPO instrument can be
effective if the reform program is well calibrated to a context of weak technical capacity and
multiple priorities. In both countries, and for each operation, ownership of reforms was
permanently elusive, and was only assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt
relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments followed a pattern of temporary
commitment to reforms for immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and
ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the ambitious reform agenda in both
counties.

2.31 The absence of an up-to-date knowledge base and shared diagnostics handicaps the
design and efficacy of a Development Policy Operation. The design of the four DPOs was
                                                     14


based on partial, imperfect, and sometimes outdated information due to lack of recent economic
and sector work (ESW) and poor statistics. The knowledge gap was acute in practically all areas
of policy intervention. This adversely affected the design of policies, undermined capacity
building efforts, and severely constrained a meaningful choice of priorities and sequencing of
reform steps within and across operations. Some prior engagement in analytical and advisory
work, and perhaps even providing for selected diagnostic work under the credit(s), could have
helped: fill the knowledge gap; inform sector policies; build political consensus and social
ownership of reforms; enable improved service delivery; enhance the design of second round
operations; and increase the overall likelihood of achieving desired outcomes.

2.32 The principles of efficient operation and standard (or good) practice approach to
design and implement Bank operations cannot easily be “transposed? to post-conflict
environments. When squeezed by time (both in project preparation and ESW), staff are likely
to replicate the known program design solutions with minimal (often superficial) customization.
First round and to some extent second round operations in DRC and RoC suffered from this
drawback. The scope of proposed reforms was very similar to standard practice, despite the
evident differences on the ground in DRC and RoC. The gap was further exacerbated by the
inadequacy of the standard supervision effort relying on Washington-based staff and limited
presence in the field. Post-conflict situations demand strong management and senior technical
staff presence to build quality dialogue and support for reforms, and to nurture partnership across
a wide political and social spectrum.

2.33 Selectivity in the choice of objectives and simple project design are key to success in
post-conflict environments. The reform program supported by the four DPOs entailed a
comprehensive set of complex long-run reform objectives that could not possibly be achieved in
a difficult post-conflict environment over the fairly limited life of the projects with severely
constrained set of mostly short-term policy instruments. If a small subset of objectives that
ultimately recorded modest achievements had received undivided attention, the results could
have been much better moving the credit outcome into the satisfactory outcome range of the
rating scale. This is confirmed by two recent DPOs8 implemented during 2007-2010 in Liberia,
another fragile country. Satisfactory credit outcomes achieved in the context of the two credits
are strongly correlated, at least partially, to the simplicity of the operations and the specificity of
their objectives.

 The two Liberia credits are: (i) Re-engagement and Reform Support Program (P102915) approved on April 04,
2007 in an amount of $430 million and (ii) A Second Re-engagement and Reform Support Program approved on
May 21, 2009 in an amount of $4 million.

Objectives and Policy Areas
1.      The $450 million Economic Recovery Credit to DRC (DRC-ERC-I) was approved in
June 2002. It was designed with three tranches. The first tranche of $410 million was released
upon effectiveness and disbursed on July 3, 2002. Two floating sector tranches, one for mining
($25 million) and another for forestry ($15 million) were released as sector conditions were
satisfied in 2003.9 Of the first tranche, an amount of $330 million was used to settle the
outstanding bridge financing provided by the donors to clear DRC's arrears to the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD).

2.       Objectives. The DRC-ERC-I was the centerpiece of the Bank‘s Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board in July 2001. The overall objective of the Bank‘s re-
engagement strategy was to support the transition to peace and stability focusing on four areas:
(i) meeting basic and urgent needs; (ii) rebuilding effective public institutions and policies;
(iii) revitalizing economic activity; and (iv) rebuilding administrative and implementation
capacity. The TSS provided three modes of assistance: financial support, policy and technical
advice, and aid coordination.



9
 Due to SDR appreciation against the dollar, total disbursed amount was $481.10 million, released in three tranches
of $436.4 million for the core tranche, $16.5 million for the forestry sector tranche, and $28.2 million the mining
sector tranche.
ANNEX A                                    18


3.     The stated overall objective of the DRC-ERC-I was to help advance the TSS goals of
supporting economic stabilization and structural reforms as a basis for recovery within the
framework of the interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP). More specifically,
according to the President‘s Report (World Bank, 2001a, para. 46), the operation aimed to
support the government's efforts to pursue policy and structural reforms needed to:

          achieve and sustain macroeconomic stability;
          improve governance and reduce corruption with the objectives of fostering private
           sector development and increasing the supply of public services;
          improve public financial management, especially regarding public expenditures;
          continue the reform and restructuring of the public enterprise sector;
          begin the reform of the financial sector, especially the restructuring of commercial
           banks;
          support policy actions in the forestry sector in anticipation of implementation of new
           regulations; and
          provide support to urgent special actions within the mining sector that support
           prospects for fostering restructuring of the sector.

4.      This statement of objectives somewhat differs from the one contained in the policy
matrix attached to the Letter of Development Policy (World Bank 2001a, Annex 3). The policy
matrix takes a broader view of the macroeconomic and governance objectives to include the
relevant aspects of the ―public financial management‖ objective. More specifically, the
macroeconomic management objective includes macroeconomic stability as well as relevant
aspects of public revenue and public expenditure management. Likewise, the governance
objective also includes pertinent dimensions of public expenditure management.

5.      This review will follow the definition of objectives adopted by the President‘s Report to
ensure consistency in evaluating the ―relevance of objectives‖ and Bank performance in ensuring
―quality at entry.‖

6.      Policy Areas. Annex Table A1.3 provides a summary of policy actions envisioned under
DRC-ERC-I to ensure the achievement of credit objectives. The efficacy of proposed policy
actions and the status benchmarks proposed in the President‘s Report are discussed later under
achievement of objectives.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
7.      Relevance of Objectives. The seven objectives selected by the first DRC operation bear
only loose resemblance to the priority objectives set in the country and Bank strategic
documents. As indicated in Annex Table A1.4, the I-PRSP identifies three main pillars, and
17 sub-pillars. Only two DRC-ERC-I objectives are directly mapped into I-PRSP objectives
(governance and macroeconomic stabilization). The remaining five objectives loosely
correspond to two sub-pillars (i) B1 - Stabilize and rehabilitate macroeconomic environment and
(ii) B6 - Promote productive sectors and exports.

8.      As much as greater selectivity was desirable, the choice of objectives supported under the
DRC-ERC-I was not well aligned with the most urgent national priorities in the immediate post-
conflict period marked with continued hostilities and ample security risks. National strategy
documents (I-PRSP and PRSP) put great emphasis on achieving peace and security, the
restoration of the rule of law, care for the victims, and basic economic and social revival, and
bottom-up re-integration through community initiatives. The DRC-ERC-I operation was
completely oblivious of these urgent security and socio-economic stabilization needs of the time.

9.      Instead, DRC-ERC-I adopted an unrealistic technical approach to reforms and pushed for
a large institutional reform agenda with little consideration for: (i) the complexity and scope of
demands that the implementation of comprehensive reforms imparts even in completely stable
political and security environments; (ii) the political economy of reforms in natural resources
management, in reforming state owned enterprises (SOEs), financial sector, and public
administration; and (iii) technical, logistical, and institutional capacity constraints.

10.     Although the proposed reform agenda was relevant for DRC needs in the longer run,
within the relatively short timeframe of the first post-conflict development policy operation
(DPO), such ambitious approach lacked sufficient ownership and support in the government and
resulted in stop and go phases.

11.     On the basis of the above indicated-elements, this review rates the relevance of objectives
for the immediate needs of DRC as modest.

12.    Relevance of Design. The design of the Bank‘s intervention needed to be attuned to an
economy and institutions under tremendous cumulative stress, with all parties anxious to turn
around a disastrous domestic situation and seize the political opening created by the initial
Lusaka peace accord. The DRC-ERC-I was the centerpiece of the Bank‘s response under the
TSS approved in mid-2001.

13.     First and foremost, the project design had to overcome the challenge of clearing large
arrears to IDA and IBRD accumulated during the war years. Together with a coordinated
resolution of arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and African Development Bank
(AfDB), this was a necessary precondition to restore DRC‘s creditworthiness and enable
effective re-engagement of international financial institutions (IFIs.)

14.      The second design challenge was to come up with a set of immediate policy actions and
institutional reforms that would jump-start the process of change across a wide front including
macroeconomic stability, public finance, public enterprises, financial sector, and two key real
sectors (mining and forestry). Expectedly, the design produced a heavily front-loaded set of
interventions tilted towards short-term policies and nominal legal change in support of truly
long-term objectives.10 The broader political ownership of the proposed measures was not tested
beforehand and, as it soon turned out, the support proved to be weak in areas that affected vested
interests. This was obvious in natural resource and public financial management.

10
   The disbursement structure was also heavily front-loaded. The first tranche disbursed on effectiveness tranche
was over 90 percent of the credit, leaving little funding and limited leverage for the sector tranches and a long list of
broader medium-term policy sub-objectives.
                                                  23                                                 ANNEX A


15.     The third design challenge, to secure sufficient Bank‘s leverage in advancing reforms in
natural resource management, was addressed through two floating sector tranches for forestry
and mining. Unfortunately, both tranches were overly focused on the submission and passage of
relevant legislation, and less on implementation which proved to be a critical bottleneck.

16.    The credit fell short of addressing most important design challenges faced by DRC in the
immediate post-conflict years: need for continued policy and institutional support secured
through programmatic lending; proper timing and sequencing of short-term and medium-term
policy measures; effective capacity building within a well-defined realistic results framework
and proper monitoring arrangements (M&E). Instead, it was assumed that the scope and
continuity of institutional interventions would be secured through policy coordination and
synergy between DPOs and investment credits.11 In part, this was true during the
implementation of DRC-ERC-I and few years beyond when the first IMF Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) provided a unifying framework for key policies and structural reforms.
Unfortunately, that framework fell apart in late 2005 when the program was stopped.

17.     Overall, the design was inconsistent: it was dominated by heavily front-loaded short-term
measures addressing complex long-term institutional development issues. Furthermore, the chosen
actions put too much emphasis on laws and process steps largely inappropriate for DRC
circumstances at the time, due to weak implementation and enforcement capacity, and weak
regulatory environment. The design was also burdened with uneven tranche amounts and an
obvious sector policy bias in the design of triggers for the release of small mining and forestry
sector tranches. This eroded incentives for the implementation of general reforms and contradicted
the basic principles of general budget support behind development policy operations.

18.     In short, based on the heavy bias towards short-term process and legal actions, weak results
framework, with no explicit long-term outcome target/indicators or baseline data, and negligible
provisions for monitoring progress, this review rates the relevance of design as negligible.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
19.     Macroeconomic Stabilization. In the early 2000s, DRC economy was dilapidated by a
devastating civil war, years of mismanagement, financial, and economic isolation. With inflation
in excess of 500 percent annually, a free-falling exchange rate, dwindling international reserves
and fast growing arrears with bilateral donors and international financial organizations, DRC was
at the verge of collapse. After more than ten years of noncooperation, the country entered a staff
monitored program (SMP)12 with the IMF in June 2001. The objective of the SMP was to break


11
  DRC-ERC-I was complemented by two IDA omnibus investment projects planned under the TSS: an Emergency
Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project and a Private Sector Development and Competitiveness
Project. They facilitated important support for some DRC-ERC-I activities.
12
  A Staff Monitored Program (SMP) is an agreement between national authorities and IMF staff to monitor the
implementation of the authorities' economic and financial program during a specified period—normally 12–18
months. Such staff monitoring does not represent endorsement of the program by IMF Executive Board or involve
Fund financing.
ANNEX A                                      24


the hyperinflation, stabilize the economy, reverse the falling GDP, and lay down the foundation
for post-war reconstruction.

20.     Under IMF leadership, and with active Bank participation, the country adopted a set of
macroeconomic policies combining the liberalization of prices and the exchange rate (move to
floating regime) on the one hand, with restrained fiscal and monetary policy and restoration of
orderly budgetary procedures on the other. Within 12 months, the economy was turned around.
In July 2002, the SMP was replaced with a multi-year PRGF for the 2002-2005 period.

21.     Bank contribution in this area consisted in helping the country to reengage with the donor
community, which started by providing the country with resources to clear external arrears
towards IDA and IBRD. Contribution was continued through the provision of budget support
and technical assistance to enhance revenue collection and public expenditure management, and
to revive the private sector, and in particular in the key areas of mining and forestry.

22.    The initial results were remarkable. The average annual inflation was reduced from
357 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2002, and less than 13 percent in 2003. The GDP decline in
2001 (-2.1 percent) turned into positive economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2002 and 5.8 percent
in 2003. The current account deficit of more than $250 million in 2001 was reduced by
70 percent in 2002 and turned into a surplus in 2003. Capital outflows stopped and international
reserves reached 3 weeks of imports in 2003, up from 1 week in 2001.

23.     Even better economic growth (6.6 percent) and external performance (foreign exchange
reserves at 5.4 weeks of fast growing imports) were recorded during 2004. The country seemed
to be on a sustainable macro path, albeit some signs of softening monetary policy became visible
as the year-end inflation started to increase.

24.    In 2005, the situation gradually deteriorated. Unplanned surges in government spending,
mostly driven by security-related expenditures, were monetized and created inflationary pressures.
The PRGF program went off-track before the final sixth review was completed in December 2005.

25.     GDP growth at over 6 percent per annum was sustained through 2008, at the cost of
declining international reserves (down to $78 million or 1 week of imports at the end of 2008, and
further down to a historically low level of only $30 million in February 2009), growing government
fiscal deficit, and accelerating inflation. DRC was in a highly vulnerable situation when the global
financial crisis hit in September 2008. Within months, it became clear that the country would not be
able to sustain its external debt of more than $13 billion, equal to 93 percent of GDP, 150 percent of
exports and 500 percent of government revenue. With collapsing export prices and protracted low
export demand, DRC was headed for a massive debt distress situation with no solution in site. With
the IMF program off-track, the HIPC completion point was beyond reach.

26.      In summary, the achievement of macro-stability objective went through two phases. In
the initial phase, under the auspices of the IMF (SMP1 and PRGF1) and the Bank (DRC-ERC-I),
DRC managed to break the hyperinflation of the war years. The second phase was marked by
inadequate fiscal and monetary performance: exogenous fiscal shocks (caused by unpredictable
security related expenditures) were not met with adequate policy response which jeopardized
macroeconomic stability and credibility of the authorities. Overall, based on the uneven
                                                             25                                                       ANNEX A


performance of the country to establish a stable macroeconomic environment when the credit
was active and the immediate years thereafter, this review rates the achievement of the macro-
stability objective as modest.

27.      The third phase started with the second PRGF and is still ongoing, has a real chance of
succeeding if the massive international financial support gathered behind HIPC completion point
relief is met with greater ownership of reforms and consistent implementation of agreed policies
and structural reforms. At that critical point, a major package (centered around a second PRGF)
was put together by the IMF to remove DRC from debt distress situation, and satisfactory policy
and institutional (structural) reform performance allowed DRC to successfully reach the HIPC
completion point in June 2010. In addition, DRC received a new SDR allocation and signed a
huge deal with China, which included a $3.2 billion mining project with a consortium of
enterprises and a $3 billion public infrastructure project. The signing bonus alone was estimated
to be $250 million payable later in 2010.

28.     Governance and Anti-corruption Agenda. The stated objective was to improve
governance and reduce corruption to foster private sector development and increase supply of
public services.
ANNEX A                                     26


29.     DRC-ERC-I included a range of immediate steps aimed at supporting the governance and
anti-corruption agenda: (i) preparation and adoption of anti-corruption strategy; (ii) creation of
an anti-corruption commission; (iii) promulgation of a legal basis (an omnibus law on corrupt
practices) and creation of the necessary enforcement mechanisms; (iv) adoption and
implementation of a code of conduct for public officials; and (v) procurement overhaul.

30.    Despite notable efforts by the government and support from the international community,
the implementation and effects of these actions fell considerably short of expectations.

31.       The national anti-corruption strategy (NACS) was approved on time (November 2002),
but had significant design shortcomings since it failed to: (i) identify the underlying causes of
corruption; (ii) assess the prevailing legal and institutional framework; (iii) draw pertinent
lessons from previous (unsuccessful) attempts to fight corruption; (iv) prioritize and sequence
proposed actions and assign responsibilities; and (v) provide for adequate monitoring and
evaluation arrangements. Weak strategy design was followed by an even weaker
implementation. In short, the national anti-corruption strategy was not well designed, it had very
little (if any) political support, and it never got implemented.

32.     For a number of years, IDA and the international community avoided the issues of
governance and corruption in DRC. By 2007, the concerns with deteriorating quality of
governance and growing cases of corruption became so large that the international community
practically imposed a Governance Compact on the Government of Antoine Gizenga as a
condition for continued donor support and engagement in DRC. The Governance Compact put
emphasis on transparency (publication of extended information), enhanced control mechanisms
(mainly through watchdog institutions), priority processing of high-visibility cases, and
implementation of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles. Although the
compact was intended to revive and follow-up on the 2002 national anti-corruption strategy, this
was not the case since it did not have the key ingredients of a national strategy: definition of
objectives, assignment of responsibilities, and support of broad stakeholders.

33.     The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was created with a six-month delay, but became
operational after the legal basis was approved in July 2004. The commission faced many
operational challenges: it lacked experience, professional expertise and managerial skills,
limited financial resources, paid low salaries irregularly, and depended on (erratic) donor
support. Its deliberations were severely constrained and its low public image eroded by apparent
problems of nepotism, political influence, infighting, deep mistrust, and antagonism among the
ACC members. As a result, the ACC was not effective in implementing the NACS and the
relevant laws, as well as launching and supervising anti-corruption initiatives.

34.     The new anti-corruption law was an important step in the right direction, but its effects
on fighting corruption appear limited due to design problems, significant delays in approval and
effectiveness, and exceptionally weak enforcement.

35.     A new code of conduct for public officials was enacted on time (October 2002) and it
applied to all individuals holding public office or being paid by the state. The code was designed
to fight negative values and misconduct (corruption, misappropriation of public funds, misuse of
labor, favoritism, nepotism, and conflict of interest). It required all public officials to declare
                                            27                                           ANNEX A


assets and defined disciplinary measures for breaching the provisions of the code. In an
environment where ethical behavior was no longer the norm, implementing the code was a major
challenge. An independent oversight body, the Observatory of the Code of Ethics for Public
Officials (OECP) was created in October 2002 with full administrative and financial autonomy
to effectively oversee the implementation of the Code. This did not happen, because OECP‘s
operation was hampered by weak capacity, limited resources, and lack of political will.

36.     Procurement overhaul. Public procurement reform was one of the priorities identified in
the 2002 NACS as a means of reducing the scope for corruption. A public procurement reform
commission, the Commission de la Réforme des Marchés Publics (COREMAP) and a national
working group were jointly leading the reform of public procurement. Independent observers
were appointed to the commission and a new tender system was put in place to prevent the
widespread single-sourcing and the related corruption that it fueled. But the full implementation
of the new procurement system was stalled by the lack of trained staff and managers, weak
information systems (including the blacklisted and eligible firms), and the failure to establish
tender boards in the provinces. The Bank was absent both from the design and implementation
of the procurement overhaul effort in DRC and, apparently, followed a different approach in the
2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).

37.     Overall, aside from sporadic evidence on policy actions and temporary improvements in
some dimension of governance during the DRC-ERC-I operation (2002-2003), there were no
systematic progress indicators on the implementation of the national governance and
anticorruption strategy and the priority action plan. Multiple external sources, aggregated under
the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), show some improvement in the quality of
governance during the 2000-2008 period, but insufficient to conclude that the situation has
changed in a significant way (Annex Box A1.1).

38.     With low effectiveness of proposed policy actions and the Bank‘s early disengagement,
the achievement of the DRC-ERC-I operation in improving governance and reducing corruption
is rated as negligible.

39.     Public Sector Financial Management. The stated objective was to improve overall
public sector financial management, especially targeting improved management of public
expenditures through: (i) general public expenditure reviews; (ii) expenditure tracking and
monitoring surveys in the context of HIPC; and (iii) better public expenditure oversight. The
project document envisioned a single benchmark for this objective: Parliamentary approval of
the 2003 budget, including the allocation of recurrent and capital expenditures to key
development ministries and agencies, acceptable to IDA.

40.     A public expenditure review (PER) was conducted in 2002 as planned, but it remains
unclear to what extent its findings influenced the quality of the 2003 budget. Tracking of
poverty related expenditures was done jointly by IDA and IMF as a part of the 2002 PER
exercise. The results obtained on the basis of standard 15 HIPC tracking benchmarks were then
used to design HIPC completion point triggers.

41.     In parallel, strong efforts were made to establish satisfactory fiduciary arrangements for
HIPC-financed expenditures. Although HIPC funds are an integral part of the state budget, they
are intended to finance pro-poor spending. To ensure the intended use of HIPC resources, they
were defined on the basis of the central government‘s main functions, and flagged so that their
execution can be tracked and monitored in the expenditure circuit. An oversight committee set
up to monitor pro-poor spending has never become operational. Instead, special budget
execution reports are produced on expenditure financed from HIPC resources; an audit of HIPC
accounts has been conducted in 2007 and reported in the 2008 PER. Progress was much more
limited in the area of public expenditure oversight. The internal audit, done by The General
Inspectorate of Finance appears to be reduced to spot checks requested by the Ministry of
Finance, with virtually no audits of financial agencies or beneficiary institutions. Furthermore,
the findings of audit reports do not lead to any corrective action.

42.     The external audit of government accounts was conducted by the Audit Office which is
not truly independent as the Ministry of Finance controls its operational budget. The information
on budget execution was usually submitted after long delays, the audit findings and
recommendations were not made public, and there was no evidence if they have been
implemented. In the medium run, improved public sector financial management was further
constrained by the absence of a medium-term expenditure framework and the lack of integrated
fiscal and budget framework (under a single ministry of finance instead of the three ministries—
for finance, for budget, and for planning). Overall, based on some improvements in budget
management (streamlined processes, regular public expenditure reviews, better expenditure
tracking systems, better coordination with the central bank), this review rates the achievement in
the area of improved public sector financial management as modest.

43.     Public Enterprise Reforms (including privatization). The stated objective was to
continue the reform and restructuring of the public enterprise sector to increase its contribution to
growth and poverty reduction. Intermediate benchmarks included: (i) the establishment of a
public enterprise reform committee; (ii) the adoption of a reform strategy for the public
enterprise sector; and (iii) the promulgation of a new legal framework for public enterprises and
privatization.

44.     At the outset of reforms in DRC, the state was the largest economic agent with 51 purely
state-owned enterprises and about 44 mixed enterprises, covering all the sectors of the economy.
Expectedly, excessive state ownership, in combination with price controls and inadequate legal
system, created governance problems and gaps in the delivery of key social services. Therefore,
the underlying development objective supported under the operation was to ensure that public
enterprises deliver basic services on a sustainable and profitable basis and, thus, reduce fiscal
pressure caused by their losses. In the longer run, it was expected that the privatization of some
state-owned enterprises would attract foreign direct investment and generate exceptional fiscal
revenues, while the reformed public enterprise sector would improve the investment climate and
the overall business environment for the private sector.

45.     A public enterprise reform committee (COPIREP) was established in June 2002. The
committee showed good performance in advancing its core mandate, despite reported problems
with overstaffing and heavy organizational structure. Its effectiveness was adversely affected by
the lack of clear reform strategy and constantly changing reporting arrangements.
ANNEX A                                     30


46.     The concept of reform was based on the assumption that (by June 2002) special thematic
strategy groups would develop reform options for all state-owned enterprises in key sectors. In
addition, the government committed to facilitate the reform process by: (i) completing
operational audits for all principal public enterprises (by October 2002) and (ii) identifying
financial claims between state-owned enterprises and the government.

47.     The overall strategy and the decision algorithm for selecting SOEs to be restructured,
liquidated, or privatized were to be adopted by December 2002. In the absence of clear progress,
these issues temporarily disappeared from the Bank / IMF radar screen until the resumption of
structural reforms in 2008-2009 leading to HIPC completion point in 2010.

48.     The reform of the state enterprise sector, the need for sizeable privatizations, and the
emergence of a strong private sector required significant changes to the legal and regulatory
framework, and in the fiscal system. Revisions of the law governing state enterprise activities
and the approval of the new privatization law were both planned for October 2002. Due to weak
political will and a myriad of obstacles, the actual approval took place in July 2008. Other
related activities planned under the credit were also delayed, including reform of the tax system,
measures to eliminate payment arrears between SOEs and the government, as well as legal and
administrative procedures to promote small and medium-sized companies as a generator of new
employment and economic growth.

49.     Overall, progress in implementing state enterprise reform was hampered by the weak
political ownership. Equally important, attempts at reform were faced with a strong internal
opposition from the regulatory authority for state-owned enterprises: The Conseil Supérieur du
Portefeuille. Early efforts by the presidency to improve knowledge and build ownership of state
enterprise reform did not produce desired short term effect. The situation did not change in the
following years. Based on very limited progress in reforming the state enterprise sector this
review rates achievement as negligible.

50.      Financial Sector Reform. The stated objective was to begin the reform of the financial
sector that would ultimately help create an effective and sustainable modern financial system
capable of providing effective financial intermediation (mobilize savings, finance productive
investment, secure payments, and provide a range of financial services) throughout the country.
This was to be achieved by: (i) reforming the legal and regulatory framework for the banking
sector; (ii) restructuring the central bank and improving its management and operations; and
(iii) restructuring commercial banks and other financial institutions such as insurance companies,
microfinance, and specialized financial institutions.

51.     The starting point was very low. At the end of the war in 2001 the financial sector in
DRC was in complete disarray, from the very unstable macro-monetary environment to
deteriorating operating conditions faced by most commercial banks. Loss of confidence in the
banking system led to reduction of deposits (to less than 2 percent of broad money (M2) and,
consequently, a dramatic decline of banking activity (credit to the economy stood at less than
1 percent of GDP).

52.     Despite the low start, progress in reforming the financial sector was more substantial than
in other areas. This is partly owed to the fact that Bank actions were fully synchronized with
                                             31                                            ANNEX A


significant support the financial sector received from the IMF. This was particularly visible in
joint efforts to secure independence of the central bank and prune the banking system by
eliminating several non-viable banks and creating restructuring plans for vulnerable banks. In
2002, the parliament approved a new banking law and the revised central bank charter, which
assigned the responsibility for banking sector supervision to the central bank and reaffirmed its
independence in the conduct of the monetary and exchange rate policy. In parallel, a Global
Framework for Restructuring the Congolese Financial System prepared in March 2002 under the
auspices of the central bank, provided a coherent framework for deeper legal, regulatory, and
accounting reforms for all subsectors of the financial system including commercial banks, credit
unions, microfinance, insurance, and specialized financial institutions.

53.     To improve the quality of data reporting and better manage financial sector risks, the new
legislation called for regular audits of the central bank and key commercial banks. More recent
financial sector studies (IMF 2007b) indicate that substantial improvements have taken place in
the 2001-2006 period. By the end of 2006 only 11 large commercial banks were in operation.
The state had minority shares in two large banks and nine were 100 percent foreign owned. The
level of concentration was moderate and declining: the largest bank had 25 percent share of the
market in 2006 versus 33 percent share in 2005. Although the banking sector strongly dominates
the financial market (75 percent), it is relatively small compared to GDP, country area, and
population: at the end of 2006, banking sector assets barely exceeded 10 percent of GDP; with
60 branches covering an area equal to Western Europe and only 100,000 bank accounts serving
about 60 million people, DRC had one of the lowest bank penetration rates in the world.

54.     The trust in the banking system has improved over the years: despite many difficulties,
private deposits increased from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2001 to 6.1 percent in 2006, but the brunt
of the growing credit potential still does not reach the private sector to finance new jobs and
economic growth. The share of private sector credit in GDP was 2.8 percent at the end of 2006.
This vividly confirms the continued existence of lending barriers (mostly caused by unreliable
enterprise data), difficulties in managing foreign exchange risks (caused by large extent of
dollarization), lack of financial discipline, and imperfections in protecting creditor rights.

55.     The commercial bank restructuring plan, key policy action envisaged under the DRC-
ERC-I operation, has been approved and largely implemented. As a result, the banking sector
became more stable and liquid. Both the soundness and performance improved over time: the
share of non-performing loans has been low and declining, and profitability has been increasing
in recent years (both in returns to assets and to equity). But many risks still remain high. For the
most part, these are liquidity risks from unpredictable macroeconomic situation, foreign
exchange risks due to large extent of dollarization, and credit risks stemming from lending
concentration on few enterprises. By contrast, interest rate risks appear to be small.

56.     Going forward, binding constraints and key risks faced by the banking sector are more
related to the regulatory performance of the central bank and the quality of the business
environment, than the portfolio or performance of commercial banks per se. On the central bank
side, key improvements could come from better oversight function, full alignment of prudential
regulation and supervision with international standards, transparent enforcement of bank
licensing and closing procedures, and the introduction of modern payment systems. On the
ANNEX A                                              32


business environment side, key improvements could come from better information on
creditworthiness through public registries or private credit bureaus.13

57.    Overall, based on policies initiated under DRC-ERC-I operation and related IMF
programs, as well as follow-on policies revived within the framework of ensuing HIPC
completion point, this review rates the achievements in restructuring the banking sector and
reforming the financial sector as modest.

58.     Mining Sector Reform. The stated objective was to provide support to urgent special
actions within the mining sector that support prospects for fostering its restructuring. The
operation had two prior actions which were met before submitting the credit documents to the
Board: (i) submission of the new mining code by the president to the national assembly and
(ii) maintaining the existing moratorium on signing any new investment agreements that are
incompatible with the provisions of the new mining code.

59.     In addition, the credit envisaged four conditions to be met before the release of the floating
tranche. The first required Gecamines14 to adopt a program of mutually-agreed voluntary separation
with its labor unions. The remaining three called for the establishment (by decree) of:
      i. a permanent Gecamines restructuring unit at the presidency level responsible for strategy,
         asset management, and oversight of the program for mutually-agreed voluntary separations;
     ii. an autonomous mining registry (cadastre); and
     iii. a commission for the validation of mining titles.

60.   The credit document proposed a set of progress indicators for the implementation of the
new mining cadastre15 and the restructuring of Gecamines.16
61.     Most agreed actions were done on time: the new mining code was adopted by parliament in
June 2002; the commission for validation of mining titles was established by decree in March 2003,
but became operational after the credit closing date in June 2003; the mining registry was
established by decree in April 2003; Gecamines issued a letter on voluntary separation program in
April 2003; a permanent Gecamines restructuring committee was established by decree in March
2003; the restructuring of the mining cadastre is an ongoing activity and the standard of service
could not be confirmed during field interviews in February 2009; strategic audit of Gecamines was

   In recent Doing Business reports, DRC scored very low on the availability and quality of information to assess
creditworthiness of individuals and companies. Information provided by the Centrale des Risques is limited and
unreliable, standards for accounting and auditing practices are poor, collateral and property registries are not
generally available, contracts are difficult to enforce.

  Completion of the restructuring of the mining cadastre, with validation of at least 90 percent of the existing
permits.
16
  These included: (i) completion of a Gecamines restructuring study; (ii) independent audit of severance payment
calculations for Gecamines workers; and (iii) the adoption of a program to scale down Gecamines' work force to
economically justifiable level by 2004, including social protection benefits to laid off workers (such as severance
payments, unpaid wages, and other benefits).

completed in March 2003 by an independent consulting firm (IMC) and approved by the
government in June 2003; and a Gecamines restructuring program was prepared in September 2003.

62.     Despite initial successes with the agreed policy actions, follow-up implementation efforts
were slow and the performance of the mining sector improved less than expected. As shown in
Annex Table A1.6 below, between 2001 and 2008 value added in the mining sector grew on
average by 9.5 percent, which is significantly above the average GDP growth rate in that period
(6.0 percent), but much less than needed to restore the pre-war size and scope of the mining sector.

63.    Overall, mining sector reforms supported under the DRC-ERC-I operation helped revive
some of the growth potential, but fell significantly short of restoring its pre-war potential in
production and exports. Based on the above evidence, this review rates project achievement in
reforming the mining sector as modest.

64.     Forestry Sector Reform. The stated project objective was to support policy actions in
the forestry sector in anticipation of implementation of new regulations. The reforming approach
to the forestry sector was focused on legal reform, improved governance, and modernization.
The longer-run development objective was to rehabilitate the sector in a sustainable, transparent,
and inclusive manner by creating a new legal and regulatory framework, ensuring full
compliance with the new laws, ensuring greater transparency, and improved governance in
managing the forest resources, including increased participation of local communities in the
management of forest resources and incomes.

65.     The starting point in the forestry sector was more difficult than in mining: the sector was
more fragmented, had less sophisticated management structure, and inherited a heavy legacy
from the war period when weak institutions permitted creation of many non-transparent new
logging concessions. To rehabilitate the sector, a new legal framework had to be accompanied
with a freeze on new concessions until a thorough clean up of the worst abuses from the past had
been completed.

66.     Policy actions supported by the project closely followed this logic. The purpose of the
single condition for the release of the forestry tranche17 was to accelerate the preparation of the
new modern legal framework for the forestry sector. This was followed by three benchmarks
with appropriate progress indicators to:

17
     Submission of a new Forestry Code (satisfactory to IDA) to parliament for approval.
ANNEX A                                     34


          Adopt a new forestry code, with continued moratorium on transformation of
           historically-filed claims under the old code into exploitation rights;
          Complete a legal review of all existing forestry contracts (original, extended,
           renewed) for conformity with contractual terms and new regulations; and
          Annul (by ministerial decree) all forestry contracts not in conformity with contractual
           terms and new regulations.

67.    All conditions were met in full and mainly on time. A new modern Forestry Code was
promulgated in August 2002. DRC completed a review of forestry (logging) contracts covering
45 million hectares out of 60 million hectares. The review resulted in the annulment of
163 contracts and the return to the state of about 25 million hectares of forestry land. A
moratorium on new contracts was issued in 2002 until full compliance with the new Forestry
Code could be assured. New rules for issuing logging contracts were published in October 2005.

68.     The implementation of the new legislation proceeded with mixed success after the release
of the forestry tranche. While actions to terminate past illegitimate concessions went on as
planned, the enforcement of the moratorium on new contracts was less successful due to strong
political ‗interference‘ at a local level. In addition, aspects of equity and community
participation in the use of forest resources were not dealt with in the DRC-ERC-I operation,
which may have contributed to circumstances reviewed in the 2006 Inspection Panel report
focused on the Bank‘s role in protecting the rights of Pygmies as Indigenous Peoples.

69.     Overall, the reforms in the forestry sector started under the DRC-ERC-I operation had the
right scope and intent, but modest achievements.

Ratings
OUTCOME

70.     DRC-ERC-I somewhat over-reached itself both in terms of breadth and depth of reform
objectives set for a 12-month implementation timeframe. The relevance of the objectives was
modest and the relevance of the design was negligible. Out of seven objectives supported under
the credit, the efficacy in achieving results was modest in five of them (macro-stability, public
financial management (PFM), financial sector reform, mining, and forestry), and negligible
progress was recorded in two (governance and state-owned enterprise reform). The main reason
for relatively poor performance was an overly ambitious reform agenda for the limited
implementation capacity and relatively weak ownership of reforms, exacerbated by a mismatch
between front-loaded short-term measures used to pursue long-term development goals. On that
basis, this review rates the project outcome as unsatisfactory.

71.     Going beyond limited success in implementing the proposed policy and institutional
reform agenda, the DRC-ERC-I operation made a positive contribution to economic and political
stabilization of DRC and demonstrated the necessity of long-run institutional reforms.
                                            35                                           ANNEX A


RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

72.     Going forward, the main risks to development outcomes will continue to come from
weak ownership of reforms and possible reform reversals under political and social pressures,
especially if the country fails to complete institutional reforms and embark on a sustainable
growth path based on efficient use of its ample natural resources (in mining and forestry). The
fast approach adopted in implementing HIPC completion point triggers casts doubts about the
genuine ownership of reforms and sustainability of policy changes recently implemented to
comply with the PRGF and HIPC requirements.

73.    Overall, given the pressures and incentives to reach the HIPC completion point, this
review rates the risk to development outcome as significant.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

74.     Design. The President‘s Report briefly discusses monitoring and evaluation arrangements
in the section ―Credit Implementation, Monitoring and Disbursement Arrangements? (page 30).
It specifies that IDA and the IMF will monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic framework,
while a special inter-ministerial technical committee will be responsible for monitoring specific
policy indicators related to the program and regularly inform the responsible ministry and IDA.
Although the report did not provide further details on the content of monitoring and other aspects
of M&E design, it stated that monitoring was expected to follow the relevant matrices on
program benchmarks (page 32) and the government‘s comprehensive policy matrix (Annex 3),
since the monitoring information was to be used by the government and IDA to ensure continued
program implementation.

75.     Implementation. The limited evidence on the implementation of the M&E arrangements
indicates that collected information pertained mostly to administrative, legal, and qualitative
information on the status of policy actions supported under the credit, and it was not used during
project implementation.

76.     Utilization of M&E Data. In all, the results of M&E effort played almost no role in the
project implementation.

77.    Based on the above elements, this PPAR rates the quality of monitoring and evaluation as
negligible.

Bank Performance
78.    Quality at Entry. The Bank promptly reacted to the narrow window of opportunity
created by the transition government following the initial peace agreement and developed this
operation under a very tight timeframe. This generated a truly exceptional level of enthusiasm,
commitment, and engagement of Bank staff and management to seek a bold start of a clean long-
term development agenda. In doing that, the Bank team overestimated DRC political readiness
and professional capacity to respond. Capacity building efforts launched within the project and in
a separate technical assistance (TA) activity could not quickly restore the necessary
administrative and reform implementation skills. The true absorptive capacity of a country that
ANNEX A                                              36


just exited one of the bloodiest regional wars in history, and continued to operate under security
risks and widespread social and economic pressures was much more limited than originally
estimated. The war had destroyed not only the physical and social infrastructure, but the value
system and the very fabric of the society. The full reform agenda advocated by this operation
was too complex and too ambitious to implement in a short time for a country whose governance
and economy had to be rebuilt almost from scratch.

79.     Critical aspects of dialogue and consensus-building effort before the operation were fairly
limited and did not address the problems of weak ownership of difficult reforms. Furthermore,
the proposed project design was heavily tilted towards early disbursement based on front-loaded
short-term process oriented actions and policies. This was at odds with the long-term nature of
the development objectives pursued by most reforms supported under the DRC-ERC-I operation.

80.    Project design would have been more relevant if it had provided continuous incentives
and a better match between proposed actions (policies) and objectives. One way of doing that
could have been accomplished by: (i) separating earmarked resources18 from policy-based
tranches; (ii) more even sizing and spacing of policy-based tranches; (iii) better matching the
time-horizon of proposed actions and policies with the nature of the development objectives
pursued; and (iv) finding the right balance between process-oriented legal actions and results-
oriented implementation actions.

81.     Finally, quality at entry would have benefited from a stronger results framework,
completely missing from the President‘s Report. A fuller results chain would have helped
achieve greater selectivity of objectives and improved sequencing of reforms, better design of
policy and reform actions, and sensible monitoring and evaluation arrangements.

82.     Overall, this review rates Bank‘s performance in securing quality at entry as moderately
unsatisfactory.

83.     Quality of Supervision. The Bank experienced problems in supervising the credit
implementation: (i) the Bank office in Kinshasa was newly opened and (ii) the team was under
pressure to deliver. Staffing on the ground was thin and the team depended on a few
Washington-based staff. The Bank had a very good collaboration with the Fund team on
macroeconomic issues, and a core group of bilateral donors and UN agencies in their areas of
specialization.

84.     During credit preparation and implementation, the main risks to development outcome
were associated with weak ownership of reforms and possible policy reversals. These risks
increased with the complexity of reforms and lack of preparation. Unfortunately, the limited time
available for project preparation and the dire situation on the ground after the war did not allow
for proper stakeholder engagement, consensus-building activities, or political economy analysis
prior to Board approval. Continuous policy dialogue with the government was the only viable
venue left to monitor and manage the evolving risks related to political ownership of reforms and
possible policy reversals.

85.     As it turned out, both risks identified earlier materialized under deteriorating security and
political situation and eroding incentives caused by declining availability of resources. At the
same time, the quality of policy dialogue declined as the PRGF program went off-track in 2006.
The situation improved markedly in mid-2009 as the country resumed the majority of reforms
started under DRC-ERC-I as part of an effort to meet the triggers for the completion point under
the enhanced HIPC initiative achieved in mid-2010. Consequently, the main risks to
development outcomes in the important areas of macroeconomic stability, improved governance,
PFM, financial sector reform, and SOE reform were at least temporarily mitigated.

86.     Bank relationship with the government was very positive based on the quality of dialogue
established at the highest level of government when President Kabila visited Washington within
days of his appointment. Accordingly, close relations and frequent interactions existed at the
level of core ministries including the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of the Budget.

87.     At the technical level, the frequency and effectiveness of supervision was hampered by
weak or non-existent monitoring and evaluation arrangements and dependence on Washington-
based staff. Within those constraints, the Bank team made a genuine effort to oversee the
implementation of an ambitious reform agenda under very difficult circumstances on the ground,
to flag problems as they became visible, and to attempt corrective actions when feasible.

88.     Based on the above evidence Bank performance in securing quality of supervision is
rated as moderately satisfactory. Overall, Bank performance in delivering credit to the client is
rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

89.     Government Performance. At the start of the DRC-ERC-I operation the country has
just emerged from a long and very debilitating civil war. The president, senior policy-makers,
and leading bureaucrats in the government were anxious to re-engage with the Bank and other
IFIs. They were very cooperative and eager to embrace and implement the complex policy
agenda supported by this operation. It should be noted that the reform agenda was perceived as a
set of policies they received, rather than policies they had actively shaped.

90.      As DRC-ERC-I moved to implementation, it became clear that a decade of war had
depleted the well of human capital and eroded many social values. As reforms deepened,
proposed actions were met with resistance, opposition, and outright obstruction as well as
technical and administrative problems caused by the lack of knowledge and weak capacity.
Initially, abundant confidence at higher political levels (ministers and vice-presidents) was
sufficient to remove these obstacles and move forward. With the passage of time, these
beneficial interventions gradually disappeared. More mundane political interventions took
center stage, often catering to populist expectations opposed to reforms.

91.      Faced with growing populist pressures and opposition from vested interest groups, the
initial enthusiasm and ownership of difficult reforms started to wane. As tangible incentives
associated with the implementation of reforms also diminished, government support declined
below the critical level leading to serious reform delays, stalled implementation of laws and
ANNEX A                                       38


policies, and even to some policy reversals. In short, government performance went from full
support to reform agenda supported by the credit (satisfactory) to a loss of political ownership
motivated by populist expectations (unsatisfactory). On average, this review rates government
performance as moderately unsatisfactory.

92.     Implementing Agency Performance. The Ministry of Finance was the main
implementing agency responsible for the overall coordination, along with the Central Bureau of
Coordination (BCECO). The broad scope of reform objectives required the active role of other
ministries and agencies. The Ministry of Environment was responsible for mining and forestry.
The high-level inter-ministerial committee (ECOFIN) was responsible for monitoring and
evaluation. The Central Bank led banking sector reforms. A special unit in the president‘s office
was responsible for restructuring Gecamines. A special Steering Committee led the reform of
state-owned enterprises. The governance policy area was coordinated by the Anticorruption
Commission, The Inspection Générale des Finances and the Cour des Comptes, and the Public
Procurement Commission. Coordination between various ministries and agencies was good in all
aspects of project implementation. However, due to inadequate monitoring and evaluation
arrangements, key implementation problems caused by deteriorating political ownership of
difficult reforms went un-noticed until it was too late to take corrective action. On that basis, this
review rates implementing agency performance as moderately unsatisfactory. Overall, the
Borrower performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

Objectives and Policy Areas
1.      Objectives. The overall objective of the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit
(DRC-ERC-II) was to provide critical financing necessary to advance structural reforms and
improve transparency and the quality of governance. More specifically, the objectives of the
credit were pursued in five main policy areas:19 (i) national program implementation,
(ii) macroeconomic policy framework, (iii) civil service reform, (iv) domestic debt, and
(v) management of public utilities (water and power). The progress to achieve objectives in the
above areas is summarized in Annex Table A2.3 below.

2.     Policy Areas. The DRC-ERC-II credit was approved in February 2004 (jointly with a
new transitional support strategy). The credit amount of $200 million was released in four
tranches. The first general tranche ($85 million) was disbursed upon effectiveness in May 2004.
Three floating tranches, related to civil service retirement plan ($47.5 million), settlement of
domestic debt arrears ($42.5 million), and payment of utilities by the government ($25 million),
could be released in any order upon meeting the required triggers.


19
   Definition of credit objectives in the Program Document and the Credit Agreement was not fully consistent. The
Program Document identified three objectives on page 14 as follows: (i) supporting the continued implementation of
economic reforms, (ii) supporting civil service reform, and (iii) addressing the domestic debt issue. The Credit
Agreement identified five specific objectives on pages 15 and 16 as follows: (i) progress in carrying out the national
program, (ii) maintain a macroeconomic policy framework, (iii),civil service reform, (iv) domestic debt, and (v)
management of public utilities (water and power). This PPAR has limited its assessment to the five objectives
spelled out in the credit agreement, because they were more specific.
ANNEX A                                                  40


3.       The policy areas supported by the credit mirrored both the credit objectives, and the
conditionalities to be fulfilled for the release of the credit tranches. First, in order to create an
environment conducive to reforms, the credit required the maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic framework and an adequate implementation of the national development
program, and these were the main policy areas underpinning the credit design. Second, the three
other policy areas were those in which benchmarks have to be fulfilled before the release of the
credit floating tranches: (i) civil service retirement plan, (ii) settlement of domestic debt arrears,
and (iii) payment of utilities by the government.

4.      The alignment between the credit objectives and the government policy priority areas is
presented in the table below, together with the progress achieved at credit closure, and at the time
of this PPAR.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
5.     Relevance of Objectives. The three pillars (continuing economic and structural reforms,
launching civil service reform, and improving financial discipline) were broadly aligned with the
Bank‘s transitional support strategy, the 2002 interim PRSP objectives, (detailed in Annex Table
A2.3) and the expected objectives of the future full PRSP then under preparation. The relevance
was even stronger at the level of the five specific objectives: (i) medium-term development
program; (ii) macroeconomic stability; (iii) civil service reform through staff retirement
program; (iv) settlement of domestic debt arrears; and (v) regular payments of utilities (water,
power).

6.     Four years after the end of the civil war, DRC needed a medium-term development
program with comprehensive diagnostics, clearly stated-strategy, priorities, and sequencing of
important institutional and policy reforms leading to greater scope for private sector-based
growth and efficient utilization of ample natural resources.

7.      At a more specific level, DRC needed a strong signal that the government was willing to
implement reforms and play a responsible role in modernizing the civil service, delivering
sustained macroeconomic stability, observing full financial discipline (in payment of government
debts and utility bills), and securing a more efficient management of public expenditures.

8.     With the exception of a newly-launched civil service reform effort, most objectives
represented a continuation of some aspects of the reforms already started under the DRC-ERC-I
                                             43                                            ANNEX A


operation. It should be noted, however, that the second operation was both more focused and
specific in the choice of targets and consequently more selective as it omitted four prominent
reform areas: governance, reform of state-owned enterprises, mining, and forestry.

9.       The five reform objectives supported under DRC-ERC-II remain relevant to this date.
First, due to delayed approval and slow implementation in the initial years, the timeframe of the
2006-2008 PRSP was extended till the end of 2010 and the preparation of a medium-term
development program very much remains a relevant objective. Second, macroeconomic stability
was an elusive target during much of the 2005-2009 period. DRC began to regain a grip on
internal and external stability only in the past 12 months with the help of an IMF program and a
renewed policy effort within the HIPC completion point drive. The real challenge to sustaining
macro-stability will come after the beneficial impact of debt relief wears out and the country has
to face new (internal or external) shocks. Third, civil service reform was only started with the
staff retirement program supported under DRC-ERC-II, and it will remain a relevant reform
objective in the medium run. Fourth, the problem of past domestic debt arrears may become
obsolete after successful settlement exercises, but prevention of future arrears will continue to be
a relevant objective. Finally, orderly payment of utilities is likely to continue to be a relevant
reform objective until proper metering systems and market pricing of utilities is fully in place.

10.    Overall, the relevance of objectives supported under DRC-ERC-II is rated as substantial.

11.     Relevance of Design. The design of DRC-ERC-II was uneven across the five objectives,
both in terms of tranche release conditions and in terms of the nature of policy actions supported
under the credit. In the case of domestic debt, there was a good balance between the statement of
credit objectives, the definition of implementation steps, and appropriate benchmarks, as well as
tranche release conditions, which jointly captured the essential steps towards achieving the
objective. In other cases, like payment of utilities or civil service reform, too much emphasis was
put on laws and process steps, preparation of action plans, strategies, and the like, instead of
implementation of policies and actions leading to achieving results. This design weakness is
particularly inappropriate in DRC post-conflict circumstances dominated by inadequate
implementation and enforcement capacity and weak regulations.

12.    Another peculiar design feature of the project was the unofficial earmarking and ring-
fencing of DRC-ERC-II proceeds under specific floating tranches to particular uses (for
example, for funding the staff retirement program). This approach was inconsistent with the
general budget support nature of the DPOs.

13.     The project had a very simplified results matrix with, in most cases, a weak or non-
existent results chain. The design made negligible provisions for monitoring and evaluation
arrangements. Despite very detailed listings of objectives, sub-objectives, and specific actions
provided in the policy matrix attached to the program document, there were very few quantified
targets and associated baseline values that could be monitored based upon accessible indicators,
rather intermediate process-type outputs.

14.    Overall, the relevance of design is rated as modest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
15.     As already indicated, the first pillar (continuation of economic and structural reforms)
had three specific objectives which will be separately evaluated and rated: (i) medium-term
development program; (ii) macroeconomic stability; and (iii) public expenditure management
reform.

16.     Medium-term Development Program. The objective was to secure continued
implementation of economic reforms through a well-structured comprehensive medium-term
development program that would help the country prioritize and sequence institutional and
policy reforms, meet HIPC completion point triggers, and ensure long-run pro-poor private-
sector based growth in line with its abundant resource endowment. This was to be achieved
through a timely evolution of the present development program towards a full PRSP (Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy [PRGS]) planned for mid-2005, leading to a HIPC completion
point expected in the third quarter of 2007.

17.     The only benchmark (and the general $85 million tranche release condition upon credit
effectiveness) was formulated as satisfactory progress in carrying out of the program.

18.    The program (detailed in the DRC-2004 Policy Matrix attached to this report as Annex
Table D1.2) had very comprehensive coverage with nine essential reform objectives:

          Alleviating poverty through a range of policies to be developed within the
           forthcoming PRSP;
          Consolidating and maintaining peace (through disarmament, demobilization and
           reintegration of ex-combatants) and improving governance (institutional reforms and
           fight against corruption);
          Reforming financial sector and improving financial intermediation through
           restructuring and rehabilitation of banks, and better policy and regulatory framework;
          Enabling private sector development that would be the engine of future economic
           growth and job creation;
          Advancing public enterprise reform to improve its management and ensure reliable
           provision of services on a commercial basis, private sector involvement (through
           partnerships, concessions, and sale of shares);
          Improving natural resource management (in both forestry and mining) to secure
           their transparent management; efficient and environmentally sustainable contribution
           to post-conflict recovery and future economic growth; rural development and poverty
           reduction while preserving the integrity of the ecosystems and the environment over
           the long term;
          Enhancing the performance of social sectors through development and
           implementation of sector strategies and studies aligned with HIPC triggers and the
           necessary rehabilitation of infrastructure in health, education, and social sectors;
          Supporting agriculture and rural development to improve food security of rural
           populations in the short-run and develop a long-term rural development strategy
           geared to achieving sustained growth in agricultural production and incomes; and
                                             45                                            ANNEX A


          Rehabilitate infrastructure at the national level and modernize the legal and
           regulatory framework for the operation of key infrastructure sectors (energy and
           water).

19.    Unfortunately, the program was too comprehensive and overly ambitious given limited
available resources and severe capacity constraints. In most areas, progress was negligible.
Preparation of a full-fledged PRSP (PRGS) with stronger selectivity and prioritization of actions
was delayed till mid-2006, and the discussion at the Bank‘s Board took place only in September
2007, more than half way through the initial coverage period (2006-2008).

20.     The new government confirmed its commitment to the PRGS medium-term framework
and prepared a Policy Action Plan to guide and accelerate implementation in the remaining
period (July 2007-December 2008). Despite these efforts, it was clear that stated PRGS
objectives could not be met within the initially set timeframe given the weak alignment between
budgetary resources and medium-term priorities, and low efficiency of government
interventions. On that basis, and in the context of accelerated efforts to meet the HIPC
completion point triggers by the mid-2010 deadline, the authorities decided to keep the existing
set of objectives and extend the implementation horizon until the end of 2010.

21.    Overall, given that progress in shaping and consistently implementing a well-structured
and prioritized medium-term development strategy has been fairly limited, this review rates the
achievement in this area as negligible.

22.    Macroeconomic Stability. The operation followed a standard (mostly implicit) objective
of consolidating and maintaining macroeconomic stability as a conducive environment for
economic revival, continuation of institutional reforms, and resumption of long-run growth. The
only benchmark (a $85 million general tranche release condition) was a very broad requirement
of maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework.

23.     Specific macroeconomic targets set at the time of project preparation were to:
(i) accelerate economic growth to 6 percent in 2004 and 7 percent in 2005; (ii) contain inflation
at 6 percent in 2004 and 5 percent in 2005; (iii) allow a current account deficit of 4.1 percent of
GDP in 2004 to be financed by a large increase in external assistance; (iv) increase government
revenues to 9 percent of GDP in 2004; and (v) reorient public expenditures towards poverty
reduction.

24.      During 2004-05, economic growth was relatively strong (6-7 percent per annum),
inflation was down, public revenues were increasing and external position was well within
financing possibilities. In 2005, the macro situation started to deteriorate. Surges in
expenditures caused by a combination of politically-driven pre-election drives and unplanned
military spending in response to a flare-up of regional fighting created larger budget deficits. As
a rule, these deficits got financed by the central bank (monetized), leading to a sharp increase in
inflation. In the fixed-exchange rate regime of the time, this caused appreciation of the currency
and depletion of foreign exchange reserves.

25.     There was little progress in improving government revenues either in terms of increasing
the share in GDP or tapping the large natural resource base in mining and forestry. Reorientation
ANNEX A                                      46


of public expenditures was also slower than expected caused by pre-emptive increases in
security-related expenditures and inefficient process of aligning budget expenditures with social
sector expenditures and other priorities of the government.

26.     After a successful attempt at correcting fiscal slippages in early 2005, budgetary
discipline slackened again in the second half of the year causing a consolidated fiscal deficit to
reach 8 percent of GDP (against a 2 percent deficit target under the PRGF). This caused a surge
in inflation to 21.3 percent at the year end. IMF let the PRGF expire in March 2006 without
completing the sixth and last review, due to fiscal slippages and related inflationary pressures, as
well as delays in implementing structural reforms.

27.     In April 2006, IMF presence was down-graded to staff monitored programs. The ensuing
macro policies were mixed. On balance, the macroeconomic situation gradually deteriorated
during 2006-2007 and reached alarming lows in early 2008, when foreign exchange reserves
declined to one week of imports, inflation accelerated to over 50 percent per annum, budget
deficits became unsustainable, and the country approached a point of external debt distress. A
major change in the macroeconomic situation took place in the past 12 months, after significant
improvements in performance under the second SMP and the current Extended Credit Facility
(ECF - similar to PRGF).

28.     In short, as already indicated under DRC-ERC-I, the achievement of macro-stability
objective went through three phases. In the initial phase, until the HIPC decision point, DRC
managed to break the hyperinflationary tendencies started during the war years. The second
phase was marked by mixed macroeconomic performance due to inadequate fiscal and monetary
performance, which led to steady deterioration of both external and internal position. The third
and still ongoing phase started with the second PRGF (ECF) in mid-2009 and enjoyed a massive
international financial support gathered behind HIPC completion point. It will be successful if
the relief assistance is met with greater ownership of reforms and consistent implementation of
agreed policies and structural reforms.

29.     Overall, just like DRC-ERC-I, this review rates the achievement of the macro-stability
objective as modest.

30.      Civil Service Reform. The stated objective was to assist the government in financing the
retirement package for workers who had reached retirement age. The operation identified one
complex benchmark which also served as a release condition for the $47.5 million floating
tranche of the civil service retirement plan. It specified four elements of a retirement action plan:
(i) the retirement process; (ii) definition of target groups, explanation of benefits, and eligibility
dates; (iii) identification of beneficiaries, disbursement procedures, and control mechanisms; and
(iv) disclosure policies and procedures.

31.     In a broader context, the retirement program was expected to trigger the wider process of
civil service reform that will ultimately bring in new qualified staff and restore public service
delivery, efficiency, and integrity of public administration.

32.   Donor support for civil service reform has been present for years. The need for a
comprehensive civil service reform strategy has been repeatedly emphasized by development
                                            47                                            ANNEX A


partners as indicated in the joint IDA-IMF staff assessments of the 2002 I-PRSP and 2007 PRSP.
Strong donor support was voiced under the coordination of UNDP and Belgium (with
participation from the EU, AfDB, France, and IDA) although the harmonization workshop
scheduled in 2003 never took place due to differences in approach.

33.     Regarding specific implementation benchmarks under DRC-ERC-II, an institutional audit
was done for selected ministries (planning, finance, budget, and agriculture), albeit following
different methodologies and no follow-up. An audit of service delivery was done for health,
education, justice, and rural development. A survey of service users and providers was done for
health and education.

34.     A general census of civil service was done in Kinshasa with limited coverage (that is,
excluding teaching personnel and employees of the ministry of defense who wanted to do their
own census). Data-gathering in other parts of the country was done based on domestic financing
at a very slow pace (completed in 4 provinces out of 17 planned). Central civil service database
(for personnel and payroll management) was planned to be based on general civil service census
data, but it was never completed.

35.     The civil service retirement plan was prepared and implemented with limited success.
The strategy was adopted by the cabinet of ministers in February 2005 as part of the tranche
release condition. Payment of benefits to the first group of eligible retirees (6,000 people;
$2.7 million) was completed as planned. The retirement package for the second group of retirees
(with about 27,000 eligible retirees in Kinshasa to be paid about $13 million) was never
implemented, due to lack of funding, and despite the earmarked resources under the floating
tranche.

36.    Overall, the implementation of the retirement plan was not successful, due to technical
capacity constraints and lack of funding. With less than 10 percent of the initial target (of
80,000-90,000 beneficiaries) reached, this review rates the achievement of the civil service
reform objective as negligible.

37.     Domestic Debt Reduction Settlement. The stated objective was to help the government
settle domestic debt arrears to the private sector by following an orderly process and partially
financing the cost of the operation.

38.     The project contained one complex benchmark which also served as a release condition
for a $42.5 million floating domestic debt tranche. The benchmark had four structured points:

          validation of the stock of debt pursuant to procedures satisfactory to IDA;
          publication (in the official gazette, and in the press/media) of a cut-off date after
           which domestic creditors are precluded from: (i) submitting further claims to be
           included in the stock of debt, or (ii) completing or modifying already submitted
           claims to be included in the stock of debt;
          an agreement, binding under the laws of DRC, having been concluded between the
           government and its creditors representing at least 75 percent of the stock of debt,
           pertaining to a common discount factor, or discount factors as the case may be,
           satisfactory to the association, applicable to the stock of debt; and
ANNEX A                                      48


          appointment of a commercial bank, acceptable to the association, following the
           application of a transparent competitive selection process satisfactory to IDA, called
           upon to effect payments to creditors.

39.     Implementation of the benchmarks included: (i) audit of government arrears to the private
sector; approval of a settlement strategy and action plan; (ii) certification and reconciliation of
private enterprises claims on the state; and (iii) negotiations with creditors; and actual settlement
according to a payment implementation schedule over the 2005-2008 period.

40.     The settlement of debt arrears to private creditors followed a well-organized, multi-staged
process, led by a special section in the ministry of finance, supported by Bank-funded
consultants. The process was based on a well-organized dialogue with a diverse range of private
creditors, followed by a complex negotiation to agree on payment schedules and appropriate
discount rates.

41.     The process took more time than anticipated and the cost exceeded Bank‘s funding
provided under DRC-ERC-II, but the government closed the gap and successfully achieved this
objective. This review rates the achievement of this objective as substantial.

42.     Payment of Public Utilities. The stated objective was to assist the government in making
timely regular flat-rate payments of current bills to the water (REGIDESO) and the power
(SNEL) companies for 2004. The essential reform objective was to ensure regular government
payments to key public suppliers of utilities (water and power in particular), establishing
mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of new payment arrears pertaining to water, electricity,
petroleum products, and telecommunications.

43.     The project had a single complex benchmark which also served as a release condition for
the $25 million utility payment tranche. The benchmark required the adoption of two action
plans, by the government and utility companies. The government action plan called for a
commitment to control its utility use and expenditures following a clear implementation
schedule. The action plan adopted by utility companies (REGIDESO and SNEL) called for a
commitment to improve the reliability, transparency, and accountability of their billing
procedures to public administration, to be achieved following clear implementation schedules. A
separate government protocol with these companies would specify expenditure plans for the
funds that would be transferred to them.

44.     Since January 2005, the government has made flat-rate payments into two trust accounts
established by the utilities rather than payments based on actual consumption. The utility
companies were slow in identifying public consumption of their services and installing meters,
partly as a result of lack of funding to purchase and install meters. Flat payments represent a
temporary and incomplete remedy for the problem. It is not clear that the DPO represents the
right instrument to support improved operation of public utilities.

45.    Overall, this review rates the achievement of this objective as negligible.

Ratings
OUTCOME

46.      The country context and the role of DRC-ERC-II were not very different from the first
operation. If anything, the second TSS and the I-PRSP provided a much clearer medium-term
framework for assessing priorities and defining the outcomes sought by DRC-ERC-II. This was
only partially reflected in the credit design through greater selectivity and narrower focus of
chosen objectives. More importantly, the second operation did not benefit sufficiently from the
experience gathered in DRC-ERC-I and continued to face many problems demonstrated earlier:
complex, broad, and unbalanced design, with unclear priorities and weak implementation. The
overall project outcome was further eroded by the rapid loss of political ownership and declining
economic performance across a broad range of macro-economic and institutional management
indicators. These tendencies continued well beyond project implementation period (2004-2006)
until renewed interest in reforms has been triggered during the run-up to HIPC completion point
in the last two years.

47.     The objectives of DRC-ERC-II were substantially relevant (more so than the first
operation), but the relevance of design was only modest. With solid performance in only one
policy area (settlement of domestic debt arrears), at best modest achievement in sustaining
macro-stability, and no detectable achievement in three objectives (defining medium-term
development strategy, launching civil service reform, and reforming public utilities), the overall
outcome of DRC-ERC-II is rated as unsatisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

48.     In the coming years, weak ownership of reforms and possible reform reversals under
political and social pressures, may re-emerge if present institutional reforms do not take hold and
the country cannot assume a stable long-run growth path based on efficient use of its ample
natural resources (in mining and forestry). The fast approach adopted and the pressures to reach
completion point triggers cast doubts on the genuine ownership of reforms and sustainability of
policy changes recently implemented to comply with PRGF and HIPC requirements.

49.     Overall, limited ownership of reforms and the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability
of policy changes support a rating of significant as regard to the risk to development outcome.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

50.     Design. The program document did not contain a separate discussion of the design and
implementation of M&E arrangements. It simply indicated that progress and outcome indicators
will be monitored by Bank staff in the areas of civil service reform and internal debt
management, based on the indicators contained in the policy matrix (Annex 3 of the program
document). The program document did not identify the overall institutional responsibility for
M&E within the government, but the policy matrix in many instances provided the names of
agencies responsible for policy implementation and monitoring of outcomes. As a rule, this was
accompanied by some (albeit rough) indication of timing, but the matrix did not contain specific
targets or benchmarks by which progress could be measured.
ANNEX A                                     50


51.     Implementation. An incomplete M&E design led to weak implementation: an extensive
collection of monitoring information was very heterogeneous in quality and pertained mostly to
administrative, legal, and qualitative information on the status of specific policy actions
supported under the credit (policy matrix).

52.   Use of the Data. In all, the results of M&E effort played almost no role in the credit
implementation.

53.    Overall, the credit lacked outcome targets and monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
This PPAR rates the quality of credit monitoring and evaluation as negligible.

BANK PERFORMANCE

54.     Quality at Entry. DRC-ERC-II showed many of the same weaknesses as the first
operation. The Bank missed the chance to change the way the operation was designed,
implemented, and supervised. The Bank was drawn into the DRC-ERC-II operation despite an
apparent lack of clarity regarding the strategic directions of DRC institutional and policy
development. Arguably there was a tight timeframe and a need to be responsive to the opening
represented by the new transition in the government, but neither pressure should have affected
the preparation of the credit this time around.

55.    The program document again overstated DRC commitment to reform and capacity to
respond. Despite opting for greater selectivity, the Bank over-designed the operation and tried to
do too many things at once at different levels of engagement. This view was supported by both
Bank staff and borrower counterparts. The Bank reduced the size of the credit, but did not scale-
back sufficiently its scope and the number of the planned activities and associated conditionality.

56.     The design (and consequently monitoring) was focused on process steps, not
development outcomes. With the exception of clear-cut support to improved financial discipline
based on the resolution of domestic debt arrears, all other elements of the program were not well
researched. This was particularly true as regards to the objectives of developing new medium-
term development framework, continuing public expenditure management reform, and launching
the civil service reform.

57.    Important areas of reforms started in DRC-ERC-I were simply dropped without any
explanation (governance, SOE reform, mining, and forestry), and others (such as issues related to
much needed private sector development as DRC ranks the latest in doing business indicators)
were just omitted without much discussion.

58.      The results framework was simplistic. As in DRC-ERC-I, this operation would have
benefited from a stronger results framework in identifying priorities, sequencing reforms, or
informing a sensible monitoring and evaluation framework for the achievement of development
results.

59.     Overall, this review rates Bank‘s performance in securing quality at entry as moderately
unsatisfactory.
                                             51                                            ANNEX A


60.     Quality of Supervision. After a number of years in Kinshasa, the Bank‘s presence has
been well-established, enabling the team to meet the challenges of supervising a DPO and
monitoring the economic developments and reform performance. The team collaborated well
with the Fund, bilateral donors, and UN agencies in their areas of specialization. It also had a
good relationship with the government at the level of core ministries implementing the policy
actions that the credit supported.

61.     Budget limitations and the lack of local staff prevented greater frequency of supervision
missions. The effectiveness of supervision effort was hampered by weak or non-existent
monitoring and evaluation arrangements and dependence on Washington-based staff. Besides,
the project design focused on process steps, rather than development outcomes, making
monitoring very difficult, despite substantially-increased field capacity and well-connected Bank
office in Kinshasa.

62.     Within those constraints, the Bank team made a genuine effort to oversee the
implementation of an ambitious reform agenda under very difficult circumstances on the ground,
to flag problems as they became visible and to attempt corrective actions when feasible.

63.     Overall, Bank performance in securing quality of supervision is rated as moderately
satisfactory. This PPAR rated Bank performance in delivering the credit to client as moderately
unsatisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

64.     Government Performance. Reportedly, during project preparation and the initial stages
of implementation, DRC authorities were cooperative and took pride in early reform and macro-
economic performance successes. However, with the move to more complex and often
politically sensitive actions, the performance started to show growing weaknesses, delays, and
limited performance. Indeed, these problems reflected both deficiencies in technical capacities
and communication caused by excessive reliance on intermediaries, such as project
implementation units (PIUs), and weak engagement of line ministries, especially in the design
stages. But the prime reason was weak or ambiguous political ownership and engagement. The
DRC-ERC-II operation was more important as a source of budget support, and thereafter in
diagnosing development problems, shaping the reform agenda and stepping-up implementation
effort. Combined with changes in the government and the overall loss of political ownership for
difficult institutional reforms, this resulted in progressively weaker government performance
under DRC-ERC-II. On average, this review rates government performance as moderately
unsatisfactory.

65.     Implementing Agency Performance. The Ministry of Finance continued to be the main
implementing agency with active involvement of other line ministries and agencies. On the
positive side, the government managed to meet the conditions of tranche release without the need
for any waivers. The fiduciary environment has been improving, and the government has been
making progress in terms of budget execution and monitoring.

66.     On the other hand, the government did not deliver in most policy areas. This was most
visible in the area of public utilities where the government still pays a flat rate for the use of
ANNEX A                                     52


water and electricity. In the civil service retirement program, benefits were being paid with large
delays and the program stalled, despite nominally earmarking the tranche funds. Changes in the
companies responsible for the civil service census created implementation delays and affected
the quality of the information gathered. Finally, there were substantial delays in completing
important elements of the medium-term development program which affected the project as well
as the preparation of the full PRSP. It should be noted that the performance of implementing
agencies has been constrained by the lack of resources and logistical difficulties, but part of the
problem can certainly be attributed to coordination and communication problems caused by
attitudes and indirect effects of waning political ownership of reforms supported under the
project.

67.     Based on the above evidence, the implementation agency performance is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory. Overall borrower performance is therefore rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

Objectives and Policy Areas
1.     Objectives. The Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation for the Republic of Congo
(RoC-ERC-I) was designed to support the government‘s 2000-2002 Interim Post-Conflict
Program (I-PCP). The I-PCP reflected key socio-economic challenges faced by the country at
the end of the war and the status of the dialogue with the donor community.

2.      The objectives of the credit were to: (i) pursue and deepen structural reforms halted by
the conflict and (ii) improve governance and transparency in the management of the country‘s
natural wealth and public funds (President‘s Report, paras 37 and 41).20

3.       An implicit goal was to provide budget resources to clear external arrears toward IDA
and IBRD. Outcomes were expected in the (i) privatization of Banks, key public utilities, and oil
downstream activities, (ii) improved legal and regulatory framework for business,
(iii) transparency in oil resources management, (iv) transparency in forestry resources, and
(v) improved governance and accountability in the management of public funds.



20
   The statement of credit objectives is based on the President‘s Report (World Bank (2001a), para 41 and Annex
B1: Matrix of Policy Actions. The credit agreement does not explicitly state the project objectives but rather refers
to the ―program of actions, policies and objectives‖ described in the government‘s Letter of Development Policy
(LDP, Annex C, World Bank 2001a), which in turn relies on the interim PCP. Despite somewhat different wording,
the LDP provides a fully consistent statement of objectives in the areas of structural reforms (section 6), and
transparency and good governance (section 7).
ANNEX B                                                 54


4.     Policy Areas. In order to achieve the credit objectives, the government committed to
implement prior actions and reforms in two major policy areas: (i) the pursuit of structural
reforms and (ii) the improvement of governance and transparency in the management of the
country‘s natural wealth and public funds. Annex Table B.1.3 provides a detailed account on the
alignment of the credit policy areas to the intended objectives and the implementation status.

5.      The credit was designed as a one-tranche operation to be disbursed upon: (i) satisfactory
clearance of arrears to the Bank and (ii) the refund of outstanding balances in the already closed
special accounts related to the Bank‘s past portfolio.

6.      Implementation Experience. The credit was approved on July 31, 2001 and became
effective on August 8, 2001. The conditionality for tranche release was swiftly met, and the
credit was disbursed in a single tranche immediately after effectiveness. The final amount
disbursed ($37.9 million) was slightly different from the approved amount ($37.7 million), due
to exchange rate fluctuations. Proceeds from the credit together with the government‘s own
resources were used to clear the arrears with the Bank ($4.7 million with IDA and $58.3 million
with IBRD), thus triggering normalization of relations with the Bank and other donors. The
project was closed on June 30, 2004, a year after the original closing date. A one-year closure
extension was granted to provide the government with an opportunity to complete the most
difficult reforms agreed in the credit program.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
7.      Relevance of Objectives. The objectives of RoC-ERC-I were substantially relevant as
they addressed critical development constraints of a post-conflict situation and were consistent
with both the government‘s strategy and the Bank‘s TSS. The credit aimed to address core issues
affecting the country: high level of indebtedness, the role of the state, private sector
development, public sector governance, and accountability in the management of natural
resources. The credit objectives were consistent with government policies and priorities set out
in the Letter of Development Policy and the Bank's TSS adopted in January 2001.

8.      Furthermore, the timing of the credit and the content of reforms supported under it were
consistent both with the immediate needs on the ground and the longer-run priorities of the
country.

9.    More specifically, the relevance of project objectives was confirmed in three critical
dimensions:

              Enabling reengagement with the donor community by: (i) assisting the
               government in shaping its on-going reform program as the necessary long-term
               context for donor financial and institutional support and (ii) resolving past debt
               service arrears and bringing external debt under control as a technical pre-condition
               for the resumption of support from the donor community.
              Rebalancing the roles of the private and public sector by: (i) transforming the
               private sector into a main vehicle for job creation and economic growth and
               (ii) refocusing the state on its key responsibilities in delivering public services
               (health, education, infrastructure) and securing the rule of law.
              Improving governance by addressing the core issues of transparency and
               accountability in the public sector. Initially, lack of accountability and open
               corruption were among the prior origins of the regional war. Corruption enabled and
               fueled the conflict, and lasting peace and prosperity can hardly be achieved without a
               major improvement in the quality of governance.

10.        In substance, these objectives have remained relevant to this day as they:

              Enabled the consolidation of large external debt and provided a basis for active
               dialogue with the main creditors; the external debt sustainability agenda culminated
               in January 2010 with the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative;
              Supported government efforts to remain a stronger provider of public goods and
               gradually withdraw from the productive sectors, thus providing greater scope for
               private-sector led growth in the non-oil sectors of the economy. Ongoing efforts to
               strike a better balance between public and private sector are based on government
               retrenchment from public utilities, and its expanded role in strengthening physical
               infrastructure and enhancing efficiency in public investments; and
              Maintained the necessary momentum for enhancing governance and transparency in
               the management of public resources, primarily in the oil sector.

11.     Despite some progress towards greater transparency in the oil sector and stronger PFM
system, improved management of natural and public resources remains an important part of the
overall reform agenda. On that basis, the relevance of RoC-ERC-I objectives is rated as substantial.

12.      Relevance of Design. The credit design was inadequate, due to an overly ambitious
reform agenda in relation to government implementation capacity, and a weak results matrix to
track progress. In the immediate post-conflict period, the Republic of Congo had a lot of
competing priorities,21 including (i) consolidating peace and securing economic revival;
(ii) strengthening government implementation capacity; and (iii) stopping corruption that thrived
during the war and continues to plague progress in governance. Also, the country was operating
on shaky political grounds caused by divisions and fragile political arrangements which barely



21
     Extracted from the country I-PCP, and the Bank‘s TSS.
ANNEX B                                            58


supported progress towards normality; a clear consensus on stabilizing the political situation and
moving the country forward was urgently needed.

13.     To ensure the achievement of improved governance, macroeconomic stability, and the
return of the economy on a sustained growth path, project performance was to be evaluated
against 20 reform benchmarks identified during appraisal (Annex Table D3). The wide set of
benchmarks replicated the entire government reform agenda. The credit would have been more
effective in supporting the government‘s efforts to reengage with the donor community if it had
focused on a subset of the most important and realistically-sequenced reforms, and ensured a
better mapping between activities supported under the credit and the final objectives. On the
positive side, the Bank envisioned strengthening internal technical capacity through a TA
project, but there was a delay in its preparation and approval.

14.     Instead of a standard results matrix, the credit document had a reduced matrix of progress
and outcome indicators (Annex B2 of the President‘s Report, World Bank 2001a, page 24). This
matrix summarized the four intended outcomes22 related progress and outcome indicators,
identified means of verification, provided linkages to the government development matrix, and
listed key assumptions. The development objectives used in the matrix differed from the credit
objectives and the matrix did not provide baseline values or clearly defined measurable outcome
indicators and benchmarks. Some of the outcome indicators were not specific enough to capture
the content of the reforms supported under the program or, more importantly, gauge progress
towards stated objectives.

15.     Overall, as clearly demonstrated through implementation difficulties, the design of the
project was inadequate as the weak knowledge of the economy prevented a meaningful selection
of priorities and sequencing of reforms within a well-defined results framework. Instead, the
credit pursued a wide range of policy actions and an overly ambitious reform agenda for what the
country could carry out. On that basis, the relevance of design of the credit is rated as modest.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
16.     Pursuing and Deepening Structural Reforms. Under this objective the credit aimed to
ensure that structural reforms undertaken by the government would provide enhanced scope for
private sector growth and an increased share in the economy after decades of a state-centered growth.

17.     The government privatized three state-owned banks, but the privatized banks remain
weak and one was later re-nationalized. Privatization of the water and power companies was
unsuccessful as bidders were not prepared to commit the large required investments, the railway
privatization was unsuccessful. Some progress occurred in reforming the telecommunication
sector, as the Office of Posts, Telephone and Telecommunications (PTT) successfully split into
two entities and two private cellular providers were licensed. However, a regulatory authority
was not established, and the government reversed an earlier decision and restored the monopoly
on international calls to the incumbent land-line company.

22
    Intended outcomes on page 24 of the President‘s report were (i) improved management of the reform process,
(ii) improved management of external debt and adequacy of the budget, (iii) improved budget formulation and
efficiency, and (iv) transparency and account in the public sector.

Annex Box B1.1. RoC: Update on Recent Developments in the Credit Reform Agenda
The implementation of this objective continued beyond the project closure date on June 30, 2004. The government‘s
progressive retrenchment from banking, key public utilities, and downstream oil sector activities was pursued to restore the
confidence of private economic operators, improve the overall business climate, as well as improve the performance of the
state-owned enterprises through lower costs, improved management, and better fiscal impact. As of end-2010, the five
commercial banks are privately owned, the entire banking sector is relatively sound and well capitalized, and is considered
one of the most stable in the CEMAC zone (see Annex Table B1.5 below).
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from low levels of financial intermediation, even by regional standards. Less
than 3 percent of the population has a bank account, reflecting both the limited number of bank branches and high fees for
opening and maintaining bank accounts. In 2006 and 2007, the oil windfall profits and robust economic activity led to the
rapid expansion of deposits: time and savings deposits grew by 60 and 21 percent respectively. By contrast, private-sector
credit grew at a much slower rate: on average only 4 percent annually during 2004-2006 period, and by 8 percent in 2007,
indicating the presence of other barriers to private sector growth.

Privatization of the oil distribution sector was successful as the state monopoly company (Hydro-Congo) was replaced by
global private distribution companies (Total, Exxon, Chevron, and Texaco). It is worth noting that in January 2010,
following a dispute over accounting irregularities involving a local bank and senior figures from the regime, Chevron (US)
returned its 25 percent stake in the oil distribution sector to the government oil company (SNPC). The privatization of key
public utilities (water, electricity, and railway) completely stalled, aside from launching preliminary steps towards a private
concession of the railway.
Regarding the legal and regulatory framework for business, the state retrenchment from productive economic activities was
the main tool to secure greater scope for private sector growth. Specific programs were scheduled in the areas of forestry,
postal service, and telecommunications, as well as the port authority and the water and electricity utilities.
Progress in postal service and telecommunications sector included the repeal of the public operator monopoly over
international gateway services and the provision of wireless services, the adoption of a decree setting conditions of
management of frequency consistent with the best international practice, as well as the passage of a new legal package
comprising laws instituting a regulatory agency for the sector, the regulation of the electronic communications, and the
postal sectors.
  ANNEX B                                               60


Regarding the privatization of the Port of Pointe Noire, an external financing package of EUR67.1 million was secured in
March 2009 to help finance the rehabilitation of the port‘s facilities, and was thereafter put under concession for
management by a private company (Bolloré Group). Finally reforms of the water and electricity utilities completely stalled,
as those public firms continued to experience acute management problems, and absorb large budget subsidies.
Improved business environment: A number of initiatives aimed at improving the business environment that took place
since the start of the first operation had very limited success. The government and the parliament placed great hopes in the
new investments chart which enabled the launching of a one stop investment window and held promise to improve the
business and investment climate, but the implementation turned out to be unsuccessful.
Limited achievements were noted in other policy areas supported under the credit. Most notably, the government‘s
intention to address the social and labor constraints to privatization by adopting a social action plan and reviewing the labor
code constraints completely failed as these activities never took place.
The lack of progress in improving business environment is confirmed by the most recent results of the Doing Business
indicators for 2010. By end-2009, it still took 169 days to start a business, and the cost of the operation was estimated at
244 percent of the income per capita. Despite some notable effort to improve business environment, the status of the
Republic of Congo as a business destination for private sector investors remains ambiguous. The country has continued to
score poorly with regard to indicators and procedures related to costs, ease of operation and institutional effectiveness,
protection of property and investors‘ rights, enforcement of contracts, lengthy administrative procedures, and rigid labor
legislation. On a positive note, the mining sector continues to attract foreign direct investments, as illustrated by an Anglo-
Swiss and an Australian mining firms, which have been active in the exploration of iron ore since 2009, as well as South
African farmers that are planning to invest in the agriculture sector.


  18.     Codes governing the water, electricity, petroleum distribution, and forestry sectors were
  approved as envisioned, but not all of the implementing regulations were promulgated. A study
  of forest taxation was completed by the Bank and the government which resulted in a number of
  promising recommendations, which were not implemented. The investment climate was
  improved by the adoption of a progressive investment code and reduction of the corporate tax
  rate. There was no information on the downstream oil privatization, or the adoption of a social
  action plan to support privatization

  19.     At the credit closure in 2004, the overall progress in achieving the credit objective was
  limited. First, privatization of targeted state-owned banks had limited impact. Second, there was
  no progress in other privatizations (of water, electricity, and railway), and the reform of the
  autonomous Port of Pointe Noire and the review of labor code simply did not take place. Third,
  the progress in reforming the postal service and telecommunications was at a preliminary phase
  and has not reached non-reversal point. Fourth, all attempts to increase transparency in the
  management of the oil sector and forestry stalled. On the basis on the above evidence,
  achievement of the first credit objective is rated modest.

  20.      Overall, this review provides updates (see Box above) on achievements in the following
  areas: (i) the banking sector was restructured, privatized and stabilized; (ii) the state monopoly
  on gas distribution operations was replaced by private firms competing in the market;
  (iii) reforms in the forestry sector led to greater competition and transparency in awarding
  concessions, ensuring sustainability of the forest resource base, and securing improved fiscal
  revenue collection, (iv) the Port of Pointe Noire was rehabilitated and put under private
  concession, and (v) the postal and communication sector was liberalized and an upgraded
  regulation was put in place following good international practice.

  21.     However, most of the above reform progress was completed only recently, years after the
  credit closure, and often represent the first step in implementing deeper institutional reforms.
                                             61                                            ANNEX B


Moreover, there was almost no progress in the privatization of public utilities (water, electricity
and railway), the upgrading of the labor code, and the adoption of the social action plan.

22.    Improved Governance and Transparency in the Management of the Natural Wealth
and Public Funds. Under this objective, the credit aimed primarily to: (i) enhance transparency
and governance in the management of the oil sector; (ii) pursue transparency reforms in the
management of forestry resources; and (iii) improve governance and accountability in the
management of public funds. Limited progress was achieved during the credit life period. As
noted under the previous objective, following credit closure, the reforms were dormant for a
number of years and were revived only recently as the government and the donor community
focused on meeting the triggers for the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative.

23.     During the credit implementation period (2001-2004) and beyond (2005-2007), progress
to improve transparency in the oil sector was very slow. The government took steps to: (i) phase
out earmarking of oil revenue and centralize all revenues in the state budget; (ii) conduct an
external audit of the state oil company (SNPC) for 1999-2000 accounts and 2001 consolidated
accounts; and (iii) stop incurring oil-collateralized debt. Overall, the thrust of these reforms was
weak, and effectiveness in improving the management of the oil sector remained lukewarm.
Despite all efforts, the general perception of opaque management in the oil sector largely
prevailed.

24.     In the forestry sector, the government completed a comprehensive and participatory
forest and environmental sector review, and adopted laws expected to improve its economic and
fiscal performance by allowing greater competition and transparency in awarding forest
concessions, and ensuring sustainability of the forest resource base.

25.      In public procurement, the goal was to strengthen institutional and legal arrangements.
Procurement reform touched many interests and proved to be quite a challenging task in a post-
conflict environment with weak commitment to reforms and lack of domestic capacity in project
implementation. As a result, the government failed to launch the procurement reform while the
project was active and returned to this issue at the end of 2008 by adopting a procurement reform
action plan. A new procurement code, adopted in May 2009, offered a legal and regulatory
framework fully aligned with international best practice. The code provided suitable
institutional, administrative, and operational arrangements for general procurement directorate,
regulatory authority, and a contract management authority. Five line ministries (including
health, education, and agriculture) created fully staffed and equipped procurement units.
Detailed procurement manuals, standard bidding documents, and general conditions of contracts
have been prepared and shared with all relevant agencies, followed by a training program
currently underway. The effects of the new procurement system will be known when the audit
of the use of public funds takes place.

26.     The momentum of reforms in oil management was revived at the same time. SNPC made
improvements in the quality of accounting and internal controls: better audit reports for 2006-
2007 (with reduced number and severity of reservations) were followed by the introduction of a
new accounting system. Both SNPC and COTRADE, the national oil trading firm, began to
transfer revenue on the basis of realized prices. The transfers were reconciled with budget data,
certified on a quarterly basis by an international audit company and posted on the government‘s

website. Statistical analysis of price differentials confirmed that sales were done at competitive
and fair market prices.

27.     Weak performance in achieving better public resource management is confirmed by low
ratings received for the quality of public sector management under the Bank‘s Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) indicators, as well as by the Worldwide Governance
Indicators measure of the quality of governance. As indicated in Annex Table B1.6, the overall
quality of public sector management did not show any improvement between 2001 and 2008 as
the average rating remained at 2.6 for a maximum rating of 6. Within the flat average score,
there were sporadic improvements in selected dimensions of public sector management
supported under the project. Most notably, property rights and anticorruption activities recorded
marginal improvements which were not sustained beyond the life of the credit. There were two
exceptions to this rule: on the positive side, improvements in revenue mobilization were
sustained throughout the 2001-2008 period; on the negative side, the quality of public
administration never showed any sign of change and remained flat at a low 2.5 score.

28.     The WGI shows a similar pattern of weak average performance over the 2000-2008
period. As detailed in graphs below (see Figures G-L in Annex Box B1.2), improvements
recorded in the initial years of RoC-ERC-I could not be sustained. Advances made in improving
voice and accountability, rule of law, and anti-corruption during 2002-2004 were invariably
followed by partial policy reversals which kept the Republic of Congo within the bottom
10 percent of all countries. The only exception was political stability which continuously
improved over the years bringing the Republic of Congo out of the bottom quarter by 2008. On
average, this review rates the achievement of the second objective during the period when the
credit was active as modest.

29.      Overall, despite weak results in improving the management of public resources during
the life of the credit, institutional changes and policies supported under this project were resumed
in recent years leading to important achievements including: (i) significant improvements of the
quality of governance and transparency in the oil sector confirmed by the results of independent
periodic audits of the national oil company, better flow of information from SNPC and
COTRADE to the treasury and timely reconciliation of realized oil prices and proceeds with the
budget data; (ii) better performance of the forestry sector based on greater competition and
transparency in awarding forestry concessions, leading to improved management of forest
resources and increased fiscal revenues; and (iii) introduction of public procurement systems and
institutions at the central government level and in key line ministries, although audit of public
funds lagged.

30.    To a large extent, the resumption of reforms was owed to a coordinated effort by the
government and international community to reach the completion point under the enhanced
HIPC initiative in January 2010. Sustaining this effort beyond the debt relief completion point
and ensuring broad ownership for continued improvements in the management of public
resources remains a major challenge.

Ratings
OUTCOME

31.     The relevance of objectives of the credit was substantial. On the contrary, the relevance
of design was modest. The implementation of RoC-ERC-I contributed significantly to economic
revival in the immediate post-conflict period. It helped bring domestic and external debt under
control, and notably improved government ability to design and implement reform programs.

32.     At the credit closure in 2004, the overall progress in achieving the credit‘s objective was
limited. First, privatization of targeted state-owned banks had limited impact. Second, there was
no progress in other privatizations (of water, electricity, and railway), and the reform of the
autonomous Port of Pointe Noire and the review of the labor code simply did not take place.
Third, the progress in reforming the postal service and telecommunications was at a preliminary
phase and has not reached non-reversal point. Fourth, all attempts to increase transparency in the
management of the oil sector and forestry stalled, and the procurement reform hardly took off.

33.     Due to weak results framework and the absence of effective M&E arrangements, many
policy actions and reforms implemented during the credit implementation period (2001-2004)
and beyond (2005-2007) were not followed by consistent longer-term policies and reforms and,
thus, did not contribute tangibly to the achievement of outcomes. These reforms were resumed
in recent years as the country strived to meet the completion point triggers under the enhanced
HIPC initiative.

34.     On balance, while recognizing the achievements in key areas of debt management, and in
improving the quality of governance in the management of natural resources and public funds,
this review notes a serious loss of the reform momentum in the 2004-2008 period caused mainly
by the weak political ownership. On that basis, this evaluation rates the overall outcome of the
RoC-ERC-I operation at credit closure as unsatisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

35.     The country has been severely hit by the global economic crisis, which slowed GDP
growth, lowered oil prices, and adversely affected the current account balance, capital flows, and
access to global financial markets. The growing external debt overhang was rapidly becoming an
overwhelming concern and the government sought solution by advancing the completion point
process under the enhanced HIPC initiative.

36.     Expectedly, the HIPC completion point triggers overlapped with the brunt of the policy
and institutional reforms advanced in 2001-2004 under RoC-ERC-I and IMF programs. Efforts
towards meeting HIPC triggers de facto meant resumption and completion of the initial post-
conflict reform agenda. It is hard to tell if the revived interest in reforms stalled in 2004-2007
represents a genuine change in ownership or just a temporary maneuver necessary to meet the
completion point triggers. In the latter case, the main risk going forward could come from
another decline in the ownership of reforms.

37.      Regarding risks to other outcomes in banking and budget, it is likely that reforms and
improved performance will be sustained in the banking sector and in the budget process.
Likewise, the privatization of the Port of Pointe Noire, and the liberalization of the postal service
and telecom sectors will probably be sustained, and eventually deepened. By contrast, initial
progress made in the management of the oil and forestry sectors, and in public procurement is
still very preliminary. Unless continuously supported by the government and key stakeholders,
these reforms could easily be stalled or reversed by vested interests.

38.    Overall, the risk to development outcome is rated as significant.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

39.    Design. The President‘s Report remains almost entirely silent on the design of the
monitoring and evaluation arrangements. Indirectly, the core M&E framework is provided in a
short matrix of progress and outcome indicators used in lieu of a full-fledged results matrix. The
matrix of progress and outcome indicators does not provide baseline values, it does not specify
measurable outcome indicators, and it does not assign responsibilities in M&E (between the
Bank and the government, and between ministries within the government). Both the Bank and
government teams failed to put in place an effective M&E arrangement.

40.     Implementation. Absence of clear M&E design, capacity constraints, and lack of
coordination among implementing agencies, resulted in a poor M&E implementation: the M&E
function was rudimentary as it provided mostly administrative, legal, and qualitative information
on the status of policy actions supported under the credit.

41.    Use of the Data. Expectedly, the limited information produced by the M&E system did
not play almost any role in the project implementation.

42.    On the basis of the above information, this PPAR rates the quality of monitoring and
evaluation as negligible.

BANK PERFORMANCE

43.     Quality at Entry. The Bank was quick to exploit the opportunity to prepare this
operation, assist the government, and mobilize donor support. The project objectives were
consistent with strategic goals of the government‘s interim post-conflict program and the Bank‘s
transitional support strategy.

44.     The project design was hampered by the lack of up-to-date knowledge of the economy
and failure to effectively utilize Bank experience from other post-conflict countries. On the
knowledge side, the analytic and advisory activities were out of date and led to a weak results
framework and unrealistic policy actions. The nature, number, and scope of reforms were
overwhelming for a post-conflict country.

45.     Experience from other post-conflict countries was not fully used in the project design,
particularly in the reforms involving complex political economy issues. The Bank team did not
recognize the delicate and controversial nature of the key reforms advanced by the project, including
the privatization agenda (for banks and public utilities), and the drive to improve governance in the
oil and forestry sectors, and increase the transparency and accountability in the public sector.

46.     In terms of content and coverage, the credit mirrored the entire country reform program.
Greater selectivity and simpler project design would have increased Bank‘s leverage with the
government, better aligned implementation arrangements with severely limited capacity, and
elevated buy in from key stakeholders. Similarly, greater clarity, consistency in defining credit
objectives, for instance, and a full results chain might have increased the effectiveness of the
credit and facilitated the design and implementation of adequate M&E arrangements.

47.     Given the severe capacity constraints in the country, the proposal to combine the
adjustment operation with a technical assistance project was quite appropriate, but the timing was
off. Instead of going in tandem with or even preceding the adjustment operation, the TA project
was launched almost a year later, creating a gap in capacity to process and implement reforms.

48.     Due to the above shortcomings, this review rates Bank performance in securing quality at
entry as moderately unsatisfactory.

49.     Quality of Supervision. The Bank took a number of steps to facilitate the supervision of
the credit. A country office was opened in 2001 with a resident Country Manager. The
economic team fielded multiple supervision missions. Sector specialists often joined the
economic team to monitor specific aspects of credit implementation. All supervision missions
were fully documented with back-to-office reports and aide-memoires.

50.     Unfortunately, the supervision effort was not sufficient to meet the implementation
challenges posed by the overly ambitious reforms program in a country that lacked administrative
resources and capacity in the key ministries. The effectiveness and quality of the supervision effort
was lowered by numerous staff changes in the country team, (both the country director and the
country economist were changed while the project was active), delayed responses to government
requests, and long periods of absence from the country between supervision missions.
                                            67                                           ANNEX B


51.   Based on the above facts, the quality of supervision is rated as unsatisfactory. The overall
Bank performance in supporting the delivery of this credit is also rated as unsatisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

52.      Government Performance. Nominally, the government was reasonably well prepared
for this operation through an interim post-conflict program for 2000-2002, an emergency post-
conflict assistance program (with the IMF), and the ongoing preparation of an interim PRSP.
The government actively collaborated with the Bank team during preparation and appraisal,
made timely policy and institutional changes to meet all Board presentation conditions (prior
actions) and tranche release conditions upon effectiveness. However, following the
disbursement of the credit, the government could not secure continued ownership and shepherd
the implementation of an overly ambitious reform agenda. There was a lack of true political and
social consensus regarding the (reduced) role of the state in the economy, the implementation of
far-reaching privatizations, and the need to improve the quality of governance in managing oil
and forestry resources and public finance. A better domestic consultation process and more open
dialogue with key donors (IFIs and bilateral donors especially) could have revealed these risks
and informed a stronger advocacy and consensus-building effort preceding the inclusion of these
reforms in the project.

53.    This review rates government performance as unsatisfactory

54.    Implementing Agency Performance. Credit implementation was initially entrusted to
two different units: (i) the inter-ministerial technical committee and (ii) the privatization
committee. To improve coordination among the implementing agencies, the government in 2003
appointed a senior staff in the ministry of finance to monitor the implementation of credit
reforms and report directly to the minister of finance.

55.     In practice, the performance of implementing agencies was inadequate. The two ad-hoc
committees entrusted with implementing reforms did not have sufficient professional capacity,
and political and institutional leverage to push through for the complex reforms. The
appointment of a senior staff member from the ministry of finance to improve coordination and
enhance the leverage of implementing agencies came late (two years after credit approval) and
did not produce the desired impact. Moderate improvements in implementation arrangements
could not possibly compensate for the absence of a clear political and social consensus to carry
out an ambitious privatization agenda (of commercial banks, public utilities, postal service and
telecom, railways and the Port of Pointe Noire), management reforms in key sectors (oil and
forestry), and other structural reforms.

56.     Overall, weak ownership of proposed reforms, revealed soon after the disbursement of
credit resources, led to partial and delayed implementation, and slowed progress even in areas
where the government had full administrative control (e.g. procurement) and did not face
opposing political and social sentiments.

57.   This review rates implementing agency performance as unsatisfactory, and overall
borrower performance as unsatisfactory.

Objectives and Policy Areas
1.     Objectives. The Republic of Congo Economic Recovery Credit (RoC-ERC-II) aimed to
deal with high level of indebtedness, lack of transparency and poor governance in the
management of natural resources, and shortcomings in the management of public resources and
investments. In essence, the RoC-ERC-II continued and deepened the essential elements of the
unfinished reform agenda launched under RoC-ERC-I. The second operation internalized some
lessons learned from the first operation as it was better focused on few priority actions.

2.      The objectives of RoC-ERC-II as stated in the President‘s Report (paragraph 69) were to:
(i) help improve the quality of management and transparency in the oil sector; (ii) assist in the
design of a sound public investment program to permit more efficient use of available resources;
and (iii) contribute to an orderly resolution of large domestic debts. As indicated in the table
below, these objectives were fully consistent with the policies scheduled to be implemented by
the government.

3.       Policy Areas. The credit was part of the Bank‘s transitional support strategy approved in
August 2003 which aimed to assist the government in its efforts to scale-down, enhance, and
reposition the public sector through better management of public resources, greater transparency,
and improved management in the oil sector. The credit was designed to be disbursed in two
tranches. The first tranche was to be released upon project effectiveness, while the release of the
second tranche was contingent on meeting seven conditions in the following policy areas:
(i) transparency in the oil sector; (ii) public investment program; and (iii) domestic debt.

4.     Implementation. The credit was approved in December 2004, became effective in
March 2005, and was closed as scheduled on December 31, 2006. The first tranche in the
amount of $17 million was released upon effectiveness on March 16, 2005. The second tranche
($13 million) was ultimately cancelled since the release conditions were not met. Failure to
achieve conditions lowered the available resources for budget support and, more importantly,
prevented the achievement of project objectives.

Relevance of Objectives and Design
5.       Relevance of Objectives. Although RoC-ERC-II was formally a stand-alone operation,
it retained a great deal of continuity in the development objectives introduced under RoC-ERC-I.
By emphasizing the need for improved transparency (in the oil sector), better public resource
management (through improved public investment program), and greater financial stability
(through resolution of domestic debt arrears), RoC-ERC-II pursued the unfinished reform agenda
set out in the first operation and implemented with mixed success. These objectives were
critically relevant at the time of credit preparation and remained relevant to this date, as visibly
confirmed by their inclusion in the set of triggers for the enhanced HIPC initiative completion
point reached in December 2010.

Annex Table B2.4. I-PRSP Pillars and RoC-ERC-II Objectives
                       I-PRSP pillars                                                  RoC-ERC-II Objectives

6.       The objectives were also aligned with the government‘s own strategy and reflected the
growing international experience. Effectively, RoC-ERC-II utilized lessons learned from the
first operation and from other post-conflict countries by being more selective in the choice of
objectives, more timely in the transfer of resources, simpler in design and better aligned with the
critical priorities jointly identified by the authorities of the Republic of Congo and the donor
community. Based on research findings and experience from other post-conflict environments,
                                                    71                                                    ANNEX B


the second operation placed added emphasis on reversing the collapse of infrastructure during
the war years (through improved public investment program) and on introducing tighter control
and better management of proceeds from natural resources to ensure their intended development
use and prevent diversion into resurgence of rebel activities.

7.      The relevance of resolving domestic debts was equally strong as the collapse of the
financial discipline became a major hindrance to macroeconomic stability, and the external and
internal credibility of the government, as well as a critical obstacle to privatization process and
further private sector growth.

8.      In short, the objectives supported under RoC-ERC-II: (i) built on the performance of the
first DPO and sought to push forward the reform agenda, (ii) maintained the momentum of
reengagement with the donor community and sustained the domestic consultation process on
policy and development issues, and (iii) laid the foundations for continued IMF programs, and
for progress towards meeting the (decision and completion point) requirements under the
enhanced HIPC initiative. On that basis the relevance of objectives is rated as substantial.

9.      Relevance of Design. RoC-ERC-II opted for a two-tranche operation design with uneven
distribution of conditionality. The credit had no prior actions and the first tranche disbursed
automatically upon effectiveness with no triggers or conditions attached. Seven conditions with
varying degrees of complexity were all attached to the second tranche. The four conditions
related to objectives I and II (see Annex Table B2.4 above) were based on approval and
implementation of complex documents23 with almost no detail on the critical monitoring
variables. By contrast, the remaining three conditions related to objective III sought a well-
defined numeric result or a simple confirmation that agreed actions have been completed.24 In
short, despite a much stronger focus of the second operation and a reasonable alignment between
proposed policy actions and intended outcomes, the nature of triggers (grounded in complex
policy documents) created an incentive bias and huge implementation difficulties.

10.     These problems were further exacerbated by the absence of a clear results framework
relating to policy actions for intermediate and longer-term development outcomes. The results
matrix presented in the President‘s Report (Annex 3) maps policy actions to development
objectives,25 and assigns policy responsibility to respective ministries, but falls short of
identifying precise outcomes and measurable outcome indicators. Consequently, it does not
provide a basis for a consistent M&E framework.

11.      Overall, relevance of design is rated as modest.



23
  The documents included detailed action plans for the oil sector and public investment program; public investment
program for two fiscal years; and detailed audit reports for public investment expenditures.
24
  For example, two triggers for ―domestic debt clearance‖ sought a confirmation that an agreement covering 75
percent of arrears has been signed and that a bank to effect payments has been appointed following transparent
procedure.

  With a confusing addition of ―Poverty reduction‖ to the three development objectives identified in the project
document.

Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
12.      Improve Management and Transparency in the Oil Sector. RoC-ERC-II intended to
build on progress achieved under the RoC-ERC-I and to step-up governance and transparency in
the oil sector. The credit intended to enhance transparency in the management of the oil
company (SNPC) and streamline the relationship between the state and companies operating in
the oil sector. When the credit closed at the end of 2006, the only activity that was completed
was the preparation of departmental operational manuals for the SNPC. All other key credit
benchmarks were missed at the closure date. The modeling of oil reserves and potential state
revenues did not take place. The final audit of two oil companies (SNPC and CORAL) was not
completed in time. A valorization study of SNPC historical costs was not done till much later.
The reconciliation of cross debts (claims) between the oil companies and the state, with
appropriate adjustments in the budget were not accomplished by the end of 2006.

13.     As already discussed under the achievement of objectives of RoC-ERC- I (see Annex
Box B1.1), weak performance in public resource management is confirmed by low ratings
received for the quality of public sector management under the Bank‘s CPIA indicators, as well
as by the WGI measure of the quality of governance.

14.     While many of the specific activities supported by the credit did not take place on time or
as sequentially planned, there were two important achievements essential for improving the
transparency and the quality of management in the oil sector. First, the quality of accounting and
internal financial controls in SNPC continued to improve. In addition to achieving better audit
reports for 2006 and 2007 already mentioned under RoC-ERC-I operation, SNPC moved to a
new improved analytical accounting system for 2008. Second, both COTRADE and SNPC
continued to transfer fiscal revenues to the budget on the basis of realized prices. Standard
procedures are in place to reconcile the transfers with budget data, certify and audit the realized
prices, and publically disclose the results. Independent analysis of price differentials shows that
RoC oil is sold at competitive market prices.

15.     In addition, it should be noted that, following credit closure at the end of 2006, much of
the unfinished agenda in the oil sector management reform has been included in the set of
triggers for the enhanced HIPC initiative completion point. Overall, based on actions completed
during the life of the credit, this review rates progress in achieving greater transparency and
improved management in the oil sector as modest.

16.     Upgrade Public Investment Program to Promote Economic Growth and Better
Social Service Delivery. In line with general findings of the Public Expenditure Review (World
Bank, 2007), the credit intended to help upgrade the preparation, appraisal, and selection of
public investment projects, as well as enhance the transparency in the execution of the public
investment program. At credit closure, some of the activities were launched, but none of the
significant actions proposed by the credit were completed and achievements towards improved
efficiency of the public investment program were negligible.

17.    Efforts to improve credit preparation, follow rigorous selection, and ensure efficient
execution and monitoring of public investment projects continued beyond the credit closure at
the end of 2006. Most actions were assumed under the set of triggers for the HIPC initiative.
                                             73                                            ANNEX B


The HIPC framework increased stakes and provided the necessary incentives to achieve
significant progress till the completion point in January 2010. To start with, based on sustained
dialogue with key external donors, at the end of 2008, the government adopted an action plan to
improve the management of public projects. Main features of the action plan were: (i) clear
delineation of responsibilities in handling public investment projects, including responsibility for
capacity building and decentralized approach; (ii) adoption of a more strategic system for the
selection of important investment projects based on progressive linkages with the budget
preparation process and the medium-term national development strategy (PRSP); (iii) enhanced
management of the capital investment budget, including unification of the budget process,
introduction of a multi-year budget programming, increased transparency and better budget
management; (iv) introduction of an efficient M&E system for all investment projects and
programs; and (v) mandatory preparation and approval of feasibility studies and project costing
for all public investment projects.

18.     A number of concrete steps were implemented towards improved transparency in the PIP
execution. Starting in 2006, all projects eligible for budget financing required a detailed
assessment of the capacity of the implementing agency and an in-depth audit of the public
investment budget execution for the previous year. A project evaluation fund was established in
2006 to provide financing and technical support for project appraisals. Since 2007 draft public
investment budgets have been shared with IDA and staffs‘ comments have been taken into
account. The new procedures led to increased compliance with budget guidelines and enabled
significant improvements in the implementation of investment projects, as confirmed in a report
on the implementation of the investment budget in the first quarter of 2009.

19.    There was good progress in upgrading the quality of Public Investment Programs, and in
improving the selection of public investment projects and enhancing the transparency in their
execution. However, performance achieved during the credit life is rated as modest.

20.      Resolution of Domestic Debt Arrears. Large external and domestic arrears had become
an endemic feature of the Congolese economy in the post-conflict period. The initial clearance of
external arrears with IFIs in 2001-2002 was expected to provide a new start and generate enough
momentum to establish a lasting financial discipline and gradually clear all other outstanding
external and internal arrears in an orderly and transparent fashion. Improved macroeconomic
stability, greater transparency, and more efficient public financial management supported under
the IMF and Bank programs, provided a favorable environment in which the government moved
early in 2003 to settle a portion of domestic arrears (1.9 percent of GDP) based on initial increase
in oil revenues. However, the process of settling domestic commercial arrears of the government
started to slow down in 2004 (1.4 percent of GDP) as it became increasingly difficult to
overcome resource limitations, lack of ownership, and vested interests.

21.     To reinvigorate the domestic debt resolution process, the RoC-ERC-II operation
supported the preparation and adoption of an actionable broader strategy to address arrears in an
orderly, systematic, and transparent manner. Building on similar exercises in DRC and other
countries, the strategy followed a four-step sequence including: (i) validation of the payment
claims through an independent audit; (ii) negotiation of terms comparable to those expected
under the forthcoming HIPC and adopt equitable payment modalities; (iii) efficient payment of
ANNEX B                                         74


arrears through a competitively selected commercial bank; and (iv) introduction of mechanisms
(payment discipline) that would prevent accumulation of new arrears.

22.     The first three measures represented conditions for the release of the second tranche, and
the fourth was maintained as a performance criterion in all ongoing and subsequent IMF
programs, as well as HIPC triggers (for both decision point in 2006 and completion point in
2010). As already mentioned,26 these conditions were only partially met and the second tranche
was never disbursed.

23.     The stock of domestic commercial arrears as of end-2003 totaling almost $300 million
was audited in 2005 and a strategy to settle domestic arrears was adopted on schedule. The
action plan stipulated that domestic creditors would be paid in accordance with a 2005-2011
payment schedule that provided a choice of three repayment periods and associated discounts
(two year period with 66 percent discount; four year period with 35 percent discount; and six
year period with 25 percent discount). The preparation of the action plan was done on a very
tight timeline which did not provide for adequate involvement of domestic creditors or feedback
from the Bank. Furthermore, the implementation materially deviated from the agreed modalities,
with significant irregularities and corruption problems.

24.     Most importantly, the resulting reduction in outstanding arrears of government
commercial payments to the private sector was slow. Despite the action plan, cumulative
reduction in arrears during the RoC-ERC-II period was only 4.2 percent of GDP. Government
incentives and performance significantly improved in the run-up to HIPC completion point, and
the reduction in arrears reached 8.7 percent of GDP during 2007-2009.

25.    In all, a strategy to settle domestic arrears was adopted and implemented. Entitled
domestic creditors have been paid according to the 2005-2011 payment schedule. However, the
stock of domestic arrears could not be entirely cleared, and there were deviations from agreed
modalities with significant irregularities and corruption problems in the settlement. Based on the
above, this review rates the credit achievement in resolving domestic debt arrears as modest.

OUTCOME

26.     The implementation of RoC-ERC-II started or maintained policy actions and reforms
which are important for improved transparency and the quality of management in the oil sector,
better management of public investment resources and the resolution of domestic commercial
debt arrears. Unfortunately, the political ownership of reforms during the active credit period
(2005-2006) turned out to be rather weak, especially after the disbursement of the first tranche.
In combination with a weak results framework and the absence of effective M&E arrangements,
most policy actions and reforms envisaged under the credit were only partially implemented,
delayed, or stalled.

27.     Achievement of outcome at the credit closure was as follows: (i) the majority of actions
slated to address governance issues in the oil sector stalled, (ii) similarly, none of the significant
actions proposed by the credit to improve the efficiency of the public investment program was
completed, and finally (iii) there were significant irregularities and corruption issues in the
settlement of domestic arrears.

28.     Admittedly, after being dormant for few years, many of the reforms and policies initiated
under the RoC-ERC-II operation were resumed in recent years as part of a wider effort by the
government to meet the completion point triggers under the enhanced HIPC initiative. The
contribution of prominent policy actions supported under the credit, such as domestic debt
resolution plan, new accounting systems in the oil sector, improved appraisal rules and more
stringent execution for public sector investment projects, started to show only in 2008-2009.

29.     On balance, while recognizing the importance of proposed reforms for improved
governance in the oil sector, better public investment performance and improved financial
discipline for private sector growth, this review reiterates the weak political ownership of
reforms during project implementation. The temporary loss of the reform momentum was
reversed only within the broad based joint effort to meet the triggers for the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Based on the above elements, this evaluation rates the
overall outcome achieved during the life period of RoC-ERC-II as unsatisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

30.     By January 2010, when the Republic of Congo accessed to debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), most risks to development
outcome have been mitigated through realized improvements in the transparency and
management in the oil sector, better selection and execution of public sector investment projects,
and settlement of domestic commercial arrears.

31.      Going forward, the risk of another discontinuation or reversal of institutional reforms
remains present and increases as government incentives to sustain and pursue difficult reforms
start to wane and the benefits of the recent HIPC debt relief disappear. In that context, the main
risks to development outcomes will continue to come from weak political ownership of difficult
institutional reforms and, to a lesser extent, from social pressures to maintain state jobs and
ANNEX B                                      76


public expenditures beyond the limits of sound fiscal sustainability. These risks are likely to
resurface faster in the presence of new macroeconomic difficulties triggered either by poor
economic performance or adverse exogenous shocks. Obviously, the best way to mitigate those
risks would be a decisive action to complete ongoing reforms and implement them with full
vigor. An important dimension would be wide ownership of reforms forged through continued
dialogue with key domestic and external stakeholders.

32.    Given that the reform agenda looms large in the areas of improved governance, public
(investment) resource management, and financial stability, the risk to development outcomes
remains significant.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

33.      Design. The RoC-ERC-II operation offered a clear definition of project objectives but
failed to provide a solid basis for effective M&E arrangements. The results matrix presented in
the project document (see World Bank 2005a, annex 3) did specify some elements of an M&E
design, but failed to identify a set of outcome indicators, baseline values, data sources, and
institutional responsibilities. Furthermore, the credit did not provide a results chain establishing
linkages between policy actions supported under the project and the achievement of longer-term
outcomes sought by Bank interventions.

34.     Implementation. Expectedly, partial specification of M&E design carried over to weak
M&E implementation arrangements. The credit document did not indicate which institutions on
the side of the Bank or the borrower will be responsible for the implementation M&E tasks, what
would be the logistical arrangements, and the calendar of M&E activities to gauge the progress
toward credit outcome.

35.     Use of Data. Not surprisingly, the information coming from inadequately designed and
poorly implemented M&E arrangements has not and could not be used in the credit
implementation. Despite multiple setbacks during credit implementation, there was no recorded
attempt to revisit the M&E arrangements and secure better monitoring of project outcomes.

36.    Overall, the PPAR rates the overall quality of monitoring and evaluation for this credit as
negligible.

BANK PERFORMANCE

37.     Quality at Entry. In designing the RoC-ERC-II operation, the Bank team focused on
three objectives from a wider list of reforms initiated in the first operation: (i) improved
transparency and the quality of management in the oil sector, (ii) greater efficiency in the
selection and execution of public investment projects, and (iii) resolution of domestic
commercial debt arrears. The credit proceeds (especially the first tranche) were needed to reduce
the financing gap associated with the economic program of the government agreed with the
donor community, and to enable an early access to HIPC resources made available upon
reaching the decision point. The credit objectives were relevant to the needs of the country and
fully consistent with the core reform agenda discussed with domestic stakeholders and the donor
community at that time.
                                               77                                                ANNEX B


38.     Despite significant streamlining and scaling down, the credit objectives remained
ambitious and exceeded the existing political commitment from the government and readiness of
domestic stakeholders. Lessons learned from the first operation (to aim for greater simplicity,
selectivity, and focus) were not sufficiently applied in the design of the second operation.
Limited results achieved in the implementation of RoC-ERC-I did not impart enough realism in
the design of the second operation.

39.     In the RoC-ERC-II operation, the Bank took into account experience from other post-
conflict countries and some of the lessons learned from the implementation of RoC-ERC-I,
especially regarding the need to reduce scope of the program and focus on fewer priority
reforms, and to keep the credit design simple and implementable in post-conflict circumstances.
The most important lesson coming out of RoC-ERC-I, emphasized in IEG‘s ICR Review as a
typical lesson for many post-conflict countries,27 was not sufficiently taken into account:
progress in the area with strong vested interests and complex political economy issues requires
prior consensus-building exercises. Otherwise, very valid objectives of improved governance,
better public resource management, and greater financial discipline may be stalled in mid-stream
compromising the credibility of the government and the Bank.

40.     A conscious choice to further pursue strategically important objectives of improving
governance in the oil sector, enhancing management of public (investment) resources, and
resolving large domestic arrears required much stronger preparation (including analytical work
and dialogue with key stakeholders), full institutional support, and adequate incentives.
Approximately half of the limited resources under RoC-ERC-II were disbursed upon
effectiveness with no strings attached. All essential reforms were back-loaded and attached as
conditionality for the release of the second tranche which never got disbursed. Faced with
declining political support for difficult reforms, the government opted for an easy way out by
delaying agreed actions and sacrificing the second tranche resources, with no consequences for
the HIPC process and only marginal impact on the combined resource transfer obtained through
the HIPC decision point.

41.      Notwithstanding substantial progress made in the achievement of objectives advanced by
RoC-ERC-II in the context of meeting requirements for the enhanced HIPC initiative completion
point, it must be emphasized that the second operation failed to: (i) furnish adequate preparation
of key institutional reforms (analytical work, stakeholder dialogue, and political economy
analysis); (ii) develop an appropriate results framework with clear monitoring and evaluation
arrangements; (iii) build critical capacity through timely and effective TA; and (iv) step-up
dialogue and advocacy in the country and among donors to mitigate possible obstacles to reforms
posed by vested interested.

42.   On that basis, IEG rates Bank‘s performance in securing the quality at entry of RoC-
ERC-II as unsatisfactory.

43.    Quality of Supervision: Implementation of RoC-ERC-II came at a time of change in the

and task manager, and the long hiatus in appointing the successors created a discontinuity in the
oversight of this operation. The Bank was slow in responding to government‘s requests, and
supervision missions were exceptionally infrequent. More frequent missions could have enabled
a better dialogue and early detection of problems (especially loss of reform momentum and
weakening ownership), secured greater borrower commitment, and identified appropriate
interlocutors to help identify and resolve outstanding issues that needed to be resolved. At times,
the policy dialogue became uneasy or became completely stuck over important reform issues,
with little or no innovative ideas to find solutions or overcome problems.

44.    Based on the above arguments, IEG rates Bank‘s performance in securing quality of
supervision as unsatisfactory. Overall Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

45.     Government Performance. The government‘s performance in implementing RoC-
ERC-II was inadequate. There was a lack of clarity in defining leadership for the reform
program supported under RoC-ERC-II and a dilution of responsibility in preparing and carrying
out the agreed policy actions and institutional reforms.

46.     First, there was an unplanned change in leadership. The minister of finance, who was the
main interlocutor for the project during preparation, was dismissed immediately after the credit
approval. The responsibility to shepherd difficult institutional reforms fell on a successor who
did not lead the credit negotiations and had to go through a steep learning curve before assuming
leadership in the implementation of the credit reform agenda. Second, there was a fair bit of
ambiguity regarding institutional responsibility and the ownership of reforms supported under
the credit. The presidency and a number of ministries (for planning, finance, forestry, oil, and
diamonds) each had a role to play in the credit implementation. In the presence of weak political
base for reforms supported under the credit, this ambiguity became a critical stumbling block for
continued project implementation. On that basis, this review rates government performance as
unsatisfactory.

47.     Implementing Agency Performance. The government appointed an existing committee
in the ministry of finance to be the implementing agency, along with a senior officer from the
ministry of finance to coordinate and supervise the implementation of the credit. Although the
committee was responsible for the implementation of economic reforms, the arrangement was
inadequate: the committee and the senior officer had a larger mandate and could not focus
enough attention on credit implementation, nor did they command sufficient resources and
logistics to secure adequate traction for the reforms that the credit supported. Cross ministerial
coordination was also a problem: the level of commitment and ownership in the line ministries
was relatively weak and the senior staff coordinator did not have sufficient authority to supervise
reforms in the line ministries responsible for the oil sector and public investment program.
Performance of the implementing agency is rated as unsatisfactory, with an overall rating of the
borrower performance of unsatisfactory.
