GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:           Government of Pakistan (GOP)
Implementing Agency: Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
Beneficiary:        WAPDA
Poverty:            Not applicable
Amount:             US$350.0 million
Terms:              Payable in 20 years, including five years grace, at the standard interest rate for LIBOR
-based US Dollar single currency loans.
Commitment Fee:     0.75% on undisbursed loan balance, beginning 60 days after signing, less any waiver
Onlending Terms:    The total loan would be onlent to WAPDA on the following terms: (a) during
construction period of the project, a variable rate equal to the sum of the prevailing
World Bank Lending Rate plus a spread of 150 basis points; (b) after completion of
construction, a variable rate equal to the sum of the prevailing World Bank Lending Rate
plus a spread of 350 basis points. The repayment period would be up to 23 years
including up to 8 years of grace period. WAPDA will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Proiect
Description:        The proposed project woulid comprise the construction of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower
Plant (GBHP), the consolidation of the power sector reform program, technical
assistance and training components. The GBHP aims at utilizing 76 meters of head
available in the Indus River between the tailrace of Tarbela power station and its
confluence with Haro River, and includes: (a) a barrage and ancillary works near Ghazi
village; (b) a 52-km long concrete-lined power channel and its ancillary works with a
capacity of 1,600 cumecs; (c) a power complex and ancillary works located near the
village of Barotha with an installed capacity of 1,450 MW to generate about 6,600 GWh
of electricity annually; (d) transmission facilities for power evacuation; and (e)
implementation of the Environmental Management and Resettlement Plans. The power
sector reform component includes in particular: (a) setting up of GBHP as a separate
project entity within the framework of the corporatization program of WAPDA; (b)
establishment of a separate transmission and dispatch corporate entity; and (c) review of
the Government's policy and package of incentives for private power investments. The
technical assistance and training components are mainly designed to assist WAPDA in
carrying out the Environmental Management and Resettlement Plans.
Benefits:           The Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost expansion plan for the
generation system in the country. It would promote the efficient development of
hydropower resources thereby reducing the dependence on imported petroleum products
and the chronic shortfall in electricity supply. The Economic Rate of Return on the
power investment program which includes the proposed project, is estimated at about
27%.



-ii-
Risks:              Risks which could affect the proposed project could relate to macroeconomic
performance of the country, uncertainty in the level of of private power supply and
project implementation. The broader macroeconomic risk of deterioration of the short-
term financial situation is mitigated by GOP's commitment to a sound fiscal and
monetary program supported by appropriate structural reform measures. The risk of
inconsistency between the macroeconomic framework and the increased level of Public
Sector Development Program resulting from the implementation of GBHP has been
mitigated by the provision of an annual review of WAPDA's investment program over a
five-year rolling period and the agreement that, during the implementation of GBHP,
GOP's Core Public Sector Development Program and its Social Action Program, would
not be adversely affected by the financing requirements of GBHP. The risk related to the
uncertainties in the level of private power supply has been mitigated by the agreement on
setting up policies and appropriate solicitation mechanism that would ensure timely
implementation of required additional capacity. The specific project implementation
risks have been also mitigated so that the probabilities of delay in project implementation
and cost overruns are considerably reduced. The non-mobilization of financmi risk has
been mitigated by the high priority given by GOP to the development of the project, thie
level and advanced status of commitments of different cofinanciers, and by the legal
agreements requiring WAPDA to generate local funds through improvement in efficiency
and satisfactory tariffs needed to enable it to comply with the financial covenants.
WAPDA's consistent record over the last seven years in meeting an ambitious cash
generation covenant provides additional comfort to the Project. Other major risks could
be caused by unsatisfactory resettlement, relocation and compensation of persons
affected by the project and delay in implementing steps identified to mitigate negative
environmental impacts.    These  risks  are  being  largely  mitigated  by  the
comprehensiveness of the Environment and Resettlement Management Plan and the
monitoring arrangements through: (a) setting a Project Information Center at project
site; (b) assistance of a Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization and of an independent
consultant for monitoring resettlement and relocation of project affected people and
implementation of environmental mitigation steps; (c) WAPDA's commitment to
implement an Integrated Regional Development Plan to support locally-based economic
activities in the area; and (d) continued support from the Independent Environment and
Resettlement Review Panel. To reduce risks of engineering nature, WAPDA will be
assisted by its consultant, and a panel of experts will monitor the activities periodically.
Further, geological and hydrological uncertainties are reduced to a minimum because of
the extensive investigations at the sites of the barrage, power chaniel and power house,
and the comprehensive knowledge gained in the construction and operation of Tarbela
Dam. Possible construction delays would be minimized by the advanced stage of the
procurement of major works, effective project management through WAPDA's internal
organization for the project and the assistance of its consultants.  To reduce delays
which could be caused by claims of the contractors, a Dispute Review Board is being
appointed to settle all claims as expeditiously as possible.

GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Overview
1.1   Since the late 1980s, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has been implementing a broad-
based macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform program, supported by the Bank and the
Fund, for improving growth performance and addressing extemal and internal imbalances. The
energy sector is critical to the achievement of these objectives, since it accounts for about 33% of
public investments. In this context, GOP has been pursuing, with Bank support, a far-reaching
policy reform program in the energy sector, aimed at strengthening the key institutions, enhancing
energy efficiency, developing measures for resource mobilization, and attracting private
investments. As a result, new institutions have been created to encourage the construction of
power plants by the private sector and promote energy conservation, important energy price
reforms have been introduced, some of the main institutions have been restructured, the
operational and financial performance of the sector has improved, while the first private power
generation project (Hub-1292 MW) is being implemented. Despite these efforts, the development
of the sector continues to be constrained by a lack of financial resources and insufficient
implementation capability, resulting in continued energy shortages that constrain economic
growth. Load shedding persists, and reached the level of 27% of peak demand in FY94, while the
gas supply shortfall reached 600 million cubic feet per day, or about 25% of demand, during the
winter of 1994.
1.2   Recognizing the need for accelerating the implementation of the reform program in the
sector, GOP has decided to complement and reinforce its policy reform program by adopting a
more comprehensive energy strategy. An Energy Task Force (ETF) was constituted in late 1993
to formulate this strategy. ETF's report confirmed the need for the restructuring and privatization
program for the power sector, and the setting up of an independent Regulatory Authority, as
outlined in a Strategic Plan approved by the Government in July 1992 (para 2.3). The ETF report
also formed the basis for a Policy Framework and Package of Incentives for Private Sector Power
Generation Projects, and a Petroleum Policy, both announced in March 1994. In March 1995,
GOP broadened its policy by introducing a package of incentives for private sector participation
in the main 500 kV transmission lines, and in hydropower projects off the Indus River. These
policy documents set out a vision of greater dependence on market forces and private sector
involvement, including restructuring and privatization of the public enterprises in the sector.
Further, these policies support the establishment of a consistent institutional and incentive
ftameworkfor promoting energy conservation and the use of alternative energy resources.
1.3   The 1994 Petroleum Policy deals with both upstream and downstream activities. It
provides for a reduction in GOP oversight and involvement in the sector, including a lower



-2-
mandatory participating interest for GOP in new concessions, elimination of the gas allocation
policy for new discoveries in high risk areas, elimination of discretionary discounts for the
producer price of domestic crude and natural gas, establishment of an independent Petroleum
Regulatory Board, and the privatization of most of the public enterprises in the sector. For the
major enterprises, several offers of strategic equity partnerships from foreign petroleum
companies have been received. However, GOP has opted for a transparent bidding process rather
than negotiated deals, and has appointed financial advisors to achieve this objective. The Policy
also enhances the incentives for gas exploration in the country, by linking the producer price to a
basket of crudes; provides additional fiscal incentives for oil and gas exploration and
development; and introduces specific incentives for private investment in petroleum infrastructure
projects (i.e. pipelines and storage facilities) and in new refineries. These initiatives have elicited a
positive response from private investors, in particular international oil companies. As a result, as
of end-1994, all the blocks of acreage offered for exploration by GOP have been awarded and
active discussions are ongoing with private sponsors for investments in downstream petroleum
facilities. The Government is now preparing, with Bank assistance, a new incentive package for
off-shore petroleum exploration in Pakistan and an international road show held in July 1995
promoting six offshore blocks has generated considerable interest from private investors. An 87
km. long pipeline is being built by a private company to supply fuel oil to Hub and other planned
power projects west of Karachi. A memorandum of understanding was recently signed between
GOP and a private international consortium for the construction of an oil pipeline linking Karachi
with major consumption centers up-country.
1.4  In the power sector, GOP has begun the implementation of a three-pronged strategy: (a)
restructuring and unbundling the activities of the power sector utilities, including gradual
divestiture of selected assets of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and
privatization of the Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation (KESC); (b) construction of all new
thermal power plants and the main 500 kV transmission lines by the private sector on a Build-
Own-Operate (BOO) and Build-Own-Maintain (BOM) basis, respectively; and (c) establishment
of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). GOP has been very active on
these fronts, and Chapter 2 gives the detail of progress made to-date.  In particular, an
amendment to the WAPDA Act was promulgated in 1994, to enable the sale of assets; a financial
advisor has been appointed for the sale of WAPDA's 1,600 MW Kot Addu thermal power plant,
preparatory work for the sale of KESC, the Jamshoro power plant (880 MW) and one distribution
Area Electricity Board (AEB) is underway; an ordinance creating NEPRA was promulgated in
January 1995, and staffing of NEPRA is underway.
1.5   With regard to the construction of new power generation plants by the private sector, the
new policy elicited an overwhelming response from both domestic and foreign investors. GOP is
negotiating security packages with sponsors of thirty-four different power plants with a potential
generating capacity of about 9,000 MW. In addition to the ongoing 1,292 MW Hub Power
Project, five other projects, with a total installed capacity of about 860MW (AES Pakistan
Limited (360 MW), Kohinoor (131 MW), Gull Ahmed (136 MW), Raiwind (117 MW) and
Tristar (120 MW)) reached financial closure in May, June, and October 1995, and at least four
other projects with a total capacity of about 1,000 MW are expected to reach financial closure
early 1996.

1.6   The Strategic Plan mentioned in para 1.2 calls for WAPDA to continue to own and
operate major hydropower projects in the Indus Basin, largely because of their importance for
irrigation. Within this framework, WAPDA will also continue to build selected new hydro-
electric plants that are part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector. The
proposed Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project (GBHP) will produce electricity at a lower cost
than the available alternatives, (see Chapter 8). The option of inviting the private sector to
implement GBHP on a BOO/BOT basis was reviewed during the final preparation stage.
However, for reasons explained in para. 4.4, it was concluded that this would not be feasible. The
Bank has been closely involved in Pakistan's power sector reforms and has supported these
reforms through adjustment operations, regular investment loans for public sector projects and
loans and guarantees for private sector generating projects. Bank support for Ghazi Barotha is
linked with further progress on the power sector reform program. Thus, the proposed operation
is consistent with the Bank's lending policy in the sector.
Institutional Settin2
1.7   The responsibility for the energy sector is shared by four ministries: the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR), the Ministry of Planning and Development, the
Ministry of Water and Power (MWP), and the Ministry of Production (MOP). A high-level
Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCE), chaired by the Prime Minister, is responsible for the review
and approval of all plans, policies and projects in the energy sector, while the implementation of
the approved projects is assigned to the respective ministries and entities. An Energy Review
Group provides coordination among the entities and ministries and monitors the progress of
ongoing projects, programs, policy actions and issues. In addition, the Environment and Urban
Affairs Division (EUAD), Ministry of Environment and Urban Affairs, is responsible for
formulating and monitoring the implementation of GOP's environmental policies, including those
for the energy sector
1.8   The management of day-to-day operations in the energy sector is vested in a number of
public and private sector entities. The public sector entities are: (a) the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA), which is responsible for developing Pakistan's water
resources and for the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission
and distribution facilities throughout the country, except the Karachi area; (b) the Oil and Gas
Development Corporation (OGDC) for exploration and development of oil and gas; (c) the
Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, for the exploration and development of mineral
resources; and (d) the State Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Corporation which owns the
National Refinery Limited (NRL), for processing crude oil. Also involved in the energy sector are
a number of semi-autonomous entities in which GOP has a controlling interest either directly or
through public institutions. These are: (a) Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC), which is
responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission
and distribution facilities in the Karachi area; (b) Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) and
Sui Southern Gas Corporation (SSGC), responsible for the transmission and distribution of
natural gas and which are in the process of being privatized; (c) two independent gas transmission
networks which supply natural gas to WAPDA's Guddu power station and to three fertilizer
plants; and (d) Pakistan State Oil Limited (PSO) responsible for marketing and distribution of
petroleum products. Private sector entities include a large number of Pakistani coal mining



-4-
companies; two refineries; two companies for marketing and distribution of petroleum products,
and a number of oil and gas development companies. MWP has jurisdiction over WAPDA and
KESC, and MOP over NRL and Pakistan Refinery Ltd. (PRL). All other operational entities
(public and semi-autonomous) are under the jurisdiction of MPNR. The list of private sector
entities will be enlarged starting June 1996 by private power generation companies which are in
the process of implementing their respective facilities.
Institutional Development
1.9   The 1994 Policies call for a redefinition of the role of the public sector in the energy
sector. Through the restructuring and privatization of the main public sector entities, and the
establishment of a transparent regulatory framework, the Government's role will be reduced. As
policy maker, the Government will be primarily responsible for monitoring the development of the
sector and, if necessary, introduce the corrective measures required to set the sector on its growth
path. Thus, under the 1994 Petroleum Policy, GOP would create a holding company to handle
the Government's participating interests in concessions so as to better separate the regulatory and
ownership functions of GOP. Furthermore, GOP announced that it would privatize OGDC,
SNGPL, SSGC, and the Pak-Arab Refinery, Ltd. Progress is being made and it is expected that
SNGPL and SSGC would be privatized by June 30, 1996. Plans for the privatization of OGDC
and the other petroleum entities in the public sector are actively being pursued. The institutional
development aspects of the power sector is discussed in Chapter 2.
Ener2v Resource Endowment
1.10  Pakistan's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of hydropower, natural gas,
oil and coal. In addition, the country has a large base of traditional fuels in the form of fuelwood
and agricultural and animal waste, which provide a major share of rural consumers' energy needs.
Despite its endowment of energy resources, Pakistan's dependence on energy imports has been
higher than envisaged by GOP in the previous five-year plans, principally due to financial and
implementation constraints.
1.11  The hydropower potential in Pakistan is estimated at about 27,000 MW under average
hydrological conditions. As of December 1994, only about 4,825 MW (18%) of this capacity was
developed or committed. A large number of medium and large sized hydroelectric projects have
been proposed and studied to varying levels of detail. In particular, detailed engineering studies
have been completed for Kalabagh hydropower project (3,600 MW), while steps are being taken
to initiate the feasibility study for Basha hydro project (3,300 MW). Kalabagh studies were
completed in 1985. However, the project could not be processed further because of provincial
differences, its very large financing requirement, and the wide scope of its environmental and
resettlement impacts. With the assistance of GTZ (the German Agency for Technical
Cooperation), preparatory work has been initiated for the identification and feasibility studies of
several medium-size hydel projects in the northern part of the country; these schemes have been
analyzed in para 8.12.
1.12  In the oil subsector, the remaining recoverable reserves amount to about 27 million tons of
oil equivalent (TOE) as against the original estimate of 64.5 million TOE. Pakistan's major oil
fields (Dhurnal, Dhulian, Balkassar and Meyal) have largely been exploited, with domestic oil



-5-
production having increased from 39,300 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) in FY86 to about 57,000
BOPD in FY94, resulting in a reserves to production ratio of only nine years. With a view to
improve the incentives for additional exploration activity, and offset the declining reserves to
production ratio, the package of reforms announced in the 1994 Petroleum Policy (para 1.3)
includes more expeditious procedures for awarding exploration licenses, the elimination of the
discount mechanism for producer price of oil, and the deferment of duties on imported equipment
for exploration activities to the production phase.
1.13  Pakistan has proven recoverable gas reserves estimated at 23 trillion cubic feet (TCF)
(including 0.3 TCF of associated gas reserves) of which 9.6 TCF were discovered during the last
5 years, mainly through the new fields at Qadirpur (3.9 TCF) and Kadanwari (1 TCF). The
Kadanwari gas field came on stream in May 1995 with an initial production of 80 MMCFD of
gas. Over the same period, gas production has also increased from about 1.0 billion cubic feet per
day (BCFD) in FY86 to about 1.7 BCFD in FY94. Despite the recent discoveries, gas
exploration has proceeded at a slower rate of development than the resources warrant, in part due
to the generally limited interest by the oil industry in gas exploration. To address this issue, the
1994 Petroleum Policy, in addition to the above-mentioned reforms common for oil and gas,
introduces additional incentives for enhancing gas exploration and development.
1.14  Domestic proven reserves of coal and lignite in established fields are estimated at about
600 million tons, of which about 360 million tons are recoverable; in addition, reserves amounting
to 475 million tons (of which about 285 million tons are recoverable) have been confirmed at the
recently discovered Thar coal field in the lower part of Sindh. However, the economic viability of
coal production from the Thar deposits still remain to be established. The quality of domestic
coal is generally poor, requiring fluidized-bed technology if utilized for power generation. Thus,
in FY94, production was only 3.5 million tons, of which 43,600 tons were used for generating
about 44 GWh of electricity.
1.15  In addition to hydropower (para 1.11), most of the balance of the renewable energy is
obtained by direct burning of biomass, while the use of solar energy and biogas remains
insignificant.  Given that the household sector accounts for over 80%  of the biomass
consumption, and in face of the rapid increase of the population, a greater pressure on the already
dwindling stock of the country's forest resources as well as other forms of biomass is expected.
Reliable statistics on the use of renewable energy have been developed under the recently
completed Household Energy Strategy Study carried out by GOP in collaboration with the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).
EnerLv Demand and Supplv
1.16  Pakistan's consumption of commercial energy increased between FY83 and FY94 at an
average annual rate of about 6.1%, from 11.3 million TOE to 20.4 million TOE. This was due
mainly to: (a) the growth of the economy of 5.7% p.a.; (b) increasing access to commercial
energy resources by the population; (c) the modernization of the agriculture activities; and (d) the
increasing pace of industrialization (industrial production increased during the period at 7.1% p.a.,
compared to 3.8% p.a. of the agriculture sector). In FY94, the pattern of commercial energy
consumption was: 38.8% industrial, 33.1% transport, 18.6% residential, 3.9% agriculture, 6%
others, as shown in Figure la below:

1.17 Due to supply constraints, the share of gas in Pakistan's primary energy balance fell from
43.6% in FY83 to 37.8% in FY94. Over the same period, hydropower generation and coal
production roughly maintained their shares and, consequently, the consumption of oil and
petroleum products grew rapidly and their share expanded from 34.1% to 40.9%. However,
despite the sharp rise in domestic crude production (17.7% p.a.) three-quarters of the increased
consumption of crude oil and petroleum products were met through imports. Because of
inadequate incentives, domestic refinery capacity expanded only slowly and the bulk of fuel
imports were in the form of refined products. The Energy Balance for FY94 is presented in
Annex 1.1.
Enerzv Demand Forecast
1.18 The forecast of unconstrained commercial energy demand (recently finalized by the
Energy Wing in the Ministry of Planning and Development in collaboration with the Bank), calls
for an annual increase of about 6.7% up to FY2008. The forecast is based on a regression
analysis of past consumption trends and relationships, and assumes the implementation of an
aggressive program of energy conservation and efficiency. These projections are also in line with
recent trends towards decreasing overall elasticity of energy consumption to econornic growth
from 1.10 in the period FY83-93 to 1.03 between FY93-2008.
Enerev Supply Forecast
1.19  In order to meet the projected demand at least cost, the supply of domestic energy
resources is forecast to increase in absolute terms (although its share in total energy supply is
expected to decrease from 68% in FY93 to about 62% in FY2003). However, despite the
implementation of the proposed project, the share of hydro-electricity in total energy supply
would decline from the present level of 15% to 12% in FY2003. The share of the largely
imported oil and petroleum products is expected to rise from the present level of 34% to 44% of
total energy supply in FY2003. This share could be reduced by substantially expanding the supply
of gas either through development of new gas fields, and matching investments in the pipeline
infrastructure, or gas imports by pipeline. Studies to determine the most economical options for
increasing the supply of gas has been recently completed by ESMAP and in the Energy Options
Study (para 1.28). These studies concluded that the likely gas supply shortfall in the country



-8-
could be sufficient to absorb economic supplies of natural gas which may be made available from
increased levels of domestic production in the short to medium term, and from a major gas
importation project in the longer term. In the absence of such an increase in supply, the share of
gas may decline from 38% to as little as 24%. Under this assumption, the share of imported
petroleum products in total energy supply would further increase from its current level of 34% in
FY94 to 58% in FY2003, to substitute mainly for the use of natural gas in thermal power
generation, and in the industrial sector.
Enerfy Prices
1.20 The Government has been gradually liberalizing energy prices, and generally moving
towards more market-oriented and transparent pricing regimes. The 1994 Petroleum Policy
introduced a more attractive market-based reference price for determining the domestic producer
price of natural gas, and eliminated the discretionary discount applied by GOP on the border price
of crude, for determining the producer price of domestically produced crude oil. These reforms
have also rectified other anomalies in the producer pricing formula. As a result, producer prices
for domestically produced crude continue to be pegged to international prices of crude, while the
natural gas producer price is now indexed to the international price of a basket of crude oil.
Refinery prices are directly linked to international market prices.
1.21  Consumer prices of petroleum products and natural gas have been periodically adjusted in
line with movements in world market prices. As a result of the price increase of 5% introduced in
the FY96 budget, consumer prices for petroleum products, with the exception of fuel oil, are
currently at or above the corresponding import prices, adjusted for inland transportation and
distribution margins (see Annex 1.2). On average, during FYs88-95, prices of motor gasoline
have been raised by about 10% per annum, kerosene 11% per annum, diesel 7.8% per annum, and
fuel oil 6% per annum. Consumer prices of natural gas were also increased by about 25% as part
of the FY96 budget. As a result, gas prices for the general industry, cement, power (including
raw gas tariffs) and commercial sectors are at parity or above the domestic price of fuel oil.
Despite their recent increase, gas tariffs for residential consumers are at about 80% of the border
price of fuel oil, due to the upward trend in international prices. Natural gas prices have been
raised by 8.6% per annum for industrial and commercial sectors, about 12% per annum for the
high consumption slabs of residential consumers, and 6.5% per annum for the low consumption
residential slab during the same period. Annexes 1.3 give a detailed breakdown of gas tariffs
compared to domestic and international prices of fuel oil. Electricity tariffs including the Fuel
Adjustment Surcharge have been increased regularly, to enable WAPDA to finance at least 40%
of its average investment program through internal cash generation. As a result, the average
electricity tariff has risen from about Rs 0.64/kWh in FY85, to Rs 2.24/kWh in FY96 (para 2.18).
Environment and Ener2 Conservation
1.22  Responsibility for environmental protection in the energy sector in Pakistan is vested in the
Environment and Urban Affairs Division (EUAD).  The framework for the country's
environmental protection was established in 1983, when the Pakistan Environmental Protection
Ordinance was promulgated. Subsequently, EUAD prepared guidelines for environmental impact
statements for energy-producing activities, and has notified the standards for protection against
air and water pollution. The Ministry of Labor is developing improved health, safety and



-9-
emergency management standards for surface and underground coal mining activities.  In
addition, programs to strengthen the environmental management capabilities of OGDC and
WAPDA are being supported through existing Bank operations.' The Directorate General,
Petroleum Concessions in the MPNR is preparing, with Bank assistance, guidelines for
environmental management and operational safety for petroleum exploration and production in
the country. These efforts will be continued under the proposed project and with the assistance of
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
1.23  In 1992, the Government approved a comprehensive National Conservation Strategy
(NCS)2, prepared with the assistance of CIDA, UNDP and the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The NCS sets out the Government's
priority objectives and plans for promoting effective environmental and natural resource
management. The NCS proposes to achieve these objectives through a broad-based program
which is directed towards encouraging greater public participation in development and
environmental management; merging environment and economic decision making; and promoting
sustainable improvements in the quality of life.
1.24   As regards energy conservation, the National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON)
has, in accordance with its mandate, initiated information and outreach programs for enhancing
awareness about energy conservation prospects; assisted in policy formulation and planning;
developed investment projects and proposals for the promotion of energy conservation activities;
and implemented pilot programs aimed at demonstrating the viability and benefits of such
activities.   The major activities completed to date include: (a) a draft National Energy
Conservation Law and a National Building Energy Code; (b) detailed energy audits for 59 large
industrial plants which have identified possible savings of 22% on average; (c) pilot tune-up
programs for industrial boilers and automobiles, and retrofitting of tubewells; and (d) training
programs for private and public sector managers, engineers and technicians. A proposed Energy
Efficiency and Conservation Project, tentatively scheduled for FY97, would focus on the
implementation of a comprehensive demand-side management program and activities in energy
efficiency and conservation.

centrally, the main entities are publicly owned, the prices are set by administrative fiat, and the
key concern is to expand supply, to a situation where the Government focuses on policy
formulation, private sector owns most of the assets and operates within a transparent regulatory
framework, most prices are set by competitive market forces, and proper incentives are provided
for energy conservation and development of domestic energy resources. The concrete actions to
implement this vision - most of which are already underway - include: (a) accelerate the ongoing
restructuring and privatization of WAPDA, (b) complete the already initiated privatization of
KESC, SNGPL, and SSGC, (c) extend the privatization program to the other major parastatals in
the energy sector, i.e., PSO, OGDC and NRL; (d) further increase private sector involvement in
power generation and transmission, oil and gas exploration, production and distribution through
an internationally-competitive package for attracting local and foreign investors; (e) enhance
domestic resource mobilization for energy projects through further capital market reforms; (f)
establish a transparent regulatory framework for the power sector as well as the petroleum sector;
(g) restrain energy demand growth, by introducing incentives for energy conservation; (h) reduce
losses in transmission and distribution; (i) further develop domestic energy resources at least-cost;
and (j) improve the operational efficiency of the energy enterprises that will remain in the public
sector.
1.26   The Bank's Assistance Strategy is geared to supporting the Government's strategy outlined
above and is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) being discussed along
with this project. In particular, the Bank's strategy is to pursue the "unbundling" of various
energy sub-sectors in order to maximize competition and to bring in private sector management
skills and financing. This strategy comprises six basic elements:
(a)    provide direct support for the privatization of the key utilities (with emphasis
placed on creation of competitive market structures where feasible);
(b)    encourage the mobilization of private sector resources through Bank lending and
guarantees for energy and other infrastructure projects;
(c)    establish appropriate - and stable - regulatory frameworks to both reduce risks for
private operators and protect the consumers against potential monopolistic
practices by private operators;
(d)   rationalize pricing structures to enhance resource mobilization and ensure that the
final costs of providing appropriate incentives to private firms is borne by the
consumers and not funded through the Government's budget;
(e)    continue institutional and financial support for the key agencies that will remain in
the public sector; and
(f)    help create and implement a consistent institutional and incentive framework for
promoting energy conservation and use of alternative energy resources.
1.27   Since the mid-1980s, the Bank has been deeply involved in Pakistan's energy sector
reforms through both policy advice and lending. The Bank was instrumental in developing the
legal and institutional framework for private investments in generation and transmission, and



-11-
is strongly supporting the creation of NEPRA and the divestiture of WAPDA's thermal
generation and distribution facilities. Past lending aimed also at improving economic efficiency
and financial sustainability in the sector by encouraging least-cost planning and tariff setting to
provide adequate levels of self-financing, ensuring compliance with international environment
standards and strengthening implementation capability. The Bank's future lending program will
further develop and enhance economic efficiency and the participation of private investors. The
proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project would strengthen Pakistan's demand-side
management and energy conservation program (para 1.24). A proposed Hydrocracker Project to
increase production of high-value petroleum products is being developed by a joint venture in
which the private sector holds the controlling interest. Other projects would support additional
private sector investments and the restructuring and privatization of public sector enterprises,
including the Bank's proposed guarantee for the Uch Power Company, and the planned Third
Private Sector Energy Development Project. To complement private sector investment in energy
projects, long-term domestic resources need to be made available in the sector. To this end, the
Bank is executing a study to review long-term domestic resource mobilization options and capital
market reforms (para 7.5). Finally, the proposed project is consistent with the Government's
policy framework for the sector, which envisages decentralization and deregulation of operational
responsibilities, improvement of efficiency, and development of domestic energy resources at
least-cost to reduce shortfalls of energy supply.
1.28  The Bank has also assisted the Government in (a) identifying the expected shortfall
between energy demand and supply, and evaluating the options available to GOP for enhancing
supplies; (b) assessing the effectiveness of the Government's strategy for promoting the necessary
levels of investments; and (c) outlining the remaining agenda of policy reforms which would
complement the ongoing reform program, and set the energy sector on the required growth path.
An Energy Options Study,' concluded that energy demand growth is expected to remain strong -
about 7% per annum between 1994-2018, and ensuring adequate expansion of energy supplies
will entail substantially higher levels of investments than in the past. In order to ensure adequate
investments for expanding energy supplies, while at the same time maintaining macroeconomic
stability, a number of policy responses should be considered by the Government: (a) more
aggressive efforts to curtail demand growth through appropriate price increases (aimed at raising
the level of energy prices while reducing cross-subsidies for residential and agricultural
consumers), and the elimination of tax exemptions; the latter would also mobilize additional
resources for investments in the energy sector; (b) introduction of more state-of-the-art
operations, maintenance and management practices to enhance the operational performance and
efficiency of existing assets; (c) better phasing of the required investments so as to mitigate their
adverse fiscal and balance of payments effects; and (d) targeting of the increased energy supplies
largely towards the productive sectors, particularly export-oriented activities, in order to ensure
sustainability in the balance of payments and prevent a deterioration in creditworthiness ratios.
The proposed project will assist GOP in achieving some of these policy measures.

2.   THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Back2round
2.1   The responsibility for power supply in Pakistan is currently shared between WAPDA and
KESC   WAPDA supplies power to the whole country except the Karachi area, which is served
by KESC. The WAPDA and KESC systems are integrated through a 220-kV double circuit
transmission line. As of December 1994, the power system included 10,675 MW of generating
capacity in the WAPDA system (of which 4825 MW is hydel), 1738 MW generating capacity
under KESC (all thermal), and a nuclear power plant (137 MW) connected to the KESC system.
The system serves about 10 million consumers, in the following main categories: about 7.9 million
residential, 1.5 million commercial, 200 thousand industrial, and about 160 thousand agricultural
consumers. WAPDA accounts for about 84% of the total installed capacity of 12,550 MW, while
supplying about 80% of the country's electricity consumption. A description of the existing
WAPDA system is provided in para 3.10.
Power Sector Reforms - Recent Developments
2.2   As indicated earlier, GOP has been pursuing a far-reaching privatization and reform
program for the power sector. Initiated in 1988, with the 1,292 MW Hub Power Project under a
BOO scheme, GOP's commitment to the reform policy was further strengthened in July 1992
with the approval of the Strategic Plan for the Privatization of the Pakistan Power Sector. In
March 1994 and 1995, the reform program was strengthened with the announcement of a new
policy framework providing internationally attractive incentives for private investors in thermal
power generation, and in hydropower generation off the Indus River and 500 kV transmission
lines. The Bank is assisting GOP in implementing this reform program through policy advice and
three operations: the Private Sector Energy Development Projects (PSEDP) I and II approved in
1988 and 1994 (Ln. 2982-PAK and Ln. 3812-PAK), and the Power Sector Development Project
(PSDP) (Ln. 3764-PAK) approved in June 1994. The proposed project will further enhance
Bank's assistance in this reform program.
2.3   The Strategic Plan envisages a gradual transition of the power system from integrated,
state owned utilities to a decentralized system with substantial private ownership and
management, and reflecting a commercial and competitive operating environment. In particular,
WAPDA would be reorganized as a holding company with independent subsidiaries for the
thermal and hydel generation, transmission and despatch, and distribution operations.  The
thermal and distribution subsidiaries would be gradually offered for sale to the private sector.
Each subsidiary would be established as a company under the 1984 Companies Ordinance, with
its own Board of Directors and management; preparation of independent year-end financial
statements, evaluation of management performance, and accountability to owners/shareholders.
At the same time, new thermal projects would be implemented only by the private sector. The
power system, upon completion of the transition, would thus comprise a number of privately-
I     Private power generation will enter into the system starting June 1996.



-13-
owned generation companies operating under free market competition; an independent, regulated
transmission and despatch entity responsible for the integrated operation of the system and for the
wholesale power market; publicly-owned, corporatized entities for the operation of multipurpose
hydel facilities; and private companies responsible for supplying electricity to the final consumers,
including socially desirable subsidized services, with GOP bearing the cost of such services
through transparent and explicit transfers from the budget. The Strategic Plan also provides for
the establishment of an independent National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to
set standards and regulate a gradually privately-operated power sector. The PSDP is assisting
GOP and WAPDA in setting the stage for this gradual restructuring and privatization program.
2.4    While the Strategic Plan deals mainly with the restructuring and privatization of WAPDA
(the dominant public utility in the sector), the March 1994 and 1995 policy frameworks are
oriented towards implementation of new power generation and transmission system under
BOO/BOM schemes in the private sector. These policies provide attractive incentives to private
investors and establish a streamlined "one window" approval process, based on the experiences
gained through the prolonged process of negotiations preceding financial closure of the Hub
Power Project. Box 1 presents a summary of the Incentives Package.
Incentives for Private Power Generation Proiects in Pakistan
|   Bulk tariff of US cents 6.5/kWh (to be paid in Pakistan Rupees) for the sale of electricity to
WAPDA/KESC, with indexation mechanism for fuel prices, US and Pakistani inflation, exchange rate
fluctuations, 0 & M costs, etc.
*  Fiscal incentives consisting of exemption from corporate income tax, customs duties, sales tax, lqra,
and other surcharges on imported equipment.
*  Standardized security package which includes a model Implementation Agreement, Power Purchase
Agreement and Fuel Supply Agreement.
* Creation of a Private Power and Infrastructure Board, so as to facilitate a one-window operation.
*  Fiscal incentive to facilitate the creation of a corporate securities market in the country, including
permission for power generation companies to issue corporate bonds and shares at discounted prices,
and establishment of an independent rating agency.
2.5    Major actions taken todate by GOP and WAPDA towards the implementation of the
reform program are summarized below:
(a)    an amendment to the WAPDA Act was promulgated in April 1994, enabling
WAPDA to be corporatized and divest selected parts of its assets;
(b)   following this amendment, the Government finalized in early 1995 and with the
assistance of a reputable international financial advisory firm, the short list of
potential investors for the Kot Addu power station (1,600 MW). Bids from those



-14-
2
investors are expected shortly.  As a second step, GOP also initiated the due
diligence required to proceed with the privatization of the 880 MW Jamshoro
power station, and for the Faisalabad Distribution Area Electricity Board;
(c)    an Ordinance was promulgated in January 1995 for establishing NEPRA. As
provided for under the Ordinance, Provincial Governments have been requested to
submit their nominations for the Members of the Authority3, and the Chairman of
NEPRA was appointed in September 1995;
(d)    a tariff policy and administration study which would establish the commercial
pricing principles for electricity, in support of GOP's privatization strategy, is
underway, and its recommendations are expected to be formulated by January
1996 and their implementation thereafter;
(e)    a  manpower  transition  program   study  is  being  initiated  to  provide
recommendations which would allow the privatization of the power sector to
occur in a manner that addresses the concerns of labor and the purchaser,
(f)   the restructuring program for WAPDA has been launched; accounting systems in
line with the cost profit centers objective have been designed and their
implementation initiated; and the process of appointing consultants for preparing
and implementing the corporatization of WAPDA's existing assets started. This
includes the preparation of the legal framework, management structure along
cost/profit center lines and staffing plans, as well as computerized management
information systems (covering, among others, accounting and finance, operations,
personnel, materials management etc.), and operational and financial performance
criteria for the corporate entities;
(g)   the first major private generation project, the 1,292 MW  Hub Power Project is
under implementation, and the commissioning of the first unit is expected by June
30, 1996; and
(h)    as a result of GOP's incentives packages of 1994 and 1995, GOP has received
proposals exceeding 25,000 MW for new power generation projects and for its
transmission projects. GOP has so far issued letters of support (LOSs) and is
negotiating the security packages with sponsors of thirty-four different power
plants with a potential generating capacity of about 9000 MW. Out of these, five
projects, with an estimated total installed capacity of about 860MW, have reached
financial closure, and projects for about 1,000 MW are expected to reach financial
closure early 1996.
2     The process of sale of Kot Addu was delayed due to labor issues which have been resolved lately. Financial
closure is expected by early 1996.
3     Two out of four Provinces noninated already their Members.



-15-
2.6   The above overall progress on the various aspects of the reform program is encouraging
and illustrates GOP's commitment. However this reform program will take time to be fully
implemented, as it has been the case in other reforming countries. While recognizing this fact, and
putting in place required measures to address the main issues, the need for accelerating the pace
of its implementation remains critical for an optimal and efficient development of the sector and
its positive impact on the growth of the economy. The proposed project would assist GOP and
WAPDA in achieving this objective.
The Power Market
2.7   The electricity market has grown at a very rapid pace over the past two decades.
Consumption of electricity increased from 6,097 GWh in FY73 to 38,218 GWh in FY94, at an
annual average rate of growth of 9.1%, while real GDP growth rate averaged 5.7% p.a., showing
an elasticity ratio of 1.6. Over the years, the domestic sector has emerged as a major electricity
consumer, accounting for 37% of total consumption in FY94, compared to 11.7% in FY73,
together with the industrial sector whose share has declined from 50.1% in FY73 to 39% in
FY94. During the same period, the agricultural and commercial sectors have decreased their
share in the overall consumption. The impressive growth of the domestic consumption has been
caused by a five-fold increase in the number of connected households, equivalent to an average of
over 380,000 new customers per year. Despite this progress, only about half of Pakistan's
population of about 121 million, have access to electricity service, and the per capita electricity
consumption (about 300 kWh) remains low both in absolute terms and in comparison with
countries at a similar level of development.4
2.8   The country has been experiencing wide-spread power shortages, principally due to
insufficient power facilities (generation, secondary transmission and distribution systems), coupled
with variations in hydro flows and irrigation constraints. In FY94, power shortages reached a
level of about 27% of peak demand (Annex 2.1) and estimates of the overall impact of load-
shedding on the economy amount to about US$950 million. The proposed project would assist in
gradually reducing the power supply/demand gap.
Electricity Demand Forecast
2.9   The electricity demand forecast through FY2020 has recently been finalized by WAPDA
and reviewed by the Bank. The forecast is based on a regression analysis of past trends of the
demand for electricity in Pakistan, and assumes as independent variables (a) the level of income;
(b) electricity price; (c) price of alternate fuels; and (d) load-shedding. Three scenarios regarding
macroeconomic performance and income growth were used for the analysis: (a) a High Scenario,
which assumes full implementation and further deepening of the macroeconomic reform program,
and is consistent with overall GDP growth of 6.2% per annum up to FY2002 and 7% per annum
over the FY2002 to FY2020 period; (b) a Base Scenario, assuming a partial, and slower
implementation of reforms, with a GDP growth of 5.3% and 5.6% per annum over the same
4     In 1990, the average electricity consumption per capita for the Asia region as a whole, was about 1,235
kWh.



-16-
periods as above; and (c) a Low Scenario, which is based on little reforms, along with external
difficulties, and assumes an overall GDP growth rate of 4.5% per annum over the entire period
(FY94-2020). Because the historic load-shedding estimates were included in the data base, the
resulting forecast provides a reasonable approximation of unconstrained electricity demand. The
introduction of load management and conservation measures (Annex 2.2), including a gradual
increase in the tariffs to move closer to the economic cost of supply, consistent with the
provisions discussed in para 2.19, was then included in the model.
2.10  The resulting electricity demand under the Base Scenario is projected to increase at an
average annual rate of 7.9% over the FY94 to FY2002 period, implying a decline in the level of
losses from about 23.3% in FY93 to 18.5% by FY2000; and 6.5% over the FY2002 to FY2020
period. The growth rates become 9.6% and 8.4% for the High Scenario and 5.8% and 4.8% for
the Low Scenario respectively. Annexes 2.3 and 2.4 summarize historical statistics of WAPDA
system, and the results of the demand projections respectively.
Power DeveloDpment Plan
2.11  In order to meet the electricity requirements estimated under the Base Scenario,
additional generation capacity of about 9,770 MW needs to be installed in the power system by
FY2002. As detailed in Annex 2.5, of this installed capacity, 1,830 MW relate to ongoing
projects in the public sector to be commissioned by FY98, and 1,290 MW is under
implementation by the private sector for the Hub Power project. Of the remaining 6,650 MW,
1,450 MW relate to Ghazi Barotha, and 5,200 MW relate to new thermal power plants to be
implemented by the private sector. Under the Low Scenario, the required additional thermal
generating capacity by the private sector is 3,100 MW by FY2002, while under the High
Scenario, it is 7,200 MW. Table 2.1 below summarizes the growth rates and the required private
generating capacities.
Table 2.1: GROWTH RATES AND REQUIRED PRIVATE GENERATING CAPACITIES
GDP Growth       Electricity Demand Growth   Level of New Private
Power Plants
FY1994-2002  FY2002-2020  FY1994-2002  FY2002-2020   Required Capacity in
Low Demand Scenario  4.5%      4.5%       5.8%       4.8%          3,100
Base Demand Scenaro  5.3%      5.6%       7.9%       6.5%          5,200
High Demand Scenario    6.2%   7.0%       9.6%       8.4%          7,200
2.12  As stated in para 2.5, the private sector, has shown an overwhelming response to the
incentives introduced by the 1994 Policy. In particular, the Government received private sector
project proposals for about 25,000 MW, and has limited the issuance of letters of support (LOSs)
to 34 projects for about 9,000 MW. However, given the limited amount of debt financing
available for Pakistan, the credit ceiling of Export Credit Agencies and multilateral institutions, it
is likely that only half at most of the projects for which a LOS has been issued will be able to
materialize. In particular, given the results of a recent assessment of the financial and technical



-17-
strengths of several sponsors, only a few projects amounting to about 1700 MW are expected to
be commissioned by end-1997.
2.13  At present, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the required level for thermal
generation from private plants, with the estimates of additional capacity needed by the year 2002
ranging from 3,100 MW to 7,200 MW, in addition to the proposed GBHP whose energy is
significantly less costly than that of private thermal projects (Chapter 8). An over capacity would
impose a heavy financial cost on WAPDA and its consumers, and strain Pakistan's balance of
payment situation while an under-capacity would lead to continued high economic costs
associated with power shortages and load shedding. Thus, it is essential that the Government
carefully matches the sanctioning of new private power plants with the anticipated growth of
demand in order to ensure commissioning of the "right amount" of power supply at the "right
time." Fortunately, thermal power plants have relatively short construction periods (three years
or less) and new plants can be solicited and approved as the demand forecast is firmed up over
time. Therefore, during negotiations, the Government agreed to introduce not later than
December 31, 1996 a set of policies, including an appropriate solicitation mechanism,
satisfactory to the Bank, in order to ensure that the required power supply capacity will be
implemented in a timely manner (para 9.2).
2.14  The power sector investment program (including Ghazi Barotha) up to year 2002 would
amount to about Rs 406 billion, of which Rs 161 billion represents private investments, and Rs
245 billion represents investments by the public sector (WAPDA and KESC). The level of public
investments, of which Ghazi Barotha represents about 30%, would rise to an average of Rs 33
billion per annum during FYs96-98 (when implementation of Ghazi Barotha is at its peak) before
declining gradually to about Rs 23 billion by FY2002. By contrast, private investments (other
than for the already-committed Hub Power Project) are expected to escalate from about Rs 24
billion in FY96 to an average of around Rs 30 billion per annum during FYs98-99.
Demand-Side Manaeement (DSM)
2.15 WAPDA, through its Energy and Load Management Cell, and in collaboration with
ENERCON, is actively pursuing load management measures. They include: non-operation of
Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) tubewells during peak hours, staggering of
weekly holidays, voluntary 25% reduction of the load by continuous process industries and textile
mills and stoppage of steel melting furnaces during peak hours. Under the ongoing Rural
Electrification (RE) Project (Ln. 3148-PAKJCr. 2078-PAK), WAPDA is implementing a program
among 15,000 tubewells to control and restrict tubewell operations through ripple control, time
switches and splitting and controlling residential and tubewell load in phases. Also under the RE
Project, WAPDA has completed the installation of about 280 time-of-day (TOD) meters, and
plans to procure an additional 1,000 TOD meters for the largest industrial consumers. With the
assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a power factor improvement program has
been initiated by ENERCON in collaboration with WAPDA. In addition, WAPDA conducts
energy audit reviews in all sectors of the economy, with particular emphasis on the industrial
sector.



-18-
2.16  The new energy policy calls for a more aggressive approach to DSM. In particular, the
following measures are being undertaken: (a) extension of peak/off-peak pricing to the remaining
industrial consumers, and to large commercial and residential customers, and seasonal shift
incentives for industrial consumers; (b) restriction of peak supply for agricultural tubewells (no
supply during evening peak hours) through the ripple control system and extension to residential
users; (c) introduction of a policy package and fiscal incentives to promote customer preference
for energy-efficient fluorescent lamps vis-a-vis incandescent lamps; and (d) promulgation of a
policy package to promote the manufacture and use of energy efficient motors for tubewells,
pumps and compressors. These measures, depending on the speed at which they would be
introduced, could reduce peak demand by some 1,000 MW by FY2002. In preparation of the
proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project (para 1.27), the proposed project would
assist GOP and WAPDA in assessing the effeztiveness of the ongoing DSM program and, based
on the lessons learned, outline a program of additional measures and related institutional
arrangements to ensure effective implementation of an aggressive DSM program in line with
GOP's policy. Annex 2.6 gives the draft Terms of Reference (TORs) for such a study. During
negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to appoint consultants not later than December 31,
1996, to undertake the required DSM study, to complete the study by December 31, 1997, to
review and agree with the Bank on the recommendations of the study by March 31, 1998, and to
implement the recommendations so agreed in accordance to a plan satisfactory to the Bank.
(para 9.3).
Electricity Tariffs
2.17  Electricity tariffs are proposed by WAPDA and approved by the Govemment.  The
current tariff structure distinguishes between consumers under the following categories: domestic,
commercial, industrial, agriculture, bulk consumers and others. Furthermore, tariffs, within each
category are subdivided according to the level of consumption. Tariffs levied on industrial, some
bulk and a small number of agricultural consumers are composed of two parts, i.e., the demand
charge and the energy charge, while the other consumers pay only an energy charge. The
exceptions to the structure are flat rates paid by: (a) the majority of the agricultural consumers
(based on the water pump horsepower level); and (b) domestic consumers in the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA consumers). All consumers, except those who are charged flat
rate tariffs, also pay a Fuel Adjustment Surcharge (FAS) equivalent to Ps. 7/kWh for the lowest
two slabs of domestic consumers, Ps. 1 5/kWh for the next domestic slab, and Ps. 75/kWh for the
remaining domestic, agriculture, industrial, commercial, and other consumers. FAS is calculated
on the basis of the average fuel cost incurred in the twelve-month period ending two months prior
to the month of billing, and allows WAPDA to recover at least 95% of its fuel cost. Finally, all
consumers pay a hydroelectric surcharge (10.4%) which is collected by WAPDA on behalf of the
Government for payment of hydroelectric profits to the Provinces (para 7.9). Annex 2.7 gives the
details on the levels and structure of current tariffs.
2.18  Since 1985, the level of electricity tariffs has been increased annually to enable WAPDA to
finance 40% of its investment from internal sources. As a result, average revenue has increased in



-19-
nominal terms from 63.8 paisas/kWh in FY85 to about 224 paisas/kWh5 in FY96, representing
average increases of about 4% per annum in real terms. Following these increases, the average
revenue is now about 90% of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC). These increases have been
used by the Government as an opportunity to gradually reduce cross-subsidies in the tariff
structure. For example, in the recent tariff increase (July 1995), while overall tariffs were raised
by an average of 14.5%, domestic tariffs were raised by 21.9%, and flat rate agricultural tariffs
were raised by 25%. Commercial and industrial tariffs, on the other hand, were increased by only
13.5% and 10.8% respectively as consumers in these categories already pay tariffs higher than
their respective LRMC. Furthermore, subsidies for consumer connection for agriculture have
been eliminated. However, domestic and agricultural tariffs continue to be below their cost of
supply as detailed in Table 2.2 below.

2.19       Table 2.2 clearly indicates the need for further rationalization of the tariff structure.
In particular, the residential and agriculture sector, which account for about 39% and 18% of total
energy sales respectively, pay an average tariff equivalent to only 57% of WAPDA's average
revenue and cover only about half of their cost of supply. Although this is a marked improvement
from the prior tariff increase where residential and agricultural tariffs were 54% of WAPDA's
average tariffs, there is a need to continue to rationalize the tariff structure. As a first step in
facilitating the reduction of the level of distortion for flat-rate tubewells, it has been agreed under
PSDP to include a metered energy charge component on all flat-rate tariffs charged for tubewells.
Actions are being taken by WAPDA towards this objective. In addition, GOP and WAPDA
agreed during negotiations, that any future tariff increase required in order for WAPDA to
comply with its financial covenants will entail a reduction in the level of distortion with higher
tariff increases for those consumers for whom the average electricity rates are below the overall
5      Includes the surcharge of 10.4% on electricity consumption collected by WAPDA on behalf of the
Government for payment of hydroelectric profits (para 7.9).



-20-
average electricity rates than that for consumers for whom electricity tariffs are above the
overall average electricity tariffs (para 9.3).
2.20   Finally, in line with its objective to privatize the power sector, GOP has recognized the
need to revise the pricing regime to make the power sector more efficient and attractive to private
investors. As a first step, GOP introduced in 1994 a bulk electricity tariff of US 6.5/kWh for
new private power generators. In addition, under the ongoing PSDP, a study is being carried out
to develop proposals and an action plan for reforming the retail pricing regime6. In particular, the
study will develop pricing principles linking the final tariff for each consumer category to the cost
of supply. The study is near completion and the consultant's recommendations are expected to
be presented to GOP and the Bank very shortly.
Government Strategy for the Power Subsector
2.21   The Government's strategy for the power sector aims at encouraging private sector
participation on a build-own-operate (BOO), or Build-Own-Maintain (BOM) basis; and
continuing the process of restructuring and privatizing existing utilities in order to maximize
competition and bring in private sector management skills. GOP would continue its efforts to
establish a transparent and autonomous regulatory framework and make it fully operational. The
package of incentives offered to the private sector would be reviewed to ensure its adequacy for
attracting additional investments, while at the same time limiting sovereign GOP guarantees to the
minimum feasible levels, as agreed under the PSEDP-II Project (para 2.2). Ongoing efforts to
rationalize energy prices, while developing conmmercial operating principles and a competitive
environment for those enterprises that rerrain in the public sector, would continue.
2.22   While incentives offered under the 1994 and 1995 Policies need to be adjusted regularly to
ensure their competitiveness with those offered in other countries in the region, there is a more
immediate need to review the magnitude and macroeconomic impact of these incentives.
Specifically, exemptions from corporate income taxes, customs duties, sales tax, and other
surcharges on imported equipment are provided for private power projects. However, this runs
counter to the Government's urgent need to expand the tax base, and institute a consistent tax
policy for all sectors of the economy. Experience worldwide has shown that, provided the level
of the tariff is appropriate, additional incentives in the form of tax relief are not essential for
attracting private sector interest. Rationalization of the incentive package, which could involve
removal of these exemptions, rolling over and capitalizing such taxes, and including these in the
capital cost component of the tariff, would thus provide additional revenues for the Government,
while ensuring a uniformity of incentives across sectors. Therefore, during negotiations, GOP
agreed to review not later than June 30, 1996, the incentives offeredfor private investments in
the power sector, in particular in the form of exemptions from income and other taxes, and,
based on such review announce and introduce not later than December 31, 1996, a set of such
6      Given the decentralization of the power sector envisaged by the Strategic Plan, the study will also develop
transfer pricing principles for exchange of electricity at the wholesale level between generation and
transrnission, and transrnission and distribution, which can be effectively regulated.



-21-
incentives under which such exemptions will no longer be provided as part of such incentives
(para 9.2).
Bank's Assistance Strate2v in the Power Sector
2.23   The Bank will continue to actively support the Government's new power policies, seek to
accelerate the reform program and expand the role of the private sector, while financing selected
investments and improvement of the operational efficiency of the public enterprises. Specifically,
Bank financing would include environmentally sound and attractive hydropower investments such
as the proposed project, while pursuing further reforms in sectoral policies including tariffs and
incentives for private power projects.  Under the PSDP, the Bank is supporting the
implementation of the Strategic Plan for the power sector which envisages the development of a
competitive electricity market, restructuring and privatization of the main utilities, and the
establishment of an independent regulatory agency. In line with the same objective, the Bank
would seek to leverage its resources through the selective use of guarantees for new private
projects (such as Uch Power Limited proposed in FY96) in order to mobilize private sector
resources for the power sector to the maximum extent possible. In addition, the Bank would
support, under the future Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project, the implementation of a
more aggressive and comprehensive loss reduction, load management and energy conservation
program.
Bank Group's Role in the Enerev Sector and Experience with Past Lending
2.24  The Bank Group's involvement in Pakistan's energy sector started in 1955, with a loan to
KESC for the construction of a thermal power station.  Since then, it has assisted in the
implementation of projects in all energy subsectors. Prior to 1985, the Bank Group had made 16
loans/credits to Pakistan for energy projects. In the power subsector, the Bank had participated in
the Indus Basin Development Projects, involving mainly the construction of Tarbela and Mangla
hydropower projects, and provided a series of four credits/loans to KESC and three to WAPDA.
In the petroleum subsector, the Bank's involvement included five loans to SNGPL for the
expansion of the infrastructure for the transmission and distribution of gas, three to OGDC for
exploration and development of oil and gas and the Refinery Engineering and Energy Efficiency
Project (Ln. 2218-PAK) for restructuring product output and streamlining existing system. These
projects have been completed, and the respective Project Completion Reports issued.
2.25  In 1985, the Bank's strategy for supporting the sector was broadened to address sectoral
policies in addition to investments. The new approach was intended to address issues that cut
across the energy subsectors, i.e., power, coal, oil and gas, to ensure that consistency in policies is
maintained throughout the sector. In addition, the sectoral policies were intended to launch a
broad program for structural reforms with the principal objectives to: (a) identify key investments
needed to meet the energy requirements of the economy; (b) remove the distortions in energy
prices and promote efficient use of energy; (c) strengthen the institutions in the sector to move
them towards financial and administrative autonomy; and (d) deregulate the sector and create an
enabling environment for the private sector to assume a greater role in the production and delivery



-22-
of energy. Two Energy Sector Loans7 were approved to accomplish these goals which provided
an overall policy framework for the Bank's lending in the energy sector.
2.26  Since 1985, and in addition to the above mentioned Energy Sector Loans, the Bank has
provided fourteen loans for the energy sector. These include, WAPDA IV and V (Lns. 2499-
PAK and 2556-PAK) for the least-cost expansion and reinforcement of the secondary and high
voltage transmission grid; the Petroleum Exploration Project (Ln. 2351 -PAK) and the Petroleum
Resource Joint Venture Project (Ln. 2553-PAK) to assist GOP in mobilizing private sector
involvement in exploration and development of oil and gas; the Kot-Addu Combined-Cycle Power
Project (Ln. 2698-PAK) to add about 200 MW of generating capacity through the conversion of
combustion turbines to combined-cycle operation; the Power Plant Efficiency Improvement
Project (Ln. 2792-PAK) for the rehabilitation of existing power plants and conversion of
combustion turbines to combined-cycle operation at Kotri and Faisalabad; the Refinery Energy
Conservation and Modernization Project (Ln. 2842-PAK) for improving energy efficiency at the
National Refinery Ltd.; the Private Sector Energy Development Project (Ln. 2982-PAK), the first
of its kind to be approved by the Bank, and which provides for a fund to assist in the financing of
energy projects sponsored by the private sector; the Transmission Extension and Reinforcement
Project (Ln. 3147-PAK) to extend WAPDA's transmission grid; the Rural Electrification Project
(Ln. 3148-PAK/Cr. 2078-PAK) which is the Bank's first operation in Pakistan to support the
extension of the distribution network in rural areas; the Corporate Restructuring and System
Expansion Project (Ln. 3252-PAK) which provides for the privatization of SNGPL as well as
expansion of gas infrastructure; the Domestic Energy Resources Development Project (Ln. 3500-
PAK), which provides for the development of the country's oil and gas resources; and the Power
Sector Development Project (Ln. 3764-PAK), which is the first to support the implementation of
a comprehensive strategy for the privatization of the power subsector in Pakistan and the
restructuring and privatization of WAPDA; and the most recent Bank operation in the sector, the
Second Private Sector Energy Development Project (Ln. 3812-PAK), which supports additional
private investments in power generation and related infrastructure facilities.
2.27  Overall, the Bank has provided ten credits/loans to WAPDA. The first seven have been
completed and the remaining projects are being implemented satisfactorily, after some delays in
start ups. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) and the Project Completion Report
(PCR) for the Third Power Project (Cr. 968-PAK and SAC 39-PAK) were distributed to the
Executive Directors in April 1989; the PCR for the Fourth WAPDA Project (Ln. 2499-PAK) was
completed in June 1995; and the PCR for Ln. 2698-PAK was completed in November 1995.
Implementation Completion Reports for Ln. 2556-PAK and Ln. 2792-PAK are expected to be
distributed to the Executive Directors during FY96. The completion reports have concluded that
the projects not only improved electricity supply, but also most of the aspects of WAPDA's
operations including  administration, technical and financial.   However, despite these
achievements, the projects were completed two to three years behind schedule because of
weaknesses in WAPDA's overall management of the projects, delays in procurement (both for
goods/works, and consultant services) and in the clearance of Project Concept (PC 1) documents,
7     ESL I - Ln. 2552-PAK. approved 1985, closed 1988;
ESL II - Ln. 3107-PAK, approved 1989, closed 1994.



-23-
as well as the periodic scarcity of local funds. In order to minimize delays in start-up, the Bank,
under subsequent operations, has assisted WAPDA in preparing standard bidding documents and
provided training to its staff in the Bank's procurement procedures and made the approval of
PC Is as part of the up-front actions required to improve quality at entry. Moreover, through the
sectoral approach to lending and annual reviews of the investment programs, the Bank has also
been able to assist in identifying funding requirements for individual projects, mobilizing
resources, and ensuring that adequate funding is provided in the budgets for high priority projects.
2.28  The proposed project would be the Bank's eleventh operation with WAPDA. It would
follow up on the restructuring and privatization program for WAPDA, and would assist GOP and
WAPDA in reducing the chronic shortages of electricity supply. Lessons learned from previous
operationis, related mostly to improving the quality at entry, advanced procurement action to
avoid risk of delays, securinigfullfiniancingfor the Project in a timely manner, and the needfor
uipfronti actions for dealinzg with enivironmental and resettlement issues, were taken into
consideration7 in the design atnd preparation of the proposed project. As a result, the PC I for the
proposed project was approved prior to the Bank's appraisal, and procurement for the main
packages have been initiated early enough to allow for bids opening and/or award of the main civil
works contracts prior to Board Presentation, thus minimizing the risk of delays and cost overruns.
GOP and WAPDA have also learned from previous similar projects,  the importance of
experienced foreign consultants and expert review panels and, for the proposed project, a strong
project management team has been put in place and is being assisted by well-reputed joint venture
of foreign/local consultants and panels of experts. Furthermore, the agreement to set up a Ghazi
Barotha Hydropower entity, in line with the restructuring and corporatization program of
WAPDA, would ensure an efficient and independent management and operation of the project.
2.29  Based on past experience both in Pakistan and Bankwide, the preparation and
implementation of effective Environmental Management PIlans and Resettlement Action Plans
have generally suffered from the following weaknesses: (a) lack of public consultation and
participation; (b) shortage of funds to compensate the affected population in a timely manner; (c)
failure to assign appropriate trained staff responsible for the implementation of the plans; and (d)
lack of independent monitoring. These findings have been carefully integrated in the design and
processing of the proposed project. As a result, an Environmental Resettlement and Review
Panel (ERP) has been associated with project preparation from the onset; a proactive approach
for public participation and consultation has been ensured, including the setting up of a Public
Information Center (PIC) at the project site, sufficient funds for land acquisition and
compensation are being made available well ahead of the transfer of land to WAPDA; WAPDA's
Environmental Cell and Project Resettlement Organization are being adequately staffed; and
external monitoring is being undertaken by ERP, a monitoring consultant, a Ghazi-Barotha
Development Organization (GBDO), and the Bank's and other major donors' environmental
specialists.

3. THE WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY
Organization and Management
3.1   WAPDA, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, was established in 1958 as a semi-
autonomous agency to coordinate the development of Pakistan's water and power resources.
WAPDA's current organization chart is shown in Annex 3.1. It is divided into two largely
independent "wings," one for power and the other for water. The Power Wing is responsible for
the planning, construction and operation of power generation, transmission and distribution
facilities throughout the country, except the Karachi area which is served by KESC. The Water
Wing is responsible for the overall planning and investigation of water resources, and the design
and construction of surface and groundwater development projects for the federal and provincial
governments.
3.2   WAPDA's governing body, referred to as the "Authority" has been enlarged since 1994,
and comprises the Chairman, the Secretaries of Finance, Planning, and Water and Power along
with three Members who are in charge of power, water, and finance, and are designated Member
Power, Member Water, and Member Finance. The members are appointed by GOP and function
as chief executives of their respective groups.
3.3   WAPDA's Power Wing compares favorably with most of the utilities supported by the
Bank in terms of its financial performance and technical competence. With few exceptions over
the last decade, WAPDA has consistently met an ambitious cash generation covenant (which
requires it to finance at least 40% of its investment program from internally generated funds) and
its return on assets is among the highest among the Bank's borrowers. WAPDA has also
systematically reduced transmission and distribution losses, and has established a good track
record in the planning, design and implementation of large projects.
3.4   Member (Power) is assisted by three Managing Directors, in charge of Distribution,
Transmission and Grid Stations, and Customer Services respectively, and by General Managers
responsible for thermal generation, hydro generation, planning, finance, coordination, and system
control and load despatch. The distribution department is further divided into sections, each
headed by a General Manager dealing with administration, customer services, management
services, operations, planning and engineering, and purchasing and inventory control. Although
WAPDA is highly centralized with respect to decision making, its Distribution Department is
divided into eight Area Electricity Boards (AEB), which were established in 1981. Each AEB has
a chairman who is the Chief Engineer for the area and is appointed by WAPDA for a five-year
term; three full-time members (who are also directors in charge of departments), and three part-
time members representing local interests, one of whom is normally a representative of the
Provincial Government. The AEB members are appointed for a period of three years. In addition,
and in order to coordinate activities related to the restructuring and privatization in the sector,
WAPDA created a separate department headed by a Managing Director, the WAPDA Power
Privatization Organization (WPPO).



-25-
3.5   The Water Wing functions under Member (Water). For effective control, the entire
country is divided into north, central, south and west zones, generally covering the provinces of
NWFP, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, respectively, for execution of Salinity Control and
Reclamation Projects (SCARP) and surface water development projects. A General Manager is
responsible for each zone, while chief engineers and project directors implement projects falling
under regions within the zones. In addition, the Water Wing has a General Manager (Dams and
Coordination) for construction and operations of dams other than Tarbela, primarily Mangla Dam,
the Mangla Watershed Management Project, and construction of link canals, barrages/syphon,
including the Chashma Barrage. Because of the size and importance of these projects, the Water
Wing has separate General Managers for Tarbela Dam and the Kalabagh/Hydroelectric Projects as
well as one for the proposed project. The Water Wing also has a Water Resources Planning
Organization responsible for preparing and reviewing water sector development plans.  The
Planning Division of the Water Wing, headed by a General Manager, is responsible for all
planning activities on the water side, including SCARP. To ensure the safety of its dam projects,
the Water Wing has a separate Dams Safety Organization (DSO) which is responsible for the
review, analysis and interpretation of performance data collected by the project operation and
maintenance group to detect any malfunctioning of the units.  The DSO carries out an annual
inspection of all WAPDA's dams, and is involved in the safety planning of future dam projects.
3.6   As stated in Chapters 1 and 2, the 1958 WAPDA Act was amended in April 1994 to
enable WAPDA to be corporatized and divest selected parts of its assets mainly thermal
generation plants and distribution areas.  As a result, WAPDA will be reorganized and
corporatized into a holding company with decentralized power generation, transmission and
distribution subsidiaries operating as discrete autonomous profit centers, and selected parts of its
assets will be offered for sale to private investors. While actions have been initiated by GOP and
WAPDA towards achieving these objectives, as agreed under the PSDP, the time required for
completing the full corporatization of WAPDA, originally set as of December 31, 1997, has been
reassessed to ensure adequate implementation of the required measures.  Therefore, during
negotiations WAPDA agreed to complete the full corporatization of WAPDA by December 31,
1998 (para 9.4).
3.7   A key objective of the proposed project is to continue to assist GOP and WAPDA in the
reform program for the power sector. Therefore, to ensure that Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower
Project (GBHP) will be organized and operated in consistency with WAPDA's restructuring
program, the technical assistance component of the proposed project will provide financing to
assist WAPDA in providing GBHP with an organizational structure and management system and
procedures more adapted to its corporate objectives. TORs for such assistance are provided in
Annex 3.2. WAPDA agreed during negotiations that a project entity to operate GBHP be set up
no later than December 31, 1998 consistent with the overall restructuring and corporatization
program for WAPDA (para 9.4). Moreover and as recommended by the Strategic Plan, the
transmission and despatch functions should be entrusted to a separate corporatized and regulated
entity, responsive to the needs of the system. This Transmission and Despatch Entity (TDE),
initially operating as a corporate subsidiary of the WAPDA Holding Company, would be
responsible for the integrated operation of the power system and its timely extension and
reinforcement to connect new generating facilities as well as new customers. This would also
ensure that the central despatch mechanism is transparent, efficient and non-discriminatory



-26-
between private and public sources of power generation. Under the Power Sector Development
Project, WAPDA has already initiated the required study for preparing and implementing the
corporatization of its existing assets, including its transmission and despatch facilities. One of the
main objectives of the study is to recommend the optimal organizational structure and
management system for the TDE. Therefore, during negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to
inmplenment the recommenidations of such study as agreed with the Bank and that a separate,
corporatized national transmission and despatch entity be established by December 31, 1998
(para 9.3).
3.8   Staffing and Training. WAPDA's management staff is competent and well qualified. In
1993, WAPDA, including its Water, Power and Finance activities, had about 158,070 employees:
4,980 engineers, 1080 other professionals, 12,250 technical and other supporting staff, 27,310
administrative and accounts staff, 70,340 skilled workers and about 39,100 other employees
including unskilled workers. Most of these employees (85%), are employed in the Power Wing.
The number of consumers served by WAPDA was about 8.4 million consumers, which
corresponds to a consumer/employee ratio of about 53.  This ratio is relatively low when
compared to other developing countries (181 in Indonesia and 99 in Thailand), and it reflects the
overstaffing mainly in the Distribution Department.  The manpower transition study being
undertaken under the PSDP, would, in time, lead to an optimization of staffing levels. In the
meantime, under PSDP, GOP and WAPDA confirmed their commitment to initiate specific
measures such as a freeze on the hiring of new staff and retraining of staff to enable their
redeployment, in parallel with the privatization process. This will reduce the number of staff that
would likely become redundant as a result of privatization prior to implementation of actions to be
agreed under the manpower transition program study.
3.9   Training in WAPDA is a separate activity and is well-supported. Each of the main
functions, i.e., generation, transmission and distribution, operate technical training schools in a
number of locations, which are efficiently run. There is a management training center at Tarbela
which provides a comprehensive program to WAPDA's training staff. For training in specialized
areas, support has been provided to WAPD A by bilateral and multilateral agencies. CIDA has
provided extensive training to WAPDA's staff in the areas of load forecasting, generation,
transmission and distribution planning, and in design, construction and operation and maintenance
of the 500-kV network; USAID in the area of distribution; and the Bank in the areas of
generation planning, maintenance and spare-parts management, and in financial and commercial
areas. In addition, CIDA, as part of its ongoing National Power Plan Project, and in coordination
with the Bank's training program under PSDP, will be providing training to WAPDA's Planning
Department in DSM and to WAPDA's Environmental Cell.
WAPDA's Existing Facilities
3.10  As of December 1994, WAPDA's total installed generating capacity was 10,675 MW.
About one-third of this capacity (2,917 MW) was commissioned during the last three and a half
years. The existing generating system consists of 4,825 MW (45%) of hydro capacity and 5,850
MW (55%) of thermal capacity based mainly on dual-fired power plants, using fuel oil and natural
gas. WAPDA's primary extra-high voltage (EHV) transmission system consists of about 2,800
km of 500-kV lines and seven grid stations whose aggregate capacity is about 6,774 MVA. The



-27-
secondary transmission grid (STG) consists of about 23,000 km of 220-kV, 132-kV and 66-kV
lines and 600 grid stations, with a total capacity of about 22,344 MVA. The distribution system
comprises 310,313 km of 33-kV, I 1-kV and 0.4-kV lines.
WAPDA's Power Development Program
3.11  WAPDA's Planning Department is using several computerized planning models, in
particular the Wien Automatic System Planning Package III (WASP III), to prepare long-term
development studies and medium-term development programs which are revised once a year,
using sound methods and procedures for determining the programs to meet electricity demand at
least cost. During the preparation of the proposed project, further assistance has been provided
to WAPDA for the use and training of the VALORAGUA model, for the optimal planning and
operation of the mixed hydro-thermal system.  In coordination with the Energy and Load
Management Cell and the Distribution Planning, the Planning Department also carries out
feasibility studies on load management measures.
3.12  Generation Expansion Program. WAPDA's proposed generation program is consistent
with GOP's latest policy in the power sector whereby all new thermal power generation projects
would be undertaken by the private sector, and WAPDA will continue to be responsible for the
construction and operation of the major hydropower projects. Therefore, the present WAPDA's
generation program only includes the completion of ongoing thermal and hydropower generation
projects, and the construction of GBHP.
3.13  WAPDA's future transmission and distribution program calls for the expansion and
rehabilitation of the network to connect future load centers at least cost, including the new
independent power producers (IPPs), and enhance WAPDA's efforts in improving the operating
efficiency of the power subsector. These programs would allow for increased investments in loss
reduction, load management, expansion and reinforcement of the network, and the expansion of
rural electrification.
3.14  WAPDA's development program for the period FY95-2002, together with the annual
phasing of expenditures for ongoing and new projects is presented in Annexes 3.3 and 3.4. The
program which involves expansion in generating capacity, along with parallel expansion of the
transmission and distribution network, is estimated to cost about Rs. 251.8 billion equivalent to
about US$ 7.0 billion. This program assumes that implementation of the GBHP would be
effectively initiated in FY96, with some minor preparatory works in FY95.
3.15  The Bank has reviewed WAPDA's investment program to ascertain its consistency with
the macroeconomic and public investment targets of the Government's economic reform program.
Annex 3.5 presents the details of the assumptions. The results indicate that WAPDA's projected
investment program over the period 1995-2002 could be accommodated within the
macroeconomic targets, given the policy of implementing new thermal power generation in the
private sector, and provided that a sound macroeconomic framework would be maintained. In
order to ensure that WAPDA's investment program will remain consistent with GOP's agreed
macroeconomic targets, and avoid crowding out of other GOP's high priority projects, GOP and
WAPDA agreed during negotiations to repeat under the proposed project the agreement under



-28-
PSDP to review with the Bank before March 31 of each year, WAPDA's rolling investment
program over a five-year period, covering the current year, the last preceding year and the next
three following years, with a view to enabling the Bank to satisfy itself that the program remains
consistent with the Borrower's macroeconomic targets (para 9.5).  In addition, during
negotiations, GOP antd WAPDA agreed that the GOP's Core Public Sector Development
Plrogram and the Social Action Program, as discussed and reviewed with the World Bank on an
annual basis, will not be adversely affected by the fitnancing requirements of GBHP (para 9.2).
Operational Performance
3.16  WAPDA operates and maintains its plants and equipment satisfactorily. The level of
performance in generation operations remains satisfactory, particularly when considered in
relation to the constraints arising from insufficient power generation capability and shortage of
supply, fuel availability and quality, spare parts procurement procedures, aging plants requiring
major overhaul, and financial and implementation constraints for generation development
programs. This performance is expected to further improve with the actions undertaken under the
recently completed Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project (Ln. 2792-PAK) cofinanced by
the Overseas Development Administration, and which involved station refurbishing, supply of
spare parts, introduction of a computerized maintenance system, and a technology transfer
component. In addition, arrangements are being undertaken to ensure additional supply of gas for
power generation, and for additional combined-cycle units, thus improving the efficiency and
availability of the generation system in general. Finally, the addition of generation capability to
the system will allow WAPDA to improve the maintenance program of its power plants, therefore
improving the availability of these plants.
3.17  Improvement in WAPDA's operational efficiency is also illustrated by the efforts made in
reducing the level of its power system losses from 37.6% in 1977, to 24.2% in 1994, with
transmission and distribution losses amounting to 9% and 12.1% respectively. This has been
achieved through a continued program of power system reinforcement and rehabilitation.
However, these losses remain higher than the economically achievable levels of about 3% and 8%
for transmission and distribution system respectively. The PSDP, the proposed project and the
loan covenant with ADB for the proposed project would assist WAPDA in enhancing its efforts
for further loss reduction.
3.18  The transmission system is designed and constructed to high standards but maintenance is
made more difficult due to the multiplicity of plants and difficulty of planning the extension of the
transmission system, due to the location of the generating plants vis-A-vis the load centers.
Despite the efforts already undertaken, the 132-kV system in particular will require additional
measures to improve its operational efficiency.  The implementation of the transmission
component of the PSDP which is proceeding satisfactorily, would assist WAPDA in achieving this
objective.
3.19 Until recently, WAPDA's investment programs were geared towards developing the
generation and the transmission systems, thus limiting the resources for distribution development.
Moreover, due to pressures to provide new connections, most resources were directed towards
extending the network and little attention was given to the maintenance and operation of the



-29-
existing distribution system. Recognizing the need to overcome the inefficiencies stemming from
this situation, and as a follow up to an agreement with the Bank, WAPDA created a distribution
directorate under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.  Actions required to enhance the
operational performance of this department are being continued by WAPDA on the basis of the
recommendations of a study funded by USAID, and strengthened under the ongoing Rural
Electrification Project (para 2.26). In order to assist WAPDA in evaluating the progress made, a
distribution diagnostic study of one AEB would be undertaken under the PSDP. Despite the
above mentioned improvements in its management and operation over the past several years,
WAPDA is more required to further streamline its operations in view of the pressure and
competition of the forthcoming private power generating plants. In line with its restructuring and
reorganization program, WAPDA needs to strengthen its managerial, technical, and financial
operations. To this end, during negotiations, WAPDA agreed to appoint, not later than
September 30, 1996, a management consultant firm with relevant international power utility
experience and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Board, to assist WAPDA in designing
and implementitng a set of managerial, financial and technical efficiency objectives by which
WAPDA would measure and improve the operational, managerial andfinancial performance of
its power operations (para. 9.4).
Financial Manazement
3.20 WAPDA's financial function is headed by a Member Finance, while the day-to-day
management of the financial function for the power sector is the responsibility of the General
Manager Finance (Power), assisted by four senior deputy general managers for treasury,
accounting and control, coordination, and field offices, a director for administration, and four
senior managers in charge of accounts pertaining to thermal operations, hydro, transmission, and a
resident representative in Karachi. The financial function was reorganized to: (a) accommodate
the separation of the Distribution function headed by a Deputy General Manager in charge of
accounts of all the AEBs; (b) address the problem of an excessive number of senior managers
reporting to the General Manager Finance (Power); and (c) segregate the complex treasury tasks
from those of financial management, including debt management WAPDA bonds and accounts
consolidation and financial planning. The reorganized financial function is resulting in a more
streamlined operation.
Financial Improvement Prouram
3.21  Under the Rural Electrification Project, WAPDA adopted a Financial Management
Improvement Program aimed at enhancing WAPDA's resource mobilization and financial
efficiency objectives. Implementation of the program is progressing satisfactorily. Measures to
increase resources availability included: (a) recovery of tubewell connection costs from consumers
through a loan program with the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan; (b) implementation
of a cost recovery program for rural electrification operations; (c) regular aging of accounts
receivables to improve collections monitoring; and (d) enhancement of security deposits to reflect
current average billings. The subsidies for consumer connections including those in the rural
areas, have been eliminated, and WAPDA now prepares a pro-forma balance sheet and income
statement for rural electrification to identify the financial costs of this program to WAPDA. The
regular aging of accounts receivable has resulted in an increase in provision for uncollectible



-30-
receivables in WAPDA's accounts. In addition, WAPDA is reviewing its accounts receivable
overdue for more than three years to determine the uncollectible receivables to be adjusted on its
balance sheet. Institutional measures to improve financial management efficiency have been
carried out, including the reorganization of the financial function of WAPDA, regular review of
the adequacy of premiums paid for its self-insurance scheme, and strengthening of WAPDA's
internal audit functions. To further enhance efficiency, the accounting and financial information
system of WAPDA is being automated with assistance of international consultants.
3.22 Accounting System. WAPDA has about 500 accounting units distributed over a wide
geographical area. To cater to this large number of accounting units, WAPDA has adopted a
decentralized, accrual-based accounting system. While the system is sound in structure, the utility
is not deriving full benefits from the system primarily due to: (a) non-availability of trained
accounting personnel, particularly in the distribution areas; and (b) the manual system of
maintaining the accounts which causes significant delays in the flow of accounting information
through WAPDA's hierarchy. To address these concerns, WAPDA is implementing a
comprehensive training program for the accounting staff of the AEBs, with the assistance of the
Electricity Supply Board of Ireland. Furthermore, under the Rural Electrification Project, the
design of the automation of the accounting and financial management information system at
headquarters has been completed and the computer hardware is being procured. In view of the
corporate restructuring and privatization initiatives that GOP and WAPDA are pursuing, the
design of the automated accounting system has been reoriented to accommodate truly
decentralized accounting based on profit centers (generation plants, transmission, and AEBs). A
pilot design for one thermal plant, one hydel plant, WAPDA's transmission facilities and interface
with one AEB system has been completed. To ensure that an automated accounting and finance
system on a profit center basis is implemented throughout WAPDA, consultants are being
appointed under the PSDP to implement the program. Completion of WAPDA's automation for
accounting, finance and a Management Information System program is planned to coincide with
the corporatization of WAPDA, scheduled to be implemented by December 1998.
3.23  Management Information System (MIS). The manually-generated information system of
WAPDA has led to delays in decision-making and cumbersome preparation and storage of data.
The successful implementation of WAPDA's current corporate restructuring program would have
to rely on a timely and reliable information flow. Thus, the development of a comprehensive and
automated MIS covering WAPDA's technical and financial operations is urgently needed. With
assistance from consultants, an MIS, covering, inter alia, WAPDA's technical and operational
information requirements would be integrated with the ongoing work being done on the design of
the automated accounting system. The process for obtaining proposals from consultants for the
MIS design and implementation has been initiated. In addition, WAPDA has established an MIS
Development Cell headed by a Director General whose responsibilities include all aspects of
evaluation, planning, development, testing, maintenance of all financial and information systems
and computer requirements of WAPDA.
3.24 External Audit. The responsibility for auditing WAPDA's accounts rests with the Auditor
General of Pakistan (AG), who discharges this responsibility through a Director General assigned
to WAPDA Audit on a permanent basis. WAPDA is required by the WAPDA Act to finalize the
annual accounts and have them audited within six months of the end of the financial year.



-31-
However, because of the large number of accounting units scattered throughout the country and
the manual preparation of accounting data that feeds into the audit, the Audit Report is issued
some eight to ten months after the end of the financial year. With the improvement envisaged
through the automation of its accounting and financial information system, WAPDA expects to be
able to have its finalized annual accounts audited within six months of the end of the financial
year. Accordingly, the Bank Group's standard audit covenant which is included under all
ongoing WAPDA Power Projects will be maintained under the proposed project (para 9.5). To
improve the quality and timeliness of the external audit, WAPDA and the Office of the AG,
Pakistan have agreed to appoint private auditors to participate in the audit of WAPDA's accounts.
Under PSDP and as a first step, WAPDA would explore the scope and nature of the audit to be
done by private auditors in close consultation with the AG. Therefore, WAPDA agreed during
negotiations to appoint by June 30, 1996, a reputable private auditing firm, in consultation with
the Auditor General of Pakistan, to develop, by December 31, 1996, a detailed audit plan
salisfactory to the Bank, and to conduct beginning FY99 the audit of WAPDA's accounts in
accordance with the agreed audit plan (para 9.4).
3.25 Insurance. WAPDA insures its assets under a self-insurance scheme established in 1981.
The scheme covers substations, power houses, machinery and workshops against loss from fire,
machinery breakdowns, and other calamities. Since the value of WAPDA's assets have been
increasing, premium rates are regularly monitored based on the most recent twenty year
experience in claims, and insurance coverage based on replacement value basis has been adopted.
Since the last actuarial review of WAPDA's self-insurance scheme was done in 1990, a new
actuarial review should be undertaken to ensure that WAPDA's self-insurance scheme remains
adequate. Therefore, WAPDA agreed during negotiations to appoint no later than December 31,
1996, consultants whose qualifications are satisfactory to the Bank, to complete an actuarial
study for the utility by December 31, 1997 and implement the recommendations by March 31,
1998 (para 9.4).

4.   THE PROJECT
Project Back2round
4.1    Downstream of the Tarbela dam, the Indus River briefly crosses a broad plain before it
enters the Attock Gorge. The Indus River drops by about 76 m. in a distance of 63 Km. between
the tailrace at Tarbela and the confluence of the Indus and Haro Rivers. This topographical
feature makes it possible to economically utilize the available hydraulic head for power

4.2    A pre-feasibility study initiated by WAPDA in 1986 established that it would be possible
to divert water near the village of Ghazi downstream of Tarbela and lead it through a canal to
Gariala where a power station with a capacity of about 1,000 MW could be built. Because of its
location, this scheme was named Ghazi-Gariala Hydropower Project.
4.3   In 1989, UNDP agreed to finance the feasibility study and the detailed engineering designs
for the Ghazi-Gariala Project. The Bank was appointed executing agency. The feasibility and
design studies were carried out by Pakistan Hydro Consultants (PHC), a joint venture of five
consulting firms (para 4.6). The planning and design work were, from the onset, guided by an
Independent Panel of Experts and an Environment and Resettlement Review Panel. Several
alternatives and redesigns were examined in order to minimize resettlement and environmental
impacts and to ensure the safety and technical soundness as well as the economic viability of the
project. As a result of these studies, it was decided to locate the power house near the village of
Barotha and, at the request of the local residents, the name was changed to the Ghazi-Barotha
Hydropower Project.
4.4    Although GOP is pursuing private sector participation in hydro projects in secondary
tributaries of the Indus River, the public sector, under the Government's policy', will continue to

build, own and operate hydropower projects on the main Indus River. This is due primarily to
their critical importance for the operation of the Indus Basin's irrigation system and flood control,
whose benefits are vital to the Pakistan economy. Consequently, from the inception of the
GBHP, whose operation will be dependent on the water releases from the Tarbela dam, it has
been envisaged that the project would be implemented by WAPDA. Still, both GOP and the
Bank seriously examined the possibility of having GBHP owned and operated by the private
sector. However, it was concluded that this was not a viable option. Private sector lenders are
generally more reluctant to finance hydropower than thermal generating projects on a BOO/BOT
basis. This is partly due to the inherently greater construction and operating risks associated with
hydropower plants due to hydrological and geological uncertainties. Other considerations also
would make the project unattractive to the private sector: (i) its long gestation period and
economic life compared to the much shorter repayment period of commercial loans; (ii) its large
financing requirements, particularly in local currency, coupled with the scarce local resources
available in the domestic capital market; and (iii) the equity-debt ratio required by the private
sector in BOO/BOT structure, thereby increasing the overall external borrowing requirement for
the project.
Proiect Objectives
4.5   The main objectives of the proposed project are to assist GOP in its efforts to: (a) develop
domestic energy resources and reduce load-shedding in a cost effective and environmentally
sustainable manner, thereby supporting the country's long-term energy development objectives;
(b) reinforce and complement the reform program for the power sector; (c) strengthen WAPDA's
capability to address environmental and resettlement issues related to hydropower projects; and
(d) further rationalize the use of electricity. The proposed project is consistent with an overall
sectoral approach that includes substantial attention to issues of pricing, demand management,
environment, resettlement, and redefined roles of the public and private sectors in the energy
sector.
Proiect DescriPtion
4.6   The description of the proposed project is summarized below and detailed in Annex 4.1,
which also gives the main project data. The geographic locations of the project's physical
components and the project layout are shown in IBRD Maps 25106 and 25107. Drawings Dl,
D2 and D3 give the layout and cross section of the barrage, the power channel and the power
house respectively. The proposed project would consist of:
(a)   the construction of the Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project (GBHP) which aims at
utilizing 76 meters of head available in the Indus River between the tailrace of
Tarbela power station and its confluence with Haro river, and which comprises the
following three main components:
(i)    a barrage and its ancillary works, located near Ghazi village at about 7 km.
downstream of Tarbela Dam, with a normal pond level of El. 340 m, which
would have an initial live storage capacity of about 62 M cu m, and would
allow diurnal re-regulation of the discharge from Tarbela. The barrage



-34-
would include 20 open-flume standard-bays, and 8 undersluices bays, each
18.3 m wide, with a crest level of El. 332.2 m and 326.0 m respectively; a
dividing island of about 400 m width acting as two guide banks, one for the
standard bays, the other for the undersluices and head regulator; a head
regulator of 8 bays, each of 18.3 m width with a crest at El. 333 m for
controlling flows, into the power channel, while allowing the pond level to
fluctuate in response to diurnal variations in flow from Tarbela;
(ii)   a 52 km long concrete-lined power channel with a capacity of 1,600
cumecs, and its ancillary works. The power channel would have a bed
width of about 58.4 meters and a depth of about 9 meters. The concrete
lining would be 135 mm thick, reinforced and joints with water stops
would be provided at 9 to 12 m intervals. The underdrainage system is
designed to maintain groundwater levels below the invert of the channel,
and would comprise a filter layer under the concrete lining along the bed
and sides of the power channel. The channel would have a bed slope of
1:9,600, with a resulting average water velocity of 2.33 m/s. Along the 52
km length of the canal, there would be 33 bridges for easy access, and 45
cross drainage structures. For safety reasons, the power channel would be
fenced in the populated areas; and
(iii)   a power complex and ancillary works, located near the village of Barotha
with its tailrace outfalling at the confluence of the Indus and Haro rivers,
and with an installed generating capacity of 1,450 MW comprising five
units each of 290 MW. The power complex would generate 6,600 GWh of
energy annually, would run as a base load station, and would have daily
peaking capability throughout the year, provided by headpond storage of
about 25 M cu m, and depending upon water released through Tarbela
units;
(iv)  the construction of power transmission facilities to connect GBHP to the
interconnected grid, involving two 500 kV transmission lines of 100 km
each, from Barotha to Rewat and related substations, and about 140 km of
500 kV loop in and out of existing 500 kV Tarbela-Gatti line at Barotha;
(b)   the Implementation of an Environment and Resettlement Management Plan
including:
(i)   an Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan;
(ii)   a  Resettlement Action  Plan  (RAP)  involving  land  acquisition,
compensation and rehabilitation plan for the project affected people; and
(iii)  an Integrated Regional Development Plan (IRDP) to address the project's
induced impacts and promote long-term sustainable development in the
project area; and



-35-
(c)   the power sector reform component which involves:
(i)   setting up of GBHP as a separate project entity; and
(ii)   establishment of a separate transmission and despatch entity.
(d)   a technical assistance component in the form of consultancy services to assist
WAPDA in:
(i)   the engineering design, procurement process, construction supervision and
commissioning of part (a) above, including the environmental and
resettlement components;
(ii)   continuing the participation of two Panels of Experts, one technical and
one for environment and resettlement, for periodic reviews during project
construction, and overseeing the implementation of the project and of the
Environment and Resettlement Management Plan respectively;
(iii)  coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Environment and
Resettlement Management Plan;
(iv)   strengthening its environment and resettlement capabilities;
(v)   carrying out the power sector reform component;
(vi)  improving its managerial, operational, technical as well as financial
efficiency through appointment of a Management Consultant;
(vii)  reviewing the effectiveness of WAPDA's ongoing DSM  management
measures and preparing a more aggressive action program in preparation of
the forthcoming Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project;
(viii)  auditing accounts of WAPDA by private auditors; and
(ix)  reviewing the self-insurance scheme of WAPDA by actuarial consultants.
Proeect En2ineering and Preparation
4.7   GBHP.  As stated earlier, PHC, a joint venture of five consulting firms (National
Engineering Services Pakistan and Associated Consulting Engineers, both of Pakistan; Ewbank
Preece, Binnie and Partners, both of UK; Harza Engineering Company, USA), carried out the
detailed project feasibility, design and preconstruction studies. In accordance with the Bank's
procedures, an independent Panel of Experts (POE) has been associated with the project
preparation from the onset. An independent Environment and Resettlement Review Panel (ERP)
also participated since the beginning of the project preparation process and design in the
environmental assessment and resettlement studies.



-36-
4.8   The proposed project has been the subject of intensive engineering and design studies and
site investigations executed in several phases. During those studies, several alternatives were
considered with due consideration to technical, safety, environmental, resettlement and economic
aspects, mainly with regard to the project size, the barrage site, the power channel size and
alignment and the siting of the power complex. In particular, five barrage sites were identified,
several alternative designs for the power channel and its alignment were studied (unlined versus
concrete-lined, twin channels versus one channel, and alignments into higher and lower ground),
and five potential power complex sites were considered. This process allowed in particular for
significant reductions in the potentially adverse environmental, resettlement and archeological
impacts. The selected site for the barrage was preferred on environmental grounds; the power
channel alignment and capacity were also selected on environmental, resettlement and safety
grounds; and the Barotha site for the power complex was selected on environmental and technical
grounds, as it offered the most favorable topography. Annex 4.2 summarizes the alternatives
which were considered. The project feasibility study was completed in August 1992, establishing
the project to be technically sound, economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially
acceptable. This was also endorsed by the POE and the ERP. The project feasibility report is in
the Project File. The Project Concept document (PC-I) has been approved by the Government.
4.9   Within the same assignment funded by UNDP and GOP, PHC prepared the detailed
engineering design of the adopted scheme, and prequalification and bidding documents for the
preparatory works, and the main civil works contracts for the barrage, the power channel and the
power complex.  Given the priority and complexity of the project and PHC's excellent
performance during the feasibility studies and the already completed preparation phase of the
project, GOP and WAPDA decided to extend the services of PHC to complete the preparation of
the project, including the procurement process, and to assist in the construction supervision and
project commissioning (para 5.1). The related TORs have been reviewed by the Bank, found
satisfactory and are attached in Annex 4.3. While PHC is proceeding with its assignment,
negotiations between WAPDA and PHC are currently underway for the finalization of the
contract. Todate, contracts for the preparatory works have been awarded; bid evaluation reports
for the barrage and the power channel civil works contracts have been reviewed by the respective
financing agencies, and notification of award expected very shortly; bids for power complex civil
works contract, the cranes and gates are being evaluated; bidding documents for the turbines and
generators have been prepared, and are being reviewed by the respective financing agency.
4.10  Power Evacuation Facilities.  WAPDA's arrangements for planning, engineering and
supervision of works for the transmission system were reviewed. Load flows and stability studies,
design criteria and environment and resettlement considerations were the basis for the adopted
scheme for the evacuation of power from GBHP, and its connection to the grid system. These
were also reviewed and found satisfactory. Detailed engineering design of the transmission
component of the proposed project is being carried out jointly by WAPDA's transmission and grid
stations staff assisted by National Engineering Services Pakistan (NESPAK).

Safety Aspects
4.11  In accordance with the Bank guidelines for Safety of Dams and Structures (OMS 3.80,
and the presently revised draft OP/BP 4.37), the project provides appropriate measures to ensure
the safety of the proposed project and the associated structures.
4.12  Engineering.  The PHC consortium prepared the project engineering and all detailed
designs and technical reports with specific consideration of the safety of the project structures.
4.13  Independent Panels of Experts. As indicated earlier, POE and ERP have been associated
with the project from the initial stages of the project preparation to carry out a comprehensive
review of the feasibility study, project layout, and the detailed designs of the project, and to advise
and ensure the safety of the project and the appurtenant structures, with specific consideration of
the hydraulic, soil, seismic, structural, environmental and resettlement aspects. POE comprised
eight internationally reputed experts with relevant expertise in dam/barrage, appurtenant
structures and power house engineering, concrete lining of major channels and the underdrainage
systems, and the electrical/mechanical equipment for the power station. ERP comprised three
internationally recognized experts with relevant expertise in environmental and resettlement
matters. The Panels contributed some important modifications for the design and implementation
plan of the project. These Panels are being reconstituted to review, assist and guide on the critical
technical and safety aspects of the proposed project, and their monitoring during construction and
initial operation of the project. Related TORs are attached in Annexes 4.4 and 4.5. Most of the
members of the previous Panels will continue on the reconstituted panels. Nomination of
members to the Panels is ongoing and expected to be completed early January 1996.
4.14  Instrumentation. Extensive instrumentation is proposed to be installed at the project
structures and the concrete lined power channel for safety monitoring. The same would be
further reviewed by the POE and the Bank for its adequacy when instrumentation designs are
finalized during construction, and additional instrumentation will be incorporated if considered
necessary. The proposed instrumentation would provide data for studying the behavior of the
various project structures and the power channel and foundations after construction, and enable
the development of protective measures to cope with emergency conditions. Special provisions
have also been made for monitoring and controlling the accumulation of sediments during project
construction.
4.15   Safety Inspections During Operation. Periodic inspections of the dam and hydraulic
structures will be carried out by WAPDA assisted by suitably qualified experts, acceptable to the
Bank. WAPDA Dam Safety Organization staff are well trained in dam safety monitoring and
conducts inspections of dams and major hydraulic structures in the country that generally follow
the practices of the US Bureau of Reclamation. During negotiations, WAPDA agreed to
maintain or cause to be maintained all facilities relevant to the project, and for making or
causing to be made all necessary repairs to those facilities, in accordance with sound
engineering, financial and power utilities practices (para 9.4).

Project Cost Estimate
4.16  The total project cost estimate, including physical and price contingencies, local duties and
taxes is about US$1,863.5 million of which about US$1,192.2 million (64 percent) would be the
foreign exchange component. The financing required, including interest during construction, is
estimated at about US$2,250.0 million. The cost estimate is based on June 30, 1995 prices. Land
acquisition costs are based on the assessed market price including compensation to lessees and
mortgagees. Their costs have been estimated by preparing detailed bills of quantities for each type
of work and costing the quantities. Cost estimates for the preparatory works are based on the
related contracts amount. Cost estimates for the barrage and the power channel are based on the
evaluated bid of the recommended bidder. All other costs are based either on consultant's
estimate or on recently opened bids for similar works. Physical contingencies are assumed to be:
(a) 15% for the barrage, the power channel and the power station civil works because these
works are of more difficult design and complex nature, and for the transmission lines which are
being surveyed; (b) 10% for certain mechanical and electrical works (switchyard steel structure,
cables and accessories, power plant auxiliaries and SCADA equipment). These works comprise
many components and therefore need larger provision of contingencies than major
mechanical/electrical works (turbines, generators, transformers, reactors, cranes, HV/MV/LV,
switchgear, elevators, standby diesels and gates, etc.) for which a provision of 5% is made. The
same percentage of 5% is assumed for preparatory civil works and technical assistance. Price
contingencies have been included at annual rates of 1.8%, 2.6%, 2.5%, 2.5%, 2.4%/O, 2.4% and
2.4% for foreign costs and at annual rates of 8.0%, 6.7%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 6.0% and 6.0% for
local costs, for FY96 through FY2002 respectively. Custom duties and taxes on imported
equipment, and Iqra (Education) surcharge would amount to about US$31 million. The estimated
costs of the project are set out in Annexes 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 and summarized in Table 4.1 below.
Financing Plan and Lendin2 Arrangements
4.17  The proposed Bank loan of US$350 million would finance about 15.6% of the total
financing required for the proposed project and about 25% of its foreign exchange component.
The proposed Bank Loan would include financing of a portion of IDC on the Bank loan (US$40.0
million) in order to help alleviate WAPDA's debt service burden over the medium-term, and its
difficulties in raising financing in the commercial market (para 7.5). The remaining (US$1,900
million) is expected to be covered by the following identified sources: (a) The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) for an amount of US$300 million; (b) The Government of Japan through the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) for an amount of US$350 million; (c) The
Government of Germany through the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KFW) for an amount
equivalent to US$150 million; (d) The European Investment Bank (EIB) for an amount of US$60
million; (e) The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) for an amount of US$40 million; and (f)
WAPDA's internal cash generation for an amount of about US$1,000.0 million, representing
about 44.4% of the total financing required for the proposed project. WAPDA's share for the
financing of the project is consistent with its overall financing of its total investment program for
the period of the construction of the project (para 7.10). The proposed project financing plan is
shown in Table 4.2 below.

4.18  The identified cofinancing sources are at different stages of commitment.  ADB
completed negotiations on November 13, 1995 and EIB's negotiations are scheduled for
December 5, 1995. Submissions to their Boards are scheduled for December 21 and 12, 1995,
respectively. The Government of Japan/OECF confirmed its intention to participate in the
financing of the project. As regards the Government of Germany/KfW and the IDB, their intent
to participate in the project and the level of their participation are expected to be confirmed very
shortly, while they are completing their internal process for formal approval of their respective
loans early 1996. Given the advanced stage of their internal processing, these financing sources
are very likely to materialize. However, should they not materialize, the resulting financing gap
would be covered by suppliers'credits. As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan,
GOP and WAPDA should provide evidence that the ADB and OECF Loan Agreements have
been executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to their effectiveness have been
fulfilled (para 9.1).
4.19   The proposed Bank loan of US$350 million would be made to GOP at the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US Dollars single currency loans, with a repayment period of 20
years including five years of grace period. The proposed Bank loan would be onlent by GOP to
WAPDA on the following terms similar to those approved for PSEDP II, i.e., (a) during
construction period of the project, a variable rate, to be reviewed semi-annually, equal to the sum
of the prevailing World Bank Lending Rate to GOP plus a spread of 150 basis points; (b) after
completion of construction, a variable rate, to be reviewed semi-annually, equal to the sum of the
prevailing World Bank Lending Rate to GOP plus a spread of 350 basis points. The repayment
period would be up to 23 years including a grace period of up to eight years. WAPDA will bear
the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed to execute a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank as a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Bank loan (para 9.1).
4.20 The Government of Pakistan is eligible for the single currency loan (SCL) because it
converted all its outstanding VLR82 loans to VLR89 terms. The proposed loan of US$350
million, which will be the only FY96 loan to Pakistan on SCL terms, represents 60 percent of the
Bank's FY96 lending program to Pakistan of US$580 million, including guarantees.
Furthermore, the Government of Pakistan has selected US dollar single currency loan terms
within the context of its overall liability management strategy and the LIBOR-based interest rate
in order to preserve standard country terms for this project. GOP judges that WAPDA has
sufficient risk-bearing capacity to borrow on the proposed onlending terms.

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Plans
5.1   WAPDA would be fully responsible for the implementation of the proposed project.
While WAPDA's track record in timely implementation of a large power system expansion
program and hence large scale projects has improved over the last three years, given the priority
and complexity of the project, WAPDA has decided to extend the services of PHC to assist in the
implementation of the project until its commissioning. PHC's past association with the Indus
Basin and the proposed project, its excellent performance during the preparation phase, and in
order to avoid delay in the project processing (if fresh proposals were to be invited), the Bank has
agreed to this extension. These services, which would amount to an estimated cost of about
US$60.0 million, are being funded by WAPDA's own resources (para 4.8).
5.2   WAPDA has set up a Ghazi-Barotha Project Management Unit (GBPMU) headed by a
Project Director with the rank of General Manager (Annex 5.1). WAPDA has already appointed
key staff on full time basis, and is actively taking the required measures to fill all the posts of this
unit in a timely manner. As stated earlier, the services of an independent POE to review the
technical and safety aspects of the project and of the ERP will be continued during the
construction phase. These services are expected to be financed by the proposed Bank loan.
During negotiations, WAPDA agreed to incorporate, during project implementation, the
comments of POE and ERP in the design and implementation of the project as appropriate (para
9.4).
5.3   To complement the above arrangements, a project implementation management plan
(MP), which will clearly define the responsibilities of the different agencies involved, with
WAPDA as the institution's primary responsible for the project has been set up. This MP would,
in particular, ensure project completion in a timely manner, and reduce the risk of cost overruns.
In addition to the regular meetings between GBPMU and PHC, the MP provides for the
establishment of a Project Coordination Committee chaired by Member Water, WAPDA, which
meets on a monthly basis, and another high level Executive Committee chaired by the Secretary of
Water and Power, which would meet as required to review progress of project implementation.
5.4   WAPDA is proceeding with the land acquisition process expected to be completed by
June 30, 1996, within the framework of the resettlement action plan (para 6.11). Preparatory
works including access road, permanent colonies for WAPDA staff, power supply equipment,
infrastructure in the new villages for RAP, and salvaging archeological sites have been initiated.
Contracts for the construction of the barrage (C-01) and the power channel (C-02) are expected
to be awarded very shortly. Bidding documents for the power complex, contract C-03, were
released to prequalified bidders. Bids are expected to be opened early January 1996, and contract
award is expected late April 1996..
5.5   Construction of the barrage will start with the temporary diversion of the Indus River to
be completed in 1996, the cofferdams which will enclose the main barrage structures, the head
regulator, undersluices and standard bays. The undersluices will be completed in 1997, while a



-42-
start will be made on the right guide bank and the fuse plug, and work on the head regulator
including the gates, left guide bank and gates for the undersluices will continue for completion in
1998. The standard bays including gates, the right guide bank and fuse plug will be completed in
1999/2000, and the commissioning of the barrage structure will commence. The main features of
the construction program of the power channel are as follows: (a) excavation for the channel
lining, and the construction of the bridges and cross-drainage structures will all proceed from the
downstream (Barotha) end; (b) bulk excavation of alluvial material will be carried out by mass
loaders feeding mobile conveyor belts, allowing the excavated material to be moved directly to the
spoil banks for spreading and leveling; (c) purpose made plant will be used to trim the excavation
before lining, to install the underdrainage system and place filter materials, to place the concrete
lining and apply curing compound to the finished lining; the channel will be lined in four passes
and this work is scheduled to start mid 1997; (d) the bridges will be built ahead of the excavation
of the power channel, so that communications across the channel are not interrupted; similarly,
superpassages will be built early, to protect the excavation from monsoon floods. As regards the
power complex, the main features of its construction program are as follows: (a) excavations for
the power house and other structures will be completed in 1996, and the construction of the
power house, penstocks and headpond/forebay embankments will start; (b) construction of the
intake and spillway will start in 1997, and first built-in parts for the turbines will be installed; (c)
all main structural work will be completed in 1999; and (d) in the year 2000, water received via
the power channel will be allowed to fill up the head ponds, commissioning of turbines, generators
and all associated equipment will start and continue until 2001.
5.6   The proposed project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and the detailed
implementation schedule is given in Annex 5.2. This plan was prepared by WAPDA and PHC
and is based on full mobilization of the contractor as early as possible during the dry season.
Procurement
5.7   Procurement for the proposed project has been divided in various packages taking into
account the size and complexity of the project, the barrage, power channel, power house and
transmission system size and sites, and the various sources of financing.  In particular, the
packaging of the main project components is as follows: two lots for preparatory works, three
lots for the main civil works (C-01 for the barrage, C-02 for the power channel, and C-03 for the
power house), 9 lots for the electro-mechanical equipment, one lot for the transmission line, one
lot for the substations, one contract for engineering and construction supervision (PHC contract),
and a set of contracts for the remainder of the technical assistance component. The detailed list of
these lots, the proposed timing for their procurement and the allocation of funding for each
package are outlined in the project procurement schedule in Annex 5.3, defined in line with the
overall project implementation schedule. Overall, there will be about 17 packages ranging in
value from about US$500.0 million for the power complex to US$0.70 million for the elevators.
Contracts for generators, turbines, transformers, switchgears, control and instrumentation,
substations and transmission lines would be awarded on supply, delivery, erection supervision and
commissioning basis. Contracts for gates, cranes, elevators, diesels would be awarded on supply,
delivery and supervise basis. The remaining contracts would be awarded on supply and delivery
basis and the contractors of the main civil works contracts would be responsible of their erection
as well as the erection of gates, cranes, elevators and diesels. In addition, the contractors for each



-43-
of the main civil works contracts will be responsible for the overall coordination and
commissioning of the barrage, the power channel and the power house respectively.  The
coordination, supervision and commissioning for the overall project is the responsibility of the
Engineer.
5.8   Table 5.1 below summarizes the proposed procurement arrangements for the project, and
the identified source of financing. The procurement arrangements will be consistent with the
requirements of the financing agency. In particular, the main civil works contracts C-01 would be
funded by ADB, C-02 by the Bank, C-03 joint-financed by the Japanese Government through
OECF and the Bank, and the turbines and generators by the Government of Japan/OECF and
Germany/KfW. Respective procurement requirements will be applied. Bank funds would also be
used for some electromechanical equipment and specialized instruments and control equipment
for environment monitoring and laboratory; and part of the technical assistance component.
Annex 5.3 gives the detailed contract packaging and allocation of funding.
5.9   Goods, works and services to be financed by the Bank would be procured in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines dated January 1995.  With the exception of the items listed in the
following paragraph, all contracts to be funded by the Bank would be awarded through
international competitive bidding (ICB). For purpose of bids comparison, a preference limited to
15% of the CIF cost of the imported goods, or the custom duty applicable, whichever is less,
would be extended to eligible locally manufactured goods. In the procurement of works WAPDA
may grant a 7.5% margin of preference to domestic contractors in accordance with the provisions
of the Bank's procurement guidelines.
5.10  Specialized instruments and control equipment for environment monitoring, in contract
packages not to exceed US$400,000 and US$200,000, shall be procured through international
and local shopping respectively, all of which will not exceed US$4.0 million in aggregate.
Consultants for studies and technical assistance would be selected in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines and employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank will
review all ICB procurement above US$1,000,000 and hiring of consultant firms above
US$100,000 and individuals above US$50,000 on a prior review basis. All other relevant
contracts not financed by the Bank shall be subject to consultation with the Bank prior to award,
including the consultancy services.

Bank to support withdrawal applications for consultant services above US$100,000 for firms and
US$50,000 for individuals and all other contracts above US$1,000,000.  Disbursement for
amounts less than US$1,000,000 would be made on the basis of itemized statement of
expenditure (SOE). The SOE documents would be maintained by WAPDA and made available
for review by Bank supervision missions
5.12  To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account (SA) of about US$15.0 million would be
maintained by WAPDA in a commercial bank in Pakistan. This SA will be used for all eligible
foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account should be submitted on a
monthly basis or whenever 20% of SA funds have been used, whichever occurs first. At its
option, WAPDA may submit withdrawal requests, outside the SA, provided the individual request
reaches or exceeds 20% of SA balances.
5.13  Disbursement Profile.  Annex 5.4 gives the estimated disbursement schedule for the
proposed Bank loan defined on the basis of the project implementation schedule and the advance
procurement actions which have been taken for the civil works. Because of the nature of the
project, no comparison has been made with the Bank's standard procurement profile. Based on
the estimated commissioning date of the fifth unit (June 30, 2001) and in order to allow time for
payment of the contractors' retention money and unforeseen delays, the loan closing would be
June 30, 2002.
5.14  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing.  In order to meet the construction
timetables, the Bank has agreed to carry out most of the procurement activities for contracts to be
financed by the proposed loan as advance procurement. Therefore, expenditures amounting to a
maximum of US$35.0 million (10% of the loan amount) which would be incurred prior to the
signature of the proposed loan, but after October 1, 1995, to finance advance payments for
contract C-02 (power channel and auxiliary works) and other additional payments related to
technical assistance, would be eligible for retroactive financing.
Monitorin2, Supervision and Reporting
5.15  Project Monitoring and Reporting. Given the size of the project, its multiple sectoral,
environment and resettlement aspects and the need for close coordination among several donors,
understanding has been be reached during negotiations on satisfactory procedures for monitoring,
evaluating and reporting progress on the project. WAPDA would submit to the Bank and the
other donors brief monthly reports and comprehensive quarterly progress reports, which would
include in particular an analysis of progress toward project objectives and key targets, lessons



-46-
learned and their incorporation in forward planning. These would cover all aspects related to
GBHP implementation, as well as the other project components. Environmental and resettlement
issues would be addressed through implementation of the resettlement action plan and the
environmental mitigation, monitoring and institutional strengthening plans (paras 6.16 and 6.19).
WAPDA would establish a computerized Project Management System (CPM) to closely monitor
the implementation of the project. It is expected that the POE and ERP would meet at least twice
a year to review progress on implementation of the GBHP and the Environment and Resettlement
Management Plans, and to provide advice on corrective actions as required
5.16  Project Supervision and Mid-term Review. Supervision of the project will extend over a
period of seven years, 1996-2002. To make efficient use of resources, the supervision will be
combined with supervision of other ongoing power projects, preparation for future projects, and
organized jointly with the other donors whenever possible. Halfway through the implementation
of the project, in June 1998, a mid-term review will be held to analyze if there are any critical
problems which require management review.
5.17  The key issues that would be focused upon during project supervision are: (a) review of
Pakistan's and in particular WAPDA's power development plan in keeping with changes in the
economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with GOP and WAPDA on the restructuring and
efficiency improvement of the power sector, and on required measures to ensure compliance with
the financial covenants; (c) close monitoring of the implementation of the environment and
resettlement management plan, including the RAP for GBHP and for the 500 kV transmission
lines; and (d) technical supervision of the physical implementation of the project. The Bank
missions would also assist GOP in analyzing policy issues and options in the power sector, and in
formulating and/or fine-tuning the strategy within the agreed Country Assistance Strategy. The
total Bank staff-weeks requirement is estimated at about 20-25 staff weeks per year, with three
missions annually for the first three years and an average of two missions per year for the
following years. The project supervision plan and the key performance indicators that would be
used for supervision are given in Annex 5.5 and Annex 5.6 respectively.
5.18  An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be drafted by the Bank within six
months after closing of the proposed Bank loan, and GOP and WAPDA would assist in the
preparation of the ICR. GOP and WAPDA would adopt the plan for the operational phase of the
project in line with the corporatization program of WAPDA, and as indicated in para 3.6. In
particular WAPDA will define the performance indicators to monitor operations and development
impact of the project. WAPDA will prepare and make available to the Bank its own evaluation
reports assessing the project execution including environment and resettlement issues and initial
operation, its costs and benefits, and the extent to which the objectives of the project were
achieved.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESETTLEMENT ASPECTS
Introduction
6.1   The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category "A" and has
been subject to the preparation of an environmental assessment and a resettlement action plan
consistent with the procedures of the World Bank and the requirements of the Government of
Pakistan Ordinance XXXVII, "Control of Pollution and Preservation of Living Environment
(December 1983)." As indicated earlier, one special feature of the project is the participation of
an independent Environmental and Resettlement Review Panel (ERP) during the detailed
feasibility studies and project engineering design. The Environmental Assessment Executive
Summary (EAES) prepared by WAPDA and endorsed by GOP, was distributed to the Executive
Directors in November 1994 (Report No. SecM94-1147), and provides an overview of these
environmental and resettlement studies. The EAES and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) have
been translated into Urdu and made available to the people permanently and temporarily affected
by the project, as well as to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). In addition, Urdu
information booklets describing the land acquisition process and the entitlement packages in
simple and concise terms have been prepared for the affectees.
6.2   With the assistance of the ERP, environment and resettlement aspects, including the
protection of cultural heritage sites, were considered in detail in the evaluation of design
alternatives and in the adoption of a number of design modifications to mitigate potential adverse
impacts through careful siting of the principal components of the project and in establishing the
alignment of the power channel (para 4.8). A summary of the environmental and resettlement
aspects of the proposed project, including details of the alternatives considered is provided in
Annex 6.1.
Environmental Impacts and Key Mitization Measures
6.3   Under the current project design, potential environmental impacts include: (a) changes of
land use in areas acquired for construction of the barrage, reservoir, power channel and power
complex; (b) reduction in the flows in a portion of the main channel of the upper Indus River,
immediately below the Tarbela Dam, when the power complex is in operation: (c) impacts to two
minor archaeological sites along the power channel alignment, which would be subject to salvage
excavation, in consultation with the Provincial archeological authorities; (d) relocation of two
mosques and 14 graves, with the approval of religious leaders and concerned families;
(e) potential risks for persons and livestock if they enter or fall into the power channel; and (f)
safety issues associated with transmnission lines.
6.4   Potential environmental impacts have been examined in the environmental studies and
action plans, mitigation measures and monitoring programs have been prepared accordingly.
Annex 6.1 gives more details on the Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.  In
particular, the impact of land acquisition will be largely mitigated by the redevelopment of
excavation spoil for agriculture. The spoil banks and terraces will be leveled, covered with top-
soil, provided with tubewell irrigation, and resold to interested affectees consistent with the



-48-
entitlement provisions of the project. Measures for fair and prompt compensation as well as a
number of other measures are also being adopted to ensure that the affectees are provided
adequate support during the transition period and that the compensation process is transparent.
During periods of low flow, the river downstream of the barrage will be fed by compensation
releases at the barrage, to maintain aquatic ecosystems and provide local users access to water
releases. Detailed studies and evaluations of the potential hydrological and ecological impacts of
reduced flows in the Indus river have been made, and a compensation release of 28 cumecs was
found to be more than adequate. Furthermore, and as provided for in the Environmental
Mitigation and Monitoring Plan, to be implemented by WAPDA as an integral part of the project,
the water quality in the river downstream will be closely monitored, especially during the low flow
season, and any adverse environmental impacts promptly mitigated by adjusting the water release
pattern. A new sewerage system will be provided for Ghazi-Khalo and fisheries resources will be
enhanced by stocking fish species in the barrage pond. To protect persons from entering or falling
into the power channel, chain link fencing will be placed in populated areas. Transmission lines
would be routed to avoid passage over or close to residential, educational, health or commercial
facilities and relocation for safety reasons would be compensated consistent with project
entitlement procedures.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Process
6.5   Early consultations with residents of the project area led to identification of land
acquisition and resettlement as major issues which have been addressed in the project design, and
much attention has been paid during project preparation to the resettlement and compensation
aspects.  Based on a complete focused census and sample surveys of the affected persons,
WAPDA has prepared a RAP. A legal task force appointed by WAPDA was associated to review
Bank policy and national legislation and to find or propose legal basis for the entitlements
proposed in the RAP. Field-based reviews were also conducted in the areas of relevant recent
projects in Pakistan to incorporate the "lessons learned" in the preparation of the RAP.
6.6   The RAP makes a commitment to improving or restoring the current standards of living
and earning capacity of the people permanently and temporarily affected by the project. This
policy commitment has been given operational form through the development of entitlement
packages (Annex 6.2) clearly identifying the type of land loss or disturbance, definition of an
entitled person, definition of entitlement/right, additional facilities and services for the affectees,
including training, work opportunities, credit and provisions for infrastructure.  The RAP has
been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. The RAP has also been formally approved by
the Governments of North West Frontier Province and Punjab Province, where the project
facilities are located. At present, the implementation of the RAP is well underway.
6.7   To avoid or minimize resettlement, civil works were sited either on higher ground or more
difficult terrain. As a result only the resettlement of 179 families with a surveyed population of
899 persons, currently living along the power channel and at the power complex sites, and the
demolition of 110 private housing units will be required. The number of persons adversely
affected by the loss of land and employment is currently estimated to be 21,460, bringing the total
number of adversely affected persons to 22,359. Table 6.1 below gives the breakdown of the total
persons between private title holders, and others affected by the loss of land and employment.

TXotal Number of Affectees                      22,359
Total number of affectees requiring resettlement  899
6.8    Most resettlement would be accomplished close to the original sites of the 110 private
housing units and their associated buildings to be demolished. Three model villages are being
established at the following locations: (a) about I km from Ghazi, for those losing 13 houses in
Haripur; (b) adjacent to Banda Feroze, for those losing 33 houses in Banda Feroze; and (c)
adjacent to the existing houses of Barotha village on the tailrace alignment for those losing 22
houses in Barotha. These locations have been identified by the concerned affectees and will
accommodate 68 of the 110 houses which need to be relocated. Construction of these villages is
underway. For the remaining 42 houses which are widely scattered, replacement housing would
be constructed in the vicinity of the existing house. In addition, in each resettlement village, a
road network, a water supply and sewage system, and electricity would be provided. A primary
school, a mosque, a basic health unit, and overhead water storage tanks would also be provided
by WAPDA.
6.9    Approximately 4,770 hectares of land would be acquired by the project, 3,457 hectares of
which are privately owned. Uncultivated, the public land is free of any claims by individuals or
groups with customary rights. All of the privately owned land will be legally acquired. Out of the
total land to be acquired, 1,640 hectares would be only needed temporarily for spoil banks.
Through an innovative approach, these lands would be developed, provided with irrigation
facilities and used as the core of land-for-land option for the adversely affected landowners. It is
estimated that the potential income of a typical farmer presently working barani (rain-fed) land
who receives land on irrigated spoil banks should be up to twice that of his present income. This
would provide the adversely affected people an economic base in the project area by not forcing
them to resettle in unfamiliar host communities.  Table 6.2 below gives the details of the land
required for the project.
6.10   The provisions set forth in the Pakistan Land Acquisition Act of 1894 have been
complemented through the provisions of the RAP to ensure fair and equitable compensation to
the affected people. These concerns formed the basis for the formulation in the RAP of the land
acquisition and compensation process. In particular: (a) instead of revenue officials determining
the replacement cost of lands and houses, this cost is being decided by a Land Valuation
Committee composed of the Assistant Commissioner of the subdivision, a WAPDA
representative, two representatives of the affectees, and a representative from the specially
created Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO) (para.6.18); (b) before commencing
the land acquisition process each Land Acquisition Collector (LAC) is issuing guidelines for the
public's information setting forth the considerations governing the land evaluation process; (c) all
persons losing privately owned agricultural land would be entitled to receive compensation either
in the form of cash or land; (d) cash compensation is being based on the market value of the land



-50-
pIus an additional premium of 15% for the compulsory acquisition of the land; (e) each person
losing land, dwelling or other property is being issued a Compensation Certificate clearly outlining
the value of all assets and the precise physical details of the property, and compensation payments
are being made directly into the accounts of the affectees prior to the transfer of land to WAPDA;
(f) the amounts deposited into the accounts of the affectees are being cross-checked with the
Compensation Certificates by the project field teams, including representatives of the GBDO, to
ensure that compensation payments have been made accurately; (g) the affectees would be
permitted to farm the land, even after WAPDA has taken possession, until the land is required for
construction; (h) any scheme for compensating laborers and others who have lost their livelihood
wvill be put on a sound legal footing; and (i) land acquired for the purposes of the project is being
transferred promptly to the Federal Government consistent with the requirements of the project.

6.11   The land acquisition process seems well on its way towards completion by June 30, 1996.
So far 8 awards, (cost of replacement), have been announced. Another 55 awards still need to be
made. Out of a total amount of about Rs 2.0 billion required for land acquisition, Rs 380 million
have been deposited by WAPDA with the LAC, and the balance will be provided as soon as
needed. The functionaries appear to have gained confidence in the process and WAPDA is
pursuing its e fforts to ensure that the required land acquisition and compensation process are
proceeding smoothly. In addition, to complement the provisions of the RAP, GOP and WAPDA
agreed during negotiations that: (a) land acquisition, compensation and resettlement under the
proposed project would be carried out in line with the provisions of the RAP and in accordance
with plans satisfactory to the Bank; (b) a legal framework satisfactory to the Bank would be
established to apply to persons whose land has been acquired but who have been left in
possession for the time being, and the standard legal documentation setting forth the terms and
conditions of such continued possession made available to the Bank; and (c) for the transmission
lines a land acquisition and resettlement action plan satisfactory to the Bank, to apply to the
persons affected by the acquisition of land requiredfor the transmission lines, will be furnished
to the Bankfor its review not later than December 31, 1996 (para 9.3).



-51-
6.12  In order to complement the RAP and to provide additional safeguards for the population being
affected by the project, WAPDA has had the National Rural Support Programme, a local NGO, prepare
an Integrated Regional Development Plan (IRDP) for the affected area. The IRDP would ensure that
the local communities benefit from the construction of GBHP in a long-term and all-round way and not
only by way of piecemeal compensation. This plan would include social uplift (education, health);
agricultural development (credit extension services); and business and industrial development. One
main feature of the IRDP is to involve community participation, during its preparation, implementation
and beyond. It will include specific programs for women and other vulnerable groups and emphasize
long-term job development in the region.
6.13  WAPDA's experience with resettlement issues has not always been effective.   As a
consequence, a number of outstanding claims resulting from the Tarbela Dam Project, implemented in
the mid-1970s with the Bank's assistance, still remain unresolved. Based on a preliminary survey being
undertaken by an independent consultant, along with a legal expert, the major issue relating to these
outstanding claims appears to be the application of the land-for-land compensation policy. According
to this preliminary survey, out of a total number of about 4,930 families eligible to receive land-for-land
compensation, about 1,440 families (29%) are still awaiting the allocation of their land. Although there
is no direct relation between the resettlement aspects of the proposed project and those related to the
Tarbela Dam Project located upstream of GBHP, efforts were made during the preparation of the
proposed project to discuss the best approach to deal with the outstanding resettlement issues of the
Tarbela Dam Project. As a result, WAPDA has appointed the above mentioned independent consultant
to define a clear action program based on a survey to deal with the outstanding claims. Annex 6.3 gives
the terms of reference related to these services. The mechanism to be put in place for addressing
outstanding grievances should be transparent in terms of legal and financial aspects. During
negotiations, GOP and WAPDA agreed that as a condition of Loan effectiveness, a survey will be
carried out to assess the status of outstanding claims of persons affected by the Tarbela Dam Project,
and an action plan to address legitimate grievances in a timely manner will be agreed with1 the Bank
(para 9. 1).
6.14  Participation and Consultation.  Public participation has been an integral part of project
preparation. Preparation of the environmental and resettlement studies for the proposed project have
included extensive consultation at the national, provincial, district and local levels.  Village level
meetings ('scoping sessions') have been conducted with groups of men and women throughout the
area. These scoping sessions have been designed to inform the affected people about the project as
early as possible and to listen to their views and concerns. Consultations, including field visits, have
been conducted with local NGOs including the World Conservation Union (Pakistan), the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF/Pakistan), and the Sungi Foundation.
6.15  WAPDA has established a main Project Information Center (PIC) at the project site for the
systematic and broad dissemination of all technical, environmental and resettlement information to the
affectees in particular, and to the media and NGOs in general, among others on the land acquisition and
compensation process and entitlement packages. Two smaller subcenters are also being established at
Attock and Topi to provide easier access for affectees to project information. The information center is
a critical part of the communications channel for redressing grievances about the land acquisition and
compensation process. Since it was established in December 1994, it has undertaken an active program
of outreach activities, including over 146 scoping sessions as of October 31, 1995. It has commissioned
a popular film/video on the project, including its environmental and resettlement aspects. It has also
prepared key documents in Urdu, including a schedule of public announcement of awards, Urdu



-52-
translation of the EAES, entitlement packages and the full RAP. An advisor has been recruited to the
PIC to assist in the preparation of written and audio/visual information for the PIC, support outreach
activities for the affected people and provide training for the information center staff.
6.16  Implementation    Given the complexity of the proposed project, adequate institutional
arrangements are being developed to ensure smooth implementation of the environmental mitigation and
resettlement plans. WAPDA's Environmental Cell (WEC) has been reorganized and is now headed by a
Gieneral Manager (Annex 6.4).  To ensure close monitoring of the project's environment and
r esettlement aspects, and adequate coordination with the Environmental Cell responsible for all
WAPDA operations, WAPDA has set up within the GBPM1U a Project Resettlement Organization
(PRO) to deal exclusively with environment and resettlement issues of the proposed project (Annex
6.5).  The PRO includes a Social Sciences Unit which is expected to play an important role in
developing WAPDA's capacity for supervising and monitoring resettlement. The terms of reference for
the Social Science Unit are attached in Annex 6.6. A key responsibility of this Unit is to ensure that the
affectees, particularly women, small landowners, landless tenants and laborers fully understand their
entitlement and procedures of compensation as provided under the RAP. It is also responsible for
informing WAPDA of grievances of the affectees, as well as any serious and sustained deviations from
the provisions of the RAP. Staffing of this unit has been completed and the appointed members are
already in the field.
6.17  To support the Environmental Cell and the GBPMU/PRO, mainly during the transition period of
appointment and training of the relevant staff, external monitoring consultants were appointed in August
1995, for an estimated 30 staff-months. The monitoring consultants will assist with the monitoring of
the environmental and socioeconomic aspects of the project as well as the implementation of the RAP.
Related terms of reference are attached in Annex 6.7.
6.18  In addition to the PRO, WAPDA is supporting the creation and providing a grant to the Ghazi-
J3arotha Development Organization (GBDO), originally referred to as the Project NGO (PNGO).
Terms of reference for this organization are attached in Annex 6.8. The GBDO will undertake contacts
with the local population, particularly for matters related to land acquisition, compensation, the
formation of Tubewell Users Associations and the allocation of land on the developed spoil banks. The
RAP mandates that its representatives participate in Land Valuation Committee meetings which are
required for the land acquisition and compensation process. It will also be the administrator of the
IRDP.  WAPDA has selected the National Rural Support Program  (NRSP), an internationally
recognized independent Pakistani NGO, to set up the GBDO for the project. A memorandum of
understanding was signed between the two organizations in October 1994. The GBDO was formally
registered under Section 32 of the Companies Ordinance (XLVII of 1984) in October 1995.
6.19  To ensure coordination among all the different units involved, an Environment and Resettlement
Review Committee (ERRC) is being set up under the chairmanship of the Project Director. This
Committee will meet periodically, and its members will comprise the chief of the PRO, representatives
from the WEC, the Social Science Unit, the monitoring consultant, and a representative of each of the
construction contracts, and the GBDO. Annex 6.9 outlines the organization of the relations between all
the parties involved in the resettlement and environment monitoring. To assist in all these matters, the
Government of Japan has approved grant funds of about US$1.2 million to assist WAPDA in
implementing and supervising its environment and resettlement plans for the project.

7.  WAPDA'S FINANCES
Introduction
7.1     WAPDA's financial affairs are governed by the WAPDA Act of 1958 which requires the
utility to operate along commercial principles, and to generate sufficient revenues from electricity
sales to cover operating costs and achieve a reasonable return on investment. To ensure that
adequate funds are available for the implementation of its investment program, WAPDA has
agreed under ongoing operations with the Bank on an Internal Cash Generation (ICG) covenant,
which requires WAPDA to generate annually from internal sources at least 40% of its capital
expenditures, averaged over the previous, current and ensuing year, taking into account changes
in working capital. WAPDA is also required to consult with the Bank before incurring new debt
should it be unable to maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times. WAPDA's tariffs are
set to ensure that these two financial objectives are met. Except for a couple of years, WAPDA
has achieved these financial performance targets satisfactorily since FY85, and is one of the few
electric utilities in the developing world to achieve this high level of ICG to finance its investment
program.
Past and Present Financial Performance

7.3   WAPDA's overall financial performance during the period has been satisfactory. Its self-
financing performance has been sufficient (exceeding 40%) in all the years, except in FY94 due
mainly to WAPDA's retirement of its Second bond issue of Rs.5.6 billion which it was unable to
roll-over because of unfavorable market conditions. A substantial tariff increase in November
1994 (averaging 24%) led to an improvement of WAPDA's financial performance, enabling it to
meet the financial covenants during FY95. Thus, WAPDA is expected to earn a satisfactory rate
of return on net fixed assets during FY95 of about 19.0%. Average revenue has steadily
increased from Rs. 1.06/kWh in FY90 to Rs. 1.75/kWh in FY95. Operating revenues increased
from Rs. 1.09/kWh in FY90 to Rs. 1.77/kWh in FY95 representing an average annual increase of
10.8%, while operating costs increased at an average annual rate of 13.3% during the same
period. The faster increase in operating expenses is due to a lower recovery of fuel costs in FY94
and FY95 and higher fuel costs resulting from an increase in thermal generation to compensate for
the low hydro generation during these two years. With average inflation rates running at about 10
- 12% during the period, WAPDA has been achieving rates of return well above inflation, based
on assets valued at historical book values, the normal practice of public sector agencies in
Pakistan. While WAPDA's debt-equity ratio has been satisfactory at about 57:43, WAPDA has
had to resort to substantial short-term borrowings in recent years, in part due to its high levels of
receivables, especially from Government agencies and departments, and the difficulty in
mobilizing long-term financing due to the general tightness in credit markets. WAPDA also faced
increasing difficulties in its bond issues due to the removal of GOP guarantees. Finally, WAPDA
continues to pay hydroelectric profits to the Provinces out of the surcharge it collects for the
purpose, and the balance of the payments is paid by the Federal Government. To safeguard
WAPDA's future financial viability, an arrangement where the tariffs will be adjusted to fully
cover hydroelectric profits has been agreed under the proposed project (para 7.9).
Fuel Adiustment Surchar2e
7.4   In the current tariff structure, all consumers pay a fuel adjustment surcharge (FAS), except
those who are charged flat rate tariffs. The current FAS rates vary from Paisas (Ps.) 7/kWh for
the lower two levels of domestic consumers to Ps. 75/kWh for other domestic and all the other
consumers. The FAS rates are normally adjusted in line with variations in fuel prices. However,
during the August 1993, fuel prices increased, but WAPDA was not allowed to adjust its FAS
rates accordingly, thereby adversely affecting its cash flow position. As a result, WAPDA was
unable to make its fuel payments at the new rates. To compensate for this shortfall, the
Government advanced Rs. 3.0 billion to fuel suppliers on WAPDA's account, which is being
recovered through the tariff increase for FY96. For the future, the Economic Coordination
Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has authorized WAPDA to automatically charge the FAS "in
accordance with the prescribed rules without reference to the Government." Accordingly, the
GOP agreed during negotiations that WAPDA would be authorized to automatically adjust the
FAS rate or any other component of its electricity tariff to ensure full recovery of fuel costs
(para 9.2).
Domestic Borrowin.
7.5   WAPDA's local debt comprise mainly of bonds issued in the local financial markets,
raising Rs. 21.0 billion in six bond issues since FY88. All issues were in the form of bearer



-55-
certificates except the fourth and fifth issues which had pre-maturity encashment features. During
the last two domestic borrowing programs, WAPDA experienced difficulties in mobilizing long-
term resources for its investments because of: (a) the withdrawal of Federal Government
guarantees on domestic borrowing of public corporations; (b) limits imposed by the State Bank of
Pakistan on the level of WAPDA bonds that can be purchased by the banking sector; and (c) lack
of well-developed discounting arrangements for the WAPDA bonds. Thus, WAPDA's last bond
issue was only marginally successful. To address the issue of meeting WAPDA's long-term
financing needs, a Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) Study is underway with the assistance
of consultants to review WAPDA's long-term financing options, assess the prospects of different
long-term financing instruments, and make policy reform recommendations to the Government to
enhance the long-term domestic resource mobilization capability of WAPDA. Accordingly, GOP
anid WAPDA agreed during negotiations to discuss the findings of the DRM Study with the Bank
by June 30, 1996, and implement the agreed recommendations of the study, as it relates to
WAPDA, by December 31, 1996 (para 9.3).
Accounts Receivable
7.6   Over the years, WAPDA's overall accounts receivable has varied around three months.
Collection from private consumers has been steady at around two months' of sales, but until
recently, Government receivables were a persistent problem, exceeding 3.0 months' sales. Since
November 1994, the Government and WAPDA have taken bold steps in improving the collection
of Government receivables. The ECC approved a set of budget adjustment measures to ensure
recovery of these receivables directly through deductions of payments due to WAPDA from
budgetary releases to the Government departments and agencies. As a result, in June 1995, some
Rs.3.0 billion was deducted and adjusted against WAPDA's debt service to the Government. This
has ensured WAPDA to comply with the existing covenant under the ongoing Bank loans, which
provides that all Federal and Provincial government departments and agencies settle all bills for
the supply of electricity within three months. In order to ensure that WAPDA 's cash flow is not
adversely affected by high levels of Government receivables, the existing agreement under
ongoing projects, whereby GOP has agreed to cause all federal and Provincial governmental
agencies to settle all bills for the supply of electricity by WAPDA within three months of receipt
of the bills, will be retained under the proposedproject (para 9.5).
7.7   There is also concern with WAPDA continuing to carry accounts receivable of over three
years in its books. As of February 1995, total receivables amounted to Rs. 14.8 billion of which
Rs. 4.8 billion (32%) have been outstanding for more than three years (see Table 7.2 below):
Table 7.2: WAPDA'S AGING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF FEBRUARY 1995

Accounts Receivable



-56-
7.8   Under the Rural Electrification Project (Ln. 3148-PAK/Cr. 2078-PAK), WAPDA agreed
to carry out an aging analysis of its accounts receivable, and reflect on its balance sheet only
receivables outstanding for less than three years and deemed collectible. Although the aging
analysis is done by WAPDA regularly, a determination of which accounts are deemed collectible
has not been made. To address this problem, WAPDA has agreed to increase its provision for
bad debts to ensure that its balance sheet properly reflect its financial condition with respect to
accounts receivable.  Furthermore, to ensure that WAPDA adjusts from  its books those
receivables over three years which are deemed uncollectible, the existing agreement under
ongoing projects where WAPDA has to carry out, by September 30 of each year, an aging
analysis of its accounts receivable and thereafter, but not later than December 31 in each year,
adjust its accounts receivable on its balance sheet of the previous financial year to reflect only
those receivables that are outstanding for less than three years and deemed collectible, will be
maintained under the proposed project (para 9.5).
Hydroelectric Profits
7.9   Under Article 161 of the Pakistan Constitution, the net profits earned by WAPDA on bulk
generation of power at hydroelectric stations, computed in accordance with a formula set by the
National Finance Commission of the Federal Government, are to be paid to the Province in which
the hydroelectric station is situated. In this regard, WAPDA was instructed by GOP to pay hydro
profits, estimated at Rs. 6.0 billion, to the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) for the Tarbela
Hydroelectric Plant. In order for WAPDA to make the payment and, at the same time, maintain
the 40% ICG level covenanted under the Bank loans, the Government introduced a hydro
surcharge in its tariff structure, which is levied on all consumers. The surcharge is currently
equivalent to 10.4% of the base tariff and raised about Rs. 4.3 billion in FY94. The balance
amounting to Rs. 1.7 billion was paid directly by the Federal Government to the NWFP. In the
proposed project, WAPDA would be required to pay hydroelectric profits to the Punjab Province
in accordance with the instructions of the Government. The required payments would be treated
as an outflow of WAPDA resources, and would be recovered directly from electricity consumers.
Therefore, in order to safeguard the financial viability of WAPDA, and minimize the financial
impact of distribution of profits on GBHP, the Government and WAPDA agreed during
negotiations that consumer tariffs will be adjusted to fully cover the payments of hydroprofits,
and that WAPDA should only pay hydroelectric profits that it collects for payment of such
profits (para 9.3).

The financing plan assumes that the required tariff increases to enable WAPDA to comply with
the financial covenant under the Bank loan agreements would be made from July 1 of each year.
The financing plan does not include any proceeds from future privatization of WAPDA's assets
nor does it include any budgetary allocation from GOP. Overall local loans are expected to
amount to US$354.0 million during the project period. After taking into account the proposed
loan and all committed loans, the foreign exchange financing gap for implementing the FY96-02
program is estimated to be US$412.0 million, equivalent to 6.3% of the investment program,
which is expected to be covered by export credits, and other loans and credits from bilateral and
multilateral sources. Based on WAPDA's past experience in mobilizing foreign financing from
these sources, it should be able to secure these funds on reasonable terms.
Future Finances
7.11   The projected balance sheet, income statement and sources and applications of funds
statement for the period FY96-FY2005 based on the covenants discussed above is shown in
Annex 7.1, and the assumptions used for preparing these forecasts, are shown in Annex 7.2. As
stated earlier, WAPDA's financial performance is currently assessed on the basis of a 40% ICG
covenant and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times. To ensure that WAPDA achieved these
covenants in FY96, the Government implemented a tariff increase in July 1995, averaging 14.5%
of the existing tariff (27.7% on an annualized basis). To further ensure that WAPDA's investment
program including the proposed project continues to be adequately financed, the existing financial



-58-
covenants would be maintained. Therefore, GOP and WAPDA agreed during negotiations to
repeat the covenant requiring GOP and WAPDA to take all necessary measures including
adjustment of the structure and levels of tariffs, to enable WAPDA to generate for each year
from internal sources 40% of its capital expenditures averaged over the previous, ongoing and
one ensuiing year (para 9.5).   Furthermore, in order to ensure that WAPDA's debt service
coverage continues to be satisfactory, GOP and WAPDA agreed that the debt limitation covenant
under ongoing Bank Group operations which provides that WAPDA would consult with the Bank,
should it seek to incur new  debt that would result in its debt service coverage falling  below  1.5,
will be repeated under the proposed project (para 9.5).
7.12   WAPDA's forecast financial performance  from  FY96-FY2005, based  on  these
assumptions (Base Case), is summarized in Table 7A4 below.

7.13 The sales forecast are based on demand projections, WAPDA's generation expansion plan,
and purchases from private sector power plants beginning in FY97. During the project period,
sales are expected to reach 65,072 GWh in FY2002 from 36,731 GWh in FY96, an annual
average increase of about 10% which is consistent with the average growth in electricity sales for
the past ten years. Based on these assumptions, WAPDA's forecast financial performance during
the period is expected to be ffilly satisfactory. The average tariff increases, on an annualized
basis, required from  these financial projections are as follows: 27.7%   in FY96, 13.1%   in FY97,



-59-
22.4% in FY98. 0.7% in FY99, 7.5% in FY2000, 0.5% in FY2001, 5.7% in FY2002, 9.1% in
FY2003, 5.7% in FY2004 and FY2005. The steeper tariff increases required in FY97 and FY98,
though still within levels of the past years, are mainly due to the purchases of power expected
from the private sector at the average bulk cost of 6.5 US cents per kWh. The higher tariff
increase projected in FY98 results from the large purchase of power from the private sector
(10,511 GWh) compared to 3,153 GWh in FY97, and the tariff premium paid to private power
plants commissioned by December 1997. Beyond FY98, the tariff increases required are within
reasonable levels averaging between 0.5% to 9.0%. Based on these projected tariff increases,
WAPDA's internal cash generation is expected to remain in excess of 40% of its average
investment program. The rate of return on net fixed assets throughout the project period are well
above inflation. The current ratio and capital structure remain to be fully satisfactory, particularly
during the later years of the project period, when WAPDA begins to retire long-term debt, and
borrowing requirements for capital expenditures decline.
7.14  WAPDA's management is aware of the need to strengthen its finances, and have agreed to
pursue cost efficiency measures in addition to tariff adjustments (para. 3.19). These measures
include, inter alia: (a) making improvements in operational efficiency and cost controls; (b) using
more prudent investment planning, taking into account the company's financial constraints; and
(c) maximizing loan maturities for future investments. In this regard, international management
consultants will, among others, assist WAPDA in implementing financial efficiency measures. In
addition, these consultants would review the ongoing study on WAPDA's financial performance
criteria, and make appropriate recommendations consistent with WAPDA's corporatization and
commercialization objectives.
7.15  Sensitivity tests of adverse scenarios with respect to high system losses, increases in
investment costs, increases in accounts receivable and commercial rates for all future foreign
exchange borrowings were made (Annex 7.3). Overall, the sensitivity analysis indicates that
WAPDA's required tariff increases are in line with the Base Case. Even in the most pessimistic
scenario, which combines high system losses of 24.2% (the highest level in the last five years),
increases in investments costs by 25% (which is unlikely as WAPDA adjusts its investment costs
in response to availability of financing), increases in accounts receivable to 3.6 months sales
(compared to the normal overall performance of 2.4 months' sales) and commercial foreign
exchange borrowing rates at 19% compared to past onlending rates between 11%-14%,
WAPDA's tariff increase requirements would remain reasonable with the exception of one year
(FY98, 28.8%). The probability of this one-year, worst-case scenario is very low, considering
that: (i) WAPDA is committed to reducing its line losses through a covenant with the ADB (para.
3.17) and is now implementing a time-bound, loss-reduction program; (ii) WAPDA's five-year
rolling investment program is subject to review with the Bank to assess its adequacy and ensure
its financeability, thereby making program costs increasing by 25% unlikely; (iii) WAPDA's
collection of Government accounts receivable has now been institutionalized, resulting in
automatic collection of Government receivables through direct deduction from budgetary
releases; and (iv) foreign borrowing from bilateral and multi-lateral sources have been onlent to
WAPDA at a maximum of 14% as the onlending spread (kept by the Government) is already high
at between 9%-1 1% (only 1 foreign loan out of 35 onlent to WAPDA in the past ten years has
been at 14%, the rest have have been onlent at 11% or lower).

8.    PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
Introduction
8.1   The project is attractive in terms of its fiscal sustainability, its contribution to power
development, its positive impact on the poor, and its high economic return. The implementation
of the proposed GBHP would be sustainable from a macroeconomic point of view provided that
GOP continues its reform program, and from an environment and resettlement point of view, as
long as the required mitigation measures are implemented. The least-cost analysis shows that
GBHP is an integral part of the optimal development plan of the Pakistan power system and it is
required to be implemented at its earliest commissioning date, even under more conservative and
unfavorable assumptions. The project was selected by the optimal generation expansion model,
after allowing for significant savings expected from energy conservation and demand-side
measures (paras 2.15 and 2.16). Furthermore, given its limited adverse environmental impact
compared to alternatives, GBHP is the best candidate for system expansion under integrated
resource planning methodology. The project is also expected to have a considerable beneficial
impact on poor households, as a result of the expansion of the rural electrification and reduction
of load shedding in rural areas.
8.2   The Economic Rate of Return (ERR), calculated on the investment program of the
national power system, consistent with the Base Scenario of the electricity demand forecast (para
2.10) is estimated at about 27%. When computed on the GBHP alone, the ERR is estimated at
about 30%.  There are also significant non-quantifiable benefits derived from the project
consisting of reduced cost of unserved energy, improved operational and managerial efficiency of
the utilities and further development of WAPDA's capability to address environmental and
resettlement issues related to hydropower projects. Further, the consolidation of the reform
program in the power sector as envisaged by the project is expected to have positive overall
economic benefits, consisting of savings achieved by raising the overall efficiency of operation of
the system, fiscal relief obtained from the reduction of subsidies and the decrease in public sector
power expenditures. The increased reliability of the power system will, in turn, save business lost
output and redundant investments. Such benefits, which are expected to continue materializing
beyond the implementation period of the project along with the introduction of sectoral reforms,
would further increase the estimated ERRs.
8.3   The results of an integrated risk analysis indicate that the probability of an ERR
(calculated on the power development program including GBHP) falling below the opportunity
cost of capital is estimated at 8 percent.
Macroeconomic Impact of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project
8.4   In order to analyze the impact of the project on the fiscal and balance-of-payments
position of the country, an assessment of its macroeconomic sustainability has been carried out.
Such assessment has been developed on the basis of a comparison of key macroeconomic
projections for the FY1995-2010 period derived from WAPDA's investment program including
the project, with those resulting from WAPDA's investment program without GBBP, using data
on investment costs, import requirements, and the financing plan for the project (see paras 3.14,



-61-
3.15, and Annex 3.5). Both scenarios assume a somewhat slower pace of macroeconomic and
structural reforms than that proposed in the Government's reform program as described in the
1993 Policy Framework Paper.
8.5   The results of the analysis can be summarized as follows: (a) the share of WAPDA's
investment program, including GBHP, in the Public Sector Development Program would not
exceed historical levels even at the peak of project investments in FY1998, and would decline
significantly thereafter, as new thermal power plants are to be built by the private sector; (b) due
mainly to the policy of no new public sector investments in thermal power plants, the budgetary
public investment/GDP ratio would decline from 4.5% in FYI 995 to 4% by FY2000; and (c) the
external current account deficit is expected to worsen somewhat during the project
implementation period but would improve over time in line with expected improvements in export
and economic performance.
8.6   Given its lower cost per unit of electricity generated compared to other alternatives,
implementation of GBHP will result in lower electricity tariffs, and lower increase in the rate of
petroleum imports, which, in turn, will have a beneficial impact on the economy and on the
balance-of-payments. Moreover, given the high economic cost of power shortages (estimated
between US$0.27 and US$0.75/kWh), the reduction or elimination of load shedding resulting
from the implementation of the project is expected to remove an important constraint to
Pakistan's economic growth, and in the industrial sector in particular.
8.7  It should be noted that since the local currency requirements during the construction
period of the project and the debt service for the foreign loans are expected to be met from
WAPDA's cash flow, there should be no direct impact on GOP's finances and no direct crowding
out of other priority public investment projects, including those in the social sectors. However,
GBHP financing could affect the funding of other priority public sector projects indirectly. That
is, if budgetary resources would be required for the financing of GBHP, there could be a
reduction in the local counterpart funding of other high priority projects. Furthermore, if a
significant deterioration in the macroeconomic performance of the country were to occur in the
medium term, the overall balance-of-payments sustainability could be further worsened by the
implementation of GBHP. A lower export growth, in particular, would lead to debt servicing
difficulties and a deterioration in creditworthiness over the medium-term.
8.8   There is, therefore, a need to closely monitor the consistency between the power sector
investment program and the overall macroeconomic targets, as well as the adequacy of the
funding of GOP's Core Public Expenditure Program and the Social Action Program, as discussed
and reviewed with the Bank on annual basis. The agreement reached during negotiations (para
3.15) would ensure that the financing of GBHP will be independent from budgetary resources, so
as to protect the funding of high priority public sector projects including in the social sector. As
regards the macroeconomic performance of the country, the Government's decision to slow the
pace of the reform program in June 1995 raised a number of uncertainties, and resulted in a sharp
deterioration in Pakistan's balance-of-payments position during the July-October 1995 period. As
a first step to reversing the deterioration, the Government announced in late October 1995 a



-62-
package of measures aimed at strengthening Pakistan's fiscal and external position.'   In
November 1995, the Government of Pakistan reached, ad referendum, agreement with the IMF
staff on a stabilization program for the remainder of FY1996 and for FY1997, which provides the
basis for a stand-by arrangement.  This is expected to allow the resumption of a more
comprehensive macroeconomic and structural adjustment program at an early date.  Such a
program  would help improve Pakistan's creditworthiness over the medium  term, thereby
mitigating macroeconomic uncertainties.
Least-Cost Analysis
8.9    The least-cost analysis to assess the level of additional power capacity required by the
system, and to compare GBHP with alternatives is detailed in Annex 8. 1. The analysis has been
developed on the basis of the three electricity demand forecast scenarios, described in para 2. 10.
Under all three scenarios, the proposed project is selected at its earliest completion date. The
Internal Rate of Return calculated on the difference between the power generation costs of the
expansion program with and without GBHP is 33%. A sensitivity analysis has been developed to
test: (a) the robustness of the least-cost solution to variations in the main parameters of the
analysis, such as a higher discount rate, lower cost of unserved energy, elimination of the
reliability criterion, higher capital cost for GBHP, lower and higher demand forecast; (b) the
robustness of GBHP as part of the least-cost solution through changes in the number of private
thermal power projects which could be implemented before the commissioning date of GBHP;
and (c) the inclusion in the analysis of a group of medium-size hydropower projects identified by
GOP with the assistance of GTZ (the German Agency for Technical Cooperation).
8.10   Sensitivity on the Main Parameters. The results of the sensitivity analysis on the main
parameters used in the analysis indicate that GBHP is an integral part of the least-cost solution,
and that it should be implemented as early as possible. In particular, the least-cost expansion
generation program including GBHP is not affected by the adoption of a higher discount rate
(15%), the elimination of the reliability criterion, the introduction of a low cost of unserved
energy (US$0.27/kWh), and higher capital cost for GBHP (+40%), even under the Low demand
scenario.
8.11   Sensitivity on New Private Projects. As also indicated in para 2.11, the least-cost analysis
indicates that under the Base demand scenario, about 5200 MW of private power thermal
projects would be required to be commissioned by FY2002 along with the ongoing projects and
GBHP. Under the High and the Low demand scenarios, the required amount of private
projects by FY2002 is about 7200 MW, and 3100 MW respectively. In order to test the
robustness of the GBHP, a higher number of private thermal power projects has been imposed on
the least-cost solution under the Base and Low scenarios. The results are given in Table 8.1
below.
1 These included a 7% devaluation of the rupee against the US dollar, a 10% import surcharge, a 5% minimum
tariff on selected tax-exempted imports, and a 7% increase in domestic prices of petroleum products. The
State Bank of Pakistan was also given full authority to implement a tight monetary policy, and subsequently
raised interest rates for concessional credit by 100 basis points to 14%.

8.12   Alternative Hydropower Plants. About fifteen medium-size hydropower projects have
been recently studied at inventory level by the Sarhad Hydroelectric Development Organization
(SHYDO) with the assistance of GTZ. A detailed list of these projects, whose size varies from a
minimum of 80 MW to a maximum of 850 MW, is given in Annex 8.1. Although a
comprehensive data base (including some hydrological data) has been developed, more
information is required to consider these projects at par with the already identified hydropower
projects included in the base case. For example, no data related to land acquisition, resettlement,
environmental mitigation costs is available. More detail work is needed for the selection of design
parameters, including an assessment of seismic risks and several other design parameters
according to site conditions.

\a Capacity in addition to the optimal requirements of the system
8.13   However, for the purpose of confirming the economic integrity of GBHP, several
sensitivity analyses were carried out with the SHYDO projects as represented in the available
reports. These analyses indicate that when this broader range of projects is considered, GBHP is
still selected at its earliest possible completion date. Thus, the medium size hydropower projects
identified by SHYDO, even at the preliminary costs and conditions presented in available reports,
are not competitive with GBHP. Further, the analyses also indicate that many of these projects
might be marginally more attractive than thermal power projects. While this conclusion might be
a result of the rather incomplete data available and the extremely preliminary nature of the cost
estimates, further investigations are merited to establish the economic viability and the
environmental impact of the SHYDO projects.
8.14   Under technical assistance provided by the Bank, a report on the "Feasibility of Setting up
100 Small Hydel Schemes in NWFP" was finalized in July 1987. The hydro schemes are located
in six districts of NWFP, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat and Chitral.  A total
potential of about 75 MW was identified through 100 schemes. Sixty-three of these schemes are



-64-
situated at remote locations, at least 10 miles from the grid. Given their size and incomplete
information available, such schemes cannot be included in the present analysis. Certainly, their
size indicates that they cannot compete with GBHP. However, it is suggested that more work be
carried out to investigate the feasibility of these schemes, particularly in the context of an optimal
rural electrification plan.
Environmental Benefits and Costs
8.15   The proposed project will provide major environmental benefits from a lower increase of
consumption of petroleum products, in particular High Sulfur Fuel Oil and Diesel Oil. On the
basis of simulations of the operation of the power system with and without GBHP, the difference
in petroleum products consumption and associated major pollutants emissions have been
estimated. Table 8.2 below presents the increase in pollutants emissions taking into account the
2
characteristics of the fuels used in power generation

8.16   There are no significant negative externalities associated with the implementation of the
project. The environmental and resettlement mitigation measures (see Chapter 6), whose costs
have been included in the least-cost and economic analyses, are expected to more than
compensate the loss of welfare to the population in the project area. In particular, through the
provision of irrigation facilities, the agricultural productivity of the land (development of the spoil
banks) to be returned to the farmers is expected to be twice that of the total land to be acquired
for the project, which is mainly rainfed. The low water flows between the barrage and the Indus
river confluence with the Kabul river (41 km) would not have a significant negative impact on
vegetation, and on the recreational and economic activities of the population in the area.
Additional income benefits for the population are expected from the development of fisheries in
the barrage and headponds, more than offsetting the reduced fish-catches in the river. Public and
private transportation and economic activities in the area will not be significantly affected, given
the construction of 47 bridges (1 for railway, 34 for vehicles and 12 for pedestrian) as well as 26
superpassages along the power channel. The ERR estimates (see paras. 8.21 and 8.25) would
further improve if the above net positive externalities were included.
Poverty Imoact
8.17   The development of the power sector in Pakistan is essential to support the country's
economic growth, which is the basis for a sustained improvement of the living standard of a

rapidly growing population. Expansion of power supply is required to reduce the high cost of
electricity load shedding, and to continue increasing the access to electricity in rural areas 3, where
poor households are mostly concentrated 4. The implementation of GBHP will allow to continue
and accelerate the rural electrification program, thereby generating direct and indirect benefits to
poor households. In particular, an estimated two million additional electricity consumers, mainly
rural population, would be supplied by the project at a tariff considerably lower than that of
alternatives. The experience in similar countries 5 indicates that rural electrification, by facilitating
growth of new economic activities, and a more rapid growth of agricultural production, stimulates
economic development, improves the quality of life and the condition of the poorest groups of the
society. The availability of electricity may also help to accelerate industrial growth by improving
efficiency and lowering costs in areas that already experiencing economic growth. The project
will also provide direct relief to the rural population through a reduction or elimination of load
shedding, which, at present, severely affects rural areas.
8.18   As a result of the implementation of the project, and in particular of the Integrated
Regional Development Plan (para 6.12), social improvements, agricultural, industrial, and
commercial development will be implemented. The plan will include specific programs for
vulnerable groups and emphasize long-term job development in the region. Finally, the project is
expected to provide employment to about 10,000 workers.
Economic Rate of Return - ERR
8.19   ERR on tlka Power Investment Program. In order to evaluate the economic viability of the
proposed project, an ERR has been calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit
streams associated with the overall least-cost investment program for the period FY95-2006 of
which the proposed project is an integral part (Annex 8.2). Benefits are valued in terms of the
incremental demand that can be served under this program compared to the lower level of demand
that could be served if no new supply capacity were added to the power system. Similarly, the
costs are the difference between power system costs for meeting the demand forecast with this
program (FY95-2006) and the system costs without any investments in new supply capacity and
related transmission and distribution facilities (FY95-1999).
8.20   Total benefits for new residential users is divided into the following two components: (a)
substitution of existing methods of lighting, i.e., kerosene lanterns, by electric lighting, that is
resource cost savings; and (b) the consumers' surplus derived from the additional quantity of
electricity above the substituted level caused by the large drop in the price of energy that comes
with a switch from non-electrical method of lighting to electric forms. For the other consumer
categories, i.e., industrial, agricultural, and others, the basis for valuing the benefits after FY2000
is their avoided cost. This is the cost that those users would incur if they had to meet their
3   Despite considerable progress made in the rural electrification program, less than half of the country's
population has access to electricity. WAPDA's rural electrification program has been constrained by the
insufficient generation capacity.

electricity needs by installing and operating diesel-based generators or tubewells, instead of taking
electricity from the national grid.
8.21   Results. The ERR for the power sector development program under the Base case is
estimated at about 27%. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to assess the robustness of the
ERR to more unfavorable discrete changes in the main parameters of the analysis, such as a lower
demand, higher costs, lower benefits, schedule slippage, and additional number of private power
plants.
8.22   Sensitivity Analysis. The results indicate that the ERR is quite robust to any change in the
main parameters and to any combination thereof In particular, the main outcomes of the analysis
are the following:
(a)   in the Base demand scenario, the ERR is in the range of between 19% to 27%; and
(b)   in the Low demand scenario, the ERR is in the range of 14% to 20%, with the
exception of 11.3% when an increase of 20% in the capital cost of the program is
associated with an overall delay in program commissioning of 2 years.
8.23   ERR on the Project Alone. Because of the interdependence in the power sector, the
standard methodology adopted by the Bank for power projects, and followed in the above
analysis, is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the investment program as a whole.
Although the least-cost analysis has demonstrated the robustness of GBHP to the main
parameters of the analysis, such as increase in capital costs, lower demand, etc., it is desirable to
more directly assess the impact of certain adverse events on the economic viability of GBHP. The
reason for this separate analysis is that large hydropower projects tend to be more susceptible to
delays and cost overruns than smaller thermal projects.
8.24  The ERR is calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams associated
with the implementation of GBHP. The costs associated with GBHP consist of the estimated
capital costs and related operating and maintenance costs. Benefits are valued in terms of the
incremental demand that can be served by GBHP, adopting a methodology almost identical to the
one used in the previous analysis.
8.25   The results of this analysis indicate that the estimated ERR is about 30%6. Such result is
independent of the overall demand scenario, as the least-cost analysis has demonstrated that under
the low scenario, GBHP is still required at its earliest completion date. A sensitivity analysis has
been also developed to determine the robustness of the economics of the project to changes in
cost profile and schedule. The results indicate that the estimated ERR would remain well above
20% even under a combination of high project cost overruns (+30%) and considerable delay in
the commissioning of the project (2 years).
6  The ERR for GBHP alone is higher than the ERR for the program as a whole, since GBHP is more
economical than the thermal power plants that make up the bulk of the generation investment in the least-cost
development program.



-67-
8.26 Economic Impact of Higher Water Compensation Releases. As indicated in para. 6.4,
detailed studies and evaluations indicated that, in order to mitigate the potential hydrological and
ecological impacts of reduced flows in the Indus river, a compensation release of 28 cumecs
would be more than adequate. Nevertheless, the water quality in the river downstream will be
closely monitored, especially during the dry low flow season, and any adverse environmental
impacts quickly identified and mitigated by adjusting the water release pattern. In this context, a
sensitivity analysis have been carried out to assess the economic impact of a higher compensation
release of about 420 cumecs, which is equivalent to the existing flow in the river during the dry
low flow season. This would result in a lower level of energy generated by the project, as the
water flow in the power channel would decrease to about 5 cumecs. The results of the least-cost
analysis demonstrates that, even under such unfavorable assumption, GBHP is still selected at its
earliest completion date. The results of the economic analysis on GBHP alone indicates the ERR
would decline from about 30% to 27%. Such reduction would be lower for the ERR calculated
on the investment program, as the decrease in the energy generated by GBHP would be partially
compensated by other power plants.
Risks and Mitieation Measures
8.27  Risks. Bank's experience indicates that there are always substantial risks associated with
large scale hydroelectric projects. In order to reduce such risks, various measures have been
considered in the preparation, design, institutional arrangements and processing of the proposed
project.  In particular, risks which could affect the proposed project could relate to the
macroeconomic performance of the country, possible excess amount of private power supply, and
to project implementation. The risk of a deterioration in the economic performance of the country
and related creditworthiness could result in a lower electricity demand, delay in implementation
and/or higher cost of both public and private sector power projects. The risk of an excessive
power supply due to a higher than required level of new private thermal power plants could result
in a delay in the operational start-up of GBHP.
8.28  Risks related to project implementation that could result in potential cost overruns, delays
or a combination of both, could stem from the following: (a) non-mobilization of financing
requirements, including the local financing component, (b) a unsatisfactory resettlement,
relocation, and compensation of Project Affected People and delay in implementing steps
identified to mitigate negative environmental and cultural heritage impacts, (c) construction delay,
and (d) risks of engineering nature generally associated with hydroelectric projects, such as
geological and hydrological uncertainties.
8.29  Risks Mitigation Measures. Various measures have been designed to mitigate the risks
described above so that the economic viability of the project will be safeguarded. The broader
macroeconomic risk of deterioration of the short-term financial balance is addressed by GOP's
commitment to an acceptable fiscal and monetary program supported by appropriate structural
measures designed to strengthen its revenue mobilization capacity. The risk of inconsistency
between the macroeconomic framework and the increased level of Public Sector Development
Program resulting from the implementation of GBHP, has been mitigated by the agreements
proposed in para. 3.15. The risk related to the amount of private power supply, which could
result in a possible mismatch between power demand and supply has been mitigated by the



-68-
agreement reached during negotiations that the Government will introduce policies and an
appropriate solicitation mechanism to ensure timely implementation of the required additional
capacity. (para 2.13).
8.30  The specific project implementation risks have been also mitigated so that the probabilities
of delay in project implementation and cost overruns are considerably reduced. The risk of non-
mobilization of financing has been mitigated by the high priority given by GOP to the
development of the project, the level of commitments of all cofinanciers, and by the legal
agreements requiring WAPDA to generate local funds through improvement in efficiency and
satisfactory tariffs needed to comply with the financial covenants. WAPDA's consistent record
over the last seven years in meeting an ambitious cash generation covenant provides additional
comfort in the project. The risks related to an unsatisfactory resettlement, relocation and
compensation of affectees and delay in implementing steps identified to mitigate negative
environmental and cultural heritage impacts are being largely mitigated by the comprehensiveness
of the Environmental and Resettlement Management Plan and monitoring arrangements through:
(a) setting a Public Information Center at the project site; (b) obtaining assistance of a Project
Non-Governmental Organization and an independent consultant for monitoring resettlement and
relocation of affectees and implementation of environmental mitigation steps; (c) WAPDA's
commitment to implement an Integrated Regional Development Plan to support locally-based
economic activities in the area; and (d) continued support from the Independent Environment and
Resettlement Review Panel. To mitigate risks of engineering nature, WAPDA is being assisted by
its consultants, and a Panel of Experts will periodically visit the site. Further, geological and
hydrological uncertainties are reduced to a minimum because of the extensive investigations at the
sites of the barrage, power channel and power house, and the comprehensive knowledge gained in
the construction and operation of Tarbela Dam. Possible construction delays are being minimized
by the advanced stage of procurement of the major works, ensuring effective project management
and supervision through WAPDA's internal organization for the project and assistance of its
consultants. To avoid delays caused by claims of contractors, a Dispute Review Board is being
appointed to settle all claims as expeditiously as possible.
8.31   Risks Analysis. The risks described above have been analyzed and summarized under
different scenarios. Probabilities have been assigned to each scenario, so that a weighted average
ERR and a probability distribution for the ERR can be obtained. The scenarios considered in the
analysis are the following: demand uncertainties (high, base, and low scenarios), cost profiles (no
cost overruns, 15 percent costs overruns, 30 percent cost overruns), schedule delay (no delay, I
year delay, and 2 year delay) and amount of additional capacity provided by private projects
(3100 MW, 5200 MW, and 7200 MW). The analysis has been carried out separately for the ERR
on the overall power sector program and for the ERR on GBHP alone. Details of the assumptions
and results are given in Annex 8.2. A cumulative probability of ERR on the power system
program is provided in Figure 8.1.
8.32  The results indicate that the risk-weighted ERR calculated on the overall power
investment program is 18.5%, which is lower than the ERR of the Base Case, but still
considerably higher than the opportunity cost of capital estimated at 12%. The probability of the
ERR falling below the opportunity cost of capital is estimated at 8%. Furthermore, the risk-
weighted ERR is quite robust to changes in the basic probabilities.

ERR
8.33   The above analysis has been repeated for GBHP alone.  In this case, the risk-weighted
ERR is over 23%, and its probability of falling below the opportunity cost of capital is zero. This
is because under any unfavorable scenarios considered (including project implementation delay of
3 years and higher cost overruns), the ERR is always in the range of 18%-30%. In particular, in
the event of an excess of private projects commissioned by FY2001, the consequence to GBHP
will be a delay in its commissioning date, which is not, however, considerably affecting its
economic viability. Figure 8.2 below shows the cumulative probability of ERR on GBHP alone.

Energy Conservation Activities
1.        The government's energy strategy for the next five-year plan places
special emphasis on the introduction of demand management measures aimed at
restraining the growth of energy demand. As part of these measures, GOP intends
to improve energy efficiency in the economy, particularly in the industrial
sector, by strengthening pricing and non-pricing policies, adopting demand
management policies such as load shedding/management at peak periods, and
promoting interfuel substitution towards the use of indigenous resources such as
coal and gas.
2.        As regards non-pricing measures to improve energy efficiency and
conservation, GOP intends to support the ongoing activities which are being
implemented by the National Energy Conservation Center (ENERCON). For the Eighth
five-year plan, GOP has endorsed the following ENERCON-sponsored investments: (a)
Power Factor Improvement Program, aimed at saving 1,343 GWh/year or over TOE
115,000 (equivalent to a net saving of 76 MW/year of installed generation
capacity) through the installation of bank capacitors at 2,400 industrial plants,
financed by ADB, (b) Commercial Building Lighting Efficiency Improvement Program,
aimed at saving about 110 GWh/year (equivalent to TOE 9,500/year) by replacing
lighting fixtures in the commercial buildings of the main cities; (b) Industrial
Boiler and Steam Systems Efficiency Improvement Program, which would save 0.23
million TOE/year of natural gas by replacing and retrofitting low-efficient
boilers among 500-750 industrial consumers; (c) Municipal Pumpsets Efficiency
Improvement Program, aimed at saving 60-70 GWh/year (equivalent to TOE 6,000
thousand/year) by retrofitting 500 large capacity pumpsets used in conjunction
with water supply and sewerage operation (d) Agricultural Tubewells Efficiency
Improvement Program, consisting of implementing retrofit measures for 26,000
pumpsets for tubewell irrigation operation, saving about 180-200 GWh/year
(equivalent to over TOE 17,000/year), and (e) Road Transport Fuel Efficiency
Improvement Program, for the tune-up of gasoline and diesel-driven vehicles aimed
at fuel savings of 11%. In addition, GOP intends to promulgate regulations aimed
at promoting energy conservation among energy producers/consumers, and to concede
preferential duties/taxes for energy efficient equipment.
3.        GOP is initiating action to enact an Energy Conservation and Management
Bill that would establish a firm legal and organizational framework for the
National Energy Conservation Program in the country. When enacted (GOP plans to
submit the bill on the proposed law to the Parliament for ratification in the near
future), the proposed law would provide the legal basis for the establishment of
the Pakistan Energy Conservation Council (PECC), which would have the authority to
enforce regulations on energy conservation. Under the provisions of the proposed
law, ENERCON would be transformed into an executing agency for the PECC, and
accordingly charged with responsibilities previously outside its mandate,
including: (a) developing schemes to mobilize and channel financing for energy
conservation investments, including the creation of a National Energy Conservation
Fund; (b) implementing technology transfer schemes in the field of energy
conservation; and (c) developing or revising equipment performance specifications
to incorporate minimum energy efficiency standards for procurement by public
sector organizations. Accordingly, ENERCON with the Technical Assistance of
ESMAP, is in the process of preparing a Long-Term Strategy and an Action Plan for
the period 1993-98 which would transform the center into a sustainable
organization.

Consultant for Energv Efficiency and Load Management Proiect Development
Terms of Reference
Staff Costs (USD)       $100,000
Travel Costs (USD)      $25,000
Total Costs             $125,000
1.  Consultant will begin work in Pakistan on or about December 1, 1996 and work
will continue for a term of six-nine months, depending on work program and budget.
2.  Objective of the consultant assignment will be to assist GOP and WAPDA in
assessing the effectiveness of ongoing DSM program and, based on this assessment,
outline a program of additional measurea and related instuttuational arrangements to
ensure effective implementation of an agressive DSM program in line of with GOP's
stated energy policy objectives.
3.  In meeting these objectives consultant will carry out the following tasks:
(a)   Compile and review the background materials in the Bank and other
sources including USAID concerning ongoing and previous initiatives on
DSM, including load management, power factor correction, end-use energy
efficiency, market transformation, and supply-side energy efficiency efforts,
undertaking by WAPDA, ENERCON, KESC and pertinent NGOs and
private organizations.
(b)   Compile and review the numerous WAPDA, ENERCON, MWP, GOP
documents dealing with the role of and targets for energy efficiency, load
management and DSM in the energy sector and the power sector,
specifically, Report of Prime Minister's Task Force on Energy. National
Power Plan Pakistan. Pakistan Household Energy Strategy Study. and
others.
(c)   Identify, recommend, and implement remediation of gaps in the planning
data bases available on customer, rate class, and tariff populations, load
shapes by rate class, end-use, and appliance (especially peak demand
contributions),  end-use  categories  and  characteristics,  selected
demographics, and salient regional/state-by-state variations.

(d)   Identify, recommend, and implement remediation of gaps in the
planning/analytic capabilities of ENERCON, WAPDA, KESC, and MWP
as regards demand-side planning and management. Develop and coordinate
some shared load and energy impact estimation, project cost estimation,
and benefit/cost and financial evaluation capabilities that are shared across
the government and utility organizations.
(e)   Identify and help develop key institutional capabilities and inter-
organization coordination needs for ENERCON, WAPDA, KESC, and
MWP as regards meeting the GOP's DSM objectives. This effort should in
particular build upon the nascent coordination role played by the ad hoc
Y'oint Working Group for Energy Conservation/Management", formed by
office order of WAPDA dated February 3, 1995. This working group,
comprised of ENERCON, WADA, and MWP senior staff, could be the
beginning of an inter-organizational planning and implementation
supervision body that could ensure the overall GOP goals for energy
efficiency and load management are met.
(f)    Using the newly-developed planning data bases, analytic capabilies, and
inter-organization coordination abilities, re-evaluate and fine-tune the
several GOP and Bank plans for energy efficiency and load management.
This re-evaluation should seek to ensure that the most cost-effective and
highest-impact projects and measures are being pursued and in the right
order.
(g)   Again working with the individual organizations and the Joint Working
Group, develop detailed implementation strategies for the Bank-financed
Energy Efficiency Project. These implementation strategies should
takeaccount and capitalize on the institutional capabilities of all the
government, utility, NGO, financing, manufacturing, and private sector
groups within Pakistan.
(h)   Develop a monitoring and tracking scheme that would allow both the GOP
and the Bank to track the success and progress of the Bank-financed
project and other parallel projects addressing energy efficiency and load
management efforts.

Ghazi-Barotha Hvdropower Project
Setting Up a Separate Proiect Entity of WAPDA to Operate the GBHP
Terms of Reference for Consultants
Background:
1.   The Government of Pakistan, in conjunction with the Water and Power Development
Authority, is implementing a program for the corporatization and privatization of the Pakistan
Power Sector. Towards this objective, a Strategic Plan has been prepared by WAPDA, with
the assistance of international consultants' financed by USAID, and approved by the Cabinet
Committee on Privatization on July 18, 1992. This, along with the recommendations of a high
level Energy Task Force (ETF), culminated in the policy pronouncement in March 1994 titled
'Policy Framework and Package of Incentives for Private Sector Power Generation in
Pakistan".
2.   The Plan envisages the implementation of the program in  two sequential phases:
corporatization and commercialization of the existing entities, followed by the
divestiture/privatization of the corporatized entities. The restructured power sector would
comprise: WAPDA reorganized as a holding company; privately-owned thermal generation
companies operating under free market competition; publicly-owned, corporatized entities
responsible for the operation of multipurpose hydropower facilities; an independent, regulated
transmission and despatch entity responsible for the integrated operation of the system and for
the wholesale power market; private companies responsible for supplying electricity to the final
consumers; and an independent National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to set
standards and regulate the power sector.
Obiectives:
In consonance with the stated policy which calls for WAPDA to own and operate major
hydropower facilities as separate, corporatized subsidiaries of a WAPDA holding company,
WAPDA has proposed to build the GBHP as a part of its least-cost development plan for the
power sector. Therefore, it plans to:
(i) set up a subsidiary 'Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Company" (GBHC) to organize
and operate GBHP as a discrete, autonomous profit center engaged in hydropower
production; and
International Resources Group IIRG); Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett Inc.; and Hunton and Williams.

Ghazi Barotha HydroDower Project
Detailed Project DescriDtion
A. Proiect Description
I.        The proposed Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project is a major run off the river
environmentally sustainable power project located at about 7 km. downstream of Tarbela dam.
The project would utilize about 76 meters of available head between Tarbela tailrace and Indus
River's confluence with Haro River -- a stretch of 63 km. There would be no consumptive use of
the water by the project. The optimization and economic studies undertaken for the Feasibility
Report resulted in a recommended Project for implementation, of five 290 MW units, giving an
installed capacity of 1,450 MW, a channel capacity of 1600 cumecs, and headpond live storage of
about 25 M cu m. The project will have the following main components, and its principal data are
indicated in Attachment 1:
(a)  Barrage. A barrage about 7 km downstream of Tarbela with a gated head regulator
to divert water released from Tarbela into the power channel. The barrage would
also raise the water level at the entrance to the power channel to maximize the power
generation capability. A pond of approximately 7 km in length and 1.5 km in width
with about 62 MCM live storage capacity, created between Tarbela dam and the
barrage would be used to re-regulate the Tarbela peaking outflows on a daily basis.
The barrage works will include the following main features:
(i)    a normal pond level at El. 340 m;
(ii)   20 standard bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 332.2 m;
(iii)   8 undersluice bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 326.0 m;
(iv)   a dividing island of about 400 m width, separating the undersluice bays
from the standard bays;
(v)   a head regulator of 8 bays, each of 18.3 m width, with a crest at El. 333 m
for controlling flows into the power channel;
(vi)   a skimming platform for separating flows between the head regulator and
the undersluice bays so as to reduce the entry of coarser sediment into the
power channel;
(vii)  left and right guide banks for guiding the approach flow and for retaining
the water in the pond;



-93-
ANNEX 4.1
Page 2 of 10
(viii) a fuse plug in the right guide embankment for augmenting the flood
discharging capability of the standard and undersluice bays in the event of
extreme floods;
(ix)   a separation dyke and a cunette to assist in developing a central river
channel for flows from the standard bays; and
(x)   protective embankments for low-lying areas along the pond shoreline.
The barrage will also provide a road crossing of the Indus river.
(b)  Power Channel. A 52 km concrete lined power channel to convey up to 1,600
cumecs of water to the powerhouse and connected to two head ponds of about 25
million cubic meters with structural arrangements for impoundment of surplus
waters. The power channel would have a bed width of about 58.4 meters, a water
depth of about 9 meters, and a bed slope of 1:9,600, with a resulting velocity of 2.33
mis. The concrete lining would be 135 mm thick, reinforced, and joints with water
stops would be provided at 9 to 12 m intervals. The underdrainage system is
designed to maintain groundwater levels below the invert of the channel.  The
underdrainage system would comprise a filter layer under the concrete lining along
the bed and sides of the power channel. The power channel works will include the
following principal structures: cross drainage structures - 26 super-passages, one
culvert and 18 inlets to the power channel, five escapes and 33 bridges including:
one railroad bridge, one arterial road bridge, five district road bridges, six village
road bridges and 20 minor bridges. A significant impact will be created by the
quantity of excavated material that has to be disposed of, which will cover about
1,640 ha of land. In order to mitigate this impact, suitable measures (including
tubewell irrigation) have been proposed to permit the return of this land to the
affected people for agriculture. Provisions will be made to minimize the areas of land
taken out of cultivation at any time and to return the disposal areas to cultivation as
early as possible.
(c)  Power Station. A power station located at the end of the channel with five units of
290 MW each. The power station complex works include:
(i)   a forebay connecting the power channel tail regulator to the power intake,
and including the spillway intake and the entrances to the two headponds;
(ii)  headponds, north and south of the forebay, with low-level outlet works and
embankments constructed largely of material from required excavations;
(iii) a spillway with a multibarrel siphon intake, stilling basin and baffle chute
leading to the tailrace;



-94-                             ANNEX 4.1
Page 3 of 10
(iv)  a power intake within the forebay leading to the penstocks;
(v)  penstocks, to serve each of the five units, connecting the intake to the
powerhouse;
(vi)  a powerhouse containing five turbine-generator units with an installed capacity
of 1,450 MW, set deep enough to take full advantage of the range of Indus
river water levels in generating energy;
(vii) a tailrace channel to carry the discharge back to the river; and
(viii) a switchyard to receive the output from the powerhouse and connect it to the
WAPDA high voltage grid through 500 kV circuits.
(d)  Transmission Works.  The transmission requirement for evacuation of power from
Ghazi-Barotha and its interconnection with the power system consists of the
following:
(i)  500 kV transmission lines
a.   Diversion to Barotha of both 500 kV existing transmission lines between
Tarbela and Gatti (140 km);
b.   Two 500 kV transmission lines between Barotha and Rewat substation
(200 km); and
(ii)  extension of the 500 kV Rewat substation for the connection of the above
mentioned Barotha-Rewat transmission line;
B. Proiect Studies. Safety Aspects and Status of Investigation
2.        Studies. While finalizing the design, the following studies were carried out:
(a) meteorological, hydrological and seismic observations, their analysis and appropriate
hydraulic model studies for barrage and power complex;
(b)  sediment studies, using mathematical models, to determine sediment estimated
outflow from the Tarbela, impact on Tarbela's live storage and sediment's transport in
the power channel;
(c)  techno-economic studies to determine the most optimum capacity of power channel
in terms of cumecs and merits of single versus double channel;



ANNA 4. 1
Page 4 of 10
(d)  layout studies to finalize location of barrage and power complex and alignment of
power channel; and
(e)  system studies to determine generating unit size, system transmission, voltage and
configuration;
3.        Present Status. The Project's feasibility study, field investigations, laboratory testing,
analysis of various studies, project layout of structures, detailed design criteria and detailed
designs, technical specifications and bid documents for civil works have been successfully
completed and the same have been reviewed by the Bank , an independent technical panel
consisting of eight experts and an independent Enviromnental Resettlement Panel from time to
time. The Panesl of Experts have concurred with technical soundness, economical viability and
environmental sustainability of the overall project. A summary of the project's hydrology,
geology and seismicity is provided in the following paragraphs.
C. Hydrolofv
4.        Flood Hydrology. During the summer season (June to September), storm run off
from an area of about 10,000 sq. km immediately upstream of Tarbela is usually superimposed on
high snowmelt flows. Nearly all annual maximum floods have occurred in July or August.
Annual maximum one-day flows over the past 30 years have mostly been in the range of 8,500 to
11,300 cumecs. The flood of record (1929) at Tarbela is estimated at about 18,700 cumecs. The
maximum peak outflow in the last 15 years of Tarbela operation, has been 14,100 cumecs during
July 1989.
5.        Design Flood. The design flood has been considered as the flow which can pass
through the barrage's gated bays with no surcharge above normal pond level. It has been
estimated as 18,700 cumecs equal to the 1929 flood of record (a return period of over 200 years).
The Tarbela Dam with its two large spillways and five tunnels can release up to 48,700 cumecs
which is more than twice the flood of record. The peak outflow under emergency conditions with
Tarbela reservoir full has been estimated at 47,000 cumecs when units 15-17 have been installed
on Tunnel 4, and 48,700 cumecs when Tunnel 4 is still available as an irrigation outlet. The
routed outflow of the PMF for Tarbela reservoir, with a peak of 46,200 cumecs has been
estimated as the survival flood for the project. A fuse plug has been designed to be provided with
self trigger arrangement when the flood rise reaches a preset level, so that extreme floods up to
the survival flood can be passed. For the larger emergency drawdown outflow, there would be
sufficient notice for the fuse plug to be breached in advance. The construction flood adopted is
14,500 cumecs (return period of 40 years).
6.        Sedimentation. The sedimentation of the Barrage Pond for the proposed Ghazi-
Barotha Hydropower Project would primarily depend on the sediment outflows from Tarbela.
Based on mathematical sedimentation model studies, the maximum sediment concentration during
the month of May (when the reservoir level of Tarbela is generally low) is estimated at about
1,500 parts per million. In the other months, the sediment concentration is estimated as less than



-96-                               ANNEX 4.1
Page 5 of 10
about 110 ppm, with particle size distribution (PSD) of about 42% clay, over 57% silt and less
than one percent sand. The major sediment outflow volumes generally occur during the periods
of low reservoir levels (April to June) and also during periods of high flows (July and August).
During an average and wet year, the concentrations are low, below 500 ppm, but these could be
much higher during a dry year. However the sand content would be negligible. The predicted
sediment from Tarbela outflows for up to 25 years would be predominantly of silt and clay. After
that period, the sand concentrations should increase. Specific structural arrangements (including
the undersluices and the skimming platform) have been made under the project, to desilt the
barrage pond and avoid the coarse sediment flow into the power channel. Also the power channel
has been designed as high velocity channel with self-cleaning velocities of 6 ft./sec. It is also
proposed to have a dredger to keep the area of the pond clear upstream of the head regulator, as
and when necessary.
7.        Sediment model studies as recommended by the POE have been undertaken and
would be continued to confirm the design assumptions used in various components of the project
and to suggest modifications for improved performance. Earlier, eight hydraulic model studies
pertaining to barrage, undersluices, head regulator, siphon, spillways, super passage and power
complex were completed as planned.
D. Geolo2
8.        Barrage. The river channel right bank at the barrage site is composed of crystalline
and metamorphic rocks with non-fossiliferous sedimentary deposits. The left bank on the other
hand is wholly composed of unconsolidated terrace deposits. The barrage is mainly based on
alluvium foundation (consisting of sands, gravels, cobbles and boulders). While the thickness of
alluvium at Tarbela Dam in the riverbed was found to exceed 200m, the same in the barrage area
is found to be erratic in nature, with some boulders right at the surface and bedrock in some holes
at depths of 30 to 40m.
9.        Power Channel. The 52 km long power channel passes through varying geology in
the area. The first part of the channel from Ghazi to Kamra complex passes through alluvium
which forms a thick mantle overlying the bedrock. At Kamra the channel passes through the
northern foot of the hills consisting of agrillites, limestones, and guartzites. Beyond Kamra, the
channel mainly passes through varying deposits of alluvium (silts, clays, gravels), except at the
northern end of high grounds at Haji Shah and Rumian where rock outcrops forming the Attock-
Cherat range are exposed.
10.       Power Complex Areas. The area investigated for the power complex lies along the
left bank of the Indus River extending from Dakhner in the north to the Haro River in the south.
The area is geologically known as the Attock basin, defined by the east-west trending ridges of
the Attock-Cherat range, 7km to the north and the Kalat- Chitta range 5km to the south. The
basin is filled with thick alluvial sediments deposited nearly horizontally by the Indus, Kabul and
Haro rivers which flowed through the area in the past. The principal alluvial units include more



-97-
ANNEX 4.21
Page 6 of 10
recent deposits of sand, silts and gravel, overlying relatively older beds of siltstone, sandstone and
at the deepest exposures sandy gravel with varying degrees of cementation.
E. Seismicitv
11.       The seismicity of the area is characterized with preinstrumental data as highly
modified Mercali (mm) intensities of V to VIII. The instrumental data for the present century
shows earthquakes of magnitude greater than five on the Richter scale with very few events of
magnitude greater than six recorded within the 200 mnile radius of the project. A probability of
exceeding ten percent during the 60 year project life has bean adopted as the basis for design,
resulting in ground acceleration of 0.17g for the Operational Base Earthquake (OBE). The
Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has been estimated to generate a horizontal ground
acceleration of about 0.5g. The water retaining structures whose failure could lead to the
flooding of villages and loss of life including: (a) the barrage rim embankments; (b) the power
channel embankments and culvert; and (c) the head pond and foreby embankments, have been
designed on the basis of MCE.
F. Water Availability and Operation of Proposed Power Plant
12.         The live storage in Tarbela reservoir at the time of commissioning of the proposed
Ghazi-Barotha Project would be about 9,700 M cubic meters (about 13% of average annual
flow). The daily releases from Tarbela reservoir are governed by the requirement of irrigation
systems except when excess water is spilled. The hourly variations in the releases are governed
by power requirements. These hourly variations have become very pronounced after Tarbela
started operating as a peak load station on commissioning of four additional units.
13.         Overall operation of the Project and of the generating plant will be controlled from
the powerhouse control room, which will be linked to the National Control Centre (NCC) at
Islamabad and to the control centre at Tarbela. All significant aspects of Project operation will be
measured and recorded by a comprehensive SCADA system.
14.         The barrage will have a control room linked to the SCADA system. The barrage
gates will be controlled to maintain the required pond levels to exclude coarse sediment from the
power channel, to prevent sediment deposition near the outlets, and to minimize waste of water.
15.         Flows in the power channel will be controlled by means of the head and tail
regulators. Constant flow will be maintained in the power channel during each 10-day period.
The SCADA system will provide the operating staff with full data about discharges and water
levels in the power channel.
16.         The operation of Ghazi-Barotha Power Station will be as follows:
(a)  discharging excess flows through the barrage during the high-flow period (June -
September) when the average daily discharge exceeds the power channel capacity;



-98-
ANNEX 4. 1
Page 7 of 10
(b)  re-regulating the daily peaking discharges from Tarbela within the barrage pond
during the low-flow period (October - May);
(c)  releasing a constant flow into the power channel, by appropriate operation of the
head regulator gates, equal to the average daily release from Tarbela less water
discharged through the barrage, water lost through seepage and water provided to
the existing Pehur canal upstream of the barrage;
(d)  maintaining fMll supply level at the downstream  end of the power channel by
appropriate operation of the tail regulator gates;
(e)  operating the turbines at higher discharges during peak hours, automatically drawing
on water stored in the two head ponds with a combined capacity of 25 million
cumecs; and
(f)  outside peak hours, reducing turbine output in order to allow the flow in the channel
to refill the head ponds before the next peak demand period.
17.       The operation of the barrage gates will also take into account the need for flushing
sediment from the barrage pond and reducing sediment entry into the power channel.
18.       The resulting patterns of maximum power, base load energy and total energy
generation on a period by period basis for average hydrology are shown in Annex    . The
maximum power available in May and June indicates the contribution of the project to meeting the
annual system peak demand, which occurs in this period. Sufficient water will not be available for
an economic low-head generation. Therefore, no specific provision has been made in the layout
for future installation of a low-head hydropower at the barrage.
G. Dam Safety Aspects
19.       In accordance with the Bank guidelines for Safety of Dams and Structures (OMS
3.80, and the presently revised draft OP/BP 4.37), the project provides the following specific
measures to ensure safety of the proposed dam/barrage and the associated structures.
20.       Engineering. Pakistan Hydro Consultants (PHC), with extensive experience in major
hydro projects for over 30 years, prepared detailed design reports related to the safety of civil
structures.
21.       Independent Panel of International Experts. An independent panel of international
experts was associated with the project from initial stages of the project feasibility to carry out a
comprehensive review of the detailed feasibility, project layout of structures and the detailed
designs of the project, and to advise and ensure the safety of the dam/barrage and the appurtenant
structures, with specific considerations of the geologic hydraulic, soil mechanics, sedimentation,
seismic and the structural aspects. The Panel was comprised of eight well known experts with
relevant expertise in dam/barrage, appurtenant structures and powerhouse engineering, concrete
lining of major channels and the underdrainage systems, and the electrical/mechanical equipment
for the power station. The Panel contributed some important modifications for safe designs and
has endorsed the project as technically sound and economically highly attractive. Most of the



ANNEX 4.1
Page 8 of 10
members of this Panel are proposed to be retained and continued for the technical panel during
construction of the project. The Bank would participate in the Panel meetings as and when
appropriate
22.       Instrumentation. Extensive instrumentation is proposed to be installed at the project
structures and the concrete lined power channel for safety monitoring. The same would be
further reviewed by the Panel and the Bank experts for its adequacy when instrumentation designs
are finalized during construction and additional instrumentation will be incorporated (if considered
essential). The proposed instrumentation would provide handy tools for studying the behavior of
the various project structures and the power channel and foundations after construction and for
timely requisite protective measures to control undesirable developments or emergency
conditions.
23.       Safety Inspections During Operation. WAPDA conducts regular inspections of all
dams and the major hydraulic structures in the country and generally follows the practices of the
US Bureau of Reclamation in this respect. The safety inspections by WAPDA assisted by
individual experts (as necessary) would be acceptable to the Bank. All works completed under
the project including the barrage, undersluices, fuse plug, head regulator, syphons escapes, inlets,
super passages, concrete lined power channel, the under drainage system, spillways, head ponds,
intake structures, penstocks, forebay and tailrace, and the electrical and mechanical equipment
would be maintained by WAPDA in a satisfactory manner.

Enviromnental and Resettlement Aspects
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.    Incorporation of Enviromnental and Resettlement Issues into the proposed Project. The
preparation of the proposed project has included the direct participation of Pakistani and foreign
environmental specialists and social scientists from the earliest stages of project development and it is
planned that this approach would continue throughout the implementation phase. Emphasis has been
placed on early identification of potential environmental and social impacts at all levels of project
planning. Environmental and social considerations have been included in the process of evaluation
investment alternatives and selection of project layout alternatives for the siting of the primary and
secondary structures. The analysis of layout alternatives has allowed for a significant reduction in the
level of potential resettlement and archaeological impacts. This process has been conducted with
regard to land acquisition, design of components, public safety and project operations. The direct
participation of environmental and social science specialists on a routine basis has enabled the
planning team to identify and avoid, or at least mitigate, the potentially adverse environmental, social
and archaeological effects which are associated with the project. In addition, World Bank
environment and resettlement specialists have regularly participated in project preparation missions
since the UNDP supported feasibility study was initiated in 1989.
2.    Applicable Review Procedures and Reports. The proposed project has been the subject of
extensive environmental, resettlement and archaeological studies as mandated by the policies of the
Government of Pakistan, and the World Bank. An environmental assessment and complementary
resettlement action plan have been prepared for the proposed project consistent with the requirements
of Government of Pakistan Ordinance XXXVII, "Control of Pollution and Preservation of Living
Environment (December 1983)" and the applicable World Bank Operational Directives (4.01,
"Environmental Assessment;" 4.00, Annex B, "Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir
Projects;" 4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement;" and the Enviromnental Assessment Sourcebook Update
on "Cultural Heritage in Environmental Assessment"). The preparation of the environmental
assessment and resettlement action plans has been conducted by an interdisciplinary team of Pakistani
and international experts.
3.    The environmental assessment for the proposed project includes the following reports:
(a)    Environmental Assessment Executive Summary (1994), which presents the main
findings of the environmental and resettlement studies, it is available in English and
Urdu;
(b)    Volume 7 of the Feasibility Report (1991), which presents the detailed results of the
environmental and social studies carried out during the feasibility studies;
(c)    Report on Archaeological Studies (1991), which presents the results of the survey of
archaeological and historical sites;



-130-
ANNEX 6.1
Page 2 of 27
(d)    Report on Supplementary Enviromnental Studies (1992), which presents the results of
the supplementary studies undertaken during the tender design stage
(e)    Report on Additional Supplementary Environmental Studies (1994), which presents
the results of the additional studies undertaken during the preconstruction stage; and
(f)    Environmental Assessment of Transmission Lines (1995), which presents the results
of environmental and resettlement studies for the proposed transmission lines.
The Resettlement Action Plan (1994) provides a comprehensive overview of social conditions in the
project area and provides detailed recommendations to address resettlement and local economic
development in an equitable manner. The Resettlement Action Plan is available in English and Urdu.
It is complemented by analysis of potential socioeconomic impacts of the proposed project which are
included in the Environmental Assessment - Main Report, a detailed land ownership survey and the
recently prepared "Integrated Regional Development Plan for the Ghazi-Barotha Hydroelectric Power
Project Area."
4.    Activities of the Environmental and Resettlement Review Panel. Consistent with the
provisions of the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," and
Operational Directive 4.00, Annex B, "Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir Projects," an
independent Environmental and Resettlement Panel (ERP) was established for the proposed project.
This panel was composed of Professor Kazuyoshi Kawata, chairman and environmental specialist, Dr.
Anis Dani, social scientist and Professor Janusz Kindler, water resources management specialist. The
panel has conducted a series of field visits to the project area and conducted meetings on-site, in
Islamabad with the Govermnent of Pakistan and in Lahore with WAPDA. It has reviewed draft
reports on the environment, resettlement and archaeological aspects of the project, provided comments
on proposed approaches to these aspects of project design and recomrnended supplementary studies be
undertaken for a set of specific issues. It is planned that the activities of the panel would continue on
a routine basis during the implementation and evaluation phases of the project.
5.    Meetings with Government Agencies, Potentially Affected Parties and Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs). A major planning activity, important in making the project environmentally
and socially acceptable, has been early and frequent interactions with the local people, directly and
through government agencies. This has kept the planning team attuned to public concerns and
desires, and facilitated the inclusion of the local population in the planning process. A series of
meetings were held with the civil administration; with national, provincial and district level public
representatives, and with the local population at the village level. A list of these meetings is provided
in Attachment A.
6.    Separate meetings for men and women were conducted at the village level by social scientists.
Meetings were held with representatives of Pakistani nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
including the World Conservation Union' (IUCN/Pakistan), the World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF/Pakistan) and the Sungi Development Foundation, a local NGO. Experts from IUCN/Pakistan
and WWF/Pakistan visited the project area to review the scope of the proposed activities and
recommended mitigation actions and to discuss the proposed monitoring plan. Meetings have also
Formerly the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

been conducted for preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan and are being undertaken as a routine
activity by the Project Information Center (see paragraph 72).
II.    SETTING OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
7.     The proposed project area is immediately downstream from the Tarbela Dam on the Indus
River in the Punjab and Northwest Frontier Provinces of Pakistan. The area is crossed by the
historic Grand Trunk Road which links the project area to Peshawar to the West and Islamabad to the
East. The project area crosses the Chhachh and Sarwala plains. The Chhachh plain, which lies
between the Grand Trunk Road and the Indus river to the north, is a region that is rich in history,
archaeology, and communities that for centuries have drawn their sustenance from the fertile alluvial
soil. The Sarwala plain lies to the south of the Grand Trunk road and is a dry tract of land which is
poor, sparsely populated and dependent on barani (rain-fed) cultivation.
8.     Two other areas will also be affected by the project. The most significant of these is the
broad Indus flood plain and the river bank villages on both sides of it. These villages use the river
and its islands for water, fuelwood and grazing. The other area is the Gandghar mountains, which
close off the Chhachh plain on its eastern side. The population of this upland and mountainous area
depends on the lowlands for market, employment, and health and educational facilities. Considerable
two-way traffic passes between this area and the market villages of Ghazi and Khalo.
9.     From the start of the power channel to the Grand Trunk road, there are many villages,
graveyards and shrines. After the Grand Trunk road, the Kamra Aeronautical Complex lies across
the route of the channel. Downstream of Kamra, the land is undulating and there are few villages up
to the Indus river.
10.   The Indus river between Tarbela and the mouth of the Kabul river flows in a broad braided
channel with a number of islands (belas) which are either temporary or permanent. Some permanent
belas are flooded only very rarely and these support a vegetation of trees, shrubs and grasses. Those
located near the river banks are grazed by large number of cattle, while some are cultivated.
11.   The project area supports no permanent natural wetlands or open water bodies, other than
seasonal pools along the Indus. There is little aquatic vegetation in these pools or in the river. The
rich animal life that existed in the project area early in this century has been decimated by habitat
destruction and hunting. What remains is largely limited to the wilder areas of the Kala Chitta Range
(south of the project area).
12.    Densities of waterfowl and other water-related birds are not large. The lack of suitable
habitat and the variability of the water regime make in unlikely that the stretch of the floodplain in the
braided channel zone is more than a temporary resting place for water birds on their way to the
coastal wetlands. The most abundant fish in the Indus are the mahseer, chaina, rohu, thaila, and
mallah, which are caught by fishermen who live on the islands for part of the year. A few families
near the river fish at the subsistence level, using nets and rods.
13.   The proposed project will be implemented in parts of two provinces. The barrage and the
first 12 km of the power channel will be in the Northwest Frontier Province with the rest of the
project in the Punjab Province. The governing authority in the project area is at the District level



-132-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 4 of 27
with the District Commissioner serving as the key administrative officer. At the local level, elected
District and Union Councils play an important role.
14.   The area is occupied by a mixture of Pathans and Punjabis. Most of the population in the
project area are conservative Muslims with arranged marriages and veiling of women common.
Women perform traditional household tasks of child bearing, laundry and cooking, and some income
producing work such as caring for crops and livestock. There are no permanently settled indigenous
(tribal) people in the project area in the sense of the Bank's definition; however, there are some
transient tribal people, the Powindah or Kuchis, who summer in the Afghan highlands and winter
throughout Pakistan.
15.   Agriculture is the largest economic activity in the project area, employing about 56% of the
male workforce. Wheat, the major crop, is planted on 55 % of the cultivated land during the Rabi
season (November-March) and some is planted during the Kharif season (April-October). Most
agriculture is barani (rain-fed) with about 25 % of the land under irrigation, predominantly with
tubewells. Land holdings in the project area tend to be small and fragmented with about 90% of the
farmers working less than 5 hectares, which is considered the minimal economic holding in Punjab.
III. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
16.   Preparation of the Environmental Assessment included an extensive analysis of alternatives
which is summarized in Annex 4.2. In addition to evaluation of the "no action" alternative and other
options for addressing energy demands, the consultants evaluated in detail, on the basis of field visits
and consultations, a large number of alternatives for the siting of the barrage, alignment of the power
channel and siting of the power complex. This process allowed for significant reductions in the
potentially adverse environmental, resettlement and archaeological impacts through direct
incorporation of these recommendations into the planning process for the proposed project during the
lay out phase conducted in the early part of the feasibility study.
(a)    No Action Alternative. The latest (1993) estimate of future power demand in Pakistan
envisages an increase of nearly 6,000 MW in the peak demand by the turn of the century
from the present level of around 9,000 MW. It has been projected that various measures
being implemented to conserve energy may reduce the additional demand by up to 1,000
MW. At present, load shedding takes place on a large scale whenever generation from
Tarbela and Mangla dams is reduced significantly. This occurs during January when the
releases (which are determined by irrigation requirements) are minimal, and also in May and
June when both reservoirs are drown down. Reduced load shedding occurs in the intervening
period. Failure to meet this increase in demand will result in more load shedding which will
disrupt manufacturing processes and commerce, and have serious consequences for national
economic development.
(b)    Alternative Generation Projects. In the economic assessment of the Project, alternative
generation projects (thermal, nuclear and hydropower) were considered. Under all the
scenarios studied, hydropower has been shown to be the most attractive option for meeting
future demand. With Ghazi-Barotha included in the list of candidate plants, it was selected
immediately. From an environmental and resettlement perspective, Ghazi-Barotha was
extremely favorable due to the minimal and manageable nature of potential environmental,
resettlement and archaeological impacts when compared with other potential investments given



-133-                               ANNEX 6.1
Page 5 of 27
its unique design and flexibility in layout options which allowed for minimization of potential
impacts. The use of small-scale hydropower had been previously reviewed by WAPDA and
determined to provide 70 MW so that it was viewed as a complementary rather than
alternative investment option.
(c)    Barrage Alternatives. Five barrage sites were identified in the reach of the Indus river
between 7 and 12 km downstream of Tarbela. Of these, two sites, A and C, were selected
for detailed study. Site C offered the advantage of greater storage capacity, whereas Site A
was preferable on environmental grounds. An independent study by the World Conservation
Union (IUCN/Pakistan) confirmed the choice of Site A.
(d)    Power Channel Alternative. Alternative designs studied for the power channel included an
unlined channel and twin channels. Both options would have required a substantially wider
right-of-way, with greater socioeconomic impacts and construction costs. Therefore these
options were discarded. The most economical alignment for the channel would have passed
through several long-established villages and was considered environmentally ad socially
unacceptable. Therefore, the power channel alignment was moved into higher ground in
order to avoid all villages. The resulting alignment would then have passed through several
graveyards, some very large. Accordingly, further modifications were made to the alignment
to avoid these graveyards. As a result, the power channel alignment is largely in cut nearly
70 m cu m of surplus excavated material. Five alternative routes through the Kamra
Aeronautical Complex were studied, and an acceptable alignment was selected that passes
through a relatively less important part of the Complex. A number of options have been
studied for disposal of the surplus spoil from required excavations. The spoil will be used for
terracing of wasteland where the surface relief is very rugged and for construction of spoil
banks. About 1,640 ha of land will be acquired temporarily for spoil disposal. The spoil
banks will be graded, provided with tubewell irrigation and sold back to the affected farmers
which would minimize the need for relocation outside the proposed project area.
(e)    Power Complex Alternatives. Five potential power complex sites were initially studied,
between Dakhner and the Haro River. Jaba, Dher, and Barotha sites were selected for a
detailed evaluation. All three sites being comparable from environmental impact
considerations, Barotha was selected as it offered the most favorable topography. Various
alternatives were studied for headpond sites and embankment alignments. The selected
alternative requires more land, all of it barani and pasture land with no habitations, but
significantly increases peaking capacity and also utilizes more of the surplus material from the
required excavations. Two tailrace alignments were considered, north and south of Barotha
village. The latter has been selected because it uses the additional fall in the Indus and results
in less spoil. Following review of several alternative routes, the route adopted for the 7 km
access road from Haji Shah to the power complex follows an existing dirt road which would
be upgraded and widened. Various alternative routes for the 500 kV transmission links were
studied. The routes selected have minimal environmental, social and archaeological impact.
During detailed design, the alignment and tower locations will be fixed so as to provide
specified clearances from villages and houses, to have a minimum impact on trees and
agriculture, and to avoid archaeological sites.

IV. POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT
17.   The main anticipated direct impacts from the proposed project are associated with the
construction and operation of the three major project elements: (a) a barrage and its pond near the
village of Ghazi; (b) a power channel running between the barrage and the power complex; and (c) a
power complex at Barotha. Secondary impacts would be associated with construction of transmission
lines. Indirect impacts will be primarily social, relating to the changes in the local economy as a
result of the project and the settlement of a limited number of new residents with different social
traditions, especially near the power complex. A summary of the potential impacts is provided in
Attachment B.
A.    Effects of the Barrage and Pond
18.   Implementation of this element of the proposed project would result in the conversion of a
currently braided stretch of river bed into a pool with a fluctuating level covering about 1000 ha and
an additional 140 ha for the barrage. An additional 35-40 ha would be required for the construction
work area. All burrow material will be obtained locally and all spoil used in the construction
program. It is anticipated that secondary land use impacts would occur due to commercial
development on both sides of the barrage road which will cross the river and especially in the Ghazi-
Khalo area.
19.   The flow in the Indus river down to the confluence with the Kabul river is controlled by the
Tarbela darn. The main effect of the barrage will be to partly redirect this flow into the power
channel for non-consumptive use. During the high-flow season, the river will receive the major
portion of the release from Tarbela. During periods of low flow, the river downstream of the barrage
will be fed by compensation releases at the barrage with a minimum compensation flow of 28 cumecs.
When data from the water quality monitoring program indicates the need for more flow, it will be
released from the barrage.
20.    Downstream of the barrage, the Indus water is used to provide an estimated 10% of the
consumptive water demands of 15 riverside villages, principally for watering livestock, washing and
as receiving waters for sewage from settlements. Little water is taken for irrigation or drinking due
to the use of wells and tubewells. Flood reductions would adversely affect about 80 ha of recession
agriculture in Malla and Noor Malli; however, this could be addressed by the project providing
tubewells for these areas. In the hotter months dry season pools are used for bathing by a small
percentage of the population. Adequate compensation water for these purposes will be provided
downstream of the barrage through releases from the barrage supplemented by the provision of
tubewells to replace traditional wells in selected areas. The project would support rehabilitation and
upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities for the Tarbela colony and Ghazi-Khalo. In addition,
releases of sewage compensation and sewage would be coordinated during the low flow season to
maximize dilution.
21.   The effect of the project on flora and fauna of the riverain area will be minimal. The loss in
riverain ecosystem in the barrage pond is expected to be balanced by the development of aquatic
ecosystem in this reach and increase in riverain ecosystem downstream of the barrage due to
reduction in flood peaks. Riverain fisheries may be affected by the reduction in dry season flows
which would have an effect on part-time seasonal fishermen. With effective management, the barrage



-135-                               ANNEX 6.1
Page 7 of 27
pool fisheries should replace this loss and provision would be made to assign fishing rights to those
who have traditionally engaged in fishing in the area.
22.    At present, the Indus river is eroding its banks and destroying agricultural lands of the
villages on the left bank downstream of the barrage site which is a major concern of local residents.
The barrage will significantly reduce this process by providing greater regulation of the flood flows
and reducing peak flood events.
23.    The provision of a new crossing of the Indus river over the top of the barrage, much shorter
and more convenient than the crossing over the Tarbela dam, will be an important regional benefit, in
addition to boosting the economy of adjacent villages.
B.    Effects of Power Channel
24.    The design process for the proposed project involved the extensive analysis of alternative
routes for the power channel, with priority being given to minimization of potentially adverse impacts
to villages, graveyards and shrines, and to archaeological sites by avoiding such features. It is
anticipated that about 1,000 hectares of land would be permanently taken by the power channel and
its right-of-way. Current land use in the area to be affected by the power channel is a mixture of
irrigated and rain-fed agriculture, and grazing. In addition, military facilities and industries are
located at the Kamra Aeronautical Complex. It is estimated that 93 % of this land is in agriculture,
including pasture and fallow. The power channel does not pass through any forest reserves or natural
areas.
25.    While avoiding direct impacts to settlements and other features, the construction of the power
channel will result in the generation of about 70 million m3 of excess spoil from excavation cuts
which will require disposal. An additional 1,640 hectares will be used for the planned disposal and
redevelopment of excavation spoil for agriculture. The proposed approach for the disposal of spoil
has been designed to avoid excessive costs in hauling the material over long distances, while
providing for an environmentally satisfactory permanent solution. Under the proposed plan, the spoil
would be used for banks providing additional channel freeboard, concrete aggregates, construction of
spoil banks along the power channel, terracing of wasteland, reclamation of land along the left bank
of the Indus river, and filling portions of deep gullies and nullahs. The spoil banks and terraces will
be leveled, covered with top soil, provided with tubewell irrigation and resold to interested affectees
consistent with the provisions of the Resettlement Plan.
26.    The major impact of the power channel thus centers on the land required for its construction
and the disposal of excess spoil. Extensive village surveys have been carried out to ascertain the
views of potential affectees. These have shown that some of the affected people would prefer to have
land for land, but would not wish to move elsewhere. Since much of the land is barani (rainfed),
many people would be prepared to work with less land if it were irrigated by tubewells which would
allow for higher and more reliable yields from crops. Therefore, of the 2,640 ha to be acquired for
the power channel and spoil banks, about 1,640 ha will be developed for irrigated agriculture and
resold to the affectees.
27.    The power channel will be lined and an underdrainage system will be installed which should
result in seepage losses having a minimal effect on local groundwater levels. The underdrainage



-136-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 8 of 27
system should reduce waterlogging from the over application of irrigation water by farmers in areas
along the channel. The impact of the power channel on groundwater would be monitored.
28.    The construction of the power channel will result in the passage of a large fast flowing
channel running through an agricultural area. As a safety measure, chain link fencing will separate
the channel from populated areas. Other safety measures will include cattle grids to prevent livestock
from wandering on to the service roads, high curbs on the channel side of the service roads to prevent
traffic being driven close to the channel's edge, handrails at points of public access, and frequent
floating booms and grab rails to assist in climbing out of the power channel. A large scale public
education program would also be undertaken to alert residents of potential risks, actions which should
be taken to avoid these risks, and recommended procedures to be used in emergency situations.
29.   In order to minimize the disruption of pedestrian, livestock and vehicular traffic, the proposed
project would provide for the construction of 46 crossings of the channel which would be somewhat
closer together in the more populous upstream region. Most of these are located at the traditional
crossing points.
C.    Effects of Power Complex
30.   Construction of the power complex near the village of Barotha will include: (a) headponds
and their embankrnents requiring about 636 ha of poor, rain-fed agricultural land and woodland and
(b) power complex structures, switchyard and tailrace which will take a further 214 ha of land. The
effects of this change in land use will be mitigated by the development of tubewell-irrigated
agriculture on the more fertile river terraces.
31.   A road bridge across the tailrace channel will ensure that the present access between Barotha
village and its lands to the south of the Barotha nullah will be maintained. New roads will be
constructed in this area to link the villages with the secondary road system. In the general area of the
power complex, 50 hectares of barani and grazing land would be acquired near the Attock-Dakhner
road for construction of the power complex colony. An additional 50 hectares of similar quality land
would be required for construction of a new access road from the Attock-Haji Shah road.
32.    The construction of the power complex would result in the obstruction of flows in Barotha
nullah, require restructuring of the local irrigation system and creation of two headponds which would
provide habitat for wildlife and opportunities for fishery development. The irrigated land near
Barotha village, which takes its water from the small perennial flows in Barotha nullah, will have its
supplies safeguarded.
D.    Potential Health Effects
33.    Possible causes of changes in the health of the local population are the creation of the barrage
pond, the headponds at the power complex, the reduction in low-season flows in the Indus down to
the confluence with the Kabul river, and the high-velocity flows in the power channel. Malaria
mosquitoes presently breed in pools along the Indus river bed, and in waterlogged depressions in the
Chhachh plain. The project will reduce the former and perhaps the latter. The barrage ponds and the
headponds will be poorly suited to mosquito breeding but if this becomes a nuisance, the larvae could
be dislodged by rapidly varying the water level by 0.3 to 1 m. Oriental sore could become a problem



-137-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 9 of 27
among the construction workers but can be readily controlled by destroying rodent burrows, using
residual insecticides inside dwellings and other measures.
E.    Archaeological and Historical Sites
34.   Consistent with the Antiquities Law of Pakistan and the policies of the World Bank, a survey
of archaeological, historical and religious sites was conducted by the Department of Archaeology and
Museums of the Government of Pakistan. This included a review of known sites in the project area,
which was complemented by a field survey of the barrage and associated pool, the proposed
alignment of the power channel (500 meters on both sides of the alignment), the power complex and
proposed excavation areas for construction materials. The survey identified five archaeological sites
along the proposed channel corridor. Two of these sites, Musa I and Musa III (both Buddhist period
stupa and settlement sites) are located in the alignment of the proposed power channel and are
recommended for archaeological salvage excavations. Musa II (Buddhist period stupa), Pindanwala
Tibba (Buddhist period stupa and settlement site) and an unnamed mound between Rumian and
Dakhner (Paleolithic site) are at risk of being indirectly affected due to construction activities in their
area and precautions would be taken to avoid their burial by the disposal of excavated soil so that they
remain available for future investigations. Additional surveys will be conducted as part of the final
planning process for access roads and transmission lines.
F.    Religious Shrines and Relocation of Graves
35.   Project implementation will require relocation of a small mosque and 14 graves in a family
cemetery near Banda Feroze. A second mosque would need to be relocated at Kamra. The mosques
and graves would be moved to an adjacent location by WAPDA after obtaining a religious
pronouncement as required under Pakistani law. WAPDA will also notify village leaders to avoid
further burials in areas which would be potentially affected by the proposed project. In addition, a
minor religious shrine on the right bank of the barrage pond, 1 km upstream of Galla, would be
protected by an embankment.
V.    RESETTLEMENT AND SOCIAL ISSUES
36.   Construction Phase Employment. Implementation of the proposed project would result in
large scale employment of professional, skilled and unskilled workers. Construction of the barrage
would take approximately 51 months and require 2,500 workers with another 300 staff from WAPDA
and consultants on the site. The professionals would be housed mostly in the barrage colony. Skilled
and unskilled workers would either be provided with temporary quarters or live at home.
Construction of the power channel is anticipated to take approximately 51 months and require a
workforce of 2,600 workers with another 200 staff from WAPDA and consultants at the site. The
permanent colony, located at an existing WAPDA colony near Lawrencepur, will be available for
housing professional staff; other workers would be provided temporary housing or live at home. The
construction phase at the power complex would last approximately 64 months and require a workforce
of 2,700 with another 300 WAPDA and consultant personnel at the site. A new permanent colony
would be developed at the eastern side of the Gariala-Dakhner road and would house professionals
and skilled laborers. Unskilled laborers would be either provided with temporary quarters or live at
home. For all three construction activities, WAPDA would give preference to local affectees in
recruiting the construction workforce.



-138-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 10 of 27
37.   Operational Phase Employment. The operating staff of the barrage would number 210
persons, most of whom would be housed in existing WAPDA facilities at Tarbela. The power
channel would require an operating staff of about 390 persons, most of whom would be housed in the
permanent colony. The power complex would require an operating workforce of 800 persons, most
of whom would be housed in the new permanent colony. WAPDA would give preference in all three
locations to local affectees in recruiting the operational workforce.
38.   Land Acquisition in the Project Area. Under the proposed project, land would be acquired
for the following purposes: (a) permanent use for the barrage and pond which is nearly all owned by
either the Government in the form of river bed or currently owned by the Government of Pakistan
(1,180 ha); (b) permanent use for the power channel (1,000 ha); (c) use for spoil disposal followed by
redevelopment for agricultural use (1,640 ha); (d) construction of the power complex and related
facilities (900 ha); (e) for project related rights-of-way for service roads (approximately 50 ha); and
additional land would be required for transmission line right-of-ways. In addition, a portion of the
power channel would cross through the Karma Aeronautical Complex which is controlled by the
Pakistani military.
39.   The removal of these lands from their present, predominantly agricultural and grazing use will
have both short-term and long-term impacts. The primary impact would be a permanent loss of
agricultural production from the 1,000 ha for the power channel, 950 ha for the power complex and
its associated colony, and approximately 200 ha for the barrage, roads and other facilities. Critical to
mitigation of these impacts would be the successful reclamation of the 1,640 ha of land to be
redeveloped for irrigated agriculture following its use for spoil disposal. Development of fisheries at
the barrage pond and power complex headponds will only provide for minimal employment
opportunities. The secondary effects of the removal of income-producing land will be felt by the
artisans and shopkeepers in the support sector and the landless farmers and laborers who will require
special assistance under the propose project.
40.   Resettlement. Implementation of the proposed project would require the resettlement of 179
families with a surveyed population of 899 persons currently living at the power channel and power
complex sites and the demolition of 110 private housing units and their associated buildings. As the
power channel was routed to avoid villages, concentrated impacts would occur only at the village of
Banda Feroze where strip development has spread settlement across the channel corridor and near
Kamra where a small cluster of houses and a small mosque will need to be relocated. The remaining
dwellings are scattered along the right-of-way.
41.    Most resettlement will be accomplished close to the original sites of the houses. Three model
villages for resettling affected families will be developed near the power channel alignment as part of
the project. Compensation for immovable property will be based on replacement cost, and moving
expenses will also be paid. In addition, the proposed project would fully fund the relocation and/or
replacement of elements of local infrastructure including water towers, roads, agricultural buildings,
tubewells, etc.
42.   Barrage and Pond - Reduced Channel and Seasonal Pool Access. Construction of the
barrage and pond may have some secondary social effects during the low flow season including: more
difficult access to the riverfront or to large pools which could affect social gathering of women and
the more restricted access to water could change social dependency relationships between village poor
and those households with their own water supplies.



-139-                               ANNEX 6.1
Page 11 of 27
43.   Power Channel - Redevelopment of Spoil Banks for Agriculture. A major feature of the
proposed project is the redevelopment of 1,640 ha of spoil banks for agricultural purposes. This
activity would minimize the need to relocate families whose land would either be used for
construction of the power channel or for use as a spoil disposal site by providing redeveloped land
with tubewells in the same area. As the land would be more productive due to the provision of water
for irrigation, it could support a comparable number of families on a smaller amount of land. In
order to achieve this objective, great care will need to be taken in the implementation of the
redevelopment program and monitoring of the performance of these areas. The project would provide
support for applied research and demonstration activities concerning the use of these areas, as well as
supporting proper agricultural extension services.
44.   Power Complex - Possible Social Issues at Barotha. Construction of the power complex at
Barotha should have a potentially beneficial social impact over the long term; however, it will be
heavily affected by the project through the construction of major facilities in the village and indirectly
by the development of the nearby WAPDA colony. During the construction phase, WAPDA would
need to assure that adequate attention is given to controlling the collection and disposal of sewage
from workers to avoid any problems with disease. In addition, action will need to be taken by
WAPDA to closely supervise the contractor to avoid potential damage to non-project areas
surrounding the village by controlling the location and quality of roads, closely regulating the disposal
of solid and liquid wastes from the construction operation, stopping the unnecessary felling of trees,
etc. Measures should also be taken to control potential problems of friction and strife between
outside workers and villagers hired for the proposed project and villagers who retain their traditional
way of life. It will be necessary for WAPDA social scientists to carefully monitor developments in
Barotha to avoid the development of such problems.
45.    Unplanned Economic Development. The river crossing provided by the barrage would
result in regional road traffic and create increased business opportunities in the road junctions at
Ghazi-Khalo and Topi. These opportunities will result in additional population growth to that which
would be generated by the proposed project. Similar development can also be expected to occur
along the Attock-Dakhner Road and in the vicinity of the new power complex colony. This growth
will create additional demands on administrative and social services in these areas. It will also result
in land use problems unless adequate and timely technical and planning assistance is provided for
these areas.
46.   Management of the "Boom and Bust" Cycle. Measures should be taken by the Government
of Pakistan, in cooperation with the concerned Provincial Governments and WAPDA, to try to
minimize the "boom and bust" cycle in the project area which would result from the undertaking and
then completion of a major construction project. Interventions could be usefully made with regard to
supporting the development of alternative sources of employment in the area which would come "on
stream" following completion of the project. These could be especially useful in the effective
channeling of extra income that may have been generated in the areas into productive investments
which are employment-generating. Measures could also be taken in the planning process to reduce
adverse effects from unplanned development in the project area.

VI. ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN
A.    Implementation Responsibility
47.   Role of WAPDA. WAPDA will have overall responsibility for implementation of the
Environment and Resettlement Management Plan for the proposed Project. To ensure coordination
among the different units involved in the proposed Project, an Environment and Resettlement Review
Committee (EREC) will be established under the chairmanship of the Project Director. The EREC
will meet periodically and its members will include the Chief of the Project Resettlement
organization, the Social Science Unit, the Monitoring Consultant, a representative of each of the
construction contractors and the Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization. Representatives of the
Punjab and NWFP Departments of Archaeology will also be invited to attend these meetings.
48.   Role of the WAPDA Environment Cell. Routine oversight for implementation of the
Environment and Resettlement Plan will be the responsibility of the Environmental Cell of the Water
Wing of WAPDA. This unit has been strengthened through recruitment and training. The technical
divisions of WAPDA and other Government Departments, will support the work of the Environment
Cell, by collecting data pertaining to such aspects as land resources, river morphology, groundwater
and riverain ecosystems. The Environment Cell will be responsible for coordination of Project
activities with the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PEPA); Punjab Environmental
Protection Agency; Punjab Department of Archaeology; NWFP Environmental Protection Agency;
and the NWFP Department of Archaeology.
49.   Role of the Project Resettlement Organization. The proposed Project will include the use
of a Project Resettlement Organization (PRO) which will report to the Project Director and facilitate
routine on-site implementation of the Environment and Resettlement Management Plan. The PRO
will include a Social Sciences Unit (SSU) which will supervise resettlement activities. The SSU will
ensure that the affectees, particularly women, small landowners, landless tenants and laborers, fully
understand their entitlements and the procedures for compensation as provided for under the
Resettlement Action Plan.
50.   Role of the Monitoring Consultant. A special external Monitoring Consultant will support
the Environmental Cell and the Project Resettlement Organization, as required, in monitoring the
environmental and resettlement aspects of the proposed Project. The Monitoring Consultant will have
full-time personnel on-site in the project area to support implementation of these activities.
51.   Role of the Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization.  As per the recommendation of the
Environment and Resettlement Panel, implementation of the proposed project will include
development and funding of a Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO). The GBDO will
undertake contacts with the local population, particularly for mattes related to land acquisition and
compensation. As mandated in the Resettlement Action Plan, representatives of the GBDO will
participate in Land Valuation Committee meetings to assure that proper procedures are used for land
acquisition and compensation. The GBDO will also evaluate social trends, identify possible
mitigation actions and consult with local organizations on their implementation. It will also receive
funding to implement an Integrated Regional Development Program to support a wide-range of small-
scale activities to promote "grassroot" economic and social development in the project area.



-141-                                ANNEX 6.1
Page 13 of 27
52.    Role of the Environmental and Resettlement Panel. The activities of the Environment and
Resettlement Panel will be continued as an element of the mitigation, monitoring and institutional
strengthening plan for the proposed project. Members of the panel will make field visits on a
periodic basis and, where necessary, suggest ways of strengthening the project implementation,
monitoring and evaluation process. The panel will continue to have three members with Professor
Kazuyoshi Kawata continuing as the chairman.
B.    Environment, Resettlement and Cultural Heritage Mitigation Actions
53.    The direct participation of environmental specialists and social scientists in all stages of
project preparation have allowed for mitigations to be incorporated into the proposed project at a
variety of levels. Mitigation of potential adverse environmental and social impacts from the proposed
project has included direct modification of the original project concept approach through changes in
the siting of the components, especially the alignment of the power channel, and inclusion of specific
design provisions to address these issues. There have also been a series of mitigations incorporated
into the planning and design of the project as presently planned. In addition, the proposed project
will include mitigation actions which will be implemented during the construction and operational
phases of the proposed project to avoid or reduce impacts. The actions to be included in the
Mitigation Plan are summarized in Attachment B.
C.    Modification of the Project
54.    Siting. In development of the proposed project, significant attention was given to analysis
and selection of siting alternatives which resulted in the least possible adverse environmental and
social impacts. These have included:
(a)    Barrage and Pond. The decision on siting of the barrage, after review of several
alternatives, was made to minimize environmental and social impacts directly from the
barrage and those from the associated power channel offtake;
(b)    Power Channel. The present alignment of the power channel was developed to
establish a route, which despite significantly increased construction costs, will have
the least adverse impact to villages, archaeological and historical sites, religious
shrines and graveyards. The present alignment was developed by a team of
engineers, environmental specialists and social scientists on the basis of the study of a
series of alternative alignments and field surveys. The alignment was subject to
numerous minor adjustments to avoid a variety of issues identified during field
surveys and village level scoping sessions. Key features of the alignment include:
(i)    Resettlement. Development of the alignment has reduced the number of
parties who need to be resettled to a minimum and it is anticipated that
resettlement can be accomplished close to the original site of the houses which
will considerably reduce social impacts. It should be noted, however, that
implementation of the proposed project will still require taking land for
construction of the power channel which will require significant measures to
address the restructuring of the agricultural system in these areas. Issues
related to resettlement are discussed in more detail below; and



-142-                                  ANNEX 6.1
Page 14 of 27
(ii)    Archaeological, Historical and Religious Sites. The alignment of the power
channel was selected to avoid archaeological and historical sites, religious
shrines and graveyards to the fullest extent possible. As a result, only two
archaeological sites, Musa I and Musa III, will require salvage excavation and
three sites will require precautions to avoid accidental burial. No religious
shrines will be damaged and no major graveyard disturbed. Only one small
family graveyard with 14 graves and 2 small mosques will need to be
relocated. Actions to be taken to address these issues are described below;
and
(iii)   Kamra Aeronautical Complex. The proposed project will pass through the
large Kamra Aeronautical Complex; however, extensive analysis of alternative
alignments resulted in the development of an approach which was acceptable
to Pakistani military authorities; and
(c)    Power Complex. Following evaluation of a series of alternative locations for the
power complex in which environmental and social impact considerations played a
role, the Barotha site was selected. As a result of a recommendation made during the
local scoping session, the name of the proposed project was changed from Ghazi-
Gariala to Ghazi-Barotha to reflect this siting decision. In addition, the layout of the
complex at Barotha was also adjusted, following field review and consultation with
local parties, to minimize potential impacts.
D.    Design Provisions
55.   Movement in the Project Area. Construction of the power channel will create a physical
barrier which will require crossings if present transportation routes are to be maintained. In addition,
access needs to be maintained between villages and their fields. To address this issue, the project has
included a total of 46 crossings of the power channel, most of which are located at the traditional
crossing points, which should minimize the impact of the proposed project on pedestrian, livestock
and vehicular traffic.
56.   Power Channel Safety. The design of the power channel includes fencing, warning signs,
floating booms and grab rails for safety purposes. There will be floating booms at bridges and
superpassages. Grab rails running down both sides of the channel into the water will be at 100 meter
intervals near villages, but less frequent where the risk of falling into the channel would be less.
Public education activities to alert residents to the risks of the power channel and proper emergency
procedures are outlined below.
E.    Mitigation Actions Incorporated into the Planning and Design of the Proposed Project
57.   Compensation Water. On the basis of analysis performed as part of the environmental
assessment, a program has been developed to ensure that adequate compensation water is released
from the barrage during periods of low flow. These releases will maintain a base flow in the Indus
river channel for maintenance of water quality and ecology in the channel and provide adequate water
supplies for human and livestock use in villages along the river bank. The minimum compensation
flow will be 28 cumecs. When data from the water quality monitoring program indicates the need for
more flow, it will be released from the barrage.



-143-                               ANNEX 6.1
Page 15 of 27
58.    Spoil Disposal and Rehabilitation. The balance between excavation and fill will leave about
70 million cubic meters of surplus material. The majority of this material will be used as
construction materials for embankments and structures. About 30 million cubic meters will be placed
in spoil banks to be located at identified sites along both sides of the power channel where this
material will be placed, graded, covered with topsoil, provided with tubewell irrigation and returned
to agricultural use. The redevelopment of these areas for irrigated agricultural use will serve as an
important mitigation action for provision of land to parties who lost land due to construction of the
power channel.
F.    Mitigation Actions to be Taken During Project Implementation
59.    Resettlement Action Plan. The actions to be undertaken by WAPDA to address potential
resettlement and social issues associated with the proposed project are provided in the Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP). The RAP makes a commitment to improve or restore the current standard of
living and earning capacity of the project affected people. This policy commitment has been given
operational form through the development of entitlement packages (Annex 6.2) which clearly identify
the types of land loss or disturbance, definition of entitled person, definition of entitlement/right,
additional facilities and services for project affected people including training, work opportunities,
credit and provision of local infrastructure.
60.    Land Acquisition - Valuation and Compensation. Project implementation would require
the acquisition of approximately 3,457 ha of land from private landowners. The implementation
authority will purchase all private land for the barrage, power channel, spoil areas, power complex
and supporting physical and social infrastructure. Compensation for land would be given at current
market rates, but only after WAPDA completes a field survey to ensure that those who have made
improvements are fully compensated even if these improvements have not been recorded by patwaris.
Compensation payments will be prompt and direct, they will be made directly by WAPDA to the
landholders without any intermediaries. Procedures would be adopted to allow for maximum
transparency in the valuation and acquisition process. Parties in the project area would be advised of
the procedures which they could use if they wish to contest an assessment of land value. In order to
avoid having land out of cultivation for an unnecessary number of seasons after it is purchased but
before it is actually used by the project, it is proposed to lease it to the farmers for the intervening
period.
61.    Replacement of Lost Land for Redeveloped Land. The proposed project would use a
procedure under which land will be replaced with redeveloped land in the same area to the fullest
extent possible. This would reduce the potential negative aspects of the proposed project on
agricultural production and significantly reduce the need for an out-of-area resettlement program
which is socially less desirable as well as costly. Redeveloped land will be resold at the same rate as
that at the time of acquisition. Therefore, the farmers will be saving over half of the compensated
amount, part of which will be spent on development of the land and part will be compensation for
loss of crops for the period of construction and related activities in the area.
62.   The land would be sold to affected landholders in the village as soon as it is ready for
handing over. Under the proposed project, affected parties would have irrigated land replaced with a
comparable amount of irrigated land while rain-fed land would be replaced with irrigated land at a 2:1
ratio. Tubewells would be constructed in the redeveloped areas with a normal capacity of 0.25 cusecs
to provide irrigation water. The tubewells would be provided to the farmers without cost with shares



-144-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 16 of 27
assigned on a basis equal to their share of land commanded by the well. An agricultural extension
program would be supported by the proposed project to assist in the formation of water user
associations and to support the effective use of the redeveloped areas.
63.   Priority would be given to implement a "pilot program" for the reclamation of spoil banks for
agriculture. This would allow for detailed field testing of techniques for the cultivation of these areas
and the development of practical information for agricultural extension personnel.
64.   Resettlement. The 899 persons which would need to be resettled would be provided with
compensation for their land consistent with the practices described above. Compensation for housing
and other buildings would be according to a basic schedule developed by WAPDA based on
replacement cost. This schedule would be reviewed by the GBDO to ensure that the prices would
fully reflect replacement costs in the various sections of the project area. It is planned that the
affected parties would be allocated plots, in the vicinity of their village, which would be a minimum
of 500 square meters or double the size of the existing house plot, whichever is greater.
65.   The relocation of housing sites would be coordinated with the allocation of agricultural lands
to ensure these are near each other. Those villagers who wish to may relocate into either of three
model villages which have been prepared by WAPDA and whose alternative sites are currently under
review by WAPDA and the Bank. The project would allow for affected parties to remove the
remains of their buildings to their new site free of cost. Affected families would be provided with
vehicles from WAPDA/Government of Pakistan for the movement of their belongings, equipment and
livestock to the location of their new settlement site.
66.   Replacement of Existing Facilities and Construction of New Facilities. The proposed
project would fund relocation and/or replacement of key elements of infrastructure including water
towers, roads, agricultural buildings, tubewells, etc. New facilities to be supported by the project,
largely identified as a result of the environmental assessment and resettlement plans include: (a)
rehabilitation of sewage treatment facilities at the Tarbela Colonies and provision of such facilities at
Ghazi-Khalo; and (b) a Girls Degree College for Ghazi.
67.   Employment Preference. WAPDA will give priority in employment to the affectees in the
construction phase and in filling opening in all job categories in the permanent operations and
maintenance staff. This would be accomplished by the establishment of a work permit system under
which WAPDA would distribute permits to those directly affected by loss of land and/or occupation
for preferential employment. This would include tenants and field laborers who work on land
acquired for the proposed project.
68.   Two types of permits would be issued, one for those directly affected and a second for
residents of affected villages who have suffered a partial loss. It is planned that one work permit per
household would be issued which would be transferable between members of the same household.
The work permit would not be treated as an employment contract but as a means for identification of
those who should receive preference in recruiting employees. A provision for this employment
preference process has been incorporated into the tender documents for the proposed project.
69.   Integrated Regional Development Plan. The proposed project would include funding for an
Integrated Regional Development Plan which would be implemented by the GBDO with the
cooperation of WAPDA. The development program would be run independently of the main project



-145-                               ANNEX 6.1
Page 17 of 27
and would seek to mobilize public and private sources of funds from within and outside Pakistan to
make investments in the economy of the project area. The program would focus on facilitating the
economic development of the greater project area through, for example, small-scale inputs for
development of farmer's marketing organizations and small industrial estates as vehicles for
development.
70.    Safety Measures. A comprehensive evaluation of dam safety issues was prepared as part of
the feasibility study consistent with the provisions of World Bank Guidelines for Safety of Dams and
Structures (OMS 3.80 and the present revised draft of OP/BP 4.37). The project design includes
requirements for emergency planning, instrumentation and routine safety inspections during operation.
In addition, implementation of the proposed project would include adoption of the following safety
measures to reduce the risks associated with humans and livestock falling into the power channel: (a)
a public information program will be undertaken to inform the public about the dangers of the channel
and actions to be taken in case of accidents; (b) a special program will be developed for children
which will be presented at schools and in villages concerning the risks of the channel; (c) physical
measures will be included in the project to keep people out of the channel; in populated areas the
channel will be fenced and warning signs posted; and (d) physical measures will be adopted to get
people out of the channel who have fallen in or otherwise entered the channel; this will include the
use of floating booms and grab rails.
71.   Archeological, Historical and Religious Sites. Mitigation actions to be conducted during the
project implementation phase include: (a) salvage excavation of the Musa I and Musa III
archaeological sites; (b) adoption of precautions to avoid accidental burial of Musa II, Pindanwala
Tibba and an unnamed mound between Rumian and Dakhner; (c) an agreement to be reached with the
Department of Archaeology and Museums to have staff archaeologists make regular visits during
excavation activities; (d) adoption of "chance find procedures" to be used if archaeologically
significant properties are uncovered during the construction activities, which will be included as
standard provisions in all construction contracts; (e) relocation by WAPDA two smail mosques and of
14 graves located along the power channel alignment to an adjacent location after obtaining a religious
pronouncement as required under Pakistani law; (f) notification of village leaders to avoid further
burials in areas which would be potentially affected by the proposed project; and (g) a minor shrine
near Galla would be protected by an embankment.
72.   Public Information Center. WAPDA has established a Project Information Center (PIC) at
the project site, near Ghazi for the systematic and broad dissemination of all technical environmental
and resettlement information. The PIC is also a critical part of the communications channel for
redressing grievances about the land acquisition and compensation process. Since it was established in
December 1994, the PIC has undertaken and active program of outreach activities to provide
information to affected parties, local NGOs and governmnent agencies among others on the land
acquisition and compensation process and entitlement packages. It has commissioned a popular
film/video on the project, including its environmental and resettlements aspects. It has also prepared,
with the support of translation consultants, key documents in Urdu, including a schedule of public
announcement of awards, Urdu translation of the Environmental Assessment Executive Summary,
entitlement packages and the full Resettlement Action Plan. WAPDA is currently in the process of
recruiting an expert to be contracted to serve as an advisor to the PIC. The focus of this advisor will
be to assist in the preparation of written and audio/visual information for the PIC, support outreach



-146-                              ANNEX 6.1
Page 18 of 27
activities for affectees and provide training for PIC staff. It is planned that the PIC would be a
permanent element of the proposed Project. Two smaller subcenters are being established at Attock
and Topi.
G.    Elements of the Monitoring Plan
73.   The monitoring program for the proposed project would be a continuous program of data
collection and analysis designed to ensure the effectiveness of the Environment and Resettlement
Management Plan and to bring to the attention of WAPDA management any environmental or social
problems which were not identified during the project preparation process. It is planned that
monitoring reports would be submitted every six months in a format and using indicators which are
approved by the Bank.
74.   Environmental Aspects. The following environmental aspects would be monitored under the
proposed project:
(a)    Land Resources. The critical areas of land resources requiring monitoring will be
the spoil areas and the river banks to identify possible excessive erosion, cropping
problems and failure of the land to reenter the agricultural system. Although the
project is expected to have a negligible effect on the riverain morphology and
ecosystem, these aspects will also be monitored.
(b)    Water Resources. A regular program of water quality analysis will be conducted, in
cooperation with local and regional health authorities, to ensure than compensation
water releases are sufficient to maintain dry season water quality in the river
downstream of the barrage. Groundwater will also be monitored. The most
important issues included in the monitoring program are the groundwater recharge
from the barrage pond and the land on either side of the river downstream of the
barrage, changes in groundwater movement that may be caused by the power channel,
and seepage from the headponds and the power channel. Moreover, the power
channel underdrainage system may affect water levels in wells falling within the
effective zone. All of these aspects will be monitored on a regular basis throughout
the project life.
(c)    Biological Resources. The ecosystem of the braided channel zone will be monitored
to assess the change in plant succession. The grazing trend will also be monitored
and mitigatory actions taken if deterioration of the ecosystem is observed. The
monitoring program will include monitoring of fish, other aquatic species, birds and
other wildlife in the barrage pond, the Indus river below Ghazi, and the headponds
and adjacent habitat near the power complex.
(d)    Health Effects. In conjunction with health authorities, health conditions among the
permanent and temporary residents in the project area will be monitored. A special
program will be established for mosquito monitoring at the barrage pond and the
power complex pond. In conjunction with the PNGO, monitoring of the health of
resettled individuals would be monitored.



-147-                             ANNEX 6.1
Page 19 of 27
(e)    Archaeological Values. As per the recommendation of the Department of
Archaeology and Museums, during the excavation of the power channel two
archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology and Museums will make regularly
scheduled visits to examine the areas under excavation. In addition, WAPDA and
Monitoring Consultant personnel will receive guidance concerning the monitoring of
construction sites to determine if unknown archaeological sites are encountered and
the appropriate procedures to be taken if such a situation occurs.
75.   Resettlement Aspects. A number of resettlement aspects would be monitored under the
proposed project on an active basis to ensure proper implementation of planned actions and to address
unanticipated problems. The GBDO would monitor the land acquisition and compensation process to
ensure that each landholder promptly receives the full market value of their holding. Monitoring
would be done of the process used for leasing temporary borrow areas and assuring proper
compensation, including quick payment to landholders for inadvertent damage to fields and crops
from construction activities. There would be active monitoring of the movement of families to ensure
that replacement is comparable or better than that destroyed. Implementation of the project local
labor hiring policy would also be monitored to ensure that those directly affected by project activities
are given priority in hiring and that labor-hiring polices generally benefit the residents of the project
area.
76.   A special monitoring activity would be conducted in the Barotha area where the power
complex is to be constructed. This would include activities to ensure that irrigation is maintained
along the nullah and that construction activities are avoided in this area. In addition, monitoring of
the land acquisition process, construction of access roads, work sites, housing areas (temporary and
permanent), social services and sewage disposal would take place to make certain they comply with
good practices and do not contribute to the social destabilization of the village.
H.    Institutional Strengthening
77.   The proposed project would support the development and strengthening of the Environmental
Cell of the Water Wing of WAPDA. This would include training on environmental and resettlement
issues for personnel assigned to both WAPDA headquarters in Lahore and personnel on assignment in
the project area. The establishment, with project funding, of the Ghazi-Barotha Development
Organization will also contribute to institutional strengthening by development of a "model
organization" which could be copied for other major projects in Pakistan to promote social
development in project areas.
I.    Special Actions
78.   The following special actions would be included under the proposed Project:
*     Conduct special training for WAPDA Environmental Cell and consultant personnel
concerned with environmental and resettlement issues;
Hold Pre-Bid Conference(s) and Instructions for Bidders to address environmental,
resettlement and archaeological issues; and
Continue Environment and Resettlement Review Panel.

I.    Estimated Costs and Implementation Schedule
79.   Estimated Cost. The total costs for implementation of the Environment and Resettlement
Management Plan Mitigation and Monitoring Plans is estimated to be US$ 182.74. In addition, the
Government of Japan has approved a grant of approximately US$ 1.20 million to assist WAPDA in
implementation and supervision of the Environment and Resettlement Management Plan. These costs
are summarized in Attachment C.
80.   Implementation Schedule. The projected implementation schedule for the Environment and
Resettlement Management Plan is provided in the implementation schedule for the overall project
(Annex 4.1).
VII. SUPERVISION AND EX-POST EVALUATION
81.   Supervision. The supervision plan for the proposed project includes the regular participation
of Bank environmental specialists and social scientists who would support the task manager in
overseeing environmental and resettlement aspects of the proposed project. These specialists would
conduct supervision missions twice yearly to ensure that provisions of the environmental mitigation
plan, resettlement plan and combined environmental and resettlement monitoring plan are being
implemented consistent with agreements reached between GOP, WAPDA and the Bank.
82.   Ex Post Evaluation. The project completion report submitted to the Operations Evaluation
Department will include an evaluation of: (a) environmental aspects of the project and assessment of
their impact and the effectiveness of various types of mitigation measures; (b) resettlement and its
impact on tne standard of living of the resettled population and those who have land taken by the
proposed project; and (c) effectiveness of the project in supporting the development of a capacity
within WAPDA to better manage activities with major environmental and resettlement issues.

Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project
Social Science Unit
Terms of Reference
l.  Introduction. The Social Sciences Unit is expected to play an important role in the
development of WAPDA's capacity for supervision and monitoring resettlement in its projects. It
would also take n interactive role between affectees and WAPDA organizations. In order to
effectively undertake the RAP, a Social Science Unit (SSU) would be established as an integral
part of the management structure for the GBBP.
2.   Staff Composition. The SSU would be a field based group headed by a senior social
scientist and including a senior agricultural specialist and two community development specialists
(male and female). The Project Director plans to appoint the team leader of this unit in a Grade-
18 position, but will consider the mission's proposal to seem a more senior social scientist. It is
recommended that the senior social scientist and community development specialists be hired on
long-term contracts by WAPDA while the senior agricultural specialist would be assigned from
WAPDA staff. The SSU would work closely with field based representatives of the Project
Information Center (PIC). WAPDA Environment Cell (Water Wing), Monitoring Consultants
and the Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO).
3.   Key Tasks. The SSU would undertake, but not be limited to, the following key tasks:
(a) ensure that affectees, particularly women, small landowners, landless tenants, and laborers,
fully understand their entitlements and procedures of compensation as provided under the
RAP;
(b) ensure that project authorities are speedily informed of legitimate grievances of affectees
with regard to implementation of the RAP;
(c) ensure that project authorities are speedily informed of adverse project impacts that were
unintended or unanticipated in the RAP;
(d) ensure that both the direct affectees and the general population in the project area
understand how the Integrated Regional Development Program (IRDP) would be
undertaken as an additional effort to develop the area;
(e) maintain a village-level data base to record the implementation of the RAP and bring to the
Project Director's attention serious and sustained deviations from the provisions of the
RAP;



-167-                               Annex 6.6
Page 2 of 2
(f) maintain a sample data base to establish the success of income restoration goals and to
examine the degree to which affectees may be a dynamic advantage or disadvantage with
regards to the rest of the area population;
(g) maintain a data base to examine the specific problems that women may face due to the
project;
(h) provide the required level of technical assistance to farmers that is needed to assist them in
avoiding income losses due to changes in land and livestock or switching from barani to
irrigated farming;
(i) provide special assistance to work permit holders to obtain appropriate employment with
contractors; and
(j) provide recommendations to the Project Director for resolution of all problems faced by
affectees related to the above tasks.
4.   Supervision. The SSU, since it needs to conduct a broad range of interactions, would
report to the Project Director. Its operations would be consistent with a work plan and schedule
which would be reviewed and approved by the Project Director. The SSU would be expected to
closely coordinate the development of this work plan with the PIC. Administrative and logistical
support for the SSU would be provided by the GBHP.

tailwaters of Tarbela Dam and the confluence of the Indus and Haro rivers.  It involves
construction of a barrage near Ghazi village located about 7km downstream of Tarbela Dam, to
divert water into a 52 km power channel. The power channel would convey water to a power
complex of 1450 MW, comprising five units each of 290 MW installed capacity near the village of
Barotha to generate about 6600 GWh of energy annually. A 500 kV transmission line and related
substation would connect the power complex to the Peshawar grid substation. The project
location and layout plans are illustrated in drawings 1 and 2.
2.    Environmental Aspects. The proposed project has been subject to the preparation of an
environmental assessment consistent with the procedures of the World Bank and the requirements
of the Government of Pakistan(GOP) Ordinance XXXVII, 'Control of Pollution and
Preservation of Living Environment (December 1983)." The project preparation process included
the adoption of a number of design modifications to mitigate potential adverse impacts through
careful siting of the principal components of the project and in establishing the alignment of the
power channel. Under the current project design, potential environmental impacts include: (a)
changes in land use in areas acquired for construction of the barrage, reservoir, power channel
and power complex; (b) reduction in the flows of a small portion of the main channel of the upper
Indus River, immediately below the Tarbela dam, when the power complex is in operation; (c)
impacts to two minor archaeological sites in the power channel which would be subject to salvage
excavation; (d) relocation of 14 graves; (e) potential risks of persons and livestock being killed or
injured if they enter or fall into the power channel; and (f) safety issues associated transmission
lines. To address these issues an environmental mitigation and monitoring plan has been prepared
which would be implemented by the Environmental Cell of the Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA). An Environmental Assessment Executive Summary has been prepared by
WAPDA and endorsed by GOP.
3     Resettlement Aspects. The proposed project requires the acquisition of approximately
4,770 hectares of land, 3457 hectares of which are privately owned. All of the privately owned
land will be acquired; but as 1,640 hectares would be needed temporarily, these lands would be
provided with irrigation facilitates and offered for sale at reduced prices to the affected persons.
The total number of persons adversely affected by the loss of land, houses, and employment is



-169-                             ANNEX 6.7
Page 2 of 7
currently estimated to be 22,359, only 899 or 4% of whom need to be resettled. Based on a
complete focused-census an sample surveys of the affected persons and a clearly formulated
package of entitlements, WAPDA has prepared a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP has
been reviewed by the World Bank and found to be acceptable.
Social and Enviromental Monitorinf
4.    Objective of the Monitoring Program. The objective of the monitoring program is to

4.     The electricity sales forecasts are based on demand growth of 10% per
annum in line with 10-yr. historical sales of WAPDA between 1984-1994.
Estimated losses are projected based on actual losses in December 1994
(24.2%), and assuming a gradual reduction from FY96 resulting from reduction
in non-technical losses and gradual decrease in technical losses as a result
of  WAPDA's  loss-reduction  program  agreed  with  the  ADB.    Private  sector
purchases are based on the following capacity additions from the private
sector:

Average Revenue per kWh Sold
4.    The average revenue per kWh sold include the unit base tariff plus the
fuel adjustment surcharge.   Tariff increases  are projected to achieve the
average revenue required to meet both the 40% Internal Cash Generation
covenant and the Debt Service Coverage covenant of 1.5 times.
Fuel Adjustment Surcharge (FAS)
5.    The FAS rate as set by the government is 75 paisas/kWh for all consumers
except for the first three blocks of domestic consumers which pay a lower
rate, and flat rate agricultural and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
consumers which are exempt. From FY97, the FAS rate is assumed to recover at
least 100% of WAPDA's total fuel cost.
Other Operating Revenues
6.    Other operating revenues consist of income and fees for items such as
transfer/replacement of meters, application fees, reconnection of service,
etc.   These revenues are shown to increase minimally based on prior years
revenues.
Hydroelectric Profit Surcharge and Payments to the Provinces
7.    A surcharge on all electricity sales is levied by WAPDA on behalf of the
Government to help pay for hydroelectric profit payments due to the Provinces
in accordance with a formula set by the National Finance Commission.   The
surcharge amounted to Rs. 4.3 billion (10.4% of sales) in FY94.  The Federal
Government paid the difference between the revenues from the surcharge and the
actual  payments  during  that  year  (Rs.  6.0 billion) .   From  FY97,  WAPDA's
hydroelectric profit payments are assumed to be paid by WAPDA in full.
Fuel Costs
8.    Fuel costs, fuel prices and projected consumption are based on WAPDA's
estimated actual average fuel cost and consumption in FY95 for its thermal
generation, with estimated increases in fuel prices of 16.6% in FY96 (actual),
and 7% thereafter.
Maintenance Expenses
9.    Maintenance expenses are related to plant in service and are forecast at
1.5% of average gross fixed assets in operation.

Annex 7.2
Page 3 of 4
Operation and Administration Expenses
10.   Operation  and maintenance  expenses  are  forecast  to  increase  by  13%
annually, taking into account system expansion, inflation and past experience.
During FY98 and FY2001, an additional increase of 7% is assumed to account
for general wage increases granted to Government employees.
Depreciation
11.   WAPDA applies a composite rate of depreciation of 3.5% to its average
gross fixed assets in operation.
Balance Sheet
Cash
12.   Cash balances are projected at the level required to cover at least six
weeks of cash operating expenses.
Inventories
13.   Inventories are forecast at 6% of gross fixed assets in operation.
Accounts Receivables
14.    WAPDA's overall accounts  receivables have been projected at 20% of
billings equivalent to 2.4 months' sales based on actual experience.
Other Current Assets
15.   Other current  assets  include miscellaneous  receivables,  advances  and
clearing accounts.   These are forecast to increase by 5% annually based on
past experience.
Current Liabilities
16.   Current liabilities include accounts payable, deposits for works to be
carried  out  for  other  agencies,  contractor  deposits,  duties  payable  and
accrued salaries. Current liabilities are assumed to be 70% of current assets
(other than cash) from FY97.
Security Deposits
17.   Security deposits are forecast to increase at 5% per annum.
Sources and Uses of Funds
Consumer Contributions
18.   Consumer capital contributions consist of payments for connection costs,
including cost of conductors, meters and transformers for large consumers.
These are assumed to be 9% of WAPDA's investments.

Investment Program
19.   WAPDA's investment program includes investments for generation plants,
transmission and distribution expansion and rehabilitation.   The investment
program is reviewed with the Bank annually and adjusted to reflect revised
commissioning dates, local and foreign cost variations, and financing
availability.
Borrowing
20.   These are projected on the basis of WAPDA's capital investment program.
Forty percent of the capital investment program are assumed to be financed
from  internal  cash  generation.    Projections  assume  that  local  currency
borrowings are from WAPDA 10-Yr. bond flotations, and all foreign costs of the
investment program financed from foreign loans.
Debt Service
21.   New debt is assumed to have the following terms: local borrowing through
bonds  at  19% interest,  repayable  after  10 years.    Regular  sinking  fund
appropriations are assumed to cover the repayment at maturity date or are
rolled-over.   Foreign borrowings are assumed at the weighted average cost of
WAPDA's foreign borrowings.
Escrow Account
22.   An escrow account representing two months' purchase payments for private
power sector has been established by WAPDA in accordance with the power
purchase agreements with the independent power producers. The escrow account
is treated as a fund application.

Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project
Least Cost Analysis
A. Load Forecast
1.    The load forecast for the Pakistan system has been developed on the basis
of an econometric partial adjustment model developed by ADB\1, which
desegregates for the following consumer categories: residential, commercial,
industrial, and agriculture.   The adjustment period varies for each consumer
category and it's in the range of 1.0 to 2.2 years.  The model explains the
energy demand for each consumer category as dependent on the following variables:
(a) income, (b) own-electricity price, (c) price of alternative fuel, and (d)
load shedding.   On the basis of historical data,  the model estimates the
elasticities related to each of the above independent variables. The projections
of these independent variables are then imposed to the model to derive the
electricity demand forecast for each consumer category.
2.    Three macroeconomic  scenarios,  presented in Attachment  1, have been
formulated and used in the analysis. The three scenarios are the following: (a)
High scenario, which is predicated on deepening and fully implementing the
macroeconomic reform program, (b) the Base Scenario, which assumes some reforms
and slower implementation, and (c) the Low scenario, based on little reform
combined with external difficulties. The Base scenario envisages an average rate
of GDP growth of 5.7% per year during the period FY95-2004, and a constant rate
of 5.5% for the remaining period. Under the Low and High scenarios, the average
rate of GDP growth is 4.5% and 6.7% per year respectively for the period FY95-
2004, and 4.5% and 7% thereafter.
3.    Electricity price projections are in line with the assumptions used in the
financial analysis, and assume a gradual elimination of the cross-subsidies to
agriculture and residential consumers. Fuel price projections are based on World
Bank projections\2  (see Attachment  2) .   Load shedding  is expected to be
gradually reduced, and eliminated by FY2002, as a result of increase in supply
capacity along with improvements in supply efficiency, and demand-side management
measures, as described below.
4.    Transmission and distribution losses are assumed to decrease from the FY94
level of 22.71W, to 18.5t in FY2000, 16W in FY2010, and 14% in FY2020, as a
result of the ongoing loss reduction program in WAPDA's system, and continuous
efforts to reduce the level of non-technical losses. An aggressive Demand-Side
Management Program, consisting of pricing (e.g., time-of-use tariffs), and non-
pricing measures (e.g., ripple control, efficiency and conservation activities)
are expected to result in demand savings of about 1000MW by FY2002, and about

4000MW in FY2010, depending on the penetration rate of such measures.   As a
result of the above, the system load factor is estimated to improve from the
level of 65.25% in FY94, to 67% in FY2000, and to 70.5% in FY2010.
5.    Electricity demand after DSM is thus expected to grow at the average growth
rate of about 8.8% during the period FY94-2002 and 6.6% between FY2002-2020 or
an average of 7.3% during the period FY1994-2020 for the base case scenario. Due
to the reduction in losses, and the impact of DSM, the resulting peak demand is
expected to increase at the average annual rate of about 6.6% for the FY94-2020
period, and in particular at 7.8% for the period FY94-2002 and 6.1% for the
period FY2002-2020. These projections are in line with the ones used by WAPDA
under the National Power Plan (NPP), which forecast an overall growth rate of
energy demand of 7.5% without DSM program and 7.2% with DSM for the whole period,
and a load growth of 7.4% and 6.7% respectively.
B. Characterization of the existing svstem
6.    Existing and committed hydropower and thermal plants belong to WAPDA and
KESC with the exception of the Hub Project (1292MW), at present under
implementation, which is in the private sector.
7.    The main hydropower plants (Tarbela, Mangla, and Warsak), along with small
hydropower plants  (96MW),  belong to WAPDA.   The total combined hydropower
capacity at the beginning of the study period is 4814MW.   The total peaking
capacity at full storage level is 5146MW. An additional ongoing project, Chasma
Barrage with a capacity of 184MW is scheduled to be completed in FY1998.
8.    Given its stochastic nature, the hydrology is represented in the WASP III
model, into three hydro conditions: (30%) dry, (40%) average, and (30%) wet. The
capacity and energy available for each hydroelectric project is specified in each
hydro condition.
9.    The existing thermal power plants in the Pakistan system account for
7055MW, mainly dual fired (natural gas and fuel oil) . WAPDA and KESC have 1347MW
of ongoing committed projects, which are expected to be commissioned by FY97.
In addition, the first private sector power generator (Hub Project) with an
installed capacity of 1292MW, is expected to be commissioned in FY98.
Candidate Generating Units for System Expansion
10.   Hydropower candidate projects.  Several promising hydroelectric projects
are characterized for analysis of the national system. All proposed hydropower
projects included in the analysis have been studied at prefeasibility level
(Basha, Kohala, and Tarbela 4th extension), and at feasibility stage with
detailed engineering design for Ghazi Barotha and Kalabagh.   These projects,
whose main characteristics are described in Table 1, form part of the sequence
used in the analysis.   Further,  in the sensitivity analysis  (see Section F
below), a group of other hydropower projects identified in a study carried out
with the assistance of GTZ has been included as alternative sequence.
11.   In order to characterize the hydropower system for this study, certain
assumptions made by WAPDA under the NPP have been revised and more conservative
assumptions compared to the ones used by WAPDA have been adopted.   First, a



-188-
ANNEX 8.1
Page 3 of 11
minimum 10% of inflow energy is assumed for all hydro projects (the NPP input
data assumes 0.0 minimum energy for any month). This modification reduces the
flexibility in the operation of the hydropower plants, as a minimum outflow is
assumed to be always required for purposes such as preservation of flora and
fauna, irrigation, etc. Second, WAPDA adopts an integrated hydrological model
which allows to optimize the power and energy from each hydropower plant given
the irrigations constraints incorporated into the model. In other words, WAPDA
hydrological model assumes a synchronized hydrological system which would allow
to optimize water releases from each reservoir and barrage, while, at the same
time, optimizing the energy and power from each hydropower project. This has a
particular positive impact on the outflows from Tarbela, which determines the
inflows to the Ghazi Barotha project, by allowing a higher level of water
releases from Tarbela during the dry period viz-a-viz the average and wet
periods.    While  the mission  does not  discard  the possibility of  such
optimization, a more conservative approach has been adopted: the energy and power
which can be produced by GBHP are based on the historical water release from
Tarbela in the last few decades.
12.   Finally, in this study a more conservative set of assumptions has been
included as regards the costs of the candidate hydropower projects, as
illustrated in Table 1.

13.  All capital costs include cost estimates  related to the costs of
ameliorating their environmental impacts and the costs of land acquisition,
compensation and rehabilitation, as well as the cost of transmission lines. The
environmental cost estimate are more complete for some projects, such as GBHP and
Tarbela 4th extension, while for others, such as Kalabagh and Basha (for which
detailed environmental and resettlement studies have not been undertaken), the
available information has been updated and additional estimates have been
included.

ANNEX 8.1
Page 4 of 11
Thermal Candidates
14.   Thermal candidates include new thermal projects such as Gas Turbines, Steam
Plants, and Combined Cycle Plants which would be built-owned and operated by the
private sector (IPP) in accordance with the 1994 Power policy.   In order to
characterize such projects in the least-cost analysis, the capacity and energy
charge provided for in the power policy have been included (see Table 2).
However, in order to ensure consistency with the discount rate used in the least-
cost analysis, such payments have been capitalized at the beginning of the period
at the prescribed discount rate of 10%, and re-calculated on annual basis at 12%
discount rate.  Further the fuel cost included in the energy charge has been
separated in order to adjust it according to the fuel price projections, as
indicated in the power policy. A common feature of the IPP under the 1994 power
policy is the efficiency benchmark of 38.6%.  The policy prescribed the bulk
tariff on the basis of such efficiency, thereby providing a financial incentive
to private investors to increase this efficiency level.   This implies that
regardless the type of fuel, private sector power plants will be remunerated on
the basis of the benchmark efficiency, and the implied technology (steam plant)
In this study, the base case includes base-load plants using fuel oil.
15.   The 1994 power policy has been conceived for base-load power plants, which
are normally characterized by higher capital cost and lower energy cost compared
to peaking-load plants. In this analysis, Gas Turbines have been included as
candidate projects, but their cost has been expressed as capital cost and O&M
charges, rather than as a capacity and an energy charge. Such representation has
the advantage of being more conservative. Further, it provides an indication of
the maximum tariff which could be offered to private power investors for gas
turbines by assessing their benefits in the system.

16.   Other Private Power Plants. Since March 1994, with the announcement of the
1994 power policy, GOP has issued Letters of Support (LOSs) to private power
project proposals for about 9000MW. Some of these projects are at advanced stage
of preparation, while others appear to lag behind the tight schedule imposed by
the Government (one year from the date of issue of the LOS to reach financial
closure). For the purpose of this analysis, some of these projects have been
represented in the WASP III model on the basis of the available information
related to their technical characteristics and other preliminary contractual
arrangements.

ANNEX 8.1
Page 5 of 11
C. Economic Assumptions and Constraints
17.   The discount rate used in the analysis is 12%, which is the estimated
opportunity cost of capital. Fuel prices include inland transportation costs and
margins, and are escalated in real terms according to World Bank projections.
18.   Given GOP's objective of reducing load shedding as soon as possible, WAPDA,
in formulating the assumptions for the least-cost analysis of the system, imposes
a maximum reliability criterium (LOLP) of 1%, i.e. 3.65 days a year.   Such
criterium appears reasonable, also when considered that it is higher compared to
the ones adopted in North America and in Western Europe, and in other developing
countries, e.g., Thailand uses 3 days a year. The imposition of a reliability
criterium is usually made in alternative to the expected cost of unserved energy,
i.e. the expected damages to the economy when a certain amount of electrical
energy is not supplied. WAPDA adopts a cost of unserved energy of US$0.27/Kwh.
The present level of outage is not, however, an equilibrium level and the high
degree of load shedding has led to consumers taking steps to ameliorate the
effects of load shedding. This leads to a lower unit cost of outages than in an
entirely reliable system. Therefore, the outage cost of US$0.27/Kwh estimated
by WAPDA is most probably a reasonable level until reliability improves. In the
Energy Options Study, the cost of unserved energy has been estimated at
US$0.75/Kwh. For conservative purposes, the present analysis assumes a cost of
unserved energy equivalent to US$0.27/Kwh.
D. Base Case Sequence
19.   The least-cost generation expansion program (LCGEP) for the period FY94-
2020 formulated on the basis of the above outlined assumptions is presented in
Table 3. Upto FY2002, it includes GBHP and 5202MW of new thermal power projects,
besides the ongoing and committed WAPDA and KESC projects and Hub. This implies
that over 70%- of private thermal power projects for which LOSs have been issued
by GOP are required along with GBHP. The results of the analysis also indicates
that, by FY2002, 300MW of Gas Turbines, which are assumed to utilize expensive
diesel oil, should be installed. GOP should, therefore, consider the promotion
of two or three peaking-plants.   After FY2002, the LCGEP selectes all other
hydropower projects, that is: Kalabagh, Tarbela 4th extension, Kohala, and Basha.
The total Net Present Cost at 12% discount rate is US$32,824 million.
20.   An alternative base case, without GBHP, has been developed in order to
quantify the direct benefits to the power system attributable to the proposed
project. In this case, the LCEGP replaces GBHP with 2x6OOMW IPPs, and 2xlOOMW
Gas Turbines in FY2002. The Net Present Cost (at 12% discount rate) associated
with this case without GBHP is US$33,281 million, or US$457 million higher than
the Base Case with GBHP. The annual cost difference between these two LCGEPs,
without and with the project, provides an initial indication on the economics of
GBHP viz-a-viz the alternative projects. The resulting ERR is 339.

E. Sensitivity Analysis
21.   Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the LCGEP,
and in particular of GBHP. Revised assumptions related to the LOLP criterium,
the availability of Gas Turbines, a higher discount rate, cost overruns were
considered on the Base Case. Further, the other two load forecasts, Low and High
scenarios, were developed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the
number of thermal power projects to be commissioned by FY2002 for the three load
forecast scenarios in order to test the robustness of GBHP.   The results are
summarized in Table 7 and detailed below.
22.   Sensitivity Analysis on the Base Case.   A sensitivity analysis was
developed to test the robustness of GBHP to change in assumptions related to (a)
unconstrained LOLP criterium, (b) the availability of Gas Turbines, (c) a
discount rate of 15%, and (d) +23 percent higher capital cost for GBHP. In each
of the above cases, the results of the LCGEP analyses indicates that GBHP is
always required at the earliest commissioning date (FY2002).
23.   In particular, the assumption of LOLP unconstrained in conjunction with a
conservative estimate of the cost of unserved energy (US$0.27/Kwh) translates
into a lower number of IPPs (4300MW) required by FY2002, equivalent to almost 60%
of private thermal power projects for which LOSs have been issued by GOP. In
case no Gas Turbines were allowed in the system, the Net present Cost (at 12%
discount rate) associate with this LCGEP is US$320 million higher than the Base
Case with Gas Turbines. The use of a higher discount rate penalizes large-scale
projects,  which are capital intensive and with long gestation period.   The
results of a LCGEP carried out with a discount rate of 15%, compared to the
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%, and the same amount of IPPs
(5202MW) as in the base case is required by FY2002.   As the economic cost
attributed to GBHP in the Base Case is US$1,732 million, which includes physical
contingencies for about 10%, a capital cost of US$2123 million (equivalent to 23%
higher cost than the base case, or 35% of the base cost without physical
contingencies) was attributed to GBHP. The results of the LCEGP indicate that
the same amount of IPPs (5200MW) as in the Base Case are required by FY2002 along
with GBHP.
24.   Given the uncertainties related to the number of private power projects for
which LOSs have been issued by GOP, an analysis has been carried out to test the
robustness of GBHP to increasing level of private power projects. For the Base
load forecast, the results are the following: (a) if one additional IPP (600MW,
for a total of 5800MW - 64% of proposed projects) is added in FY2001, there are
no changes in the GBHP schedule, (b) if two additional IPPs (1200MW, for a total
of 6400MW - 71% of proposed projects) are added in FY2001, GBHP is delayed by one
year to FY2003, (c) if three IPPs (1800MW, for a total of 7000MW - 78% of
proposed projects) are added in FY2001, GBHP is delayed by one year in FY2003,
and (d) if four IPPs (2400MW, for a total of 7600MW - 84% of proposed projects)
are added in FY2001, GBHP is postponed by two years in FY2004.
25.   Sensitivity Analysis on the Low Forecast Scenario.   The results of the
LCGEP analysis for this case are summarized in Table 7. The program shows that
GBHP is still required in FY2002.   This scenario require a lower level of
capacity of private power projects, i.e., 3100MW by FY2002, compared to the Base
case. Further, + 40% higher capital cost were attributed to GBHP in order to



-193-
ANNEX 8.1
Page 8 of 11
test the robustness of the project.  Again the results indicate that GBHP is
still required at its earliest commissioning date.
26.   Sensitivity Analysis on the High Forecast Scenario.  The results of the
LCGEP analysis for this case are summarized in Table 4. The program shows that
GBHP is still required in FY2002.   This scenario require a higher level of
capacity of private power projects, i.e., 7202MW by FY2002, compared to the Base
Case.

F. Sensitivity Analysis on SHYDO Hydropower Protects
27.   GTZ and the Sarhad Hydroelectric Development Organization  (SHYDO) has
recently conducted a desk-top level inventory study of the hydropower potential
of the northern areas of Pakistan.   Under the study, the following fifteen
hydropower candidates have been identified: Karrang (453.5MW), Kai Gah (548.5MW),
Duber (comprising Patan (111MW) and Moze (11.1MW), Spath Gah - Tokyae - Chor
Nalla (comprising Spath - Chor Nalla (818.9MW) and Tokyae (31.9MW), Allai IV
(124.4MW), Besham (66.3MW), Swat Scheme Al (104.7MW), Swat Scheme Bl (428.5MW),
Naran (219.3MW), Suki Kinari (651.8MW), Kotli-2  (104.1MW), Sehra-1 (67.3MW),
Chakothi (139MW), Hari Gel (53.8MW), and Neelum-Jhelum (576MW). Some of those
projectes are run-of-river type, while others are reservoir type. The earliest
commissioning date for these projects varies between FY2002 and FY2010.
28.   Although a comprehensive data base (including some hydrological data) has
been developed, more information is required to consider these projects at par
with the already identified hydropower projects in the base case. For example,
no data related to land acquisition, resettlement, environmental mitigation costs
is available. More detail work is needed for the selection of design parameters,
including an assessment of seismic risks and several other design parameters,
according to site conditions.
29.   However, for the purpose of confirming the absolute economic integrity of
GBHP, a sensitivity analysis of the Base Case with the SHYDO projects, as
characterized in the available reports,  has been carried out.   The LCGEP
indicates that, under the assumptions provided by SHYDO, those projects are
competitive compared to thermal power plants. The results also indicate that,
when those projects are competing with GBHP, the latter is still selected in
FY2002.   The total net present cost at 12% discount rate is US$425 million
compared to the Base case without SHYDO projects.   This confirms that the
overall, SHYDO projects are not competitive with the other hydropower projects,
and in particular with GBHP.
30.   An additional sensitivity analysis was developed by replacing the hydro
sequence including Ghazi Barotha, Kalabagh, Basha, etc., with the SHYDO projects.
Again, the LCGEP selects almost all SHYDO hydro projects (fourteen out of
fifteen) . The total net present cost at 12% discount rate is US$33,232 million,
or US$408 million higher than the Base case excluding SHYDO projects.   This
demonstrates that the SHYDO projects, even at the preliminary costs and
conditions identified at desk-top level, are not comparable with GBHP. Finally,
the above analysis was developed under the low demand scenario.   The results
indicate that, under the above conditions, the commissioning date of GBHP would
be delayed by one year.
31.   The above analysis demostrates that,  under the available information
provided by SHYDO, these projects appear to be attractive from an economic point
of view. However, their availability does not affect the economic viability of
Ghazi Barotha.   It is therefore suggested that more work be carried out to
investigate the feasibility of these projects to determine their economics and
their environmental impact.

Small Hydropower Schemes
32.    Under  Technical  Assistance   provided   by   the   Bank,  a   report  on   the
"Feasibility of Setting up 100 Small Hydel Schemes in NWFP" was finalized in July
1987.    The  hydro  schemes  are  located  in  six  districts  of  NWFP, Abbottabad,
Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat and Chitral. A total potential of about 75MW was
identified  through  100  schemes.   Sixty-three  schemes  are  situated  at  remote
locations,  at  least  10  miles  from  the  grid.   Given  their  size  and  incomplete
information available, such schemes cannot be included in the present analysis.
Certainly, their size indicates that they cannot compete with the GBHP. However,
it is suggested that more work be carried out to investigate the feasibility of
these schemes, particularly in the context of an optimal rural electrification
plan.

Economic Rate of Return Analysis
Introduction
1.    In order to determine the economic viability of the proposed project, two
different methodologies have been applied. The first is the standard methodology
adopted by the Bank in power projects. It is based on the evaluation of costs
and benefits associated with the overall power investment program including the
project. Such approach better reflects the interdependence of a power system.
The second methodology is based on the evaluation of costs and benefits
associated directly with the project.   Such methodology is required because
hydropower projects tend to be more susceptible to delays and cost overruns than
smaller  thermal projects.   Such approach,  however,  requires  to formulate
simplified assumptions regarding the specific contribution of the project to the
benefits to the economy. For each methodology, this Annex describes assumptions
and results of the Economic Rate of Return and Risk analyses.
Economic Analysis on the Power Investment Proaram
Main Assumptions
2.    The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) has been calculated on the basis of the
incremental cost and benefit streams associated with the national least-cost
investment program for the period FY1994-2006 of which GBHP is an integral part
(see Annex 8.1).  Benefits are represented by the incremental demand that can
be served under this program compared to the lower level of demand that could be
served if no new supply capacity were added to the power system. Similarly, the
costs are the difference between power system costs for meeting demand with this
program (FY1995-2006) and the system costs without any investments in new supply
capacity  and  related  transmission  and  distribution  facilities.    As  the
investments related to ongoing and committed projects between FY1994 and FY1999
are the same for both with and without program case, the net costs used to
calculate the ERR are the investments associated to uncommitted and new projects
between FY1999 and FY2006. The choice of the year 2006 as upper date has been
made in order to exclude from the calculation of costs and benefits the other
hydropower projects which could be commissioned starting FY2007.
3.      Benefits are valued as the difference between the benefits with and
without the program, i.e., the incremental demand that is met under this program
(1994-2006) relative to the much lower level of demand that could be served if
no new capacity were added to the power system.  The sequence related to the
period includes the following projects: (a) for the period between FY1995 to
FY1999, ongoing projects of WAPDA (1117MW), and KESC (210MW), in parallel with
Hub (1292MW) . Further, in order to meet system requirements, it was assumed that
other private power projects (2500MW) would be implemented by FY1998, (b) between



-198-                          ANNEX 8.2
Page 2 of 12
FY1999-2006, GBHP (1450MW), and the following private power projects: llx6OOMW
base load plants and 6xlOOMW peaking-load plants.
4.    Local costs are converted to border prices by using a Standard Conversion
Factor (SCF) of 0.822 in FY95, increasing to 0.901 in FY1998 and remaining
constant  thereafter,  in  line  with  the  macroeconomic  projections.    Such
projections are in line with the macroeconomic assumptions used as a basis for
the formulation of the load forecast, which reflect the expected gradual
liberalization of Pakistan's trade policy regime.
5.    The costs associated with the power investment program includes: (a) the
costs of generation, transmission and distribution facilities to be undertaken
by WAPDA and KESC; (b) an estimate of the capital cost/' of private power
generation projects  (US$1000/Kw) /2, including an estimate of the additional
transmission costs required to connect them to the grid; (c) the operations and
maintenance costs for WADPA and KESC, estimated as a percentage of the cumulative
investments in transmission (2%) , and distribution (3%), and for generation, the
O&M provided by the least-cost generation expansion program; (d) fuel costs for
WAPDA's and KESC's thermal power plants, as well as for private thermal power
plants escalated on the basis of the World Bank energy price projections, which
assume a real price increase of about 17% by FY2005 and constant thereafter, and
(e) energy purchases from private thermal power projects, i.e., energy charge as
dispatched.   The same cost categories have been calculated for the "without
program" case. the difference between the costs of the "with program" case and
the "without program" case represents the incremental costs of meeting the
electricity demand forecast.
6.    Transmission and distribution losses are assumed to constantly decrease
during the period of analysis from an average of 22.7% in FY94 to 18.5% in
FY2000, to 17% in FY2006. This is due to an ongoing and future transmission and
distribution technical loss reduction program, and to an assumed reduction in
non-technical losses.
7.    Since the major investments in the power development program have economic
lives that stretch well beyond FY2006, a run-out period of 25 years is added to
the costs and benefit streams for computing the ERR in which costs and benefits
are maintained at the levels for FY2006.
1/    Under the 1994 Power Policy, WAPDA and KESC will pay an annual capacity
charge which has been determined on the basis of capital costs,
financial charges including Interest During Construction, and a rate of
return on equity. In the least-cost analysis, such capacity charge has
been included as a fixed operating cost, to better represent the cost to
WAPDA and KESC of buying power from the private sector, and to reflect
the actual dispatch of the system. For the purpose of the economic
analysis, financial charges, and rate of return should be excluded.
Further, private power projects are to be considered as investments to
be funded at the beginning of the period of analysis.
2/    This capital cost reflect a conservative estimate, more compatible for
steam plants (among the different private sector projects there are
combined cycle plants with a lower capital cost).

8.    The economic benefits associated with the power investment program are the
values of the incremental sales made possible by implementing the proposed long-
term development program. From FY1999 onwards, WAPDA and KESC would be able to
increase their sales, even in the without program case, due to a more intensive
use of the available capacity. In order to take into account these factors, the
results of the optimization model developed under the without program case, have
been incorporated into the economic analysis.
9.    The  valuation  of  benefits  derived  from  incremental  sales  has  been
desegregated by consumer categories namely, residential, industrial, agriculture,
and others (which include commercial, public lighting, bulk, and traction) . For
the evaluation of the benefits, a distinction has to be made between consumers
already connected to the system by FY1998, and new consumers that are first
connected from FY1999 onwards.   In the without program case, the incremental
consumption of existing consumers (no new consumers are assumed to be connected
to the system, as neither WAPDA and KESC will have adequate supply capability)
is a function of the overall income growth of the Pakistan economy.
10.   For the calculation of the benefits, a disaggregation of projected sales
for each consumer category has been done by developing a spreadsheet model of
projected sales as a function of the following:
*     overall sales growth,
-     the rate of new connections,
the projected tariff levels needed to meet WAPDA's financial objectives
and a gradual elimination of cross-subsidies (through price elasticity of
category demand),
the projected growth in incomes (through income elasticity of projected
demand), and
-     the build-up rate of consumption from new connections.
Combination of values of these factors (for which assumptions have been made) was
chosen to calibrate the total desegregated sales to the projected overall path
of sales, so as to make the benefits evaluation derived from the model consistent
with the projected sales.
Benefits Evaluation
11.   Benefits to Residential Consumers.  The increase in population growth is
expected to decline from the present 3% to 2.89 in FY2000, and 2.52% thereafter.
Given the average GDP growth rate between FY1994-2006 of about 5.6% for the base
macroeconomic scenario, the resulting GDP per capita is expected to increase at
the average of about 2.9% p.a. during the same period. This growth rate, which
has been adopted as proxy for the annual growth in household income, is
equivalent to an increase in real household income of 40% between FY1994 and
FY2006. This assumes no change in average household size.
12.   In the last 12 years, new connections in the residential sector increased
at the average of about 400,000 per year. However, during the last seven years,
new connections averaged 453,000 a year.   For modelling purposes, during the
period FY1994-2006, new connections to households are assumed to increase at the
average of about 660,000 per year. Such a rate of new connections appears to be
sustainable over a medium term, given that, at present, less than half of the



-200-                            ANNEX 8.2
Page 4 of 12
Pakistan population has access to electricity. The other assumptions used for
the modelling of residential sales are the following: a price elasticity of -
0.35, and electricity price in real terms for households almost doubling upto
FY2006; an income elasticity of 2.6 between FY94-2000, and 1.8 between FY2001-
2006; and an average consumption rate of 1967kWh/year for a mature consumer.
13.   Valuation of the benefits for new residential users is divided into the
following two components: (i) substitution of existing methods of lighting
(kerosene lanterns) by electric lighting, that is resource cost savings; and (ii)
the consumers' surplus derived from the additional quantity of electricity above
the substituted level caused by the large drop in the price of energy that comes
with a switch from non-electrical method of lighting to electric forms.
14.   The results of the Household Energy Strategy Study indicates that the
average consumption of kerosene per non-electrified household in Pakistan is
about 60 litres/year (of which over 98% is primarily used for lighting purposes).
This result, combined with field observations, suggests that a non-electrified
household consumes on average an equivalent 42kWh/year of kerosene lantern,
equivalent to an annual expenditure of about Rs. 850 (or an average cost of
Rs.20/Kwh). This estimates identifies the resource cost savings associated to
a new connection.
15.    The consumption rate for a mature connection at the prevailing tariff
identifies the upper limit at the margin of total consumption. In FY1999, this
point is defined by Rs.1.3/Kwh (the projected tariff in 1994 prices) and 2525kWh.
The benefits associated to such induced consumption (consumers' surplus), are a
function of the area under the user's demand curve for electricity. In other
words, consumers' surplus for each user depends on the shape of the demand curve.
Under the modelling of residential sales, it was assumed that a semi-log demand
curve/ passes through the two points described above. The choice of a semi-log
form has the advantage of estimating on conservative basis the consumers surplus
from the use of electricity.
16.   However, given the income effect created by the large drop in the price of
energy, an adjustment to the demand curve is necessary in order to avoid an
overestimate of the consumers'  surplus.   Thus,  the demand curve has been
recalculated to take into account such compensating variation for the consumer.
On the assumption of a linear relationship between the level of electricity
consumption and household income, this adjustment factor is 0.87.
17.   Benefits to Industrial and other sectors.   The basis for valuing the
benefits of post-1998 incremental sales to industrial and other users, i.e.,
agriculture, commercial, bulk supply, etc., is the cost that these users would
incur if they had to meet their electricity needs by investing in and operating
diesel generators on their own premises, instead of being able to take supply
3/    The semi-log form is:
Q = A + B ln P
where A is a positive constant and B is a negative constant. The
adoption of a straight line curve would overestimate the consumers'
surplus.

from WAPDA and KESC. That is, an avoided user cost has been used as proxy for
this class of consumers.
18.   Industrial consumers are divided into two categories: small users with 1lkW
ginset and an annual consumption of 22886kWh, and medium- and large users with
a 500kW ginset and an annual consumption of 55592kWh. Excluding amortization of
capital costs, the cost per equivalent unit of electricity (which includes fuel
and operating expenses) amount to Rs.5.59/Kwh and Rs.4.79/Kwh for small- and
medium/large size industrial consumers respectively.
19.  Agricultural consumers utilize using diesel oil tubewells as alternative
to electricity. According to field observations provided by WAPDA, most of the
tubewells use low speed diesel oil, and the average rating of the diesel pump is
19HP with a utilization factor of 32.5%. The equivalent amount of electricity
corresponds to 22886kWh.   Under these assumptions,  the cost per unit of
electricity equivalent (excluding depreciation) is Rs.4.35/Kwh.
20.   For the "others" consumer category including commercial, bulk consumers,
public lighting and traction, an avoid cost average between small industry,
residential and agricultural has been calculated. The assumed average annual
operating time is 2320 hours per year, and the cost per equivalent unit of
electricity is Rs. 4.96/Kwh.
Economic Rate of Return for the Base Case
21.  The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the base case is estimated at about
27% based on the methodology and assumptions outlined in the previous sections.

22.    Sensitivity Analysis.   A sensitivity analysis on the base case has been
carried out to test the robustness of the ERR of the proposed development program
to less favorable scenarios regarding increase in program costs (including GBHP),
delay in implementation of the program, decrease in benefits, and combinations
of  these  events.    Further,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the
additional amount of capacity (MW) from private power projects commissioned
during the period, particularly by FY2002.

26.   Similarly to the Base Case, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for
the Low Load Forecast to test the robustness of the ERR to increasing additional
capacity of private thermal power plants. The results are presented below.

27.   Under the High Load forecast, the ERR is estimated at about 32%.   A
sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the ERR to a 20%
increase in capital cost of the program. The resulting ERR is about 28%
Risk Analysis
28.   Introduction.  The sensitivity analysis has demonstrated that the ERR of
the proposed development program is robust to uncertainties related to capital
costs, delay in program schedule, and to combinations of the above. The analysis
has also demonstrated that the ERR is well above the opportunity cost of capital
under different assumptions regarding the amount of additional capacity assumed
to be installed by the private sector. However, the number of risks that are
extraneous to the project design are numerous. Given that a combination of such
risks could occur, a probabilistic approach in evaluating the economics of the
proposed development program is warranted.
29.   This approach assigns probabilities to the different scenarios so that a
weighted average ERR can be obtained. In this way, each scenario is not treated
as a simple alternative of any other, as is the case for the sensitivity
analysis, but provides a good understanding of which outcome is more or less
likely.    Finally,  such  risk  analysis  allows  to  construct  a  probability
distribution of ERRs.
30.   Demand Profiles.   The probability to be attached to each macroeconomic
scenario, on the basis of which the demand forecast is formulated, is subject to
change depending on the new developments in the country. Nevertheless, the Base
scenario, i.e. gradual pace of reforms and uneven progress across different
components of the program is much more likely to materialize than either the High
scenario,  i.e.,  deep  reforms  implemented  in  a  timely  fashion  across  all
components of the program, or the Low scenario, i.e. serious policy slippage.
Therefore the probabilities associated with the underlying macro and structural
policies in each scenario (from which certain key outcomes such as the rate of
growth of GDP, inflation, trade performance, etc. are derived), are the
following: 50 percent for the Base scenario, 25% for the Low scenario, and 25%
for the High Scenario.
31.   Cost Profiles.  The risk analysis considers two scenarios with respect to
cost overruns for the power system development program. As regards investments

Page 8 of 12
in generation, which account for about 56 percent of the total investments during
the period FY1994-2006, a distinction should be made between GBHP (the only new
public sector investment) and private thermal power projects. The advanced level
of preparation of GBHP, and the conservative cost estimates included in the
analysis, as also demonstrated by the recent results of two of the main three
bids, would suggest to assume moderate probabilities on cost overruns for this
project. GBHP investments account for about 10 percent of the total cost of the
power program FY95-2006, and about 18 percent of the generation capital cost in
the same period. Based on the above, the following probabilities for the cost
profile for GBHP have been assumed: 20 percent no cost overrun, 40 percent with
cost overrun of 15 percent, and 40 percent with cost overrun of 30 percent.
32.   Given the increasing private sector investments  in the power system
(accounting for about 68 percent of total generation cost during the period), it
is unlikely that cost overruns could affect other generation projects. However,
a distinction needs to be made between private generation projects, and ongoing
public sector projects (accounting for about 14 percent of total generation
investments in the period). For the private sector investments, the following
probabilities have been assigned: 60 percent with no cost overrun, 30 percent
with 15 percent cost overrun, and 1.0 percent with 30 percent cost overrun. For
ongoing public sector projects, the following probabilities have been assumed:
40 percent with no cost overrun, 50 percent with cost overrun of 15 percent, and
10 percent with cost overrun of 30 percent.
33.   Similarly  to  other  public  sector  projects,  the  implementation  of
transmission and distribution investments (accounting for about 44 percent of the
total program cost in the period)  could be subject to cost overruns.   The
following probabilities have been therefore utilized: 40 percent probability of
no cost overruns, 50 percent probability of cost overruns of 15 percent, and 10
percent probability of cost overruns of 30 percent.
34.   Based on the incidence of each of the above component in the investment
program for the period FY1995-2006, the following weighted probabilities have
been utilized: 45 percent probability of no cost overruns, 40 percent probability
of cost overruns of 15 percent, and 15 percent probability of cost overruns of
30 percent.
35.   Schedule Profile.   The risk analysis of schedule delay in the power
development program is similar to the one discussed above for the cost overrun
scenarios.   However, in order to take into account possible difficulties in
securing the financing requirements for private sector projects, a higher
probability has been attached to a two year delay in the program. Therefore, the
following probabilities have been utilized:
no delay      (40%)
1 year delay (40%)
2 year delay (20%)
36.   IPP.  As of March 1995, 32 projects with a combined capacity of about
9000MW were supposed to be commissioned in the next few years, including an
agreement with a private sector group for the implementation of power generation
complex of 1240MW based on imported coal. A recent analysis on those projects
carried out in collaboration with the Government, and in consultation with
representatives of private sector investors involved in those projects, concluded
that about 1600MW of those projects are very likely to be commissioned by FY1998,
and an additional 1000-1500MW could be commissioned by FY2000. The prospects for



-205-
ANNEX 8.2
Page 9 of 12
the remaining projects being implemented are considerably lower. This is because
several LOSs were issued to sponsors with uncertain capability of implementing
their projects. Further, only limited debt financing is likely to be available
due, in part, to the Pakistan country risk perception from lenders, and the
country credit ceiling from both export credit agencies and multilateral
institutions.
37.   Notwithstanding the above analysis, the least-cost analysis (see Annex 8.1)
has demonstrated that the minimum additional private power generation required
by the system by FY2002 is 3100MW (Low Scenario). Therefore, as the purpose of
this analysis is to assess the robustness of the proposed program to
uncertainties in the number of thermal power projects to be implemented, 3100MW
has been taken as the minimum expected additional capacity. Based on the above
considerations and analysis, the following probabilities have been therefore
assigned to additional capacity of private power projects:
3100MW (50%)
5200MW (40%)
7200MW (10%)
38.   Risk Analysis: Results.  On the basis of the above analysis, there are four
factors, i.e., demand, schedule profile, cost overruns and number of private
power projects, each with three alternative states. The total possible number
of outcomes is thus fifty-four. For each outcome, the expected value of the ERR,
calculated as probability times its own ERR, is then summed over all outcomes to
give the expected ERR. A probability distribution of ERR has been calculated,
and shown in Fig. 8.1.
39.   The expected value of the ERR is 18%, which is lower than the ERR of the
Base case (27%), but still higher than the opportunity cost of capital.  The
probability of being below 12 percent is 8%. The histogram of the ERRs presented
in Fig.  8.1  (probability distribution of ERR)  indicates  that the highest
probability is associ.ated with ERRs in the range of 16% to 23% (combined
probability of  over  55%),  followed by ERR between  12%  to  15%  (combined
probability of about 25%). The remaining 18% is distributed between very high
ERRs above 24% (about 10%) and ERRs less than 12% (8%).



-206-
ANNEX 8. 2
Page 10 of 12
40.   It should be noted that under the Base and High demand scenarios, the
probability of ERR lower than the opportunity cost of capital is zero, even under
the most unfavorable combinations of higher capital costs, delay in the schedule,
and increasing number of private power plants. The 8 percent probability of ERR
being below 12% is mostly attributable to a combination of Low demand scenario,
30 percent higher capital cost, and two year delay in the implementation of the
program.
41.   A sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the probabilities attached
to the capital cost, schedule and demand risks (see Table 6) . The results again
confirms that the weighted-risk ERR is around 171-18%, and the risk of falling
below 12% is in the range of 10%, mostly attributable to a combination of the
above greater risks with a Low demand scenario.

Economic Analysis on Ghazi Barotha alone
42.   Introduction and Main Assumptions. Hydropower projects are generally more
prone to cost overruns and schedule delays than smaller thermal power projects.
Thus, in order to more directly assess the impact of these adverse events on the
economic viability of Ghazi Barotha, a separate economic analysis has been
developed for the project alone.  The ERR is calculated on the basis of the
incremental cost and benefits streams associated with the implementation of the
project.
43.   The costs associated with GBHP consist of the estimated capital costs and
related operating and maintenance costs calculated as a percentage of the capital
costs (one percent) . Benefits are valued in terms of the incremental demand that
can be served by the project. Such demand has been calculated on the basis of
the average annual electricity generated by the project less the transmission and
distribution losses.  The valuation of the benefits derived from incremental
sales has been desegregated by consumer categories, i.e., residential,
industrial, agricultural, and others, according to their shares in the demand
forecast.   The methodology utilized to estimate benefits for each consumer
category is almost identical to the one adopted in the previous analysis on the
power investment program. New consumers are assumed to be connected to the grid
as a result of the implementation of the project, on the basis of their
proportion in overall demand, and their average consumption in FY2002.  This
connection program is assumed to be implemented in four to five years.

44.   ERR and Sensitivity Analysis.  The results indicate that the estimated ERR
is about 30%.  Such estimate is consistent with the results of the economic
analysis on the power investment program, as GBHP is more economical than the
thermal power plants representing the bulk of the generation investment program.
The estimated ERR is independent from the demand scenario adopted, as the least-
cost analysis has demonstrated that even under the Low scenario, GBHP is required
at its earliest completion date.
45.   A sensitivity analysis has been developed to determine the robustness of
the economics of the project to changes in cost profile and schedule.   The
results, which are presented in Table 8 below, show that the ERR is always above
20 percent.

with cost overrun of 30% and 1 year delay           22.82%
with cost overrun of 30% and 2 year delay           20.65%
46.   Risk Analysis.  Based on the methodology and similar assumptions adopted
for the power investment program, a risk analysis on the GBHP alone has been
developed. While the scenarios identified in the previous analysis are the same,
a different set of probabilities and risks have been identified for this
analysis. In particular, a higher cost overrun risk and a schedule slippage risk
have been assigned to the project alone, given its riskier nature compared to the
overall power investment program. The new scenarios and probabilities are given
below:
Cost Overruns                                Schedule Slippage
No Cost Overruns  probability I0.20          No Delay  probability  0.20
+15% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.40       1 Year Delay  probability = 0.40
+30% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.30      2 Year Delay  probability = 0.30
+40% Cost Overruns  probability = 0.10      3 Year Delay  probability = 0.10
47.   The risk-weighted ERR for the project alone is estimated at about 23%, and
its probability of falling below the opportunity cost of capital is zero. This



-208-                         ANNEX 8.2
Page 12 of 12
is because under any unfavorable scenarios considered, the ERR remains above the
level of 18%. The least-cost analysis (see Annex 8.1) has demonstrated that,
even under the Low demand scenario, GBHP is selected at its earliest completion
date. Thus, the adverse impact derived from a combination of high cost overruns
and schedule delay, though in evidence, does not affect the overall viability of
the project. The probability distribution of ERR on GBHP alone is shown in Fig.
2 below.
