GHAZI-GARIALA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES
1.      INTRODUCTION
Ghazi-Gariala Hydropower Project (Project) is a joint venture of
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and World Bank. The
proposed Project is of great national importance because after
its completion it would help in coping with the ever-increasing
energy and power requirements of a developing country like
Pakistan. The primary objective is to generate approximately 1200
mega watts power by channelizing water from the Indus. It is,
however, a multipurpose project to boost social conditions and
improve economic structure of the peoples by giving fillip to the
industrial development of Pakistan, thereby solving problem of
unemployment in the region, to a greater extent.
The Project envisages construction of a barrage on the Indus
river to create a water pool and reservoir about 6 kilometer
down-stream of Tarbela Dam and just above Ghazi village in
Haripur Tehsil of North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) (P1.I).
From the left bank of the pool, about sixty thousand cusecs of
water would be carried through 53 kilometer long power channel
running 1100 feet above mean sea level. The proposed power
channel will run through Haripur Tehsil and Attock down to
village Barotha (Drawing 1). Near village Barotha, a Power
Complex has been designed by utilizing a natural fall of about
200 feet necessary for the power generation, where sufficient
space for tail race is also available before the water rejoins
the river Indus about 4 kilometer north of the confluence of
river Indus and Haro (P1.II).
The WAPDA and World Bank appointed Pakistan Hydro Consultants
(PHC) to examine feasibility, design study and economic viability
of the Project. But equally important aspect of the assignment of
the PHC was to undertake environmental study and make assessment
of the area covered by the Project, with a view to document and
map archaeological and cultural wealth likely to be affected or
completely obliterated after its commissioning. It is in this
background that on the request of the PHC, the Department of
Archaeology and Museums (DAP) undertook archaeological survey and
exploratory scanning of the area within the proposed area covered
by the pool, power complex and to the extent of 500 metres along
both the banks of the Power Channel.
Before the commencement of the archaeological explorations,
familiarization trips were undertaken within the pool area and
along the alignment of the Power Channel from village Ghazi to
Barotha. It was necessary to have a clear picture of the area to
be subjected to the archaeological scanning which helped
precisely in determining the targets and quickening the pace of
work.
1



Regular survey of the Project area was started on 10th January,
1991 and was completed on 26th January, 1991. During the course
of the survey, the area in question was thoroughly explored, and
a few archaeological cultural mounds representing Buddhist stupas
and settlement sites were recorded.
Here it may be emphasized that the Project area is a part of
Gandhara region, welknown for richness of the Buddhist
monasteries, stupas and settlements.
2.      LOCATION OF THE PROJECT AREA
The Project area is partly located in the south western corner of
Haripur Tehsil of NWFP and almost in the centre of Attock Tehsil
of district Attock in the Punjab (Drawing 1). On the north, the
area in question is bounded by Tarbela Dam in Hazara Hills while
river Indus runs all along its western and southern boundary
line. On the east, area is cordoned by the Gandgarh hills running
down almost due south for almost half of the length gradually
dying out near Lawrencepur. Further east, the area is bounded by
river Haro which runs deep below the general topographical
surface level before it joins Indus below village Gariala.
3.      PHYSICAL FEATURES AND ENVIRONMENT
Interesting variations in physical and topographical features
within the Project area were observed. Mostly, the Project area
is plain containing sandy silt and loessic deposits of
considerable thickness. The area from Tarbela to Isa and south of
Dakhner is marked by the presence of gravel conglomerates, while
rock out-crops are present at Kamra (Pl.IIB) and from Rumian to
Dakhner (P1.III & IV). Numerous hill torrents from Gandgarh hills
have almost eroded the loessic deposits and formed deep gullies
and undulating surface rendering it unfit for agricultural
activities and thus inhospitable for human settlements. It is
only near the Indus bank that solid ground with annual silting is
available for agricultural pursuits in the area generally known
as Chhachh plains (Pl.V). Even today, almost all the modern
villages are located in the western half of the Project area upto
Kamra hills (Drawing 1 and Pl.V). The area on the east of the
proposed Power Channel is almost built up of non-metamorphic soft
sedimentary rocks eroded from Gandgarh hills due to weatheric
changes and rain action. This heavy erosion have rendered the
land unsuitable for any kind of agricultural activity especially
during ancient period of history, although with the introduction
of modern machinery it has become somewhat possible now, to make
certain areas cultivable.
The area beyond Kamra to Barotha contains soft sandy silt and is
thus unfit for agricultural activities (Pl.IV and VI). Solid land
is available only between Dher and Gariala.
2



Here it may be pointed out that generally the Project area does
not possess hospitable topographical and physiographical features
suitable for any settlement of considerable size. The entire area
except the Chhachh plain and plateau of Gandgarh hills with
alluvial deposits, is practically without any ancient settlement.
It is in the fertile alluvial plains of Chhachh, that small
settlements and Buddhist monastery and stupa sites have been
recorded.
Further east in the Gandgarh hills flat plateau have been used
for the establishment of stupas and monasteries during Buddhist
period (Khan and Khan, 1986). A number of such establishments
have already been documented but that have no relevance in the
present context because they are located far away from the
Project area.
4.      HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The Project area being part of the north west regions of Pakistan
and located on the routes of the invading tribes and armies, had
remained exposed to their inroads from the time immemorial. These
invaders, starting from the Aryans in c.1500 B.C. stormed one
after another through the narrow defiles that break through the
great rocky barriers and leads to the plains of the interior,
till the establishment of Durand line in 1893. The inflow of the
Aryans was followed by the Achaemenians in 518 B.C under Darius I
and Alexander the Great in 326 B.C. The subsequent centuries
witnessed successive rise and fall of Mauryians (c.317-232 B.C),
Bactrian Greeks (c.190-90 B.C), Scythians (90 B.C - 18 A.D),
Parthians (c.18-60 A.D), Kushanas (c.60-460 A.D) White Huns
(c.460-470 A.D), Imperial Guptas (320-528 A.D) Hindu Shahias
(8th-llth Century A.D), Afghans (1001 A.D), spear headed by
Mahmud of Ghazna and finally the Great Mughals (1526-1857 A.D)
under Zaheeruddin Babur.
5.      KNOWN ANCIENT SITES IN THE PROJECT AREA
5.1     General
Although the Project area is located on the route of different
marching tribes and armies yet, due to its inhospitable
physiography and topographical environments, no sizeable
settlements flourished in the past. However, the researches
already carried out in the area have brought to light a)
palaeolithic stone implements, b)petroglyphs on boulders, c)
Buddhist settlements and stupa sites and d) muslim period
monuments.
3



5.2     Palaeolithic Tool Sites
It was in 1935 that during the geological survey of Soan Valley
early palaeolithic stone implements including choppers chopping
tools, bi-facial hand axes and cleavers of quartzite were found
at Gariala in considerably worn condition (de Terra and Paterson,
1939, Paterson and Drummond, 1962) . However, during the
subsequent investigations around Gariala did not yield any fresh
evidence of palaeolithic tools. (Movius 1943, Johnson, 1964,
Allchin, 1981).
5.3     Petroglypbs
The presence of large size erratic boulders varying in girth and
height within the area around Gariala were documented in 1935 by
the Yale-Cambridge Expedition (de Terra and Paterson, 1939) which
support the supposition that before Indus cut its way through
Attock hills, its course was lain more to the east of the present
river. These large size boulders appear to have been brought in
the area during catastrophic flooding of Indus lakes in the high
mountainious region during the Pleistocene period (Rendell,
Dennell & Halim, 1989 ch.3). Some of these faceted boulders bear
brusings depicting crude and abstract renderings of elephant and
camel riders, hunters with bow and arrows and lances (king, 1940
p.48). During subsequent explorations, large size boulders with
similar petroglyphs were recorded at present river level at
Mandori (Paterson & Drummond 1962 pp. 119-122 Plate III). The
petroglyphic drawing are punched into the original patina of the
boulders with pointed stone tools. Since, there is no evidence of
subsequent patina over the petroglyphs, it is reasonable to
presume that these renderings belong to more recent times.
5.4     Buddhist Sites
The discovery of two Kharoshti inscriptions from Garhi-Matani and
Kamra (Dobbins, 1975) indicated the presence of important
settlements during Kushan era under Kanishka and Vajeshka
respectively.
Other sites located on the east of the Project area on the
plateau and slopes of the Gandgarh hills include Buddhist stupa
and Monastery sites at Khui Khezana, Injulser and. Garhi
approachable through causeway No. 7, 5 & 3 on the old
Lawrencepur-Tarbela Railway Track ( Khan and Khan, 1986 ). These
sites of Kushan period are placed in chronological context of
2nd-3rd century A.D on the basis of available epigraphical
evidence (Dobbins, 1975).
4



5.5     Muslim Monuments
The Muslim period monuments are mainly Attock Fort, are
Begum-ki-Sarai, Behram ki Baradari, Attock Tombs at Attock/ near
and around Attock Bridge and Chitti Baoli near Kamra and Saiden
Baoli on the Grand Trunk Road near Hattian. They belong to the
Mughal period and are protected monuments under the Antiquities
Act, 1975. Attock Fort and Begum ki Sarai were built by Akbar the
Great (1556-1605 A.D) and Jahangir (1605-1627 A.D), while the
remaining monuments on the Grand Trunk Road belong to Shah
Jahan's period (1627-1656 A.D).
6.      NEW DISCOVERIES
6.1     General
The present archaeological explorations within the Project area
has revealed the remains of three Buddhist settlement sites at
Hasanpur, Musa II and Pindanwala Tibba. Buddhist stupa sites were
recorded at Musa I, Musa III and Patri near Dakhner on the bank
of Indus. A large Fort of Hindu Shahia period was located on the
hills between present Pehur Pumping Plant and Gala village on the
right bank of river Indus. A boulder near the confluence of river
Haro and Indus was noticed with petroglyphs of human
representation.
The details of new sites in the Project area are described below
in chronological sequence :
6.2     Palaeolithic Artefact (Cleaver)
(sE. 72'.171.5311 N.33*.501)
The area between Dakhner and Gariala is marked by the presence of
conglomerate horizons, mainly composed of boulders and gravels.
But due to lack and failing of cementation these conglomerate
horizons have considerably been eroded. One of such horizon,
located in middle of Rumian and Dakhner on the left side of
Dakhner Nullah, was examined and only one palaeolithic artefact
(Pl.VII) was found at the foot of an eroded gully. Since, our
present artifact (cleaver) comes from an eroded gully, it is not
possible either to date it or to correlate it with any other
artefact found elsewhere in the Soan Valley (Rendell, Dannell &
Halim, 1989). The artefact is a quartzite pebble tool which has
been worked on two sides. From one side four flakes have been
taken off (Pl.VIIA) while from the other side only two flakes
were struck off to obtain the point (Pl.VIIB), leaving enough
surface with original cortex. It has a thick and broad butt. The
ridges formed by flaking are blunt due to its rolling.
In order to obtain secure dating, certainly more investigations
at this locality are required to find artefacts inrelation to the
conglomerate horizons.
5



6.3     Petroglyphs (E. 72°.15'.07" N 330.461.07"1)
A number of erratic boulders of varying sizes were encountered in
the south western part of the Project area between Dakhner and
Gariala with major-concentration around Gariala and Barotha
(Pl.VIII & IX). Presence of these erratic boulders had already
been noted in this area (Theobold, 1877, Wynne, 1881, Cotter,
1933, De Terra and Teilhard, 1936, 794). Some of these faceted
boulders bear petroglyphs depicting human and animals in abstract
rendering (King,1940:48, Paterson and Drummond, 1962: 119-122,
Pl.III). A similar faceted boulder with petroglyphic depicting of
hunters figure with a bow on its three sides (Pl.X & XI) was
located in the bed of Gariala Nullah at a distance of about 100
metres east of the confluence of Haro and Indus. The petroglyphic
rendering on the boulder had been punched into the patina of the
boulder with pointed stone (Pl.XI). All the three depictions bear
close resemblance with each others (Pl.XI). It may however be
pointed out that figure 1 (Pl.XIA) seems to be earlier than the
figures  2 and  3  (Pl.XIB  & C),  because  figure  1 shows
indiscernible coating of weatheric varnish; where as other twos
are without it. It is therefore reasonable to infer that Figure 2
& 3 are recent rendering. It may be of some interest to mention
here that near the shrine of Khadi Baba three young boys were
found busy in striking on the faceted portion of rock block with
small stones. This passing time activity of those cattle grazers
resulted in making bowl shaped circular cavities on the rock
(Pl.XII).
6.4     Hasanpur (E 72°.35'.46" N 33°.581.4711)
The ancient mound of Hasanpur is located about 200 metres left of
Ghazi-Lawrencepur road near village Hasanpur and in the immediate
southern vicinity of the Afghan Refugee Camp. The mound rises to
the height of 7 metres above the surrounding terraced fields
(Pl.XIIIA). The mound has been considerably disturbed during
recent times (Pl.XIIIB). The stone walls of river pebbles,
ranging in thickness from 60 to 90 cms are visible on the slopes
of the mound (Pl.XIIIB and XIVA).
The surface collection from Hasanpur mostly comprises plain red
pottery ware varying in texture. The notable pottery types
include fragmentary rims, necks and bases of large and medium
size pitchers (Pl.XIVB No. 1-3,5&8) Jars (Pl.XIVB No.4,6 & 7) and
pans (Pl.XIV B No. 9-11) and one complete oil lamp (P1. XIVC
No. 1) . Some of the rims of large size jars are externally
thickened. Generally the pottery is turned on slow wheel. The
string marks are evident on the basis (Pl.XIVB No. 12-14). The
surface decoration includes incised triangles and circles on the
shoulders (Pl.XIVC No.2 & 3).
The surface collection of ceramic data from Hasanpur, on the
basis of their forms and types, are comparable with the usual
ceramic types from the known settlements of Sirkap and Sirsukh in
Taxila belonging to Kushana period in the chronological bracket
6



of 3rd-5th century A.D. Other comparable parallels of types have
been recorded from the ancient city of Shaikhan Dheri and
Charsadda in district Mardan.
6.5     Musa II (E 720.29'.271 N 330.521)
Musa II is a small mound rising about 5 metres above the
surrounding field levels (PI.XVA). A portion of its flat top is
covered with the modern graves. (Pl.XVB). Due to intensive
agricultural activities and levelling of land with the help of
tractors, the size of the mound had been gradually reduced and it
is not possible to determine original size of the settlement.
However, presence of pottery in the surrounding fields indicates
rather a larger settlement than what we see today.
The surface collection from the mound and fields include
fragments of red-ware pottery representing thick textured jars
(Pl.XVIA, No.1-3) pitchers (Pl.XVIA, No.6-10), pans and bowls
(Pl.XVIA, No. 13-17). In certain cases, black bands have been
painted on red (Pl.XVIA, No.9-12). Some potsherds are incised
with a set of tripple lines below which angular lines have been
incised (Pl.XVIA, No.5).
On the basis of forms and types the pottery collection from Musa
II is also comparable with the known pottery types from Taxila,
Hasanpur, Charsadda and other related settlements in Gandhara
region belonging to 3rd-5th century A.D. during Kushana period.
6.6     Pindanwala Tibba (E 72°.28'.45" N 330.51'.47")
The ancient mound locally known as Pindanwala Tibba is located at
a distance of about one kilometer from Musa II and III, near
village Kolithian. The mound conceals a large size settlement
with 6 metre thick cultural deposit (Pl.XVI B and XVII A). It is
evident that the settlement remained under human occupation for a
considerable duration.
The mound rises about 15 metres from the surrounding field levels
in near circular formations (Pl.XVIB) and from the eroded section
at different points, two burnt deposits were observed throughout
the mound which indicate that the settlement was put ablaze at
least two times (Pl.XVIIA). It is perhaps this reason that the
mound is locally known as Pindanwala Tibba suggesting that the
settlement was more than once occupied, destroyed and abandoned.
On the surface stone walls of usual thickness of 60 to 90 cms are
visible and in the eroded section there is evidence of mud brick
structural remains also.
The surface of the mound and its eroded gullies are strewn with
cultural material (Pl.XVIIB). Collection from mound mainly
include fragments of different pottery types including medium and
thick textured pitchers (Pl.XVIII A No.1,3,5-8 & 11), Jars
(Pl.XVIIIA No.2,4 & 9) pans (Pl.XVIIIA No.12&13) and bowls
7



(Pl.XVIIIA No.14-16). Others types include specimens of lids with
and without knobs (Pl.XVIIIB No.1-3) and miniature pots
(Pl.XVIIIB No.4-5). In certain cases, incised decoration has also
been employed. Interior and exterior of fragments of openmouthed
bowls are coated with dull red slip; whereas decoration of black
band and black vertical lines also appear on some of the
potsherds. Cordon design on the shoulder portion can also be
observed (Pl.XVIII B No.6-9). A singular fragmentary specimen of
pottery mould (Pl.XVIIIB, No. 12) is comparable with the Taxila
specimen datable to 4th century A.D. Some of the bases of the
bowl (Pl.XVIIIC) show prominent string marks. The pottery
collection from Pindanwala Tibba also relates to 3rd-5th century
A.D. ceramic data recorded from the settlement sites of Buddhist
period at Charsadda and known city settlements at Taxila. In the
entire project area, Pindanwala Tibba is archaeologically the
most potential settlement site. The thick cultural deposits
indicate long and successive human occupation from 2nd-5th
century A.D.
6.7     Musa I (E 72°.29'.37" N 330.511.4011)
The mound Musa I, about 7 metre above the field level (Pl.XIX A)
represents disturbed Buddhist stupa and monastery site. The mound
has been disturbed by the sculpture hunters (Pl.XIX B), because
from the clandestine digging area of the mound, fragments of
stucco sculptures have been found (Pl.XXA). Structures of river
boulders are also visible. The stucco fragments of sculptures and
friezes contain traces of red paint (Pl.XXA No.2,5 & 6).
Therefore a late date of 4th-5th century A.D. is suggested for
the stupa at Musa I, and are comparable with stucco sculptures
bearing red paint, recorded from the monastery and stupa sites at
Mohra Moradu and Jaulian in Taxila. It appears that the stupa at
Musa I has been completely destroyed by the vandalists.
6.8     Musa III  (E 72'.29'.09" N 33*.51'.30")
Musa III is located in the immediate vicinity of Musa I and II,
and rises to the height of 10 metres from the surrounding field
levels. The mound gradually slopes towards east with top surface
almost levelled for cultivations (Pl.XXIA). Carved schist stone
collection from Musa III represents fragmentary specimens of
trefoil arched panels (P1.XXIB No.l&b2) and decorative bracket
with Corinthian capital (Pl.XXIB No.3). The stucco collection
include fragments of votive stupa decorations (P1.XXIIA No.3-9),
pilaster and pieces of drapery fold of sculptures (Pl.XXIIA No.10
& 11). On some of the stucco fragments traces of red paint are
visible (Pl.XXIIA No.5-7). As such Musa III is also dated between
3rd and 5th century A.D. during the late Kushan period.

6.9     Patri near Dakhner  (E 72¾.14f.26"1 N 33'.500.15"9)
Patri is located south-west of Dakhner village on the hill top
(Pl.XXIIB) at the bank of river Indus, just opposite Darwazi
village on the right bank (Pl.XXIIIA). It contains structural
remains of a Buddhist monastery and stupa belonging to Kushan
period. At places semi-ashlar masonry walls of monastic cells are
visible to the surviving height of one to two metres (Pl.XXIIIB &
XXIVA). Later, during the second half of the 19th century, Patri
was occupied by a watch tower (Pl.XXV) most probably constructed
during Anglo-Afghan wars fought in the second half of 19th
Century.
British period structural remains of watch Tower still survives
in a dilapidated condition (Pl.XXV) and over looking the mighty
Indus below.
7.      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1     Conclusions
In view of the limited time at our disposal and objective of the
PHC, archaeological explorations were confined to the
pool/barrage area, both the banks of the Power Channel to the
extent of 500 metres and the area of Power Complex. The primary
aim was to determine the presence of the sites to be affected by
the implementation of the Ghazi-Gariala Hydropower Project.
Within the Pool/Barrage and Power Complex areas no ancient site
was found. However, within the power channel and its close
vicinity, five ancient sites were encountered at Musa I, II, III,
Pindanwala Tibba and at a mound between Rumian and Dakhner. These
sites represent Buddhist'period stupa and settlement sites at
Musa I and III and Musa II and Pindanwala Tibba respectively,
while the mound between Rumian and Dakhner, represents a
palaeolithic locality.
Amongst the above sites, Musa I and III would be directly hit by
the construction of the Power Channel, whereas, Musa II,
Pindanwala Tibba and palaeolithic locality between Rumian and
Dakhner would be affected indirectly due to their close locations
in the immediate vicinity of the Power Channel.
7.2     Recommendations
Since Musa I and III are located within the area to be excavated
for the Power Channel, salvage operation should be carried out
before the commencement of the Project. It is necessary to
retrieve and preserve cultural material for the posterity before
these sites are lost for ever.
9



Musa II and Pindanwala Tibba being the most important settlement
sites in the near vicinity of the Power Channel, it is strongly
recommended that the excavated soil should not be dumped on these
sites, so that they remain available for future investigations.
Palaeolithic locality between Rumian and Dakhner should also be
saved from the dumping of excavated soil.
During the excavation of Power Channel, two archaeologists from
the Department of Archaeology & Museums, should make periodical
inspection visits to examine the excavated area.
Any archaeological feature/ancient remains encountered during the
construction of Power Channel should invariably be brought to the
notice of Archaeological Museum, Taxila - the nearest available
office of the Department of Archaeology & Museums, Government of
Pakistan.
