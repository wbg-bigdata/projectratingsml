MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for US$350 million to help finance the Ghazi
Barotha Hydropower Project (GBHP). The proposed loan would be at the standard interest rate
for LIBOR-based US Dollar single currency loans, with a maturity of 20 years including five years
of grace, and would be onlent to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) on the
following commercial terms: (a) during construction period of the project, a variable rate equal to
the sum of the prevailing World Bank Lending Rate plus a spread of 150 basis points; and (b)
after completion of construction, a variable rate equal to the sum of the prevailing World Bank
Lending Rate plus a spread of 350 basis points. The repayment period would be up to 23 years
including up to 8 years of grace period. WAPDA will bear the foreigr exchange risk.
2.    Background. The development of the energy sector is essential for sustaining Pakistan's
economic growth, and improving the living standard of a rapidly growing population. Expansion
of power supply and increase in the efficiency of energy supply and demand are required to reduce
the high cost of electricity load shedding imposed on the economy since the early 1980s, and to
continue to increase access to electricity in rural areas. During the last few years, Pakistan has
made considerable progress in achieving a higher level of efficiency in its energy markets, through
price reforms and demand-side management measures, improvement of the financial performance
and accountability of public sector institutions, and the involvement of the private sector in areas
previously reserved to public monopolies. Given the high level of additional generating capacity
required to successfully eliminate load shedding (2,000 MW) and keep pace with the growth in
demand (1,000 NMW/year), the Government's strategy focuses on encouraging new thermal power
projects in the private sector supplemented by selected hydropower projects in the Indus Basin to
be built by the public sector. This strategy would allow the country to attract managerial skills
and financing from the private sector, and develop the more economical hydropower resources in
an environmentally sustainable manner. Such development would help maintain the hydro-thermal
balance in the power system required to fully take advantage of the economic and environmental
benefits of renewable sources available for electricity generation.
3.    In the power sector, the Government's far reaching policy and reform program has gained
momentum, as demonstrated by the numerous actions implemented and underway, which include:
(a) restructuring and unbundling the activities of the power sector utilities, including gradual
divestiture of selected assets of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and
privatization of the Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation (KESC); (b) construction of thermal
power plants and the main 500 kV transmission lines by the private sector on a Build-Own-
Operate (BOO) and Build-Own-Maintain (BOM) basis respectively; and (c) establishment of the



-2-
National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). An amendment to the WAPDA Act
was promulgated in 1994 to enable its corporatization and divestiture; the sale of WAPDA's
1,600 MW Kot Addu thermal power plant is near completion, while preparatory works for the
privatization of KESC, the sale of the Jamshoro power plant (880 MW) and one distribution Area
Electricity Board are underway. An ordinance creating NEPRA was promulgated in January
1995, and NEPRA staffing is in progress. Finally, in addition to the ongoing 1,290 MW Hub
Project, financial closure has been achieved for five private thermal generation plants totaling an
installed capacity of about 860 MW.
4.    Within this reform program, the Government, while pursuing private sector participation
in hydropower projects in other river basins, adopted a policy to build hydropower projects
located on the main Indus River in the public sector, due primarily to their critical importance for
the operation of the Indus Basin's irrigation systems and flood control.  Still, both the
Government and the Bank examined the possibility of having GBHP built, owned and operated by
the private sector, and it was concluded that this option was not viable. Private sector lenders are
generally more reluctant to finance large hydropower projects than thermal generating plants on a
BOO/BOT basis, due largely to the high construction and operating risks associated with
geological and hydrological uncertainties.  Also, other considerations make the project
unattractive for private sector involvement: (a) its large financing requirements, particularly in
local currency, coupled with the scarce local resources available in the domestic capital market;
(b) its long gestation period compared to the much shorter repayment period of commercial loans;
and (c) the lower equity-debt ratio preferred by the private sector in BOO/BOT schemes would
increase the overall external borrowing requirement for the project.
5.    Since the mid-1980s, the Bank has been deeply involved in Pakistan's energy sector
reforms through both policy advice and lending. The Bank was instrumental in developing the
legal and institutional framework for private investments in generation, and strongly supported the
creation of NEPRA and the ongoing divestiture of WAPDA's thermal generation and distribution
facilities. In addition, the Bank's lending aimed at improving economic efficiency and financial
sustainability in the sector by encouraging least-cost planning and tariff setting to provide
adequate levels of self-financing, ensuring compliance with international environment standards
and strengthening implementation capability. Earlier this year, the Bank has also assisted the
Government, through the Energy Options Study, in:  (a) identifying the expected shortfall
between energy demand and supply, and evaluating the options available to the Government of
Pakistan (GOP) for reducing this shortfall; (b) assessing the effectiveness and the macroeconomic
sustainability of the Government's strategy for promoting the necessary levels of private
investments; and (c) outlining the remaining agenda of policy reforms which would complement
the ongoing reform program, and set the energy sector on the required growth path. Accordingly,
the Bank's future lending program will further develop and enhance economic efficiency and
promote the participation of private investors. The proposed Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Project would strengthen Pakistan's demand-side management and energy conservation program.
Other projects that would support additional private sector investments and the restructuring and
privatization of public sector enterprises, include the Bank's proposed guarantee for the Uch
Power Project Company, and the planned Third Private Sector Energy Development Project. To
complement private sector investment in energy projects that so far has relied almost exclusively
on foreign equity and loans, long-term domestic resources need to be made available in the sector.
To this end, the Bank is executing a study to review long-term domestic resource mobilization



-3-
options and capital market reforms. Technical assistance is also being provided under the
proposed project to address the main issues related to the smooth implementation of the reform
program in the power sector.
6.    Project Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project are to assist GOP in its
efforts to: (a) develop domestic energy resources and reduce the acute shortage of electricity in a
cost-effective and environmentally sustainable manner; (b) reinforce and complement the ongoing
GOP's reform program for the power sector; (c) strengthen WAPDA's managerial, operational
and financial efficiency, and its capability to address environmental and resettlement issues related
to its operations; (d) further rationalize the use of electricity and prepare a more aggressive energy
conservation and demand-side management program. The proposed project is consistent with the
Bank's sectoral policy that includes increasing emphasis on issues of demand management,
operational efficiency, environment, pricing and redefined roles of the public and private sectors in
the supply of electricity.
7.    Project Description. The proposed project would involve the construction of the Ghazi-
Barotha hydroeletric power plant, while consolidating the power sector reform program, and
technical assistance and training components. The construction of GBHP aims at utilizing 76
meters of head available in the Indus River between the tailrace of Tarbela power station and its
confluence with Haro River, and includes: (a) a barrage and ancillary works near Ghazi village
located at about 7 km downstream of Tarbela Dam; (b) a 52 km long concrete-lined power
channel and its ancillary works with a capacity of 1,600 cumecs; (c) a power complex and its
ancillary works located near the village of Barotha with an installed capacity of about 1,450 MW,
to generate about 6,600 GWh of energy annually; (d) transmission facilities for power evacuation;
and (e) implementation of environmental management and resettlement plans. In addition to its
normal operation throughout the year, GBHP would provide daily power peaking capacity, in
particular during the months of May and June, when there is reduced generation from Tarbela as a
result of low reservoir levels. The power sector reform component consists, in particular, of: (a)
setting up of GBHP as a separate project entity; (b) establishment of a separate transmission and
dispatch subsidiary; and (c) review of package of incentives offered to power private investors.
The technical assistance and training components are mainly designed to assist WAPDA in the
design and construction of the GBHP, carrying out the environmental and resettlement plans,
implementing the reform program, and improving its managerial, operational and financial
efficiency.
8.    Project Cost and Financing. The project cost is estimated at about US$1863.5 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$1192.2 million equivalent (64%) and
taxes and duties estimated at about US$31.0 million equivalent. The total financing required,
including interest during construction (IDC) of about US$386.5 million, is US$2250.0 million, of
which the Bank would finance US$350.0 million (25% of the foreign exchange and 15.6% of total
costs). The proposed Bank loan would include financing of a portion of the IDC on the Bank
loan (US$40.0 million) to help alleviate WAPDA's debt service burden over the medium-term,
and its difficulties in raising financing in the commercial market. Retroactive financing, totaling
US$35 million, would be provided for expenditures incurred within twelve months before loan
signing,  and related to the power channel and ancillary works contract and to technical
assistance. The project would be cofinanced with ADB, the Government of Japan through
OECF, the Government of Germany through KfW, EIB and IDB. KFW and IDB cofinancing are



-4-
yet to be confirmed; however given the advanced stage of their internal processing, these
financing sources are likely to materialize. Should they not materialize, the resulting financing gap
is expected to be covered by suppliers'credits.  Through its own internal cash generation,
WAPDA would finance about 44% of the total project cost. A breakdown of project costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
9.    The Government of Pakistan is eligible for the single currency loan (SCL) because it
converted all its outstanding VLR82 loans to VLR89 terms. The proposed loan of US$350
million, which will be the only FY96 loan to Pakistan on SCL terms, represents 60% of the
Bank's FY96 lending program to Pakistan of US$580 million, including guarantees. Furthermore,
GOP has selected US dollar single currency loan terms within the context of its overall liability
management strategy and the LIBOR-based interest rate in order to preserve standard country
terms for this project. GOP judges that WAPDA has sufficient risk-bearing capacity to borrow
on the proposed onlending terms.
10.   Project Implementation. WAPDA is fully responsible for implementing the proposed
project, and has set up a specialized project unit to manage project implementation. This unit will
be taken over by the Ghazi-Barotha Project Entity to be established by end of December 1998, in
line with the restructuring and corporatization program of WAPDA. Assistance in detailed
engineering, procurement and construction supervision is being provided by engineering
consultants (a joint venture of five engineering firms, three international and two local). The
review functions are undertaken by three independent panels of experts, one for technical and
safety aspects, one for environmental and resettlement matters, and one for resolution of disputes
in the main civil works contracts. A Ghazi-Barotha Development Organization (GBDO) is
assisting in matters related to land acquisition, compensation and the implementation of an
integrated regional development plan. The Japanese Government has approved grant funds of
about US$1.2 million to assist WAPDA in implementing and supervising the environmental and
resettlement aspects of the proposed project. The land acquisition process has been initiated and is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1996. Preparatory works are underway, contracts for the
construction of the barrage and power channel are expected to be awarded very shortly. Bids
opening for the construction of the power house will take place early January 1996, and related
contract award is expected late April 1996. Methods of procurement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Pakistan are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps
are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14587-PAK, is being distributed separately.
11.   Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the proposed project is being ensured by
WAPDA's experience in the execution and operation of large hydropower projects. Financial
sustainability is assured by WAPDA's consistency in the past years in mobilizing, through its
internal cash generation, 40% of its investment requirements, a level that few power utilities in
developing countries have achieved. This would be further supported and strengthened by the
rationalization of electricity tariffs under the project, which would improve cost recovery by
bringing revenues closer to the cost of supply. The restructuring and privatization of WAPDA
which is being implemented under the Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) (Loan 3764-
PAK), and followed-up under the proposed project, and the appointment of a Management
Consultant would support WAPDA's institutional development and encourage efficiency in the
power sector. Finally, the Government's strategic move in opening up the thermal power market



-5-
to the private sector would reduce fiscal pressure on WAPDA and the Government, thus fuirther
promoting the sustainability of the project.
12.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. Overall, the Bank has provided ten
loans to WAPDA, with the tenth, PSDP, signed in September 1994, and made effective in April
1995. Project Completion Reports have been completed for five out of the seven completed
projects, and preparation of the two remaining reports is well underway. Lessons learned from
these projects and other similar projects financed by the Bank have had an important bearing on
the proposed project and were integrated in its planning, design, preparation and processing.
13.   The main difficulties encountered by these projects in the early stage of their
implementation, e.g., delays in GOP's approval of the Project Concept document (PCi),
inadequate project management team, and slow pace of procurement have been addressed under
the present project. As a result, the PCI was approved prior to the Bank's appraisal, and
procurement for the main packages have been initiated early enough to allow for bids opening
and/or award of the main civil works contracts prior to Board Presentation, thus minimizing the
risk of delays and cost overruns. GOP and WAPDA have also learned from previous similar
projects, the importance of experienced foreign consultants and expert review panels and, for the
proposed project, a strong project management team has been put in place and is being assisted by
well-reputed joint venture of foreign/local consultants and panels of experts. Furthermore, the
agreement to set up a Ghazi Barotha Hydropower entity, in line with the restructuring and
corporatization program of WAPDA, would ensure an efficient and independent management and
operation of the project.
14.   Based on past experience both in Pakistan and Bankwide, the preparation and
implementation of effective Environmental Management Plans and Resettlement Action Plans
have generally suffered from the following weaknesses: (a) lack of public consultation and
participation; (b) shortage of funds to compensate the affected population in a timely manner; (c)
failure to assign appropriate trained staff responsible for the implementation of the plans; and (d)
lack of independent monitoring.  In Pakistan in particular, WAPDA's experience with
resettlement issues has not always worked effectively. As a consequence a number of outstanding
claims resulting from the Tarbela Dam Project, implemented in the mid-1970s with the Bank's
assistance, still remain unresolved. These findings have been carefully integrated in the design and
processing of the proposed project. As a result, an Environmental Resettlement and Review
Panel (ERP) has been associated with project preparation from the onset; a proactive approach
for public participation and consultation has been ensured, including the setting up of a Public
Information Center at the project site; sufficient funds for land acquisition and compensation are
being made available well ahead of the transfer of land to WAPDA; WAPDA's Environmental
Cell and Project Resettlement Organization are being adequately staffed; external monitoring is
being undertaken by ERP, a monitoring consultant, a GBDO, and the Bank's and other major
donors' environmental specialists; and an action plan to address the outstanding resettlement
issues related to the Tarbela Dam is being prepared by WAPDA with the assistance of an
independent consultant.
15.   Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project
is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), scheduled for discussion on the
same day. It would support the key medium-term CAS objectives of establishing a more



-6-
competitive enabling environment for sustainable growth, and completing fiscal adjustment in
two main ways. Firstly, the continued implementation of major energy pricing and other sectoral
reforms would contribute to better domestic resource mobilization and thus the consolidation of
fiscal reforms. Secondly, by increasing power supply reliability at lower-cost and thus industrial
competitiveness, it would improve Pakistan's ability to exploit new sources of growth outside the
cotton-based manufacturing. Besides assisting GOP in its efforts in reducing the chronic shortage
of electricity, the proposed project would also: (a) strengthen WAPDA's capabilities in preparing,
designing and supervising the construction of environmentally-sustainable hydropower projects;
and (b) further support WAPDA's autonomy and its corporatization program. Through its
involvement, the Bank has also played a catalytic role in assisting GOP in mobilizing the required
funding for this project.
16.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations agreements were reached: (a) with GOP to:
(i) ensure that the financing requirements of GBHP will not adversely affect the funding of the
Core Public Development Program and Social Action Program of the Government; (ii) adopt a set
of policies and appropriate solicitation mechanism for timely implementation of required private
power supply in the country; (iii) review by June 30, 1996 the incentives for private investments
such as exemption from income and other taxes and introduce a new set of such incentives,
satisfactory to the Bank under which such exemptions will no longer be provided; and (iv)
authorize WAPDA to automatically adjust the fuel adjustment surcharge rate following increases
in fuel prices; (b) with GOP and WAPDA to: (i) reduce the level of distortion in the electricity
tariffs; (ii) establish a separate transmission and dispatch entity; (iii) carry out the land acquisition
compensation and resettlement in accordance to the Resettlement Action Plan; (iv) establish a
legal framework for persons whose land has been acquired but who have been left in possession
for the time being; (v) furnish to the Bank not later than December 31,1996, the resettlement
action plan to apply to the persons affected by the land to be acquired for the transmission lines;
and (vi) implement the recommendations of the domestic resources mobilization study by
December 31,1996; and (c) with WAPDA to: (i) repeat the main financial and institutional
covenants under the ongoing power projects (such as internal cash generation of 40%, debt
service coverage, accounts receivable, and annual review of investment program and its
consistency with agreed macroeconomic targets); (ii) appoint a Management Consultant to
improve WAPDA' s managerial, operational and financial efficiency; (iii) fully corporatize
WAPDA by December 31,1998; (iv) set up, not later than December 31, 1998, an autonomous
project entity in line with its corporatization program, to operate GBBP; and (v) incorporate the
comments of the technical and environmental and resettlement review panels in the design and
implementation of the project as appropriate. As conditions of effectiveness: (i) a survey will
have been carried out to assess the status of outstanding claims of the persons affected by the
Tarbela Dam Project, and an action plan to redress legitimate grievances in a timely manner will
have been agreed with the Bank; (ii) GOP and WAPDA to execute a subsidiary loan agreement
satisfactory to the Bank; and (iii) GOP and WAPDA to provide evidence that the ADB and OECF
loan agreements have been executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to their
effectiveness fulfilled.
17.      Environmental Aspects. The proposed project has been classified in environmental
screening category "A" and has been subject to the preparation by WAPDA, with the participation
of an independent Environmental and Resettlement Review Panel, of an environmental impact
assessment study consistent with the procedures of the Bank and the requirements of the



-7-
Government of Pakistan Ordinance XXXVII, "Control of Pollution and Preservation of Living
Environment (December 1983)." The project preparation process involved extensive public
consultation and participation, leading to the establishment of one main Public Information
Center (PIC) and two subcenters at the project site.  PIC has been proactively involved in
information dissemination and local consultation. Project preparation also included the adoption
of a number of significant design modifications to mitigate potential adverse impacts through
selection of alternative sites for the principal components of the project. Potential environmental
impacts have been examined and appropriate mitigation measures and monitoring plans prepared.
The impact of land acquisition related to changes of land use in areas acquired for the project will
be largely mnitigated by the redevelopment of excavation spoil for agriculture. The spoil banks will
be covered with top-soil, provided with tubewells and resold to interested affectees. With respect
to water resources, quality and wastewater disposal, the main impact arises from the reduction in
the flow in a 41 km. river reach between the barrage and the confluence with the Kabul River.
Assumptions have been made regarding both the population growth in the villages along the river
banks and in the need for water supplies and sewerage, and a compensation release of 28 cumecs
was found to be more than adequate. Nevertheless, as part of the Environmental Mitigation and
Monitoring Plan, the water quality in the river downstream will be monitored regularly with
compensation releases to be adjusted as required. Although it was recognized that fisheries are
not currently important in the affected reach of the Indus, these resources will be enhanced by
stocking fish species in the barrage pond and power complex headponds.  Impact on
archeological, religious and cultural sites have been limited through design changes. As a result,
two mosques and 14 graves are being relocated with the approval of religious leaders and related
families, and two minor archaeological sites in the power channel would be subject to salvage
excavation. Safety measures to mitigate potential risks for persons and livestock falling into the
power channel would be undertaken by fencing the power channel in the populated areas, and at
the vicinity of the bridge crossings. To address these issues, an environmental mitigation and
monitoring plan has been prepared, and its implementation is being monitored by WAPDA's
Environmental Cell with the support of an Environmental Monitoring Consultant, the GBDO, and
periodic reviews by the ERP.
18.   Resettlement Aspects. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared by WAPDA,
based on a complete focused census, sample surveys of the affected persons, public participation
(affectees and local NGOs), and the assistance of a legal task force appointed by WAPDA. As a
result, a fair, transparent and comprehensive package of entitlements was formulated. The
proposed project would require acquisition of approximately 4,770 hectares of land, 3,457
hectares of which are privately owned. Out of the total land to be acquired, 1,640 hectares would
be needed only temporarily during construction, subsequently, these would be provided with
irrigation facilities and offered for sale at reduced prices to the affected persons. A total of
22,360 persons would be adversely affected (in most cases only to a limited extent) by the loss of
land, houses, and employment, out of whom only 899 or 4%, living in 110 housing units, would
need to be resettled. Three villages are being established to accommodate 68 houses, and the
remaining 42 scattered houses will be replaced in the vicinity of their current location. The limited
scale of resettlement is a result of careful attention to resettlement issues during the design phase;
the power channel was routed through more difficult terrain to avoid villages. At present, the
implementation of the RAP is underway. To complement the RAP, WAPDA has also prepared an
Integrated Regional Development Plan (IRDP) for the affected area. An innovative aspect of



-8-
WAPDA's approach to land acquisition and resettlement is the creation of a GBDO to assist in
the implementation of the RAP and of the IRDP.
19.   Program Objective Categories. The principal objective categories of the project are: (a)
Privatization: The project would improve resource mobilization and continue supporting the
restructuring program of WAPDA to improve its efficiency. The project would also assist in the
development of a business environment conducive to maximizing private sector contribution to
power sector development in the country; (b) Public Policy Reform: The project would support
economic management objectives by ensuring macroeconomic consistency of the project
investments and closely monitoring and safeguarding public sector core expenditures and social
action program investments.
20.   Project Benefits.  The project is attractive in terms of its fiscal sustainability, its
contribution to power development, its impact on the poor, and its economic rate of return. The
implementation of the proposed GBHP would be sustainable from a macroeconomic point of view
provided that GOP continues fiscal adjustment and implementation of measures to improve
external competitiveness. As the project financing plan does not assume budgetary resource
requirements, GBHP will not affect negatively the fiscal deficit during its implementation. Also
from an environment and resettlement point of view, the project will be sustainable as long as
required mitigation measures are implemented. The least-cost analysis shows that GBHP is an
integral part of the optimal development plan for the Pakistan power system and it is required to
be implemented at its earliest commissioning date, even under conservative and unfavorable
assumptions. The project was selected by the optimal generation expansion model, after allowing
for significant savings expected from energy conservation and demand-side measures.
Furthermore, given its limited adverse environmental impact compared to alternatives, GBHP is
the best candidate for system expansion under integrated resource planning methodology. The
project is also expected to have a considerable beneficial impact on poor households, as a result of
the expansion of the rural electrification program and the reduction of load shedding in rural
areas.
21.   The Economic Rate of Return (ERR), calculated on the incremental cost and benefit
streams associated with the overall national investment program for the period FY1995-2006 of
which the project is an integral part, is estimated at about 27%. Measurable benefits are valued in
terms of the incremental demand that can be served under this program compared to the lower
level of demand that could be served if no new supply capacity were added to the power system.
When computed on the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with GBHP alone under
the above methodology, the ERR is estimated at about 30%. The inclusion of environmental
externalities would further increase the ERR estimates as net positive externalities, such as lower
levels of pollution and enhancement of the economic activities in the area, are expected from the
implementation of the project.
22.   There are also significant non-quantifiable benefits derived from the project consisting of
reduced cost of unserved energy, improved operational and managerial efficiency of the utility and
further development of WAPDA's capability to address environmental and resettlement issues
related to hydropower projects. Furthermore, the consolidation of the reform program in the
power sector as envisaged by the project is expected to have positive overall economic benefits,
consisting of savings achieved by raising the reliability and overall efficiency of operation of the



-9-
system, fiscal relief obtained from the reduction of subsidies and the decrease in public sector
power expenditures. The increased reliability of the power system will, in turn, save business lost
output and redundant investments in stand-by generators. Such benefits, which are expected to
continue materializing beyond the implementation period of the project. This, along with the
introduction of sectoral reforms, would further increase the estimated ERRs.
23.   Risk Analysis. Bank experience indicates that there are always significant risks associated
with large scale hydroelectric projects, and measures have been considered in the preparation,
design, institutional arrangements and processing of the proposed project to mitigate those risks.
In particular, risks which could affect the proposed project could relate to macroeconomic
performance of the country, a possible mismatch in power demand and supply and project
implementation. The results of an integrated risk analysis indicate that the probability of an ERR
(calculated on the power development program including GBHP) falling below the opportunity
cost of capital is estimated at 8%.
24.   As regards the macroeconomic performance of the country, the Government's decision to
slow the pace of the reform program in June 1995, raised a number of uncertainties, and resulted
in a rapid deterioration in Pakistan's balance-of-payments position during the July-October 1995
period. As a first step to reversing the deterioration, the Government announced in late October
1995 a package of measures aimed at strengthening Pakistan's fiscal and balance-of-payments
position. In November 1995, the Government of Pakistan reached, ad referendum, agreement
with the International Monetary Fund staff on a stabilization program for the remainder of
FY1996 and for FY1997, which provides the basis for a stand-by agreement. This would allow
the resumption of a more comprehensive macroeconomic and structural program at an early date.
Such a program would help improve Pakistan's creditworthiness over the medium term. The risk
of inconsistency between the macroeconomic framework and the level of Public Sector
Development Program resulting from the implementation of GBHP has been mitigated by the
provision of an annual review of WAPDA's investment program over a five-year period and the
agreement that the financing requirements of GBHP will not affect the funding of GOP's Core
Public Sector Development Program and Social Action Program, as reviewed and discussed with
the Bank on annual basis.
25.   The uncertainties related to the amount of private power supply, which could result in a
possible mismatch between power demand and supply, has been mitigated by the agreement
reached during negotiations on introducing policies and an appropriate solicitation mechanism to
ensure timely implementation of required additional capacity.
26.   The specific project implementation risks have been also mitigated so that the probabilities
of delay in project implementation and cost overruns are considerably reduced.  The non-
mobilization of financing risk has been mitigated by the high priority given by GOP to the
development of the project, the level and status of commitments of all cofinanciers, and by the
legal agreements requiring WAPDA to generate local funds through improvement in efficiency
and more commercially-oriented revenue measures needed to enable WAPDA to comply with the
financial covenants. WAPDA's consistent record over the last seven years in meeting an ambitious
cash generation covenant provides additional comfort to the project. Other major risks could be
caused by unsatisfactory resettlement, relocation and compensation of persons affected by the
project and delay in implementing steps identified to mitigate negative environmental impacts.



-10-
T'hese risks are being largely mitigated by the comprehensiveness of the Environment and
Resettlement Management Plan and the monitoring arrangements through: (a) setting a Project
Information Center at project site; (b) obtaining assistance of a GBDO and an independent
consultant for monitoring resettlement and relocation of project affected people and
implementation of environmental mitigation steps; (c) WAPDA's commitment to implement an
Integrated Regional Development Plan to support locally-based economic activities in the area;
and (d) continued support from the Independent Environment and Resettlement Review Panel. To
avoid risks of engineering nature, WAPDA will be assisted by its consultant, and a panel of
experts will monitor the activities periodically. Further, geological and hydrological uncertainties
are reduced to a minimum because of the extensive investigations at the sites of the barrage,
power channel and power house, and the comprehensive knowledge gained in the construction
and operation of Tarbela Dam. Possible construction delays would be minimized by the advanced
stage of the procurement of major works, ensuring effective project management and supervision
through WAPDA's intemal organization for the project and the assistance of its consultants. To
avoid delays caused by claims of the contractors, a Dispute Review Board is being appointed to
settle all claims as expeditiously as possible.
27.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it, with retroactive
financing in an aggregate amount not exceeding US$35 million.
