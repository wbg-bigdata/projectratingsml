STRUCM AL ADJUSTME LOAN
L-oan and Program Summary
Borower                        Republic of Peru
Exeuing Agy:                   Ministry of Economy and Finance
US$300 million equivalent
1m:                            Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
I,oan Objestives:              The proposed loan would support the Government's
medium-term program of macroeconomic stabilization and broad-based
structural reforms.
Loan.Descrintion:              The loan would recognize the major structural reform measures taken
between August 1990 and December 1991, in macroeconomic policy, the
fiscal sector, the social sector, privatization, agriculture, labor, and social
security. The conditions in these abovementioned areas include
maintenance of current reforms and measures for further reform, and are
set out in Appendix A of the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 4).
Bewnefhs:                      Stabilization is necessary for the success of the structural reforms
currently being implemented. Policies supported by this loan will reduce
inflation to low levels, setting the framework for renewed growth. Ihe
revamping of fiscal administration and fiscal reforms should increase
revenues and make the fiscal adjustment sustainable. 'he trade reform
should mobilize resources toward Peru's competitive advantage and lead
to an outward-oriented, and thus sustainable, growth. Labor market
reforms will improve the flow of labor inputs among sectors to adapt to
changes in relative prices caused by trade and fiscal reforms. Interest
rates will continue to be set freely, thus improving resource allocation and
monetization. Land reformn has been extensive, strengthening property
rights, crucial for agricultural development. Privatization will create a
larger and more efficient private sector, and privatization of the social
security system would be a new source for long-term financing.
The poor will gain in the long-rn from the liberalization of the labor
market, a wider distribution of employment opportunities, and the
potential benefit from agricultural reforms to use land as collateral, and
improved registration and titling of land. To protect the poor, in the
short-run, the Government is striving to mobilize external resources for
priority projects in basic social services. The Government will develop a



-vi-
national nutrition policy with a view to improving the eost-eveness,
nutritional impact and targeting of food assistance programs. The
recently established social compensation fund (FONCODES) wIll channel
financing (both domestic and external) to small, labor-intensive projects
for the rehabilitation of the social and economic infrastructure, which
benefit the poor.
The four risks to Peru's stabilization program are that: (a) the fiscal
situation would remain precarious; (b) a continuing dollarization process
would push up money velocity and fuel inflation; (c) market perptions
of the continuing overvaluatlon of the domestic currency would increase
political pressures on government officials to take unwanted steps such
as re-introducing capital cotrols or making 'excessive' (inflationary)
purchases of foreign exchange; and (d) an increase in terroist activities
would undermine business confidence and support for the Government.
Estimated Disbursement:        The loan would be disbursed in one tranche. Upon fulfillment of
effectiveness conditions, the Bank will make the loan effective and release
the tranche.



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PENE
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED SIRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
I.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Peru for
the equivalent of US$300 million. Ihe proposed loan would support the Government's medium-term
program of macroeconomic stabilization and broad-based structural reforms. The loan would be repayable
over 20 years on a fixed amortization schedule, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and charges.
I. THE ILAN, THE WORKOU PGRAM, AND COUN     =Al=
A. he Loan
2.       This Report proposes a US$300 million adjustment loan for a structural adjustment program. The
immediate objective of the loan is to support Peru's macroecor.omic stabilization program and broad-based
structural reforms, which represent one of the most far-reaching and rapid structural refc-ns carried out in
the developing world. The broader objective of this loan, as well as those of the previous trade policy reform
loan and the following financial sector reform and privatization adjust.ment loans, is to allow the Bank to
participate in an internationally supported approach to reintegrate Peru into the international financial
community. This approach would provide Peru the opportunity to rehabilitate an economy much damaged by
the actions of past governments and would enable it to resume a normal relationship with the Bank and other
donors.
B. The Bank's Approach to a Country with  mtrated A, s
3.       On May 2, 1991, the Board approved a new approach to support debt workout programs in
countries with protracted arrears (Additional Suptrt for Workout Proem  in Countries with Protracted
Arfars. R91-70, April 11, 1991). It allows strong-performing countries with large arrears to accumulate
"contingent disbursemens" during a pre-clearance "performance period." Loans are presented to the Bank's
Board during the performance period and, once the arrears to the Bank are cleared at the end of the
performance period, loans are signed and made effective and all accumulated disbursements released. The
new approach is analogous to the IMF's Rights Accumulation Program (RAP), and requires the following
four conditions to be met: (a) the existence of an agreed financing plan; (b) an IMP stabilization program;
(c) a Bank-supported adjustment program; and (d) continued current debt service payments to the Bank.
C. The Bank's Approach in Peru
4.       In order to assist Peru during the performance period, expected to last through December 1992,
the Bank developed a country assistance strategy which conforms with this new approach. On July 30, 1991,
the Board approved the application to Peru of the new approach (Peru: The Bank's Approach to a Country
œvith ProMacted Arrears, R91-171, July 12, 1991), opening the way for the implementation of this strategy.
As a first step, the Bank participated *n the formulation of an external financing plan agreed to by the IMF,
IDB, bilateral donors, and the Government (see Section II. Concurrently, the Bank has been preparing,
based on its economic and sector work, an adjustment program to support reform efforts underway in Peru.
As required under the new approach, loans approved under this program will not be disbursed until the end
of the performance period.



-2-
5.        The Bank also has been looking beyond the current period of protracted arrears through FY95.
During this period, the Bank expects to deepen Its support of the adjustment program through additional
lending and economic and sector work, and also expects to present investment loans now under preparation.
These loans are inherently more time-consuming to prepare than adjustment loans as they require a complex
mix of engineering, Institutional, and human inputs, and Peru's public institutions are currently unable to
undertake the necessary preparation themselves.
6.        To counteract this weakness in public management, the Bank has launched a major program of
technical assistance, crucial for the successful implementation of the medium-term economic program. It bas
mobilized resources for these activities through the Japanese Grant Facility and the German Company for
Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and is currently exploring other possible sources of financing. 'Tus, even
before the Bank has been able to disburse, it has mobilized significant resources for Peru for project
preparation and implementation. It has secured Japanese grants for approximately US$8.0 million for seven
technical assistance projects, for reforms in the financial sector, debt statistics and management, the social
sector, water and sanitation, energy, and privatization, and has secured GTZ grants for about US$1.0 million
for agriculture, macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, energy, mining and industry,
infrastructure, and human resource development.
7.       To assist the Government's efforts to reintegrate Peru into the international financial community,
and subsequently to enhance and deepen the reforms undertaken during the period of reintegration, the Bank's
coury assistance strategy towards Peru is directed at four long-term strategic objectives: (i) sustaining and
accelerating the stabilization and adjustment process; (ii) fostering private sector development and public
sector reform; (iii) alleviating poverty and promoting human resource development; and (iv) rehabilitating key
infrastructure.
8.        Suining and Accelerating the Stabilization and Adjustment Process. The Bank is supporting the
reforms of the current Government, which assumed office in July, 1990, and immediately initiated structural
reforms to reverse the economic policies of previous administrations and achieve a sustained economic
recovery. Deregulatory and other reforms have been announced in trade, monopoly rights, privatzation,
ports, foreign invesunent, land tenure, labor markets, social security, tax policy and administration, and the
financial sector (see paragraphs 44-56).
9.        The Government of Peru must sustain these reforms and undertake further measures before the
country can fully reap the rewards. Bank lending operations in Peru are initially focussing on three
adjustment loans to support the Government's efforts. The trade policy reform loan has been approved by the
Board in Febnrary 1992, and this structural adjustment loan (SAL) and the financial sector adjustment loan
will follow, assuming continued fulfillment of the four conditions described in paragraph 3. Later a
privatization adjustment loan will be prepared to support the privatization effort of the Government.
10.      This loan will address balanced medium-term economic development reeds through a multi-sector
focus. It aims at securing the Goverment's achievements and enhancing the fol' wing reforms:
conwlidating the macroeconomic stabilization by maintaining non-inflationary fin cing of government
expenditure, improving tax collection and supporting the tax reform, redefining the functions of the
govermment and reducing the number of public employees, laying out the general and sectoral strategies to
privatize state-owned enterprises in various sectors, increasing labor mobility, laying out the strategy for
reform of official pension schemes, and reducing state intervention in agricultural markets. The SAL will



3-
also hdp establish a clear policy and institutional framework for poverty alleviation, identifying target groups
and priority programs that reflect the needs of the poor.
11.       The financial sector adjustment loan will support the Government's efforts to liberaize the
financial system and thereby promote efficiency in financial intermediation. The loan will focus specifically
on: implementation of the new banking law in an environment of strengthened baning supervision, a
program of privatization of state-owned commercial banks, reform of the development banks, restructuring of
the major public-sector bank, the Banco de la Nacion, and improvements in the securities law as well as
implementation of the partial or full privatization of the social security system.
12.       The groundwork for these adjustment loans was laid by eonomic and sector work undertaken in
late 1990-ely 1991 on public sector reform and investment, structural reform, the social sectors, and, in
conjunction with UNDP, trade. The Bank is also undertaking further extensive studies on macroeconomic
and structural reform which will assist in maintaining dialogue with the govemment on monetary, financial
sector, and labor policies. A financial sector report will analyze the status of financial institutians and
markets, and their inter-relation with monetary and fiscal policies. A labor markets study will seek to
strengthen the role of markets in supply and demand for labor services. In addition, a study on agricultural
incentives is currently under preparation to analyze the initial impact of agricultural reforms which have been
undertaken, and indicate areas for further reform.
13.       Fostering Priate Sector Development and Public Sector Bform. A number of lending
operations are under preparation which will broaden the Bank's support, initiated in this loan and in the
fimancial sector adjustment loan, for the Government's privatization and public sector reform efforts. These
loans will focus on the reform of public sector policies that restrict private sector participation, as well as the
privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in energy, mining, fisheries, transportation, and
telecommunications.
14.       An energy sector rehabilitation loan will finance rehabilitation of facilities and support reform of
energy policy and private sector development. Policy reforms will include the establishment of tariffs based
on economic principles, and of regulatory structures conducive to efficient production and use of energy
resources. The loan will support privatization of Electrolima, the largest electricity distribution company in
Peru, and foster private sector development in the oil industry. A privatization adjustment loan will support
implementation of an agreed privatization program of SOEs in mining, oil, gas, telecommunications, and -
building on the financial sector adjustment loan - banking. It will also support sectoral policy reforms
necessary for attracting the private sector, and permitting its efficient operation. These reforms will vary by
sector: in utilities (power, telecommunications, etc.) the focus will be on regulatory and pricing policies; in
naura resource-based sectors (mining, hydrocarbons, and fisheries) the focus will be on policies for granting
concessions.
15.       Economi. and sector work will focus on issues related to privatization of SOEs and development
of the private sector, such as the regulatory policies to govern natural monopolies, financial restructuring
requirements, and labor redundancy. A planned study on industrial deregulation will evaluate ways to further
improve the conditions for private sector development. An environmental sector study will review problems
of soil erosion, tropical deforestation, PCB pollution, and water pollution caused by mining.

16.       Alleviating PoTh and ProngHUM    R2W=  Devlome. 'Me Bank's objectves in the
area of human resources are to assist the 5overnment in formulating and implementing a poverty alleviation
strategy, providing social services for the poor, and improving existing programs. The Bank's work in the
sociW sector will contribute to the alleviation of poverty and will increase the likelihood that the adjustment
program will be maintained. The effectiveness of community organizations and other non-gwoernmental
organizations will decrease reliance on the public sector and encourage a lareer private sector role in the
provision of social services. Howe% er, current requirements for rehabilitation are substantial due to the
deterioration of the economy.
17.      In the lending program, the first Social Development Project will support basic health services
and nutrition to the poor. It will build on the SAL to support the Government in formulating a poverty
alleviation strategy and identifying reforms in food assistance programs. It will also include activities to
strengthen institutional capacity at the regional and central levels and improve the Governmen's ability to
design and monitor social programs. This improvement in institutional capacity, as well as the results of
economic and sector work, would lay the base for another more comprehensive loan to strengthen primary
health services in Peru. This future loan would address critical rehabilitation needs and financial issues,
including cost recovery, and it would extend to additional areas the programs and interventions which proved
successful under the first project. The participation of non-governmental organizations is being incorporated
in both projects. A subsequent operation in primary education is also planned to improve programs and
teacher training in rural areas, including school feeding programs.
i8.       The emphasis of sector work in primary health, basic education, and nutrition is on the
fundamentals. Improvements in these areas, together with a resumption of economic growth, are critical to
efforts to reduce poverty in Peru. The focus will be on identifying ways to broaden access by the poor to
these programs, to enhance program quality, and to improve cost-effectiveness of programs. To reduce the
demands on government agencies, mechanisms to enlarge the role of non-governmental organizaons and
community participation will be explored. An evaluation of public spending in the social sectors will review
government priorities in light of the contribution to poverty alleviation, the need for continued fiscal :austerity,
and a reduced role for public agencies. The Bank is also exploring the possibility, with the Government, of
convening a donors meeting during 1992 to channel external financing for priority programs and projects in
the social sectors.
19.       Rehabilitating Ky Infrasnucture. The Bank's objectives in this area are the rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure in the transport, sanitation, irrigation, urban, and water sectors, which have suffered
from a lack of maintenance due to severe fiscal constraints, as well as the identification of further
rehabilitation needs and specific policy reforms. The goal is to simultaneously promote sustainable growth
through an efficient use of resources and identification of public policies for the provision of infrastructre
services which will help alleviate poverty.
20.       Initially, lending will focus on high-priority rehabilitation needs. A water sector loan will involve
emergency-type investments to address critical supply and quality problems, and health hazards (such as
cholera) resulting from poor water quality. A rehabilitation loan, focussing primarily on highways, will
finance emergency investments in the transport sector. Given tight fiscal constraints in Peru, these loans will
also support policy and regulatory changes to promote private sector participation and investment. Over the
medium-term, these emergency-type rehabilitation loans will be supplemented with a municipal development
loan to support basic urban infrastructure and a second water sector loan to support further rehabilitation and



-5 -
secoral reforms. An irrigation rehabilitation loan will be prepared to address irrigation infrastructure, which
has been allowed to deteriorate as procedures and maintenance have been inadequate.
21.       Given the constraints to immediate large-scale lending to Peru, and the weaknesses of Peruvian
institutions, the Bank is seeking immediate impact through the provision of policy advice. Sector work
related to infrastructure is emphasizing rehabilitation, as well as institutional and pricing issues, including
studies on irrigation, water supply, telecommunications, transport, and general issues of policy reform in
inrastructure. A study is underway to examine the scope for deregulation, privatization, and decentralization
in urban services.
II. T       ECONOMY
A. The Economy Inherited
22.       During most of the last two decades Peru has had a legal structure and a policy environment
inimical to economic development. A state-led development strategy created a large public sector, an
intricate network of controls, and largely inefficient state-owned enterprises in virtually every sector of the
economy. The tax code was complex and full of loopholes, tax administration was ineffective, and tax
evasion was widespread.
23.       These conditions seriously distorted most markets in the economy. Job security in the formal
sector was constitutionally protected and strictly enforced, and, together with very high tax rates on labor,
helped shrink the formal sector. Land reform in the early 1970s severely restricted the marketability of land
and its use as collateral. Trade policy relied on import substitution with very high tariffs and many non-tariff
barriers, depriving the country of the benefits of its comparative advantage in intemational trade. Domestic
regulatory policies conferred special privileges on incumbents. The financial sector was heavily regulated and
burdened by direct government involvement, including tight control of interest rates.
24.       The Administration taking office in 1985 attributed chronic inflation and low growth to Peru's
external debt, declaring that debt-servicing was responsible for devaluation of the exchange rate, erosion of
domestic savings, and curtailment of investment. Consequently, it put a ceiling on foreign debt service at 10
percent of the value of exports and later stopped debt-servicing altogether. It instituted widespread foreign-
exchange controls on current- and capital-accounts, and introduced multiple exchange rates that were
frequently changed. It increased minimum wages, expanded directed credit and subsidies, reduced the VAT
rate, and decreased public sector prices.
25.       This strategy led to a severe fiscal deficit, financed by an unrestrained increase in the money
supply. Between 1985 and 1987, this increase had little effect on prices, due to an increased demand for the
domestic currency generated by the Administration's initial credibility among Peruvians. Economic activity
expanded by 17 percent, the rate of price increases fell, and real domestic liquidity experienced an
unprecedented growth. This "boom,* of course, proved to be unsustainable. After 1987 the market lost
confidence, the process of monetization was suddenly reversed, inflation rebounded, and the economy
deteriorated sharply.
26.      In key productive sectors such as petroleum and mining, the breakdown of management and
finances led to a decline in production. Peru's per capita GNP declined sharply and unemployment and



.6-
poverty increased alarmingly. Relations with international financial Institutions (IFls), bilateral lenders, and
commercial institutions were suspended because of the accumulation of large arrears. The goverrment's only
remedy was to reduce public investment to historically low levels, with the greatest relative reduction in
health and education. Inflation continued out of control, further eroding tax revenues. In 1989, the price
level was 267 times higher than in 1987, output had contracted by 19 percent, and real wages had collapsed
to less than half their 1985 level.
27.      By early 1990, economic activity was extremely depressed and investnent even more so. The
public sector had virtually abandoned maintenance of its capital stock, the formal financial s- or had shrunk,
and real domestic liquidity was down to about one-sixth the level of 1985.
Inflation
28.      As shown in Table 1, the annual inflation rate (over the last twelve months) increased steadily
from 127 percent in January 1988 to 5,707 in August 1989. Thereafter, it fell to a new range between 2000
and 3000 percent per year. The very high inflation of August and September 1990 was due to the strong
adjustments that the new Government had to make on the price of public goods and services. Since August
1990, one month after the current Administration assumed power, inflation decreased steadily from a peak of
12,375 percent to a rate of 139 percent in December 1991.

32.       Price controls during the 1980s temporarily delayed increases in the price level but could not
repress the foreign exchange market even in the shortest-run. A recurrig sequence of events during the
1980s was first a fall in the demand for money, followed by a foreign exchange crisis, and then an outburst
of inflation. But ttie real culprit was always a weak and deteriorating fiscal front By July 1991, almost one
year after the initi stabilization shock of the current Admhistraton, inflation was still relatively high at 9
percen per month. Thereter it diminished steadily to 7 percent in August, 5.6 percent in September, 4
percent in October, 3.9 percent in November, 3.7 percent in December, and 3.5 in January 1992.

Doll1arizafti
33.       The 1980s witnessed a slow but steady process of dollarization as the Peruvian currency continued
to weaken. Dollar-denominated deposits doubled, exceeding all domestic-denominated liquidity, which in this
period was halved in real terns. The previous Administration attempted to end this process by freezing all
dollar deposits and later even tried to nationalize the banking system. The market reaction was to rely even
more heavily on the dollar than before.
34.       The functions of store of value, unit of account, and payment for transactions have been
increasingly rendered by the dollar, which is held freely among the population. As of December 1991, the
highest denomination of domestic currency was worth US$10. Exchange houses have virtually been displaced
by hundreds of unofficial exchange dealers who can be found at every conceivable public place and at any
time of the day or night. Furthermore, dollar deposits in the domestic financil system are estimated to be
small relative to Peruvian deposits held abroad. After the present Administration's stabilization shock, the
dollarization process has continued at a slower pace and as of December 1991 it seems to have leveled off.
35.       High inflation does not necessarily lead to dollarization. Countries like Brazil, which have
indexed their financial markets, have been able to sustain high inflation rates without experiencing a shift
towards the generalized use of foreign exchange as a substitute for the local currency. But Pem, like
Argentina and Bolivia, had repressed the financial market, the result being a steady process of currency
substitution.
36.       Despite general dollarization, domestic-price inflation remains relevant. For example, wages are
set in the domestic currency, and thus unexpected changes in domestic inflation affect employment Also, if
domestic-price inflation is higher than the devaluation of the exchange rate, the real exchange rate will
appreciate. Consequendy, the wage bill of exporters will increase relative to the proceeds from exports,
putting increasing strain on their competitive advantage.

37.       Fiscal Deficits. Mounting deficits were accompanied by rising inflation, frequently obscured by
the use of price controls and income policies that delayed required price adjustments and ended up in
corrections far greater than needed in the first place. Econometric tests do not reject the hypothesis that, for
Peru, there is a significant causal relationship between deficits, actual or expected monetary growth, and the
inflation rate. Figure 2 shows the steady deterioration in Peru's fiscal condition:

38.        Tax Revenues. Table 2 shows the structure of tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. The
decline in tax revenues began in 1981 and accelerated after 1986, so that by the middle of 1990 total tax
revenues were very small and most public sector prices and tariffs were approaching zero in real terms.
Most noteworthy was the decline in income taxes, both personal and business; which diminished from 4.4
percent of GDP in 1980 to only 0.49 in 1990, and in import tariff revenues, which went from a peak of
3.03 percent of GDP in 1981 to a low of 0.79 in 1990. Tariff revenues from increased imports in 1991
and beyond ue expected to steadily increase, surpassing previous levels, notwithstanding the low import
duties established by the recent trade liberalization.

39.       Table 3 shows that, in countries at a similar stage of development (i.e., per-capita income
around USS1,200), the average ratio of tax revenues to GDP is 17%. Peru's ability to reverse the secular
decline in tax revenues lies at the heart of the restoration of the fiscal balance. Such reversal is also vital
in order to guarantee the Government's ability to provide basic services in the long-run.

40.       An eloquent testimony of the weakness of Peru's tax system is that over the period 197689
no revenue from any tax increased pari-passu with income. As a result, the overall buoyanc of tax
revenues in the corresponding period was as low as 0.91, compared, for example, to 1.69 for Paraguay. In
fact, over this period the VAT and the export taxes display a very significant negative annual trend

growth rate: -12% for the former and -31% for the latter. While less reliance on trade taxes is salutary,
the persistent decline of VAT revenues is a serious matter of concern.
41.       Column A of Table 4 shows that VAT revenues as a percentage of GDP in Peru were lower
than all the Latin American countries included in the sample, with the excepdon of Panama. However,
the VAT rate in Panama was three times lower than that of Peru. In fact, after adjusting for differences
in VAT rates across the countries included in the sample, Peru was ranked last and by a wide margin (the
last column of Table 4).

42.       The decline in VAT revenues prior to the period of high inflation indicates that ifation
erosion is not the only culprit. Tax incentives have also affected VAT revenues. In 1989, the foregone
tax revenues from these incentives reached 2% of GDP compared to actual collection of 1.5% of GDP.
It should be noted, however, that it is tax evasion and avoidance that account for most of the gap
between potential and actual revenues. For this reason, the temptation to rely on additional tax increases
to meet revenue requirements should be resisted. Furthermore, empirical evidence strongly suggests that
the supply-side arguments about indirect taxes hold in Peru. The conjunction of all these factors proves



- 12 -
that the answer, which the government is currently addressing, lies in strengthening enforcement,
eliminating tax incentives, and reducing collection lags.
43.       SUNAT, the new tax collection agency, was created in 1989 to arrest the steady decline in tax
revenues. It inherited a large number of employees without proper training and qualifications, an
absence of computing facilities, and inadequate controls and tax- auditing procedures. SUNAT's
performance, though still inadequate, is improving steadily.
B. Tlhe Economic Reforms of the Current Administration
44.       In August 1990, shortly after assuming office, the current Administration launched a sweeping
stabilization cun structural reform program with bold steps towards achieving macroeconomic
stabilization and rebuilding ties with the international financial community. The main components of the
program, whose results so far have been impressive, were:
(a)  Tight controls over public sector wages and salaries, a 3,000 percent increase in fuel prices,
and a 1,000 percent increase in the price of electricity, water, and telephone services.
(b)  The elimination of numerous exemptions in import tariffs and sales taxes, and the introduction
of a temporary tax of 10 percent on exports and I percent on net wealth and insured assets.
(c) The introduction of a casb management committee to manage the finances of the Central
Government on a cash basis only (without recourse to Central Bank credit).
(d)  The unification of exchange rates and the establishment of full convertibility in all current-
and most capital-account transactions, with a managed floating exchange-rate system.
(e)  A tight domestic credit policy.
(f) A significant reduction in price controls, including the de facto elimination of ceilings on
interest rates.
These measures aimed at eliminating the main source of hyperinflation: the monetary financing of the
fiscal deficit.
45.       Further Fiscal Reforms. Following these measures, the Govenment took a number of steps,
most of them in March 1991, to reform the tax system:
(a)  Numerous taxes were eliminated and a new system based on five types of taxes was
introduced: on income of individuals and corporations, on wealth of firms and individuals, on
value-added, on selective consumption, and on imports.
(b)  The income tax rate on firms was reduced from 35 to 30 percent and exemptions were
redu.-d. The tax on net wealth of corporations was unified at 2 percent and all exemptions
eliminated. Both taxes will incorporate a system for adjustment to inflation beginning in fiscl
year 1992. The personal income tax rate was reduced from 45 to 37 percent, and a 1 percent



-13-
tax levied on the inflation-adjusted value of a list of assets replaced the previous tax on an
individual's net wealth. Selective consumption tax rates - excluding gasoline taxes - were
reduced to three, with a maximum of 50 percent.
(c) The emergency tax on insured assets, the 10 percent subsidy on nontraditional exports, and
the 10 percent tax on exports (except for minerals) were eliminated. Howvever, the emergency
tax on checks and the excise tax on interest are being maintained until there are enough tax
revenues to permit their elimination.
46.       Although the lowering of the average import tariff rate, on its own, would be expected to
reduce revenues, the elimination of many preferential regimes would counteract this. The elimination of
export subsidies has stopped a drain on the budget. Due to loopholes in customs procedures and tax
evasion, import duties collected in 1989 were 13 percent of import values, and fell to 9 percent by mid-
1990. Preliminary estimates suggest that the figure will rise to about 15 percent in 1991 because of better
customs administration and the removal of prohibitive tariffs. The share of net revenues from trade taxes
(import and export tax collections JI export subsidies) in total Central Government revenues rose from
around 11 percent in both 1989 and 1990 to 14 percent in the first six months of 1991.
47.      Tax L minisation. The reorganization of SUNAT has been officially underway since March
1991. The decree which created SUNAT gave it the authority to weed out unqualified employees and
hire the best it could attract. It has now been permitted to increase its salary scalesf and its budget was
increased to 2 percent of total tax revenues. Until recently it could not acquire even basic equipment. It
shares computing facilities with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and some of its regional offices are
without office equipment and furniture.
48.       The institutional setup for tax collection has too many lags. The Banco de la Nacion acts as
the ultimate revenue collector for the Government, gathering taxpayers' deposits from private banks. But
tax collection procedures are difficult to control when the Banco de la Nacion delays in providing tax
compliance information to SUNAT. It is premature to speculate about the impact of reform on the
actual collection of taxes, although the transformation of SUNArs administration to a smooth, efficient
operation will be facilitated by the design of a simple and easy-to-manage tax system and its subsequent
implementation. Consequendy, to improve tax administration, the IMF has set up a progtam of technical
assistance to overhaul the entire system of coverage and control.
49.      Gavernment Expenditures. Strict control of the Central Government's cash flow was essential
to reduce monetary financing of the deficit and, consequently, the rate of inflation. However, a cash
budget does not guarantee a sustainable level of government spending, nor does it allow for any
'budgetary policy" because payments are not based on budgetary appropriations but on available cash.
The most important issue is the implemnentation of measures that ensure an inportant and permanent
increase in revenues to match the Government's minimum expenditures.
SO.       Some public sector expenditures not under complete control of the Central Government can
generate quasi-fiscal deficits, e.g.,the Central Bank's payment of interest on required reserves, its new
debt operations, and its purchases of foreign exchange. The IMF program placed a minimum target for
I/ Current monthly wages avcrage $50 for regular employees and S250 for supervisors.



-14-
the increase in Net Inteniational Reserves (NIR) and a maximum target for the increase in Net Domestic
Assets (NDA). This program also provided that any excess above the NIR minimum increment should be
complemented with a reduction In the program's ceiling for Net Domestic Assets so as to dampen the
monetary effect of foreign exchange occumulation.
51.       Currently, public sector projects are not subject to economic evaluation. The Government
intends to change this by requiring that the agency initiating the investment evaluate the project and the
Ministry of Economy and Finance rank the project according to economic criteria. This procedure will
guarantee more economic efficiency in project planning. Similar economic project evaluation procedures
have been conducted with reasonable success in Chile, and are now implemented in Argentina.
52.       Since August 1990, public sector wages have been under strict control. Wage indexation in
public enterprises has been elimiated and wage increases now require Central Government approval. In
the first four months of 1991, 50,000 civil servants resigned under a program that offered incentives for
voluntary resignations.
53.       Deregulation. The Government has begun a process of drastic deregulation and extensive
privatization, and, in this context, the Bank will prepare a privatization adjustment loan to set the
framework for a small, but efficient, public administration. Since March 1991, sweeping measures have
eliminated regulations that limited the development of various sectors of the economy. In the fields of
health and agriculture, registration of firms and other procedures have been simplified with respect to
import and export activities. Administrative and legal restrictions that impeded domestic-market access to
other than national shipping firms have been eliminated. Also, domestic firms are now allowed freer
access to maritime loading or unloading activities for merchant ships.
54.       The Government announced a program which would foster immigration by foreigners who
would bring in funds for investrnent. The Tariff and Transport Regulatory Commission was abolished,
thus eliminating controls over tariff policy in transportation and price-setting for interregional public
transport systems. Restrictions and procedures impeding the development of civil aviation were
eliminated, facilitating the participation of private capital, national or foreign, in air transport activities.
Water transport routes were opened to national traffic, and legal and administrative restrictions
prohibiting such traffic were eliminated.
55.       All monopolistic and restrictive practices were eliminated to foster free competition
throughout the economy. The steps for approval of contracting foreign workers were simplified, public
bidding procedures were modifted to allow for freer competition, and constraints that imitaed the work of
professionals were eliminated. Stipulations for official translating activities were eliminated, and
administrative procedures of local governments for the development of economic activities were
simplified.
56.       Further Structural Reforms. During the second stage of policy reform launched in March
1991, the Govermnent also announced several unprecedented measures aimed at promoting domestic and
external competitiveness and deregulation of economic activity:
(a) Monopolies and deregulation. Monopoly rights of 12 public firms (grain marketing, import,
of fertilizers, gold trading, reinsurance, etc.) were abolished.



- 15 -
(b)  EInnnailneI. A new banking law strengthened prudential regulations by redefining the
capital requirements and credit concentration ratios of banks, promoting universal banking,
and opening commercial banking to foreign investnent. In addition, insurance was partially
deregulated by freeing premiums and abolishing some government monopolies.
(c)  Lar mikt. The rigid labor stability laws were amended to broaden provisions for layoffs
and to establish a better system for the financial management of funds within the Forced
Savings Scheme for Worker Retirement (CTS).
(d)  Pot  The Controlling Commission of Maritime Labor, which monopolized most
loading/unloading activities, was abolished and the cost of these services was substantially
reduced.
(e)  Foreign investment. Foreign investors were permitted to repatriate all net profits and
royalties. Foreign investment can now enter under any corporate form or joint venture, and
investors are allowed to purchase stock from residents and to invest in any sector except
television and radio.
(f)  EPdatizatin. The Govermment announced an extensive privatization program in all sectors of
the economy and designated the first batch of companies to be privatized. It is now working
on a strategy to privatize public enterprises in mining, fishing, oil and gas, power,
telecommunications, banking, and transport.
(g)  Land refbQr. Land property rights have been broadened and strengthened. Corporations
(including agrarian cooperatives) can now legally become private estates. Moreover, land is
now freely transferable and can be used as collateral.
57.       Tne Social Emergency Program. In August 1990, the Government also launched the Social
Energency Program (SEP) to provide direct food and health assistance to the poor - principally through
NGOs. However, fiscal problems, a weak institutional framework, and changes in leadership within the
Social Emergency Program contributed to the failure to mobilize external support and sustain domestic
financing for the SEP. From August to December 1990, the program disbursed only US$67.7 million, far
below its original target.
C. The 1991-1992 Macroeconomic Stabilization Program
58.       To consolidate the process of economic stabilization, the Government has agreed to a Rights
Accumulation Program (RAP) with the IMF that identifies several targets for macroeconomic
performance between July 1991-December 1992. The program envisages an increase in fiscal revenues of
roughly 2 percent of GDP from 1991 to 1992 as a result of better tax administration, a higher VAT rate
of 16 percent (up from 14 percent), and simplification of the tax regime. Privatization could also provide
some fiscal relief but the Government acknowledges this to be temporary. Also, a tight monetary policy
would dictate that any increase in the money supply would be from sources other than the deficit of the
Central Government. The program expects to reduce inflation to low levels by the end of 1992. Table 5
summarizes the main fiscal indicators:

59.       Worthy of note is the reduction in the quasi-fiscal deficit from a peak of 6.1 percent of GDP
in 1988 to 0.5 percent in 1991 and the projected decline to 0.3 percent of GDP in 1992. Furthermore,
this and the NFPS deficit will be financed ondy by external resources.
60.       The program also calls for substantial fiscal improvements. While the primary balance of the
NFPS showed deficits higher than 5 percent of GDP during 1987-89, it improved to a 1 percent deficit in
1990 (the first year of the current Administration) and to a 0.4 percent surplus during 1991. However,
this balance is expected to show a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 1992 because of planned expenditures
in basic areas, including the social sector. These expenditures will be possible thanks to contributions
from the Support Group and consequently will be financed entirely with foreign funds.
D. Risks and Assessmwnt of the Stabilization Program
61.       Peru's stabilization program faces four threats: (a) the fiscai situation could remain precarious;
(b) a continuing dollarization process could push up money velocity and fuel inflation; (c) market
perceptions of the continuing overvaluation of the domestic currency could increase political pressures for
the reintroduction of capital controls or for excessive (inflationary) purchases of foreign exchange; and
(d) a growth in terrorist activities could undermine business confidence and support for the Government.



-17 -
62.       The fiscal situation gives cause for the greatest concern. As of December 1991, in spite of
gradual improvement, it remained precarious. To maintain the budget cash balance, suppliers are not
fully paid, administrative regions do not receive full fiscal transfers, foreign creditors are kept waiting,
salaries of civil servants remain low, net public investment is practically zero, and there is little or no
maintenance of physical infrastructure. This extremely low level of expenditure has created social
tension. Fiscal adjustment is crucial for the sustainability of the stabilization program. The Government
expects revenues for 1992 to increase by 2 percent of GDP relative to 1991, bringing tax collections to a
total of 9.2 percent of GDP. This target is reasonable, given that inflation for 1992 is expected to be
low; in 1985, by comparison, when annual inflation was 160 percent, tax collections were 13.3 percent of
GDP.
63.       The process of dollarization continues, reducing the demand for domestic currency and
making it increasingly difficult for the Government to collect the inflation tax. The experience of Latin
American countries that have recently undergone a high degree of dollarization is that successive
stabilization efforts were unable to return domestic cash balances to the pre-stabilization level, even when
a lower inflation path was realized. The elimination of all foreign exchange controls In Peru appears to
have facilitated the dollarization process, expanding the dollar's traditional store-of-value function to
include those of unit of account and medium of exchange.y If dollarization continues, it could
complicate the stabilization process; but it should not derail it as long as the fiscal accounts achieve a
sustainable equilibrium and the money supply grows within its targets.
64.       The Government has been concerned about the significant real apurecation of the domestic
currency in 1991V and in response to this concern has permitted the purchase of foreign reserves by the
Central Bank.2' The indicators are that, as interent rates declined by the end of 1991, capital inflows
have slowed and the real exchange rate has started to depreciate.
65.       To sum up the stabilization effort, Peru's orthodox shock treatment succeeded in bringing
hyperinflation to an abrupt halt. Monthly inflation fell from 63 percent in July 1990 to 6 percent in
November 1990 after reaching a historic high of 397 percent in August 1990 (Table 1.6 in Annex 1), the
month in which the public price and tariff adjustments were made. By December 1991, inflation was 3.7
percent and steadily falling.
I/ Real domestic cash balances (currency plus demand deposits, deflated by the Consumer Price Index) fell by 36 percent
between July 1990 and July 1991, in spite of the substantial reduction in inflation that took place. (CPI inflation was at s
monthly rate of 45 percent in the three nwths May-July 1990, as compared with only 8.7 for the same months in 1991).
Nevertheess, by the fourth quarter of 1991, the fall in the real demand for the domestic currency seems to have leveled off.
fi According to the available measures, the curmcy has been appreciating steadily since 1988. The rate at the begi_n
of 1991 was one-quarter its 1988 level. The reasons for the long-term appreciation in the real exchange rate are not obvious;
they are attributed by some to the rise of Peru's coca economy (now, by some estimates, equivalent to at least one-third of
official exports).
2/ Increased purchases of foreign reserves by the Central Bank increased net reserves by US$277 million during May-August
1991, equivalent to 45 percent of the dollar value of Ml as of May, 1991 when the purchases started. In spite of the
significant purchases of foreign exchange by the Central Bank, the purchasing power of the dollar in terms of domestic goods
(meured by the CPI) fell by 25 percent during the same period.



* 18 -
66.        le tizd  economic ctcle. By August 1991, the rate of growth of the monetary base
explained about 75 percent of the inflation experienced since October 1990, the rest being due to the
persistent dollarization of the economy which increased the income velocity of money. The rate of
growth of the monetary base was highly variable but monetary policy was generally tight in the sense that
the monetary base grew at a lower rate than prices.
67.       The following sequence describes Peru's experience of cyclical fluctuations as of August 1991.
Tight monetary policy increases interest rates on dollar and domestic currency flnancial assets. These
rates attract capital inflows, which in turn cause an appreciation of the real exchange rate. ITe Cental
Bank reacts by speeding up money supply creation through increased foreign exchange purchases, and
this in turn creates inflation.
68.       Meanwhile, inflation reduces the real level of prices that are under Government control
(gasoline, for example) and are designed to include a large tax elemert; fiscal revenues therefore decline.
Worried about falling revenues, the Government then permits a large and immediate rise in public-sector
prices, which then causes a one-time rise in the price level. This kind of adjustment should have no
permanent inflationary effect. The Central Bank, concerned about the surge in prices, tries to
compensate by turning to a much tighter monetary policy (which involves buying less foreign exchange),
thereby further increasing interest rates and capital inflows. As these inflows appreciates the Peruvian
currency, the Central Bank loosens its grip, increasing the rate of growth of the money supply by
purchasing foreign exchange. This completes the inflationary cycle. The cycle has led to a highly volatile
monetary policy which, particularly until August 1991, increased uncertainty in an already uncertain
environment.
69.      ?n sum, Peru's Central Bank has been concerned with the same issues that concer most
Central Banks: inflation, foreign-exchange reserves, interest rates, unemployment, and the exchange rate.
But Peru has been experiencing high inflation in an extremely demonetized economy, leaving the
Goverment little room for mistakes from inconsistent policy objectives. Consequently, these objectives,
or shifts - -ing them, are another source of monetary volatility contributing to uncertinty. Coupled with
continuir.  llarizatior -'d a weak  scal situation, they help explain the current fragpile macoomic
situation.  iien a floa:  exchan4   ite, the Central Bank should target only the rate of growth of the
monetary base to provi.. a stable ani predictable monetary framework. This indeed seems to be the
policy that the Government has followed since August 1991. In addition, an efficient fiscal fraenwork
would be an indispensable complement for lasting stabilization.
L Monitoring the Stabilization Program
70.       The uncertainty related to the precarious tax base, the process of dollarization, and the
appreciation of the real exchange rate makes it difficult to forecast the evolution of economic variables.
TIerefore the Bank will .ssess the progress of the stabilization program with particular reference to a set
of broad relevant indicators which are consistent with the IMF program. For 1992, we shall use the
following set of indicators, with their corresponding values, to evaluate the economy's macroeconomic
performance:
(a) 'entral Governmnent current tax revenues: about 9 Jercent of GDP;



- 19 -
(b) Pimary deficit of the non-financial public sector (NFPS): no larger thaM 0.6 percent of GDP.
and no domestic financing of the NFPS total balance;
(c) Rate of creation of monetary base (December 1991 to December 1992): Ipto 40 percent;
(d)  Stock of other Central Bank monetary liabilities in the domestic currency: up to 0.1 times th
mone1trybas.
Within these broad indicators, the Bank will pay particular attention to measures of fiscal revenue
enhancement and expenditure control which will contribute to efficiency, equity, and the sustainability of
adjustmet in the medium-term. In monitoring the macroeconomic program, the Bank will consult
regulary with the IMF.
F. The Agenda for Structural Reform
71.      The structural reforms that Peru began in 1990 and 1991 are but the beginning of a long and
difficult path. The institutions of public management have to be rebuilt and public confidence in
government restored. This must happen against an alarming backdrop of poverty, a cholera epidemic,
and the security problems that have fed on the country's economic collapse. The Government has begun
an ambitious program to modernize the economy through policies to make it more efficient and
competitive: the liberalization of trade and agricultural, labor, and financial markets will continue; the
Government is determined to provide public goods - health, education, justice, and so on - more
efficiently; and a wide-ranging privatization process has been launched.
72.      Through its program of adjustment lending in FY92, the Bank will be working with the
Government in support of its agenda for structural reform. In addition to the structural reforms to be
supported in this project and the reforms of the preceding trade policy reform loan, a subsequent
financial sector adjustment loan would support a variety of other reforms (paragraph 11). This program
of adjustment lending will also contribute to stabilization objectives. Three components of the SAL -
supporting the non-inflationary financing of public expenditure, reform of tax administration, and a
reduction in public employment - have a direct and obvious impact. But other components of the
lending program will support policy reforms with more indirect effects:
(a)  If the prospects for structural reforms and for more efficient government are credible, people
are more likely to pay their taxes. Thus structural reforms indirectly increase fiscal revenues.
(b) The immediate fiscal contribution of privatization is to provide a usefil, but only temporary,
boost to revenues. Privatization's longer-term effect is to increase efficiency, eliminate the
recurring fiscal burden of state-owned enterprises, and create a new tax base.
(c)  The net impact of lower import duties combined with the elimination of many preferential
regimes is expected to lead to higher fiscal revenues, a trend which has been apparent since
the second quarter of 1991.
(d) New labor laws will increase labor mobility and thus facilitate the adjustment of inputs
resulting from changes in relative prices caused by the trade and other reforms.

(e) The new batiking law, by strengthening prudential regulation and providing for partial deposit
insurance, wIll help the banking system withstand the recessionary effects of the stabilization.
G. keMediunm-TeIlQOgt"tk
73.      Six major policy areas are likely to play an important role in determining the medium-term
outlook of the economy: (i) trade and financial sector reform, (ii) fiscal adjusttnent, (iii) restoration of
external debt service, (iv) privatization, (v) increased reliance on market allocation mechanisms, and (vi)
currency convertibility and financial openness. GDP growth is expected to be at 2.5 percent for 1992 as
the economy still needs tight monetary policy (required to end inflation), the hardening of the fiscal
budget, and the structural changes in relative prices. GDP is expected to start recovering in 1993 and its
growth rate to rise gradually to a sustainable level of 4.5 percent by the end of the decade (Table 1.4 of
Annex 1).
74.       A successful trade reform will increase the participation of exports and imports in GDP, once
the short-run disturbances associated with the end of the hyperinflation are washed out. We expect
exports and imports of goods and non-factor services to gradually increase their share of GDP from 11
percent in 1990 to 17-18 percent by 1999, with exports rising slightly faster than imports, resulting in the
energence of a positive balance in the trade account towards the end of the decade (Table 1.4 of Annex
1).
75.       Two forces operate on the current account: the fiscal adjustment should operate towards
improving the current account while foreign debt service would tend to generate a deficit. The most
likely scenario assumes the current account balance to remain in deficit during the decade, although it
will be reduced from the high level of 5.2 percent reached in 1991 to below 4 percent by 1999 and
thereafter (Table 1.4 of Annex 1).
76.       The simultaneous achievement of GDP growth and current account improvements depends on
a sustained fiscal adjustment and an increase in private savings that would bring domestic savings up to 26
percent of GDP by 1999 (compared with 19 percent in 1991), a level consistent with an investment ratio
of 20.9 percent and a trade surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP (Table 1.4 of Annex 1). The increased savings
should be sustained by the positive interest rates allowed by the financial liberalization begun in mid-
1990.
Hi. EXTERNAL FINANCING
A. The External Debt Problem
77.       Peru's arrears grew rapidly from 1983, when Peru adopted a best-effort-to-pay practice on its
foreign debt. Then, in July 1985, the Government announced that total foreign debt payments would be
capped at 10 percent of exports. Not until 1988, however, did actual debt service fall to the 10 percent
limit. Initially only payments from public creditors to private foreign banks were targeted, but in 1987
Peru extended the moratorium to the IFIs and also banned external debt-service payments by private
debtors. In August 1986, Peru was declared ineligible for IMF lending and was placed on *non-accrual
status by the World Bank one year later. In early 1989, the I1DB also took this last step. Threatened
with expulsion, the Government resumed current debt-servicing to the IMF at the end of August 1989.

78.      The current Government took prompt steps to rebuild Peru's ties with the international
flnancial community by resuming current debt service payments to the Bank and the IDB: following
discussions with the Bank, payments to cover current obligations were resumed in mid-October 1990, and
to the IDB one month later, thus "freezing the stock of arrears with these two institutions. Payments to
the IWUs average about US$41 million per month, equivalent to about 14 percent of the Central
Government's total fiscal revenues. Interruptions in the payment of current obligations to the Bank and
the IDB, but not the IMF, recurred in March 1991. By mid-September 1991 current debt service had
been resumed to both of these institutions, and all arrears accumulated since mid-October 1990 paid.
79.      Peru now faces an unprecedented overhang of external debt and arrears. At the end of 1990,
it had almost US$22 billion of external debt, with about one-third owed to private creditors, one-third to
Paris-Club members, 10 percent to other official bilateral creditors, and 18 percent to IFls (see Table 1.5
in Annex 1). Almost two-thirds of this was in arrears; arrears to the IFis alone totaled US$2.2 billion.
The secondary-market discount on commercial-bank claims on Peru is over 90 percent (down from 95
percent at the time the new Government took office).
B. The External Financing Plan for 1991 and 1992
80.      Peru's external financing requirements for 1991 and 1992 could total US$20.7 billion (Table
6). Taking account of disbursements already in the pipeline and private capital flows, external financing
requirements are reduced to US$18.8 billion. Most of the requirements are for the financing of arrears;
the rest is for public-sector debt-servicing, achieving a targeted level of reserves, and supporting the non-
nterest current-account deficit.

81.       To helpocover these financing requirements, the donor community has developed a coordinated
plan to help reintegrate Peru into the international financial community. Rescheduling and deferral of debt to
official bilateral creditors, and a continued moratorium on debt servicing to private creditors, are expected to
cover most financing requirements. Peru is not expected to receive any type of debt forgiveness in 1992.
The balance is expected to be provided by disbursements from the three IFls, the Latin American Reserve
Fund, and bilateral donors, coordinated through a 'Support Group.'
82.       Debt rescheduline and deferral. Rescheduling negotiations have already been successfilly
completed with the Paris Club of creditors, but negotiations are still underway with Peru's other bilateral
creditors, notably some Latin American and Eastern European countries. The financing plan incorporates
the agreement reached at the Paris Club, and assumes that Peru will be able to secure similar terms from its
other official bilateral creditors. It also assumes Peru will be unable to service debts to private creditors
during 1991-92; these debts will therefore be rescheduled.
83.       Paris Club Rescheduling. Peru rescheduled part of its obligations to the Paris Club of creditors
on September 17, 1991. The Paris Club awarded the Government exceptional treatment in the form of
unprecedented cashflow relief between October 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992 (the consolidation period).
All current maturities due during the consolidation period on debt contracted before the 1983 Paris Club
rescheduling (pre-cutoff debt) and all arrears on pre-cutoff debt were rescheduled on terms reserved for
heavily indebted lower middle income countries. All moratorium interest (interest due during the
consolidation period on rescheduled debt) and all arrears on post-cutoff debt were deferred, the latter
contingent on continued performance under the IMF's RAP. (See the notes to Tables 1.1. to 1.4, in Annex
1, for more detail on the terms of the Paris-Club rescheduling).
84.       Other Official Bilateral Reschedulings. Peru is seeking debt rescheduling from other bilateral
creditors on comparable terms to that received from the Paris Club of creditors, including the reprogram
of debt-for-export agreements with Eastern European creditors and the restructuring of medium-term
obligations to Latin American creditors that are currently being serviced through the ALADI payments
mechanism.
85.       Existing Medium- and Long-term Debt to Commercial Banks and Unguaranteed Suppliers.
Although Peru will be unable to service debts to private creditors during 1991 and 1992, the Government will
continue discussions with these creditors. Unless an agreement can be concluded without cash payments, the
arrears on these debts will continue to grow during this period. Following law suits brought by the
commercial banks in 1989-90, the new Government has negotiated an understanding with them under which it
renounced recourse to statute-of-limitations provisions in return for a suspension of the default proceedings
that were initiated in February 1990.
86.       Existing Short-Term Private Debt. Peru will continue to service short-term trade credits. Ihe
suspension, since 1983, of amortization of short-term working-capital loans will continue. In addition,
arrears that have emerged in recent years on interest payments on working capital owed by some public-sector
entities are likely to persist.
I/ The World Bank and the IMF would only disburse following clearance of Peru's ears to both institutions, expected
in December 1992.



-24-
87.       New disbrsmet. The three MIs and bilateral donors are committed to helping Peru secure
vitally needed exteral financing. However, their financial assistance is conditional on Peru's program of
stabilization and economic reforms remaining in place. For the financing plan to be successful, Peru must
abide by the conditions of the IMF's RAP and the Bank's conditions for lending to a country with protracted
arears during a speciftad period of time, expected to end in December 1992. As long as Peru adheres to the.
economic reforms in these programs until the end of the performance period, the Bank and the IMF will be in
a position to disburse to Peru upon clearance of arrears to both institudons. In order to clear Peru's arrears,
a bridge loan, presumably from bilateral donors, will need to be secured at the end of the performance
period. Economic discipline throughout the performance period is also essential to ensure continued lending
by the IDB, and the release of funds pledged by a support group of bilateral creditors.
88.         eIntrnat             Fund. In January 1991, the IMF management reached an agreement-
in-principle with the Government of Peru on an economic program for 1991-92 intended to form the basis for
a request for a two-year Rights Accumulation Program (RAP). On September 12, 1991, the IMF Board,
satisfied that Peru's external financing requirements could be met, and that Peru would maintain its payments
on current obligations to the IFIs, approved the RAP. Under the program, if Peru abides by IMF
performance criteria, and continues to service current debt to all three IFIs, it would accrue rights to future
disbursements equivalent to 188 percent of its quota, or SDR624 million, equivalent to Peru's current arrears
to the IMF. Rights would be disbursed once arrears to the IMP are cleared.
89.       Ihe World Bank. On May 2, 1991, the World Bank adopted a new "debt workout" policy,
analogous to the IMF's RAP (see paragraph 3). Under this program, three adjustment operations (expected
to total around US$900 million) would be presented to the Board for approval, and disbursements would be
released upon clearance of arrears to the Bank. On February 4, 1992, the Board approved the trade policy
reform loan.
90.       The Inter-American Develoment Bank. The three IFis agreed that Peru's arrears to the MDB
should be cleared first as they were smaller than those to the Bank or the IMF. These arrears were cleared
on September 13, 1991 with the help of a bridge loan of US$325 million from the Latin American Reserve
Fund (FLAR).2 With the clearance of its arrears, the IDB has begun to move ahead with a substantial
program .in support of Peru's rehabilitation. On September 18, 1991 the IDB Board approved a quick-
disbursing US$425 million loan for trade reform. In November 1991, it approved a transportation
rehabilitation investment loan for US$210 mi!tion and is expected to approve a quick-disbursing US$200
million loan for financial sector reform in ea..y 1992. This lending will be followed up with disbursements
on new projects in health, agriculture, energy, and water/sanitation, as well as the reactivation of existing
energy projects. Total disbursements in 1991 and 1992 are expected to be about US$839 million.
21 FLAR, an institution of the Andean Pact countries created to deal with balance-of-paymets problems in the region
thrgh the provision of medium-term (up to three-to-four-year) funding, has commited to make available to Peru up to $78
million more in financing through the end of 1992.



-25-
91.       The S    QuprGop. Following several meetings beginning in April 1991, a Support Group, led
by the U.S. and Japan, was officially formed on June 7, 1991 . At the time of approval of the RAP, the
IMF estimated that the quick disbursing balance of payments support required from the Support Group would
be as much as US$1.3 billion but, following the Paris Club rescheduling, which was more favorable than
initily expected, and an increase in expected disbursements from the IFIs, additional balance of payments
support needed is now estimated at only US$0.7 billion. The Support Group has pledged to provide this
amount, in addition to US$326 million earmarked for project assistance. With the approval of the IMF RAP,
which opened the way for the recent Paris Club agreement, bilateral donors have now begun to disburse these
funds.
C. External Financing Beyond the Performance Period
92.       Peru's net external financing requirements would be between $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion a year
between 1993 and 1999 (Table 1.2 in Annex 1). These estimates are based on the macroeconomic scenario
presented in Section III of this report. Under this scenario, Peru would sustain non-interest current-account
deficits through 1996; from 1997 a surplus is projected. In addition, these estimates are based on public
debt-service obligations of between $2.5 to $4 billion a year, which are drawn from assumptions about
expected disbursements. Finally, the estimates depend on assumptions about the volume of private capital
flows, and Peru's ability to increase its reserves. Yearly increases in reserves and positive private capital
flows, including direct investment related to the development of natural resource projects and renewed access
to short-term trade credits, are assumed throughout the period. Because we recognize that many of these
assumptions are based on scant information, we emphasize that this financing scenario is highly tentative and
should be interpreted with caution.
93.       If this scenario comes about, significant increases in flows from the IFIs and official bilateal
donors are expected to account for most of the necessary financing. In addition, it is assumed that the
Government will continue to reschedule private debt service ', and pre-cutoff-date debt service to Paris-
Club creditors due throughout the period. No debt reduction is assumed for either official bilateral or private
creditors. Under these assumptions, a financing gap generally within the range of $200 million to $500
million annually would remain. This gap would diminish by the amount of the IMP program that would
have to be in place before a further Paris Club rescheduling could take place. If Peru's access to IMF
resources were to average around 50 percent of current annual quota a year, the gap could be reduced by up
to $200 million a year. Further reductions in the gap could come about if any variables prove to be more
IQ/ Bilateml donors who have pledged through the Support Group are: Belgium, Canada, Ftance, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.
11/ Given that financing gaps are likely to occur, even assuming a 100 percent rollover every year of commercial bank
debt, it will be difficult for the Government of Peru to enter into an agreement with commercial banks requiring a large cash
payment. However, discussions have begun which may lead to negotiations with the commercial banks as ealy as 1992 and
a settlement on at least part of the Government's debt to commercial banks. Indeed, if the actual external financing scenario
is more favorable than the one presented here, and the Govemment were able to service or buy back its private debt, the
external financing gap would reflect the cost of any iesources devoted to such transactions.
12/ The projections assume this financing gap would be met on commercial terms.



-26 -
favorable than assumed, for example if Peru were able to secure new flows on more concessional terms than
in the past, if other exceptional treatment, such as debt reduction, were offered, or if faster GDP growth were
to lead to higher government revenues.
94.       Debt Servicing Capacity. Peru's current lack of creditworthiness originated with the previous
Administration's unwillingness to service the government's debt. Peru's creditworthiness is expected to
improve following the repayment of its arrears to the World Bank and IMF in December 1992 and the earlier
resumption of relations with the IDB and the Paris Club of creditors. The improvement in economic
performance, in the coming decade, from a sustained program of economic reform can be expected to
underpin creditworthiness by improving Peru's capacity to service its external debt.
95.       Under the assumed scenario, the ratio of debt service to exports could fal quickly, to 32 percent
by 1999 from around 51 percent in 1993. However, the ratios of debt to GDP and interest to GDP, which
better reflect the transfer problem, are projected to fall only slightly. Debt reduction would clearly lead to a
greater reduction in the debt burden and contribute to the future recovery of Peru's creditworthiness. (See
Table 1.4 in Annex 1, for a summary of Peru's debt and debt-service indicators).
IV. T   GE G(OVERNMENT'S SRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
A. Fiscal Policy
Baehru=nd
96.       'he state of Peruvian public finances in June 1990 was chaotic. Fiscal difficulties were
aggravated by a plunge in Central Government revenues due to lags in adjusting public sector prices, the
erosion of tax revenues caused by inflation, and increased tax evasion. A substantial quasi-fiscal deficit
merged as a result of the Central Bank's losses from its foreign exchange operations and subsidized lending
to Banco Agrario.
Recent Reffonn
97.       The new Administration enforced tight discipline on public sector wages, reduced the number of
public employee; bhrough voluntary retirement, and postponed public sector investments. The financial
performance of public enterprises improved as a result of frequent adjustments in the level of public sector
prices and tight controls on wages. Consequently, the deficit of the Non-Financial Public Sector (NPPS)
declined dramatically during the first two quarters of 1991 compared with the same period of 1990. ITe
level of the quasi-fiscal deficit declined as a result of a reduction in Central Bank lending to officW
development banks. Real tax revenue increased 22 percent in the first half of 1991 compared with the same
period of 1990. Legislative Decree 666 regulating VAT and selective excise taxes was enacted in September
1991 and, in October 1991, Supreme Decree 166-91-PCM established the basis for reform of the public
sector, redefining the scope of government activity, and reforming personnel policies and the tenure system.
Supreme Decree 267-91-EF (November 21, 1991) was later enacted to interpret the regulations created in
Legislative Decree 666 by establishing procedures for their applicason.



-27-
98.      The new tax system was simplified and is based on only five types of taxes:
(a)   a tax on the income of individuals and corporations;
(b)  a value added tax;
(c)   a tax on gross assets of firms and individuals;
(d) tariffs on imports; and
(e)   a tax on selective consumption.
99.       SUNAT, the tax administration agency, is undergoing a complete reorganization. A budget for its
reform has been provided with up to 2 percent of total tax revenues. Furthermore, the employees' tenure
system has been eliminated, the number of employees reduced, and a careful selection process of the
remaining staff has begun. On November 6, 1991 Supreme Resolution 326-91-EF/SUNAT established a new
SUNAT division charged with administrating account closures and with developing sanctioning systems for
the Regional Service Corps. By December 6, 1991, SUNAT increased the number of primary taxpayers to
2,200.
An Agenda for Further Reform
100.     The Administration is starting a series of reforms of the public sector to redefine the scope of
government activities, establish procedures allowing for the recruitment of skilled personnel for senior
positions, and the reassignment of personnel throughout the public sector. The public sector labor force is
being cut back with the use of voluntary retirement incentives.
101.     The administration will make frequent adjustments in public sector prices, based on price
inflation. By October 31, 1991, the Government and the Bank wil; jointly review taxes on bank current
account debits, taxes on interest, and taxes on exports to access the prospects of phasing them out within a
specific timetable. Changes in the tax code allowing for greater efficiency in the tracking of infringements
will be introduced.
102.     A revamped SUNAT will: implement new personnel selection processes which will operate in a
program without tenure benefits; establish a modern information center which will be developed during the
first semester of 1992 - the first stage will be the installation of modern computer facilities in the region
where primary taxpayers are concentrated; and expand the monitoring of large taxpayers to 2,500 firms by
the last quarter of 1992. This expansion will be crucial in boosting tax collection.
B. Social Sectoirs
103.     Peru suffers from chronic poverty, the extent and depth of which have increased significantly over
the past decade. In Lima alone, in 1990, it was estimated that 44 percent of the population was living in
poverty (defined by consumption below the cost of a basic food basket). The available data also confirm that
Peru's child and infant mortality rates (119 and 84 per thousand live births, respectively) are more than
double and its life expectancy rate (62 years) is ten percent lower than those of neighboring countries
(Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia). Half of all children under age six are chronically malnourished. There is a
sharp disparity in the availability and quality of health, nutrition, and education services within the country.
Activities are not well-integrated or targeted to the most vulnerable groups: infants, pregnant and lactating
mothers, and children under six. Although there are substantial contributions to food assistance programs by



-28-
the Central Government and donors (totaling at least US$200 million in 1991), many programs do not reach
their target groups or lack significant nutritional impact. Although the present Government has made
impressive progress in restoring macroeconomic stability and establishing a more efficient incentive structure
as a base for broad-based growth, it needs to attack Peru's deep-rooted poverty more vigorously and ensure
that the poor benefit from the increased economic opportunities. Such efforts will also increase the likelihood
that the adjustment program will be sustained.
Recent RC&=
104.     hEgty Allevialio. To protect vulnerable groups during the adjustment period, the Government
launched the Social Emergency Program in August 1990. However, this program did not develop as
planned, and disbursements fell short of their original targets (paragraph 57). In a renewed attempt to
alleviate poverty during the adjustment period, the Government created the National Fund for Social
Compensation and Development (FONCODES) in August 1991 to finance small labor-intensive projects for
the rehabilitation of the social and economic infrastructure (e.g., health posts, water and sanitation facility,
schools, and rural access roads). Activities have begun on a small scale, mainly in the emergency zones in
the Andean region (where the incidence of poverty is high). Through its trade reform loan (which includes a
component for FONCODES) and a US$4 million technical assistance grant, the IDB is assisting these
operations and defining emergency programs. With funding from the Japanese Grant Facility, the Bank is
also providing technical assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of FONCODES. Additional support
is being provided by UNDP.
105.      Fiscal austerity will continue to severely limit government resources available for social programs
in the medium-term. Furthermore, the Government faces a difficult task in coordinating the work of various
social sector institutions and setting priorities for their activities. As a first step in developing a framework
for poverty alleviation, the Government, with UNICEF assistance, prepared a Plan of Action for Children in
late 1991, which identifies problems and sets goals in health, education, nutrition, water and sanitation, and
employment. The Government is making this plan more effective by identifying priority projects and target
groups, and clarifying the responsibilities of the various institutions concerned.
106.      Health. Nutrition, and Education. With increased awareness of the need to reach vulnerable
groups more effectively, the social sector ministries recently have introduced several key programs. The
Ministry of Health has made special efforts to increase vaccination coverage (currently reaching 60 percent of
children 1 year old and under) and has begun to monitor child growth and promote breast feeding within its
broad maternal and child health program. It has streamlined the logistics of food assistance by scaling down
the organization and personnel of ONNA, the National Food Assistance Office. It is forming a coordinating
group for nutrition programs to improve the effectiveness of food assistance through better linkages to health
and nutrition promotion, increased focus on 'regnant and lactating mothers and infants, and better impact
evaluation. The Ministry of Education has introduced an emergency program, 'La Escuela Defiende la
Vida," which provides primary and pre-primary school children with a daily meal and uses the school as a
center for tuberculosis detection and other health services. In view of fiscal constraints, the Government now
plans to improve and expand these programs with resources from the NGO/private sectors and externa
donors.



-29-
An Agda for Furthr Reform
107.     The SAL program calls for concerted actions to define and implement a series of social measures
to enable the poor to respond to income-earning opportunities arising from economic growth and to improve
living conditions. Under the program, the Government is committed to:
(a)  developing a poverty alleviation strategy;
(b) developing profiles for priority projects in health, nutrition, and education;
(c)  preparing a national nutrition policy based on a review of the existing food assistace
program; and
(d)  implementing reforms in food assistance, based on the recommendations of the above-
mentioned national nutrition policy.
108.     The poverty alleviation strategy aims at establishing specific objectives and implementation
mechanisms for targeted social programs as well as defining the roles of FONCODES, the social sector
ministries, and the non-governmental sector. This strategy, together with the profiles for priority projects and
the national nutrition policy, will set the framework for the Bank-supported first Social Development Project
and serve as an important instrument for mobilizing external resources. Also, the first Social Development
Project will expand the scale and geographical coverage of selected, well-defined programs currently operated
on a limited scale, e.g., maternal care, reduction of micronutrient deficiencies, and child development and
growth monitoring (paragraph 106). The project will thus complement the activities of programs in which
other donors are taking the lead (for example, the IDB in the case of FONCODES). Reforms in food
assistance will address major weaknesses in the current food assistance program by integrating it with the
promotion of good health and nutrition practices and health services.
109.     These actions are being supported by technical assistance under the Japanese Grant Facility and
will be strengthened by the Bank's program, including: (i) the preparation of a poverty assessment report; (ii)
donor coordination through 1992; and (iii) a first Social Development Project and future lending to improve
the health and education infrastructure and the quality and coverage of services. Through the German GTZ
grant, the Bank has also supported an update of the 1985/86 Living Standard Measurement Survey (including
selected rural areas) to construct a poverty profile, monitor changes in living standards over the past five
years, and establish a base for evaluating the effect of the Government's economic program on poverty.
C. Privatization
Ba&kgmond
110.     State Entrepreneurial Activity (SEA), which includes those enterprises in which the Government
is sole owner, majority, or minority shareholder, increased from 29 companies in 1968 to 177 in 1991. The
performance of these enterprises has been adversely affected by lags in price adjustments, the high cost of
over-employment, and political interference. Since most of the companies comprising SEA operated at a
deficit, the Government has not made the necessary investment for replacement, modernization, and
expansion of existing facilities. Political interference and poor economic performance of SEA firms have



-30-
severely deteriorated the institutional framework of SEA, affecting the effectiveness of the companies'
management as well as the Government agencies which control it.
&Mtfl Reforms
111.      Faced with the reality of failing SEA companies, the Government decided to redefine and reduce
the role of the public sector in the economy through the sale of public companies to the private sector. The
process began on March 12, 1991, when the President issued Supreme Decree 41 authorizing procedures for
the privatization of 23 companies. The strong public support for the first successful privatizations stimulated
the Government to move forwardW. Technical assistance from the Bank, supported by Japanese Grant
Funds, enabled the Government to proceed with a more comprehensive privatization strategy covering all
sectors of economic activity, expressed in Legislative Decree 674 (September 27, 1991).
112.      The Government's privatization strategy includes three main components:
(a) the development of a simple and flexible legal and institutional framework, as defined
in Legislative Decree 674. Decisions on privatization will be taken by a central
privatization commission (COPRI) under the direct supervision of the President.
COPRI will be responsible for defining the companies to be privatized, ensuring
consistency throughout the privatization process, and resolving the cross-sectoraJ
issues affecting the privatization;
(b) the development of sector strategies and action plans for privatization in the areas of
economic activity where privatization should be preceded by changes in the regulatory
environment, and the development of action plans for privatization of companies
which can be transferred to the private sector without any changes in the regulatory
environmentl-';
(c) an overall implementation plan to strengthen public support for the program. In the
short-term, COPRI will focus its efforts on a list of approximately '0 companies
which can be privatized by December 1992 or early 1993.
An Agenda for Further Reform
113.      Attention should be focussed at this stage on the conclusion of sector strategies and action plans
for privatization in the essential areas of banking, fishery, mining, oil and gas, power, telecommunications,
transportation, and water and sewage. These strategies will be developed to ensure an organized and
comprehensive privatization, minimizing the risks and maximizing the efficiency of the process. The
implementation of the privatization of the first batch of companies and subsequent privatizations will be
supported by the Bank under the privatization adjustment loan and other Bank sector operations.

on July 19, 1991.
JA/ To support the sectoral strategies, the Government also issued derees promoting private sector investmen in distit
sectors of economic activity including fishery. mining. power, telecommunications, and transport.

D. Agdcultur
114.     For the last two decades, the agricultural sector was highly centralized. Credit was subsidized
and rationed by the State and agriculture was decapitalized under a system of incentives that favored cities.
The state companies, ENCI and ECASA, created to import and market foodstuffs, became enormous
bureaucratic organizations demanding large transfers from the goverment's budget. The Central Bank
heavily subsidized their imports via access to the most subsidized exchange rates. The Banco Agrario ran
large deficits and largely operated as a window for dispensing subsidies to a small portion of agricultural
producers.
Rew ]Rehors
115.     The newly established unified exchange rate eliminated the bias against agricultural experts, and
imports of foodstuffs no longer received exchange rate subsidies. lTe trade reform also eliminated, the
widespread system of exemptions that discriminated against agriculture. Most significant have been the
liberalization and deregulation of all domestic and foreign trade of agricultural products.
116.      Decrees were enacted to abolish the National Rice-marketing Company (ECASA) and to
restructure the National Input-marketing Company (ENCI); Banco Agrario credit subsidies were eliminated
and its privileged access to collateral offered by agricultural producers abolished; land and property rights
were strengthened, making land transferable and allowing it to be used as collateral. In promoting private
corporate ownership of land, the Government began a long-term plan ensuring land-titling and registration;
new agrarian policies dismantled the massive subsidization and regulatory system within the domestic market;
and the personnel of the National Institute for Agricultural and Agroindustrial Research (INIAA) was reduced
from 7,000 in 1987 to 4,000 in 1991.
An Agenda for Further Reform
117.      Under the SAL program there will be no reversal of the provisions of the Agricultural Sector
Investment Promotion Law (Legislative Decree 653) which reform land tenure, agricultural commercializadon
and credit, water usage, trade, and labor policy, and the final liquidation of ECASA and ENCI will be
carried out according to liquidation guidelines set by the IDB Peru Trade Sector Loan (PE-029).
E. Labor Reform
gkgrouand
118.      Labor market regulations of the last two decades were intended to protect worker stability and
improve wages, but worked in opposite ways. The formal labor market shrank, releasing resources to the
*infbrmal* sector. Labor stability and fringe benefits significantly increased labor costs for employers
without improving workers' incomes or employment conditions. In 1990 real wages in the formal market fell
to 20 percent of their value at the beginning of the 1970s. Provisions for probationary employment in labor
stability laws were rigid and limited probationary employment to a maximum of three months, and temporary
employment was restricted to a limited number of sectors. Peru had a forced Savings Scheme for Worker
Retirement (CTS) by which businesses had to account for wcrkers' retirement in their balance sheets. The



^32-
CTS served as a 13th month salary, accumulated yearly and withdrawn when job separation occurred. CTS
funds, proportional to tenure, were indexed to the inflation rate. However, severe problems existed in the
implementation of the CTS system.
119.     The current Administration, recognizing the importance of reducing labor market rigidities, took
important steps to liberalize labor markets. Supreme Decree 76-90-TR permitted the formation of unions
with as few as twenty members and, where the Government had previously set the minimum wage
unilaterally for the whole country without considering local differences, minimum wages are now set by a
board consisting of employers, employees, and government representatives, and are established by
enployment sector, regional cost of living, and type of occupation (Supreme Decree 17-91-TR).
120.     Probationary Employment The new Job Promotion Law created a more flexible probationary
employment period. The initial employment period of three months can now be extended to a total of six
months, provided the work requires a training and adaptation period. In the case of managerial and other
positions of trust, the period is extendable to one year (Legislative Decree 728, November 12, 1991).
121.     Tepra  Employme. Supreme Decree 077-90-TR allowed fixed-term employment contracts
to be made for up to two years for all sectors and under most circumstances (few relevant restrictions
remain). Temporary employment was authorized for initiation or increase in work load, or for changing
labor market needs (Legislative Decree 728, November 12, 1991).
122.    EPr_d Savings Scheme for Worker Retirement. In relation to the Forced Savings Scheme for
Worker Retirement (CTS), the Administration made two reforms: the employee may now choose to deposit
the funds in any financial institution and the firm now has ten years to deposit, in the institution chosen by the
employee, the balance of the CTS accumulated under the old regime. These changes have thus converted
CTS funds into a privately administered retirement cum unemployment fund.
An Agcn    r Further Reform
123.     The labor sector agenda for further reform is largely one of maintenance of current reforms
through which the Government liberalized some distortionary regulations in the labor market, improved
occupational mobility by increasing the term for labor contracts, and extended the probationary employment
period to one year.
F. Social Secudy
124.     Peru's social security system, administered by the autonomous Instituto Peruano de Seguridad
Social (IPSS), was almost bankrupt in 1990 following a near total breakdown in its administration it the late
1980s. Between 1985 and 1990, for example, IPSS boosted personnel from 31,000 to 45,000 in a massive
bureaucratic expansion. It paid out generous pensions to employees with only five years of payments into the
system and extended health coverage without concomitant increases in contributions. IPSS's real estate



-33 -
investments had been poorly managed, as revenues generated from rents did not cover costs. While this was
happening, most firms, including most state-owned firms, stopped depositing funds withheld from employees.
Recen Reforms
125.     The Govermnent took dramatic steps to improve the administration of IPSS. It abolished most
deductions and reduced its staff by 30 percent. IPSS reorganized the management of its real estate assets and
commenced eviction procedures in order to rent and sell its properties under new market-based contractual
arrangements. Also, the forced deposit and collection of IPSS funds at Banco de la Nacion was eliminated.
Under the new system, official and private banks make monthly bids for tax collection of IPSS funds, based
on length of terms and interest rates. Furthermore, the Government has created the framework for a Private
System of Pensions (SPP) to complement the IPSS. SPP benefits will be managed by the Administrators of
Pension funds (AFP) which will initiate its activities to partially or totally privatize the system by July 28,
1992 (Legislative Decree 724, November 11, 1991).
An Agenda for Further R_eform
126.     The SPP framework will be established and will probably be based on a mixed-pension regime
with IPSS as the first layer (pay-as-you-go) and private companies as the second layer (capitalization). The
policy of partial or complete privatization of the pension system should not be reversed and an action plan
and implementation schedule will be agreed to by the Borrower and the Bank. Also, the separation of all
health and pension fund accounts will be completed. The IPSS revenue collection rate will not be increased,
the collection system will remain streamlined, and its personnel will be reduced by an addidonal 7,000
employees.
127.     IPSS will prepare quarterly action plans for the management of assets including the administradon
of revenues from asset sales. As a control mechanism for its new collection procedures, IPSS intends to
contract a private company to conduct informational cross-referencing between the banking system's and its
own records. The independent audit of IPSS for 1991 will be completed by October 31, 1992. IPSS last
presented financial statements in 1986; but the new administration will have a private organization prepare
annual audits for IPSS beginning in 1992.
G. Prospects for the Structural Adjustment Program
128.     The Administration has made important changes to reduce fiscal expenditures, initiate the
privatization effort, and deregulate the economy. The risk of a major reversal of these policies is slight
because: (a) the strategy of emphasizing market forces is well in tune with regional and worldwide trends;
and (b) a different strategy attempting to expand government expenditures would be constrained by the low
tax revenues and high income velocity of money.
129.     Nevertheless, partial reversal cannot be ruled out, as policy objectives are far from having been
reached and cost always precedes the benefits. The reforms have just begun to make an impact: trade
reform must hold against import-substitution lobbies; privatization has proven, in other countries, to be far
more difficult than first envisaged; and fiscal adjustment will be demanding due to the narrow tax base. The
entire stabilization effort will depend on the Government's determination to fight special interests.

--M T E PRPQED SI*RUCURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
A. The loan
Descriptjo
130.     A loan is proposed for US$300 million under the Bank's new policy for countries with protracted
arrears (paragraph 3). The Board's approval would entitle Peru to immediate disbursement of the whole
amount after signing and effectiveness. These actions would take place at the end of the performance period
upon satisfactory implementation of the SAL reform program, the economic stabilization program, the
external financing plan, and continued current debt-service payments to the Bank. The performance period,
which began with the initial reforms of August 8, 1990, is expected to end in December 1992, concurrently
with the termination of the IMF Rights Accumulation Program. We do not propose any earmarking of local
counterpart funds.
131.     Under the workout program, the loan would be signed after Board presentation only after Peru's
arrears to the Bank are cleared (possibly by December 1992). The standard grace period will be calculated
from the time of loan signature, rather than Board presentation.
Policy Reforms to be Supported Under the SAL
132.     We propose a quick-disbursing loan in support of Peru's current medium-term structura
adjustment program. It would recognize the major reform measures taken between August 1990 and
December 1991 and further reforms to be implemented by December 1992 in the following areas:
Macroeconomic Policy, Fiscal Policy, Social Sectors, Privatization, Agriculture, Labor, and Social Security.
These measures are presented in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2).
PMrooosd Sectoral Co-ndiflons
133.     We propose the following conditions for preventing reversal of policies recently implemented, and
conditions for further reform. These conditions are also presented in the attached Policy Matrix (see Annex
2) and in Appendix A of the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 4).
134.     Conditions Preventing Policy Reversal. These conditions will be monitorable based on policies as

A. M    nomic Policv:
*   Adopt measures and an implementation schedule satisfacory to the Borrower and the Bank
aiming for a level of Tax Revenues for the Central Administration of about 9 percent of GDP.
The primary deficit of the NFPS will not be larger than 0.6 percent of GDP (January -

.37-
* Changes' in the tax regime code, satisfactory to the Borrower and to the Bank, will be
introduced to allow for greater efficiency in the tracking of infringements.
C. ocial Sectors:
*   The Government will develop, by January 31. 1292, a poverty alleviation strategy and
*                  imnplementation schedule, both acceptable to the Bank, outlining policies, and identifying
priority programs and target groups. The Government will adopt this strategy by December-3,
1992.
*   The Goverunent will develop profiles for priority projects in primary health and nutrition
acceptable to the Bank by April 30IM.192.
*     nThe Government will prepare a national nutrition policy acceptable to the Bank, based on a
review of existing food assistance programs, and will recommend reforms necessary to improve
cost effectiveness by April 30. 1992. The Government will initiate the first stage of these
reforms in food assistance programs, including streamlining the role of public agencies, by luu
30, 1992.
* nThe Government will develop profiles for priority projects acceptable to the Bank in pre-
primary and primary education by April 30,1992.
D. Privatization:
*   The Government will implement policies defined in the institutional framework for privatlzation
(established in Decree 674) by Junk 30. 1992.
*   The Government will develop an overall action plan and implementation schedule acceptable to
the Borrower and the Bank for divestiture in the banking, fishery (including Flopesca,
Pescaperu, Epsep, and CERPER), and mining sectors (including Minero Peru, Centromin Peru,
and Hierro Peru) by June 30. 1992.
*   The Government will develop a policy framework acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank,
including an implementation schedule for private sector participation in: (i) oil exploration,
refining, and distribution; (ii) gas production and distribution; (iii) power generation,
transmission, and distribution; (iv) telecommunications; (v) transportation (railways, ports, and
air transport); and (vi) water supply and sewage, by June 30. 1992.
*   The Government will develop a divestiture strategy acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank,

Government is a minority shareholder. The Government should bring to the point of sale at
least 6 of these companies by December 31, 1992.



-38 -
E. Agdl2tur:
*   The Government will liquidate ECASA by Sptember 192. The liquidation will follow the
Action Plan already agreed by the IDB and the Government for the IDB Trade Sector Loan
(PR-1796: Annexes V and VI; September 10, 1991). The general objective of the Action Plan
is to help rapidly liquidate ECASA's assets with reasonable prices, thus allowing the
corporation to settle its liabilities and prevent continued costs which erode the state's fiscal
resources. The liquidation steps are detailed in Annex 3.
*   Implement Supreme Decree 148-90-PCM, authorizing ENCI's reorganization. The
restructuring of ENCI will also follow the steps agreed to by the IDB and the Government
entailed in the IDB Trade Sector Loan and detailed in Annex 3.
F. Social Securny:
* Pensionsysem: The Government has issued a decree allowing for partial or complete
privatization of the pension system. There will be no policy reversal regarding privatization of
this pension system, and, by September 30. 1992, the Government will present an action plan
acceptable both to the Borrower and the Bank to implement the privatization decree.
* Complete the separation of all health and pension fund accounts (except administrative expenses)
by Junlg30. 1992.
- IPSS, as fund intermediator, will be subject to periodic independent auditing. These audits will
include not only financial control but also administrative and operational diagnoses and
recomnendations. The independent audit for 1991 will be completed by October 31. 1992.
* Reduce number of IPSS employees by an additional 7,000 by 12ecember 1992.
136.     In all of the above areas the Bank and the Government of Peru will agree on a final timetable for
measures to be taken, monitoring criteria, and on procedures to be followed during the performance period.
Monitorint and Reporting
137.     The Bank will, at negotiations, finalize an agreement on the information which the Government
will provide during and after the performance period on developments in macroeconomic policy and
performance, the external financing plan, and fulfillment of the conditions as set out in this loan. The
proposed information is listed in Appendix B to the Letter of Development Policy, Annex 4.
138.     Consistent with the Bank's new policy for countries with protracted arrears (paragraph 3), the
management will submit each quarter to the Board a report on Peru's compliance with the requirements of
this and the c.ther adjustment loans in the workout. The report would assess the likelihood of a successful
workout by December 1992, and recommend, as necessary, any modifications to the conditionality or
administration of the loan. Specifically, the report would cover the following topics.



-39-
(a)  Peru's progress in fulfilling the objectives of the macrgocnom1iC stabilizatjnmgrM, wh
particular reference to the risks that have been identified (paragraphs 58-69).
(b)  Progress in fulfilling the conditions of the external financing plan, including Peru's servicing of
current payments due to the Bank, and any related developments (for example, negotiations with
commercial banks).
(c)  Progress in fulfilling the gt rL ditiong of the workout loans, in the context of overall
sectoral performance and policy and other developments affecting fulfillment of sectoral
conditions and sectoral performance.
Cooperation with the IDB
139.      On September 18, 1991, the IDB's Board approved a fast-disbursing US$425 million trade sector
loan, US$325 million to be disbursed on effectiveness, with US$50 million for each of a second and third
tranche. The loan covers five areas: (i) trade policy; (ii) customs reform; (iii) labor market reform; (iv)
private sector development in agricultural marketing; and (v) the social compensation fund. The IDB and the
Bank have developed their analysis and sectoral conditionality on trade and customs reform in close
cooperation, in particular through concurrent pre-appraisal missions in June 1991 . In these last two areas,
conditions in the two loans are the same.
C-o-Financing
140.      As part of the German contribution to the Support Group, KfW (the German financial aid agencq)
will provide DM50 million to Peru in the form of co-financing the SAL. Although details of co-financing
arrangements are to be firmed up over the coming months, it is likely that Board approval of the SAL could
trigger KfW disbursements to Peru.
Twhnital Assac
141.      Technical assistance for implemnenting structural reforms proposed under the SAL will be
provided externally. Bank technical assistance will be principally supported by bilateral trust funds, i.e., the
Japanese Grant Facility and GTZ (German Technical Aid Agency) grants, and will complement support being
provided by other donors, including the IMF, IDB, and UNDP.
142.      The Bank, as executing agency under the bilateral grants, will provide technical assistance totaling
approximately US$5.5 million in six areas (see Annex 7 for a description of the technical assistance
program):
151 Labor market reform, private sector development in agricultural marketing, and the social compensation fund will be
covered by the Bank in this SAL. The Bank also continues to work closely with the IDB in the areas of trade policy and
customs refonn.



-40-
(a) budgjet planning and expenditure control, including development of criteria for national budget
planning and expenditure monitoring, design of the public finance system, and formulation of a
public investment program (co-financing with IDB);
(b)  pgyey aJeviat   , including support to FONCODES and formulation of priority
programs/projects in primary health care, nutrition, and basic education (co-financing with IDB
and UNDP);
(c)  PdYl xim andf  restucripegf gulic enterpri3o, including development of overall and sectoral
strategies and a regulatory framework for privatization;
(d)  ariculture sector reform, including development of a sectoral policy framework (e.g.,
environment and water resources management) and implementation of urban and rural land
titling/registration;
(e)  social security system, including development of an operational plan for privatization of the
existing pension system; and
(f) extern&I debt, including design of the debt information system and development of external debt
negotiation strategies (co-financing with UNDP).
143.     Tb Bank will administer technical assistance funds to assist the Project Coordination Unit of the
Ministry of E(onomy and Finance in collecting and preparing supporting documentation for disbursement
requests. This assistance to the Project Coordination Unit will be common to the Bank's three adjustment
loans. The UNDP also plans to support the Project Coordination Unit by financing personnel, equipment,
and operational expenses. Furthermore, with the support of the German GTZ grants, the Bank will monitor
closely the implementation of the loan through the use of local consultants.
144.     The IMF has been supporting tax reforms and restructuring SUNAT. The IDB plans to enhance
this effort through a US$5 million technical assistance grant. The IMF has been providing the Central Bank
with technical assistance for monetary policy. For agriculture marketing, the IDB will set aside US$528,000
of technical assistance funds (from its trade sector loan) to develop and implement plans to liquidate ECASA
and restructure ENCI. The IDB also plans to provide the US$4.5 million technical assistance loan to the
Ministry of Ec-nomy and Finance in parallel with its financial sector adjustment loan.
145.     Pcrement. Disbursement. Audit. and Administration. Arrangements for procurement,
disbursement, audit, and administration will follow those of the preceding trade policy reform loan:
146.     The proposed loan would be used in its entirety to finance 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of
eligible public and private sector imports. Eligible imports would be all goods and services except those
normally excluded under Bank policy-based lending, such as alcohol, tobacco, and armaments, as well as
luxury, enviromentally hazardous, or other goods specifically prohibited in a negative list, and goods
financed by other Bank loans or loans from offtcial multi- or bilateral sources. The closing date of the loan
would be June 30, 1993.
147.     Tle proposed loan faces two particular circumstances affecting procurement and disbursement.
First, given the Bank's total proposed adjustment lending program for FY92 - arouna US$900 million, all



-41 -
of it required to rapidly disburse in December 1992 - and the expected level of IDB adjustment lending and
bilateral aid for the same years (US$700 million and US$1,300 million respectively), the amount of imports
which are to be subject to Bank disbursement and procurement procedures will be substantial in relation to
overall eligible Peruvian imports (total imports are currently almost US$3 billion per annum).
148.     Second, effectiveness will fall well behind the policy reform process that the loan supports: the
economic reform process began on August 8, 1990 (with the trade-reforn process being substantively
completed by April 1991), Board presentation is expected in early 1992, but the loan will not be signed
before the end of 1992, that is, 28 months after the beginning of economic reforms. Under these
circumstances, retroactive financing of eligible imports for the whole of the loan amount is recommended
from August 8, 1990.
149.     A Country Procurement Assessment Report prepared by the Bank in September 1991 noted that
the laws and decrees governing the procurement procedures followed by both public and private sector
importers were in broad conformity with the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines. In addition, the annual
budget law provides that goods and works financed by international financial institutions will be procured in
accordance with the requirements of these institutions.
150.     Trade policy reform since August 1990 - the wholesale reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers,
the elimination of fiscal privileges, the removal of controls on foreign-exchange transactions, and the
beginning of customs reforms - has immeasurably strengthened the competitive environment in which private
purchasing decisions are made.
151.     In view of the above-mentioned reforms, the following procurement procedures would apply:
(a)  Contracts for the procurement of imports made by public and private importers valued at or
exceeding US$5.0 million would be procured under simplified ICB procedures in accordance with
Bank Procurement Guidelines. Imports of petroleum products and commodities such as wheat,
corn, sugar, etc., would be purchased under competitive procedures acceptable to the Bank. In
addition, direct contracting would be acceptable if it is in accordance with the requirements of
paragraph 3.5 of the Procurement Guidelines. Contracts below US$5,000 would not be eligible
for Bank financing.
(b)  Public sector imports valued at below US$5.0 million and above US$5,000 would be procured in
accordance with local norms which have been assessed as acceptable to the Bank in the Country
Procurement Assessment Report of September 1991.
(c)  Import contracts by private importers below US$5.0 million and above US$5,000 would be
awarded in accordance with established commercial practices, which are acceptable to the Bank.
These practices generally consist of inviting more than one quotation, except for importers of
small amounts of consumer goods, who generally buy from traditional sources using direct
negotiation.
152.     Disbursements for contracts under US$5.0 million would be made against Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) for which the relevant procurement documentation would be kept locally for supervision



-42 -
by the Bank staff in the field and for auditors whose terms of reference for auditing would be acceptable to
the Bank.
153.     T`he Ministry of Economy and Finance would administer the loan and be responsible for
submitting the relevant documentation for disbursement. To fulfill this task, the Ministry has established a
Coordinating Unit to ensure compliance with loan conditions, prepare disbursement requests, supervise
consultancies, and fulfill reporting requirements to the Bank.
154.     To assist in the preparation of disbursement requests, the Ministry and the Central Bank have, in
conjunction with the Customs Administration, created a Special Procurement Unit responsible for the
collection of relevant procurement documentation, ensuring that only eligible and correctly procured imports
are included in withdrawal applications. This documentation would be retained for review, as required, by
the Bank and the project auditors.
155.     Letter of Development Policy. The basis for this loan will be provided by a Letter of Develop-
ment Policy (Annex 4). Given the context of Peru's workout, which envisages several adjustment project
and a performance period that separates Board presentation from loan signature, this Letter goes beyond the
normal scope of a letter of sector policy and constitutes the understanding between the Government and the
Bank at the time of Board presentation on the conditions and criteria upon which the proposed loan agreement
can be signed and made effective. The Letter will:
(a) set out the Government's medium-term macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment
program;
(b) describe the external financing plan for 1991 and 1992;
(c)  set out the process and timetable by which the loan is expected to be signed and become effective;
(d)  describe the evolution, objectives, and guidelines of macroeconomic policy, setting out the
precise sectoral (macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform) conditions the
Government undertakes to fulfill during the performance period and describing what further
actions are intended in the longer term; and
(e) indicate how the Government will report to the Bank during the performance period.
156.     Condidors fior Boad Presentation. Consistent with the Bank's new policy on Additional
Support for Workout Programs, the following Board presentation conditions have been met:
(a) a macroeconomic stabilization program in place and agreed to by the IMF and the Bank, as
described in paragraphs 58-60 above; this program would provide the common framework for the
three adjustment loans proposed for Peru's workout; the Bank would follow quantitative
indicators of major macroeconomic variables for 1992 (paragraph 70); within these broad
indicators, the Bank would pay particular attention, in monitoring the program, to measures of
fiscal revenue enhancement and expenditure control which will contribute to efficiency, equity,
and the sustainability of adjustment in the medium-term;



-43
(b)  an external financing plan, agreed among the international financial institutions, which would, as
described in paragraphs 80-91, provide for full clearance of arrears to the Bank and the normal-
ization of Peru's relations with the IMP and IDB;
(c)  agreement on sectoral conditions to be undertaken and conditions preventing policy reversal
(paragraphs 134-135 and Appendix A of Annex 4); and
(d)  Peru remaining current on its servicing of debt to the Bank (other than debt covered under
external financing above) currently falling due on the terms already agreed to with the
Government.
157.     Conditions of Loan Signine and Effectiveness. Consistent with the Bank's new policy on
Additional Support for Workout Programs, loan signing and effectiveness conditions would be as follows:
Signing*
(a)  prior clearance of arrears to the Bank;
(b) compliance, during the performance period, with the IMF and Bank-supported program of macro-
economic stabilization (paragraph 156(a) above), with particular reference to the Bank's quantita-
tive indicators;
(c) the continued viability of an external financing plan (paragraph 156(b) above); and
(d) compliance, during the performance period, with the Bank's sectoral conditionality as under
paragraph 156(c).
Effectiveness:
(a) taking of all Governmental actions required to authorize (or, if necessary, to ratify) signing of the
loan agreement; and
(b)  if a time lapse were to occur between signing and these actions, continued satisfactory imple-
mentation of the trade reform and macroeconomic stabilization programs and the external financ-
ing plan, in accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Development Policy.
B. Benefits
158.     Stabilization is necessary for the success of the structural reforms currently being implemented.
Policies supported by this loan will reduce inflation to low levels, setting the framework for renewed growth.
Ihe revamping of fiscal administration and fiscal reforms should increase revenues and make the fiscal
adjustment sustainable. The trade reform should mobilize resources toward Peru's competitive advantage and
lead to an outward-oriented, and thus sustainable, growth. Labor market reforms will improve the flow of
labor inputs among sectors to adapt to changes in relative prices caused by trade and fiscal reforms. Interest
rates will continue to be set freely, thus improving resource allocation and monetization. Land reform has
been extensive, strengthening property rights, crucial for agricultural development. Privatization will create a



- 44-*
larger and more efficient private sector, and pVivatization of the social security system would be a new source
for long-term savings.
159.     The poor will gain in the long-run from the liberalization of the labor market, a wider distribution
of employment opportunities, and the potential benefit from agricultural reforms to use land as collateral, and
improved registration and titling of land. To protect the poor, in the short-run, the Government is striving to
mobilize external resources for priority projects in basic socW services. The Government intends to develop a
national nutrition policy with a view to improving the cost-effectiveness, nutritional impact and targeting of
food assistance programs. The recently established social compensation fund (FONCODES) will channel
financing (both domestic and external) to small, labor-intensive projects to benefit the poor.
Vi. &ECOMMENDAION
I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Notes 3 Toles 1.1 to 1.4
The projecons in this Annex illusae a feasible path for the economy under the
stabiliaton mad  tural refbrms initiated by the Fujimori Govermen. These notes spell out
some assumptions behind the projections and some definitions of Items projected.
1.   Assumdt  for Balance.f-Pa =ment Itens dExcludine Debt Servicing and the Capital
Agout and National Accounts
lbe key coutry assumptions behind the forecasts in Tables 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4 are as
folows:
1.   After three consecutive years of decline, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected
to grow by 2.8 percent during 1991, the rate increasing steadily to reach 4.5 percent
in 2000 (an average of 3.4 percent for the period).
2. Population is assumed to grow at 2.S percent a year up to 1991, declinig to 2.2
percent by 1997.
3.   Exports of goods and non-factor services are expected, because of the trade reforms,
to be a major contributor to GDP growth. After an iiti increase of only 3.3
percent in 1991, eflecting the appreciation of the real exchange rate, export growth
wll recover to about 15 percent during 1992. For the rest of the period, exports are
assumed to grow at an average of 8.3 percent per year, increasing their shae in GDP
from 11 pecent in 1990 to about 19 percent in 2000 (a level consistent with shares
ataned in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1980s, when the economy was more open).
4.   Similarly, imports of goods and non-factor services, after an iniial increment of about
10.7 percent in 1992, are assumed to grow at an average of about 6.8 percent
between 1993 and 2000, to reach a levd of 18 percent of GDP in 2000 (up fiom 11
percent in 1990). The net movement of imports and exports would reduce the
current-account deficit ftom 4.6 percent of GDP in 1991 to 2.8 percent in 2000.
S.   The ratio of investment to GDP is expected to increase from 20.7 percent in 1991 to
25.3 percent in 2000, with an average ratio of 23.7 percent during this period, a levd
comparable to other middle-income economies. During the same period, public gross
capital formation would rise to 4.3 percent of GDP from 3.5 percent.
6.   Consumption per capita is assumed to grow slowly due to increased investment and
improvement in the trde balance.

7.    For the pod  s as a wole, tuse trends would rsult in an Increase in domestic savnp
from 19 to 21 percent of GDP. Similarly, nadonal savig, because of the ncasg
level of investment and the improving cuent-account balance, would increase fom
15 to 17 percent of GDP.

9.    Dcbt Rescbedulinu and Deferal: in 1991 and 1992 all official bilateral debt is
assumed to be rescheduled on the terms secured in the September 1991 Pars aCub
negotiations (see biclow). In 1993 and bqyond, pre-cutoff debt service due to the
Paris Club of creditors is assumed to be rescheduled. Other oficdal bilater debt is
assumed to be serviced. Private debt service is assumed to be rescheduled evey
year for 1991-99.

REPUBLICA DEL PERU
MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y FINANZAS
DESPACHO MINISTERIAL
Oficio No. 206-91/EFlO
Lima, February 20, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President,
The World Bank,
1818 H street N.W.
Washinon D.C 20433
Dear Mr. Preston:
1.    In order to support the on-going stabilization policy as well as address the longer-term
fundamental causes of the economic crisis, the Government of Peru is requesting from the Internaticnal
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) a Structural Adjustment Loan of US$300 miulion
equivalent.
2.    In support of this request this letter describes:
-     the Government of Peu's medium-term macroeconomic stabilization and medium-term
adjusment program;
-     the external financing plan for 1991-92 that Peru has agreed with its major creditors;
-      ithe process, general conditions and dmetable by which the loan would be
presented to the IBRD's Board, subsequendy signed and made effective;
-     the evolution and objectives of all components of the Strucu   Adjusment Loan,
highlighting the precise sectoral conditions the Government is committed to fulfill during
the adjustment period and additional actions to be taken in the longer-term; and
-     the procedures through which the Government will be reporting to the Bank on
macro-adjustment and sectoral reforms during the performance period.

3.    This letter also reflects our understanding on the conditions and criteia according to which the
agreement for the proposed loan can be signed and made efective after approval of the proposed loan
by the World Bank's Board of Directors.
}. THvE RS-EHffl       S MEIUM-TERM MACROSTABIIAZAIO AND AD1UM
PROGRAM
4.    In July of 1990, when the preceding government let office, Peru was confronted with a severe
economic and social crisis. By the end of that month, prices were increasing 36,000 percent annually,
exports were 40% below their 1979 level, and per-capita income reached a 30-year low. The severe
macroeconomic disequilibria were compounded by an intsification of violence and teorism. The
economic crisis resulted from a combination of massive fiscal deficits, wage and price controls, very
distorted multiple exchange rate system, negative real interest rates. Recognizing the urgency of restoring
a sound economy, the new government launched the first stage of very bold stabilization and structural
reforms in August 1990. Notable corrective measures are a tight control over public sector wages, an
increase in public sector prices, and the creation of a cash management committee to manage Central
Government finances on a cash-only basis. In March 1991, a second wave of structural measures were
adopted ranging from trade, financial, and labor market reforms to privatzation.
5.    Under the Rights Acumuation Program (RAP) agreed with the International Monetary Fund
(IMP), the Government is committed to restore fiscal and monetary discipline during the performance
period (July 1991 to December 1992). To this end, the primary balance of the non-financial public
sector, which reached annual deficits exceeding 5 percent of GDP during 1987-89, has been improved
to a one-percent deficit in 1990 and a 0.4 percent surplus in 1991. In addition, the quasi-fiscal deficit
will be limited to a deficit in the neighborhood of 0.5 percent of GDP in 1991 and 0.3 percent of GDP
in 1992. In accordance with the projected increase of money supply required to purchase foreign
exchange reserves and to service the extemal debt of the Central Bank, the program assumes an average
monthly inflation rate of 5 percent for the second half of 1991, and a monthly average of 2.7 percent for
1992.
6.    The Government of Pew recognizes that the success of its stabilization policy requires not only
cuts in spending and a tightening of credit but also significant increases in tax revenues. To achieve the
latter objective, the Government has considerably simplified the tax system and taken drastic measures
to improve tax administration. The Government is also determined to maintain the tax contribution of
petroleum sector in real terms, and adjust public sector prices in line with expected inflation.
7.    In order to contain inflationary pressures, the curent stabilizationplan entails eliminatg the need
to print money for purely fiscal reasons. The removal of interest rate controls is also expected to boost
financial savings and improve the efficiency of its allocation. In general, the financial system will
increasingly be in the hands of the private sector. In this spirit, financial activities undertaken by official
development banks will be scrutinized and an action plan to privatize public sector commercial banks
implemented.

I. TIRE  ERNAL PNANCING PLAN
8.    As of December 1990, as much as twothirds of Peru's approximately US$22 billion extnal debt
was in arrears. The biggest share of these arrears was owed to commerial baniks and unguaranteed
suppliers (32 percent) and by the Paris Club creditors (31 percet) followed by International Financial
Instuti  (17 percent). The government took prompt steps to restore Peru's ties with the itrnational
community by resuming current debt service payments to the Bank (October 1990) and the IDB
(November 1990). The current debt service payments to the IM had already been started by the
previous adminision in September 1989. The total monthly debt service payments to all three IPIs
is about US$41 million, or 14% of fiscal revenues.
9.    The Government, with the support of its major creditors has put in place a threestage debt work-
out. The first stage, which entails the clearance of arrears with multilateral creditors, has already started.
The second stage was initiated in September 1991 with Peru's rescheduling of its official bilateral debt
with the Paris Club. The last stage covers the negotiations with commercial bans. Ihe success of the
financing plan rests on four key ftors. FirEl Peru must comply with the fiscal-monetary targets under
the IMP program and Implement the structurd reforms agreed upon with the IDB and the World Bank.
Second Peru must fulfill its current debt service obligations to multilateral creditors. Tibrd. the support
group should provide financing to cover the 1991-92 gap estmated at US$0.7 billion. EQJrth Peru must
abide by the terms of the rescheduling of Paris Club debts.
Muliltwl Crelms
10. In order to clear Its arrears to multilateral creditors, Peru will rely on bridge loans against
disbursements bqy hese instdiu    as well as its own balance of payments efforts. The learance of
ars owed to the IDB took place on September 13, 1991. Ihe finaning of this clearance was made
possible by the disbursement of a US$325 million loan to Peru from the Latin American Resve Fund
(FLAR). On septemter 18, the IDB approved a Trade Sector Adjustment Loan of US$425 milion.
Furthermore, MIB's planned additional lending to Peru will consist of one sector loan and four project
loans. The former loan will support the fnancial sector reforms and the projects loans wIll cover the
areas of Electricity, Healtg, Sanitation, and Roads. Total comminments under these loans could reach
up to US$1.1 billion, while disbursements prior to the end of the performance period could total between
US$700 to 800 million.
11.   On September 12, 1991 the IMP approved a 16-month Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) to
support Peru's adjustment program. Provided the macroecnomic taugets of the program are met, this
scheme will allow Peru to build up rights towards a fully back-loaded disbursement following the
clearance of arrears. At the end of the program, remaining arrears can be cleared with a bridge loan
aganst the IMF post-clearance disbursement Total nghts to be acmulated during the program, which
-ire equal to total arrears, amount to SDR625 million.
12.   The World Bank's contribution to Peru's exteral financing will come through its newly adopted
policy for countries with proted arrears. Under this policy, which the World Bank Board has
approved for Peru, countries are entited to *contingent disbursements" during a pre-clearance
"performance" period. Accumulated disbursements are released after the clearance of ares. The
government of Peru expects this sheme to be applied to three loans: Trade, Structural Adjustment and
Financial sector. The Trade Policy Refom Loan of US$300 million has already been presented to the

Page 4 of 16
World Bank Loan Committee in December 1991. We expect the Structural Adjustment Loan to be
submitted to the Board by late March 1992, and the Financial Reform Loan in June 1992. Togetier,
these three loans could generate disbursement claims of US$900 million.
lliEbra Credtors:
13. Following the IMF's approval of the RAP, Peru obtained a significant debt relief from its Paris
Club credrs. As of Decembt 1990, arrears owed to these creditors accounted for 36 percent of the
total. The debt relief granted to Peru took the form of rescheduling, deferment of moratorium interest,
and deferment of post-cutoff date arrears. The cutoff date of January 1, 1983 was retained for the Paris
Club agreement, and post-cutoff date arrears were deferred to te year 2002.
Cammercla Banks:
14.   About 90% of Peru's US$5.6 billion debt owed to commercial banks is past due. In reaction to
law suits brought by these banks, the Government has promised to renounce recourse to statute-of-
limitations provisions in exchange for a suspension of default proceedings that were initiated in Febnry
1990. We believe that under the current circumstances, debt service payments to commercial creditors
is not feasible. For this reason, the IMF program assumes that no payments on medium- and long-term
debt to these creditors will b3 made except for short-term trade credits and non guaranteed private
creditors which Peru is expected to service fully.
iironmr.ent for Private Sector Avty
15.   The PerAvin Govenment is determined to create a more favorable environment for private sector
activity and is taking concrete steps to encourage the inflow of foreign private capital and technology as
to accelerate the development of Peru's mineral and petroleum resources. To shis end, the Government
has decided to move expeditiously to resolve some of the oustanding problems in this area-such as, for
example, the payment of adequate and effective compensation to certain affected foreign enterprises and
investrs-which have adversely affected the investment climate. In this connection, the Government has
already negotiated the basic framework of an agreement with American International Group (AIG),
representing a group of insurance compaes, which should resolve their claim against the property of
PETROMAR, and facilitate the association and involvement of a qualified foreign private company in
the efficient utilization and expansion of petroleum production. The Government intends to implement
this agreement - and similar agreements with other companies - expeditiously. The support of
multlateral instiuons such as the World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development Bank for
these policies and initatives will be essential in order to create a more propitious environment for private
business and investment
16.   Given the scenario outlined above, Peru is confronted with financing requirements of about
US$18.8 billion for the two-year period 1991-1992. To meet these requirements, we expect debt relief
to account for US$ 15.1 billion, the rest being provided by the FLAR (USSO.4 billion), the support group
(US$0.7  billion), and by multilarl creditors (US$2.6 billion) through post clearance renewed
disbursements. The FLAR component and the first tranche of the 1DB loan have already been disbursed.
As far as the World Bank and the IM  are conced, disbursements are expected in December 1992.

The support group was officially established on June 7, 1991, under the co-leadership of the U.S. and
Japan. As of August 1991, commitmens pledged by this group totalled US$1.1 billion and disbursements
are expected to take place through the end of 1992. About 61 percent of these disbursements will be pure
balance of payment support and the remaiing 39 percent are devoted to non-programmed fiscal
expenditures or grants channeled directy to NGOs.
m.     =PROCESS OF    LO    ANARATZON  miMD :U!S aEARANlCE IWllTE  OI
BANK
17.   The Government of Peru recognizes that the presentation to the Board of the Stuctural
Adjustment Loan ha is requested requires that the following conditions have been met:
(a)   the Bank's agreement to the macroeconomic stabilization program outlined in this
letter (and agreed with the If).
(b)   the adoption of an Extenal Finaning Plan, endorsed by international financial
institutions and the support group, which is consistent with the clearance of all arrears
to the Bank and the normalization of Peru's reltions with the IW and the IlB;
(c)   the Bank's agreement with the structura reforms presented in this letter; and
(d)   Pem remaining current or .ts servicing of debt to the Bank currently falling due (other
than debt covered und. (b) above), on tems already agreed between the
Govemment and the Banm
18. The Government of Peru acknowledges that in assessing the adjustment program, the World Bank
will be using the following indicators for 1992: Cental Government tax revenues should be about 9.0
percent of GDPP; the primary deficit of the non-financial public sector should be about 0.6 percent of GDP
and the domestic financing of the Consolidated Public Sector Balance should be negligible; from
December 30th, 1991 to December 30, 1992 the rate of creation of monetary base should be about 40
percent of GDP and by December 30th, 1992 the stock of other Central Bank monetary liabilities in Soles
should not exceed 0.1 times the monetary base.
19.   The Government of Peru is filly aware that the loan will not be signed right after its approval
by the World Bank's Board.  The loan's signate and effectiveness will come only after the
'performance period" and the World Bank's recogniton that Peru has successfully implementd the
macroeconomic adjustment program as well as the Structural Adjustment Loan presented in this letter.
The "performance" period would not end before December, 1992, and would follow the time span of the
IW's RAP. In addition to implementing these reforms, the Government is committed to supply the Bank
with all the information required for the monioring of the program and its reporting to the Board. The
specific information and the frequency at which it should be made available to the Bank are described in
the attached Appendix.B.
20.   The Goverment of Pemu recognizes its commitmen to continue to ser Ace debt falling past due
to the Bank with an equal ntrea    of the IMF and the World Bank regarding debt servicing. Prior to
the signature of the loan, arrears to the World Bank would need to be completely cleared. The



- 81 -
ANNEX4
Page 6 of 16
Government of Peru fuirther understands that, in the event a lapse of time occurred between signing and
effeciveness, effectiveness would require that during this period the Bank continue to be fully satisfied
with the implementation of the macroeconomic adjustmet, the exteal finmcing plan, and the adjustment
program, as described by this letter.
IV. TM GOVERNM   SMUC ADlUSNT REORMS
21.   The Government of Peru considers that structr  reforms will reinforce the credibility and
effectiveness of the stabilization program. We are therefore working very closely with the Bank in
designing a reform package which include international trade reform, fiscal adjustment, privatization and
deregulation, and financial sector reform.
TheTde Reform Prgam
22.   The foremost objectives of the trade reform program are to remove the import substitution bias
and induce a more efficient use of domestic resources. This program is also expected to provide an
welcomed impetus to technical progress. The elimnation of multiple exchange rates has been a major
step in this direction by eliminating import tariff implicit in differential exchange rates. In August 1990,
the Government unified the exchange rate under a freely floating exchange rate regime and liberalized
both current and capital account transactions. Under the World Bank Trade Policy Reform Loan, the
Government of Peru has agreed to maintain the convertibility of local currency at a single rate. The
Government has also moved towards more uniform tariff structure by reducing considerably the number
of different rates. By March 1991, only two low rates of 15 and 25 percent were used, with the former
rate covering as much as 81% of tariff positions.
Fiscal
23.   As of July 1990, the finances of the public sector in Peru were in tot disarray. One indication
of this is that tax revenues accounted for only 6.4 percent of GDP compared to 14 percent in the mid
1970s and early 1980s. Because the decline in revenues was not matched a similar reduction in
expenditures the non-financial public sector deficit increased from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1985 to 7.9
percent in the first semester of 1990. This was compounded by the operational losses of the Central Bank
resulting from its financial subsidies. The current administration bas taken corrective measures to
simultaneously increase revenues and contain expenditures. On the revenue front, public sector prices
were adjusted and the tax system improved. Corrective measures taken to contain expenditures include
a combination of tight controls upon public sector wages and the postponement of public investments.
24.   Under the Structura Adjustment L , the Government has agreed to improve the efficiency of
its tax administration. By October 31,1992, the Government and the Bank will jointy review taxes on
exports, and bank current account debits and interest to assess the prospects of phasing them out within
a specific timetable. The tax administraton agency (SUNAI) will improve the quality of its personnel
and modernize its equipments. These changes will facilitate the envisaged monitoring of a larger sample
of taxpayers. The program is reforming the Peruvian public sector, redefining the scope of Government
activities and changing policies related to its personel management.

25.    he cnsiderbl interest that the Govement of Peru places in the social mpont of this
program is due to the conjunction of two factors. Ei. sundards of living have deteriorated very fast
in the past five years hence compoudgthe structu  poverty and skewed income distibution. A
testimony to this worsening is the decline in the proportion of the population in Lima under the poverty
line was 44 percent in 1990. Second the adjustment from an unsustable economic siuation, more
often than not, has a significant sociad cost. For this reason, we understand the need to design policies
to ptct the most vulnerable groups. Furthemore, this will ensure the political sustainablity of the
reforms. To this end, the Govenment has created the National Fund for Social Compensation and
Development (FONCODES) to chnd       resources to labor iesive projects targeted to the poorest
segment of the population including in the areas of basic health and education services.
26.   In the context of the requested Structural Adjustment Loan, the Govetnment will develop a
poverty alleviation strategy and implementationschedule, outlinmgpolicies, identifying priorityprograms
for arget groups. As far as primary health and mtition are concened, the Government will design and
submit to the Bank profies for priority projects, prepare a national mntrition policy, and review the
aesting food aid program in order to undertake the first stage of its reform. Priority projecls for basic
education also need to be idendfied with a corresponding implementation schedule.
Privdzafon
27.   This is a case in which stuctural roms are expected to direcdy conibute to the stabilization
program tough the tmporary revenue gains and the simplificatio of fiscal maagemn. In March
1991, the president issued a Supreme Decree which authorized the procedure s for the prvatizaton of
23 companies. Ibis was followed by a legislative decree defining the legal and instiutional frmework
for the overal privaion program. In order to facilite the privatization process, a Commission under
the direct supenrision of the President was created. Ihe additional reforms to be implemented under the
World Bank Structural Adjustment Loan will consist of settng reglatoy frameworks for specific sectors
which define the policies to be followed.
28.   The agricutural sector has greatly benefitted from the unification of the exchange rate as well as
the liberalization and deregulation of all domesdc and foreign trade. In line with its commiment to rely
on market meanisms, the Government of Peru has abolished a stateowned rice markeig monopoly
and land has been allowed to be transferred and used as collateral. In addition, credit subsidies granted
by the Banco Agrario will be eliminated. Under the terms of the Strucral Adjustment ILan, the
Govemen is committed not to reverse the provisions related to the refom of land tenure, agricultural
commercialization and credit, water usage, trade and labor policy siroduced in Legisative Decree No.
653. In addition, the Government plans to reform  agricultural ibnitutons with more activities shifted
to the prvate sector. Other measures iclude specific wazr pricing studies to be conducted by the
Ministry of agriculte.



- 83 -
Page 8 of 16
29.   In the context of the overal structr reorms, a more flexible labor regulaon is a prerequisite
for the  pected gains in resource alocation in the goods market to materialize. Moreover, the
restrictiveness of labor nmuket reulations in Peru has artificially raised the efective cost of labor in the
formal sector hence cotruting to the shifting of reource towards the informal sector and impeding
Perm's intrational competitiveness. In order to increase the flexibility of labor markets, the Government
has issued a Decree allowing, under most circum , for fixed-term conract for all sectors. The
causes for jusdfied dismissals have also been redefed to facilitate justified dismissals. The Goverment
has also extended the probationary employment period from three month to one year. Under the
Structural adjustment Loan, the Government is committed to maintain all policy changes described above.
Socal aSecuty
30.   ln reaction to the difficlties facing the autonomous body (IPSS) which adminsters Peru's social
security system, the new Government has initiated a reduction of the staff of IPSS, the removal of the
ceiling on taxable income, and the elimination of most deductions. The system of compulsory deposit
and collection of IPSS funds at Banco de la Nacion has also bee eliminated. Under the present system,
official and private banks have to compete for these fimds by making monthy bids. In the spirit of the
emphasis on privaization, the Government has already issued a Decree dtat would allow privaiuaton of
an important part of the social security system. Forthcoming policies include periodic independent
auditing of the of the IPSS and a reduction of its staff by an additional 7,000.
V3.  ONIDIUNGM OF THE ADJUSrNT AND SM UClTURAL wRultMS AND T
EINANCING 
31.   The Goverment will provide to the Bank the information necessary to follow the evolution of
the macroeconomic policy as well as all components of the Structural Adjustment Loan. The nature and
frequency of specific information to be transmitted are descnbed in Appendix B.
VI.  OCSN
32.   The structural reforms outlined in this letter have either been implemented, are bein
implemented, or will be implemented in the near future. The Government of Peru undestands that these
policies will be the basis for Peu's position in any international negotiation related to the components
of the Stuctral Adjustment Loan. Furthermore, in the event these negotiations give rise to a legal
instument, the Government understands that the Bank could request the relevant inomation in order to
assess its impact on the program agreed in this letter.

PRE ATJZATMON STRATEY 3Y SECTOR
1.     SAL conditionality for privatization states that:
*   The Government will implement policies defined in the institutional framework for
privatization (established in Decree 674) by June 30. 1992.
*   The Government will develop an overall action plan and implementation schedule
acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank for divestiture in the banling, fishery
(including Flopesca, Pescaperu, Epsep, and CERPER), and mining sectors (including
Minero Peru, Centromin Peru, and Hierro Peru) by June 30. 1992.
*   The Government will develop a policy framework acceptable to the Borrower and the
Bank, including an implementation schedule for private sector participation in: (i) oil
exloration, refining, and distribution; (ii) gas production and distribution; (iii) power
generation, transmission, and distribution; (iv) telecommunications; (v) transportation
(railways, ports, and air transport); and (vi) waxer supply and sewage, by June 3Q
* The Gmvermment will develop a divestiture strategy acceptable to the Borrower and
the Bank, including an implementation schedule, for the sale of shares in all
companies where the Government is a minority shareholder. The Gwvernment should
bring to the point of sale at least 6 of these companies by December 31. 199Q
2.      The privatization strategy, outlined below by sector, was developed during preparation for
the SAL with the use of Japanese Technical Assistance funds, and is still evolving. This strategy,
when completed and found acceptable to the Bank and the Borrower, will be implemented under the
financial sector adjustment loan, the privatization adjustment loan (which will include the mining
sector, ydcarbonsand the fishery sector), the transport sector rehabilitation project, the water
sector rehabilitation loan, and the energy sector rehabilitation project.
L BANNG SECTOR
3.     In the banking sector the state is involved in: (a) five development banks; (b) Banco de
Ia Nacon - created in the mid 1970s to handle: the financal operstions of international trade, for
the administration of the external debt, and the collecdon of taxes - a task previously handled by the
private sector, (c) Inversiones Cofide - a second-tier bank to created to promote economic activitr,
(d) seven commercial banks in which the state controls more than 99 percent of the shares and which
colectively are referred to as the "Banca Asociada": Banco Popular del Pe,  lanco Continental,
Inteuc4 Banco Sur Medio y CaUao, Banco Nor-Peru, Banco Anazonico, aL  anco de Los Andes
and their subsidiaries; and (e) two commercial Banks with pnvate sector participaton but where the
state has a majcriiy control - Hipotecarlo and Banco de Comercio, which are referred to as the
"Banca Mbcta



- 99 -
Page 2 of 17
4.     Iu 1990, the state banb accounted fcr approximately 64 percent of the capital in the
financial system, 70 percent of the credit, and 61 percent of the deposits At the end of 1989, they
employed 72 percent of the employees in the sector. There is no reason for such extensive
participation in commercial banking when the relatively scarce fiacial and managerial talents of the
state could be better utilized elsewhere. The state banks cannot compete wth prvate sector banks
due to their discontinuity in management, overstaffing, and political influence in decision-making.
They have been especily affected by the tecent economic crisi, which has caused a general
deterioration in bank portfolios. To compensate for this deterioration, commercial banks have been
able to reduce their operational costs and increase their deposits through more aggresse competition
in the savings market. Tbe state-owned banks do not have the same flexibility to reduce costs and
their operations are perceived as more risy by depositors These features have led the state banks
to operate with higher interest-rate spreads allowing private commercial banks to increase their
profitability. It is also important to emphasize that: (a) the higher operationa  costs and interest rates
of the state-owned banks negatively affect aU economic activity through an unnecessary increase in
interest rates; and (b) the state is forced to make equity contnbutions or transfer subsidized deposits
to these institutions to save them from bankriptcy when their revues canmot cover these costs.
5.           The banks included in Banca Asociada are commercial bas expropriated for
economic and nationalitic reasons in the 1970s and 1980s. The most important banks in this group
are: Banco Popular del Pe, formerly owned by Grupo Pardo; Banco Continental, the former
Chase Manhattan Bank; Intrbanc, the former Chemica, Bank-, and their subsidianes. The Banca
Asociada has 45.8 percent of the branches and 46.0 percent of the employees of the commercial
banking sector but accounts for only 26.3 percent of the deposits and 20.2 percent of the placements
Informaton provided by the Superintendencia de Bancos y Seguros (SBYS) - the govement agency
responsible for the supervision of banking activities - indicates that in June 1991 4&0 percent of the
portfolios of these banks were in difficulty.
6.           The Banca Mixta includes Banco Hipotecarlo and Banco de Comerdo, in which the
state has a 74.2 percent and a 59.0 percent share, respectively. These banks have &1 percent of the
branches and 8.0 percent of the employees in the sector and account for 2.0 percent of the deposits
and 13 percent of the placements Information from SBYS indicates that 21.5 percent of their
portfolios were in difficulty.
Reeent Reforms and GOP strte
7.           GOP's commitment to the reform of the banking sector is evidenced by the inclusion
of Banco Popular del Peru, among the 23 companies designated for privatization in the March 1991
Presidential Decree No. 041, by the sale of the Government's 15 percent stake in Sopwlese Leasing
in June 1991, and especial by the issuance, on April 26, 1991, of Legislative Decroe No. 637, "LAy
General de Istituciones Bancuias, Fnancieras y de Seguros to state commercial banks from the
Central Bank" also referred to as the New Banking Law. This law also includes important measures
to improve the efficiency of the sector, including: (a) enlarging the scope of operations of commercial
banks, especially in the acquisition of shares and the issuance of bonds; (b) increasing the fisaliZation
power of the SBYS; and (c) establishing rules for the autoizaton of new financial institutions In
addition, the law cals for a restructunng of Banco de la Nacion and the Banca Asociada, to bring
about a downsizing and greater productivity and efficienc of these institutions in six months. On

* AN N
Page 3 of 17
September 27, 1991 tie GOP issued the Legilative Decree No. 674 establishing the legal and
institutional framework for privatization, and following that, the President of COPRI officially invited
the IFC to implement the privatization of Baneo Popular del Peru. In February 1992, the GOP
began the prepaatory procedures for the privatization of Banco de Comerdo.
Stratv for Reform
&           The privatization of the Banca Asociada and Banca Mbcta, a major step in
restructuing the sector, should simutaneously reduce the fiscal burden on the state and enlarge GOP
revenues through the sale of assets.
9.          The GOP will appoint a Special Committee for Banking Privatization in accordance
with the new institutional framework for privatization, since the restructuring cr privatization of one
bank will affect all the others, and the portfolio of non-performing loans - the most important issue
in bank privatization - could be minimized by global management. The committee should be headed
by someone of prominence with the skdll to successfuly lead negotiations between the Govemnment
and the private banks The main tasks of the comiTittee will be to: (a) minimize losses by designing
an effective mechanism for the collection of bad and doubtful loans; (b) minimize the social cost of
adjustment by softening the impact of employee reductions; (c) design and implement a strategy for
the privatization of each of the banks in Banca Asociada and Banca Mixta; (d) recruit consultants to
audit and appraise the banks; (e) renew the consultants valuations and set mnmum prices; (f)
recruit legal advisers; (g) define criteria for the pre-qualification of potential buyers; (h) prepare al
the necesay documents for the offer, (i) organize the auctions; and G) supervise the legal and
administrative procedures for the tasfer of the banks to their new owners.
10.         The reason for the GOP's decision to start the privatization process in the banking
sector with Banco Popular del Peru (BPP), whose privatization was announced in the Legislative
Decree No.041 of March 1991, probably was BPP's poor financial performance and the imminent
prospect of an equity contnrbution to save it from bankruptcy. With 199 branches, the bank operates
in almost every important city of the country, has 3,600 employees, and holds 3.2 percent of the
deposits. It has an operation in Bolivia with 18 agencies, and subsidiaries that should attract the
private sector. Among these subsidiaries is Peruinvest, a non-bank financial institution, mainly
invohled in leasing, which is to be granted a ful commercial bank license as part of the prvatization
process. Besides these few good assets, BPP has a bad portfolio, an eccessive iabor force, and a
tradition of a poor management made worse by recent exodus of qualified staff driven away by low
wages and uncertainty about the bank's future.
11.         BPP should be trans&feed to the private sector in its entirety. If part of it remains
under state control, there wfll certaily be continuing losses since it does not have the appropriate
staff or management to handle banking operations. The steps i BPP's pnvatzation should be: (a)
the administrative supervision of BPP's management to ensure that the required reports for
privatation are prepared accurately and on schedule, and that the present monthly operational loss
of more than US$2.0 million is stopped; (b) the transfer of the bad and doubtful loan portfolio to
Banco de la Nacion; (c) the implementation of downsizing plan through the sale of some assets to
private investors; (d) a guarantee that all the proceeds from GOP capitalization and the sale of assets



- 101 -
AMNEX 8
Page 4 of 17
will be used for risk-free operations and not to increase BPP's credits; and (e) the transfer to the
private sector of the downsized BPP.
12.         Since the privatization of BPP has no assurance of success a privatization failure or
a pubhic impression of an underpiced sale could serously erode public support for pdvatization.
Consequently, the privatization program should simultaneously include other banks more likely to
attract private investorsm This will (a) give the committee some leeway to negotiate the transfer of
part of the bad portfolio to private banis; (b) strengthen the credibility of the privatization program
among private investors by the transfer of banks that do not have cash problems; (c) speed up the
process of improvmg the effciency of the financial sector; and (d) increase GOP's revenue in the
short run.
13.         Prnvatization should proceed with the transfer of Banco de Comercio and Interbanu.
GOP has 59 percent of the shares in Banco de Comerclo, a smaU bank with 1.3 percent of total
deposits, 41 branches, 682 employees, and the best portfolio among the state-owned banks. The sale
of GOP shares in Banco de Comerdo to the private sector should be designed with the sole objective
of bringing in revenues. The case of Interbanc is somewhat different. Interbauc is fully owned by
GOP, has 209 branches and 3,400 employees, and holds 42 percent of total deposits. The objective
of Interbanc's privatization should not be solely to increase revenues for, in addition, privatization
presents an important opportunity for the GOP to: (a) stimulate the development of the capital
market; and (b) increase competition by transforming Ilterbac into an independent bank owned not
by a single group but by several investors. The committee should examine the feasibility of this
alternative with the help of consultants.
14.         The privatization committee should determine, in discussions with private investors,
the best timing for privatizing the remaining state-owned commercial banks - Banco Nor-Peru, Danc
del Sur Medio y Callao (Surmebanc), Baumo de los Andes, Banco Amazonico, and GOP's stake in
Bano H}potecario. These banks have a combined total of 170 branches and approximately 4,800
employees. The main target of privatization here should be to increase the GOP's revenue.
15.         As the final stage in the privatization of the Banca Asociada and Banca Mixta, the
GOP should start the privatization of Banco Contntl, the largest state-owned bank, with 8.5
percent of total deposits, 123 branches, and 3,300 employees. As in the case of Interbanc, the target
should be not only a revenue increase but also the spread of ownership among many groups of
investors and the development of the capital market.
16.         Once the strategy outlined has been approved by the GOP, implementation should
proceed under the Special Committee for Banking Privatization. The Bank will support the
committee with Japanese Grant Funds to recruit consultants to audit and appraise BPP; and prepare
specific privatization strategies for Banco de Comerdo and Interbc. The Bank wil also advise the
GOP in the analysis of alternative means to utlize debt-equity conversion in bank privatization and
in the design and implementation of ESOP schemes.

17.         The maine waters off Peru are among the richest fhing grounds wn the world, and,
prior to the 1970s, made Peru one of the world's top fishing nations. However, the sector has
decHned sigificantly over the last 20 years as a result of increased state intervention and the advere
effects of El Nito, the warm water current of 1972-73 that decimated the important anchioveta catch.
The sector, wich is export oriented, provided 15.8 percent of Peru's exports in 1989. Currently, it
employs 6.4 percent of the bbor force. The primary product is fishmeal, and the Government
accounts for 37 percent of the production. Despite its rich resource, Peru controls only 17 percent
of the world market for fish products Overall efficiency in the sector is low, with an average fish to
fishmeal ratio of 5.13:1, compared with the worldwide average of 4.7&1. Government involvement
has been one of the major obstacles in the sectoes development, particularly because of unfair
ompetition with private initiave and iefficient management, which has hurt competitveness in
international trade.
I&          The state controls tve enterprses in the sector. The largest, Pemperu, was created
in the early 1970s and soon thereafter acqured a monopoly in the fishmeal industry through the
akver of 99 fishmeal plants The company presently is losing US$140 for every ton of fishmeal
produced. It produces lower quality products than Chile from the same raw materials, and therefore
receives 10 to 20 percent lower prices for its fishmeaL The company is highly inefficient, with over
1,000 excess employees. It presently owns 20 operational prcesing units, 16 redundant units, 1
guano fertilizer  plant, and 4 oil referies. Seven of its plants coud bandlce 70 percent of its capacity.
19.         Another major state-owned enterprise i Epsep, which was given the monopoly of fish
distution in 1970 to ensure the supply of fish, especially to low-income groups. The GOP has
continued to support Epsep, despite its lsses, because of the company's social role. Audits from
1980 to 1988 revealed nonprofitable investments, uncontroled expenses, and poor centralized
management of the operational units. Epsps major source of supply was a Soviet fleet that turned
over 17.5 percent of its catch under a contract that was certaly unfavorable because it does not
reflect the opporunity cost of the catch. Epsep is overstaffed, with 1,100 worbers where 400 are
estimated to be adequate. In the mid 1980s, the GOP set up Eopescs, as a subsidiary to Epsep, with
a fleet of fishing boats that wud supply the domestic market with rozen fish. Ti company has
never generated a profit and is now in liquidation. Copes, a mixed company, was created in 1974
between Epsep, rep ing the Government, and Star Kist, a private tuna canning company. It has
been managed unilateraly by Epsep during the lst five years, when it has suffered severe losses; in
1988 these totalled US$7.8 million. The fifth state enterprise is Cerper, a priately owned firm
xpropriated in 1970 and given a monopoly over fisr- product certification. Its manageral and
financial condition has steadily deteriorated over the lasL few years
Recent Reforms and GOP Sratm
20.          The GOP recently has made some important changes in the sector, putting an end
to Epsep's monopoly of fish distributon and Pescperls monopoly of fishmeal production. It has

also begun a partial selling off of the assets of Pescaperp, and authorizd the liquidation of Flopescs
m Supreme Decree 002-92, on January 29, 1992. Epsep has cancelled the contract with the Soviet
fleet. Maitime work has been liberalized, allowmng for a decrease in the cost of port sennces which
have been among the most expensive in the world. A new fisheries law has been drafted. Many of
the Goverment's broad reforms, including liberalization of exports and foreign imnestment
opportunities and the abolition of export taxes, have encouraged the development of pnvate sector
participation. However, continuing privatization will depend on a resolution of the following issues:
(a) LIabo - Fishing crews, chosen by fishemen's unions rather than boat owners, are entitled to 40
percent of the value of the catch, a practice certain to deter new vessels carrying heavy financial
obligations Another problem is that plant employment is considered permanent rather than seasonal,
resulting in ecess costs for the plants. (b) Regaatory Framework - Development is inhibited by
cumbersome regulations and adminstrative units that slow the process of issuing iicenses to the
private sector. The Ministry, ighbly overstaffed with 6,000 employees, 60 percent of whom work in
Lima, needs to be streamlined. Succsful privatization will require the establishment of the Special
Committee for Fshery Pvatation and a regulatory fmeork that can control overfishing and the
granting of fihing concessions so as to ensure equitable competition among private investor
Stoately for Reform
21.         Ihe GOP's privatization strategy covers the following plans: (a) Pescaperu will be
transferred to the private sector through an employee buyout that wM give the workers an
opportumty to manage the compaWn, (b) Flopea is being liquidated and its fishing boats are being
sold to private investors, (c) the privatization of Copes wil depend upon an agreement with the

inefficiently and at a loss, turned over to privt initativeu The company wll be divested of its fishing
vese  and about 90 percent of its transport fleet, which will be sold to its employees  The
alternative of liquidating this company will also be assessed. Cerper will lose its monopoly over
certification, particularly for exports, and retain only its role of inpection and quality controL The
Bank and the GOP will develop a firm-by-firm divestiture strategy, including action plans and
timetables for their implementation.

22.         The mining sector is a major component of the Peruvi  economy, contnbuting 12
percent of GDP and 50 percent of total exports, and its poor performance in recent years therefore
has had a significant impact. The three principal state-owned companies - Minero Pru, Centomnd,
Hiervo Pe-u, and their subsidiaries - are responsible for 93 percent of copper concentrate production,
40 percent of lead production, 38 percent of zinc production, and 100 percent of iron ore production.
Production declined by 25 percent in the second half of the 1980s, during which time the overal net
investment was negative Inadequate investment has inhibited the expansion of production and

exploration as well as the ability to repair and replace equipment. At present, the major mining
companies are operatig at an average of 75 percent of their installed capacity.
Recent RefrMs and GOP Strategy
23.         The GOP has recognized that the immediate revival of the sector is essential and will
only be possible with the involvement of the private sector. On July 13, 1991, the GOP issued
Legative Decee No. 647 authizing private sector ownership of a minimum of 51 percent of the
shares in Miner. Pero, CeStromI  and Hierro Peru through an mcrease of capital that would
provide pnvate investors with the majority stake. This decree was recently rejected by Congress, but
ptivatizaton program in mining is continuing under Legislative Decree No. 674, which establisbed
a broader legal and institutional framework for the overal privatization.
24.         Reiulatory Framework- Te GOP has taken several steps to attract private mvestors.
A new mining law, issued by Decree No. 708 in November 1991, provides for equal treatment of
public and prvate enterprses, support of market forces to encourage economic efficiency, elimination
of mechanims that inhibit investors, allowance of joint ventures, and the free commercialization and
ownership of gold. A new investment law includes guarantees that foreign investors will be able to
remit diviends abroad.
25.         Institutional Structure- INGEMMET, the public research and technology agency, has
been reorganized to investigate and generate basic information for the sector, as recommended by
the Bank. More than two million hectares of land previously reserved for the public sector have been
released to the private sector. Over the next six months the total reserves are to be reduced by 18
percent. The General Directorate of Mines (DGM) has begun a process of reform but has not yet
achieved much progress. The personnel have been reduced from 150 to 60, but DGM is in need of
significant streamlining and modernization, to more efficiently fulfill its role as the regulatory body
in charge of supervision, planning, and promotion in the sector. It has acquired computer information
systems, without proper planning that do not adequately match its needs.
Stratefy for Reforn
26.          Rapid prwatization is essential, given the deterioration of the mIning companies, and
the Special Committee for Mining Privatization should be created as soon as possible, in accordance
with the Privatization Decree. To ensure that they are operatie when privatized, the companies
should immediately transfer to the private sector services that are not essential; drastically reduce
administrative costs; layoff of redundant workers, with compensation; consolidate the activities of
Mhpeco, which provides marketing sertices to the state mining companies, with Centromn  and
Minero Peru; and examine the liabilities of Mipeco to determine which obligations wil be
transferred to the private sector and which wil be assumed by the Central Government. Potential
investors will require information on each enterprise in a form consistent with international staniards
to include: financial statements prepared by auditors; a professional opinion on the legal procedures
required for privatization; and details of geological reserves, present state of mining operations,
envronmental impact of operations, and mmimum potential of the mines In the final stages, the
actual transfer will require the assistance of an investment banker.

ANNEX 8
Page 8 of 17
27.         Although the GOP has made significant progress in developing an adequate regulatory
framework for private sector mvestment, a number of changes are still required. Among these are
the removal of all distinctions between small, medium, and large companies; and the establishment
of a tax package that will eliminate excessive dependence on indirect taxes and promote efficiency.
DGM should be restructured as a modern and efficient organization for allocating, directing, and
controlling mining nghts. It should acquire adequate software and hardware support for the cadastre
and related activities of control and statistics to ensure prompt and smooth attention to all requests
and transfers. INGEMMEr should focus on reducing the size and complexity of its organizational
structure and improving the ratio of technical personnel to administrators from the present 70:30 to
90:10 or 85:15.
28.         Environment - Mining is a major source of pollution in Peru, which the regulatory
framework and the practices of the companies do little to address. The privatization strategy should
include environmental audits as part of the technical preparation for transfer. Based on these audits,
the sales agreements should contain provisions for cleaning up major environmental problems and
an understanding that new environmental standards with which the new owners would be expected
to comply may be introduced.
29.         Centromin -  is company should be privatized as rapidly as possible, since its
financial situation is alarming as demonstrated by the growth of its current debt to US$74 million in
18 months. Priority should be given to the transfer of the company and to keeping it in operation
until then. Centromind should not be sold as a whole but in distinct segments attractive to the privat-
sector. These should have a solid economic base, and should be flexible enough for successful
negotiation with potential investos Once it has been privatized, Centromin should take on the
functions of a holding company that would eventually combine with an equivalent holding company
to be developed for Minero Peru. Although the privatization program should attempt to mini mie
social costs, it should be made clear from the beginning that some plants will have to be closed and
others wil have their operations suspended until they can meet international enwronmental standards.
30.         Minero Peru - This company did experience a slight economic recovety in 1991, and
has embarked on a plan to reduce costs and augment production. Both local and foreign investors
have been invited to participate in the development of its projects. In accordance with the
Government decision to privatize Minero Peru, with Bank support, initiated the recruitment of
consultants to appraise the company.
31.         Hierro Peru - The privatization of Hierro Peru is underway. An international
consultant who commenced work in January 1992 is scheduled to provide a valuation of the company
within four months. The recent Bank mission reviewed the consultant's proposal and contract and
approved the scope of work In accordance with Bank guidelines, Hierm Peru has also selected the
bank that will assist in identifying buyers and preparing sales documents.

IV. OIL AND GAS
32.          The major state enterprse in this sector, Petrperu, is responsible for 54 percent of
Peruvian oil production and for supervising the remang 46 percent by foreign companies under
concesson agreements Pe1or is also responsible for 100 percent of refining and distribution.
As a result of the GOP's insbility to provide sufficient capital investment, the reserves and production
of hydrcarbons are presently at 50 percent and 65 percent of their respective 1982 levels and Peru
has become a net importer.
Recent Reforms and GOPrat
33.          The GOP has taken some significant steps to initiate the privatization process.
Petropers 84 gasoline stations have been proposed for sale to the private sector, and the contracting
out of exploration and development has been increased. In addition, a money-losing fertilizer plant
has been closed and 1,500 eccess Petroperu employees have been laid off.
Slraltq for Reform
34.          The revWal of this sector will depend on the establisment of a regulatory framework
that will attract private sector partcipation in the refining and distribution of oiL The first area of
reform wil have to be the revision of the pricing policy for petroleum products  Ex-refinery
petroleum prices need to be increased to reach parity with international border prices. The present
system in which the GOP subsidizes Pecboes operating deficits will have to be changed. A second
area of reform must be the resruucuing and deregulation of the hydrocarbon sector that will require:
(i) legislation to remove barriers to the entry of the private sector, (ii) sale of 25 percent of the
storage capacity of Peropeu to the prvate sector, (iu) freeing of exports and imports of crude oil
and petroleum products and of refining, and (*v) rationalization of taxation policies and insurance.
35.          The third area of reform is a divestiture strategy for Petropu. If the GOP decides
on a partial divestiture, it must defie the core business to be retained and the non-core business to
be spun off or divested. Among the functions that should certainly be removed are the regulatory
responsibilities for exploration and development - which should be transferred to the Directorate of
Hydrocarbons within the Ministry of Energy and Mines. An adequate regulatory framework for
private sector participation in gas production and distnbution is necessary for the privatization of
SoAP
36.          Petrma has presented for Bank review bidding documents for consultants to conduct
the valuation and an invetment bank to assist in the transfer of the company to the private sector.
However, it is unclear what the GOP is planing to do with Petromars liabilities and employees.
Pe_trmar, which operates the offshore oil fields in the Talara region, was created in 1986 when Belco
was nationalized.

37.         Solgas, which controls about 40 percent of the LPG distrbution market and competes
wnth three prvate firms, has selected firms to conduct a valuation. The success of privatization will
depend on the adjustment of ex-refinery LPG prices, as mentioned above.
38.         Petrolen Transoceca, a shipping company fully owned by Petroperu, has the
monopoly of oil transport, with four petroleum-product tankers. The strategy agreed upon by the
Bank and the GOP entails the sale of the company as a whole, with a provision that Petroperu would
continue to use the tankers for another year under terms to be included in the bidding documents
inviting offers from private investors. The next step will be the recruitment of consultants to prepare
the valuation of the company.
V. POM
39.         There are 11 state-owned companies in the power sector.  Electroperu, its
subsidiaries, and the provncial government enterprises account for 70 percent of electricity
production and distribution. (The rest is accounted for by private firms.) The power sector is facing
its deepest crisis in decades. The standard of service has deteriorated noticeably in the last few year,
with frequent and lengthy intenruptions in supply, low reliability, and a high level of losses. The
installed capacity of 2,785 MW is far short of the increasing demand. Since nationalization of all
private concessionaires in 1972, the generation and distribution of power has been placed under the
authority of Electropem  Efficient operation has been inhibited by. monopolistic and centralied
operation; the absence of an independent regulatoty body, pricing policies inconsistent with economic
principles; and a lack of corporate autonomy and accountability.
Recent Reforms and GOP Strateg
40.         In February 1991, the GOP passed Law No. 25304 authorizing the participation of
private investors in the power sector, as autoproducers, coproducers, concessionaires, BOT scheme
investors, etc. In July 1991, Legislative Decree No. 649 authorized the sale of the GOP's stake in
regional power companies. This legislation became effective in December 1991, and the GOP will
issue the relevant regulations by March 15 1992. Although the new legislation, which the Bank
reviewed prior to issuance, still requires some improvements, it does provide important changes and
allows for modenuzation of the sector.
Strategv for Reform
41.         The privatization strategy begins with Electrolima, the largest power distnbutor and
the second largest generator after Electroperu. The functions of Electroperu will be redefined in the
Energy Sector Reform and Rehabilitation Loan under preparation by the Bank Among the projects
of private sector investment to be evaluated and supported by the Bank are: (i) the privatization of
E:lectrolia (iC) the seling of the Federal Govemment's minority stake in the regional power
companies; and (iii) a Build-Own-Operate scheme for power generation for the Ima area proposed



- 108 -
ANNEX 8
Page 11 of 17
by a private group of investors In the power sector, as in telecommuncatons, water and sewerage,
and eventually transport, the establishment of a regulatory agency will be necessary. Because of the
scarcity of human and fiancial resources m the country, the Bank will analyze the altemative of uing
a single regulatory agency for all these sectors.
VL TELECOMMUNICATIONS
42.          Two companies provide telephone serce in Peru: Entel, which controls all regional
phone operations as well as all long-distance and international services; and CPT, which manages the
Lima metropolitan area. Entel, which is 100 percent state-owned, was created in 1969 to absorb
services previously provided by Government commissions or foreign companies that were nationalized.
CPT, which was created in 1970 when IT&T was nationalized, is mainly subscnrber owned (69 percent
of shares), with the Govemnment holding 21 percent of the remaining shares and private shareholders
holding 10 percent. Recently, cellular phone serce has been introduced as a joint venture between
CPT and the private sector. The service provided by the state-owned companies compares very
poorly with semce in other countnes. There are presently 2.6 telephone lines per 100 of the
population, compared with 10.2 per 100 in Argentina and 9.1 in Venezuela The GOP has set a
target for increasing the number of telephone lines to 10 per 100 citizens by the year 2000, a project
that would cost US$35 billion over the next 9 years and require the services of expenenced
nternational telephone operators.
Rent Reforms and GOP Strat
43.         The GOP is proposing to sell its 21 percent interest in CPT and a controlling interest
in Entel, to ensure new investments and improve efficiency. The Bank supports this plan and has
provided three alternatives which the GOP is presently analyzing. (a) the sale of a controlling
interest in Entel and CPT separately to a consortium of private and/or foreign investors; (b) the
merger of Entel and CPT or alternatively offering a controlling interest in Entel and CPT jointly to
a consortium of private and/or foreign investors; (c) the creation of tw'v separate operating companies
- one including the northern part of Lima and the northern hin land provinces and a second
including the southern part of Lima and the southern hinterland provinces - and the offer of shares
to two different sets of private and/or foreign investors. The GOP has appointed a new president
of Entd to implement the privatization. In an attempt to overcome the opposition of CPT, the
remaining obstacle to pnvatization, the GOP has issued new by-laws for CPT under which a new
board will be elected in February.
44.          The GOP has recently issued a new Telecommunications Law, prepared with Bank
support, which will allow and stimulate private sector participation in telecommunications service.
45.          On November 5, 1991, the GOP issued Legislative Decree No. 685 to create a state
enterprise, Serpost, to replace the General Directorate of Correspondence as the body responsible
for postal service. The decree also prohibited monopoly of postal service and declared private
investment in the shares of Serpost to be of natonal interest.



- 109 -
ANNEX8
Page 12 of 17
Stategy for Reform
46.          A key element of the telecommunications legislation should be the establishment of
an independent regulatory agency to minimize political interference in the sector, to exercise public
oersight over private supply, to enforce the telecommunications law, and to promote the
Government's objectives in telecommunications. Because of the scarcity of human and financisl
resources in Peru, the Bank is analyzing the alternative of using a single regulatory agency for
telecommunications, power, transport, and water and sewerage. Another important legal aspect will
be the implementation of an equitable and clearly defined pricing policy.
47.         In the privatization of CPT and Entd, the main issue is the ability of the Ministry to
control CPT, whose President is withholding support for the program. The Government stake in
CPT is only 21 percent, which does not give it clear control. The next step to facilitate the process
will be the formation of the Special Privatization Committee for Telecommunications. Once the
committee is established, it wil be advisable to send a mission to discuss the sector strategy.
VIOL TRANSPORTATION
adcround
4Q           Peru's transportation system is a Government monopoly in all areas except air
transport, where the state-owned airline, Aeroperu, operates in a highly competitive environment that
rewards the quality of management. The airline carries 20 percent of international passengers and
for 44 percent of the domestic load. The entire transportation sector is in dire need of rehabilitation.
The railroads, marine fleet, and port infrastruture are operating at levels below that of five years
ago. About 88 percent of the roads are in disrepair, and 70 percent of the railroads are in a
deplorable state.
Recent Reforms and GOP Strate 
49.          The GOP has begun the implementation of a policy conducive to private sector
investment in the sector.
(a) Airlines - To create an enabling environment for private sector investment,
the GOP in July 1991 authorized the operation of new companies to transport
passengers and freight Three new  companies providing regular passenger
service, seven companies providing charter flights, and four maintenance
companies have stared business in the last five months. Continuing this
liberaliztion process, the GOP issued a new Civil Aeronautics Law in
September 1991, that removes tariffs in the sector, and that followed the
Legislative Decree of July 13 authorizing the privatization of Aeroperu. An
international consultant has been selected by Aeroperu to: (-l review and
update its financial statements; (ia) catalog its assets; and (iii) assess the value
of the company for privatization.



- 110 -
ANNEX a
Page 13 of 17
(b)   Highways - Although the GOP will continue to own the nation's roadways,
a proper strateg for private sector development is essential for rehabilitation
and maintenance. An estimated 30 percent of the roads are to be toll roads
operated by private companies through concessions. The remaining 70
percent can be serviced by private sector contracts paid for by a Highway
Fund suppled by a portion of the revenues raised from gasoline tax The
GOP issued Supreme Decree No. 006 in April 1990 designating the Mistry
of Transport and Communications as the sole authority to establish tolls, thus
creating the conditions for a national Highway Transport Policy. The 1991
budget for the public sector permits the toll system for federal highways to be
operated by private ;nvestors under concessional agreements. Two bids from
private toi operators are being reviewed.
(c)   Ports - The GOP has taken the following measures to encourage increased
private sector involvement in port services: (i) Supreme Decrees Nos. 026,
027, and 054 have eliminated the monopoly of the Comision Controladora de
Trabajo Maritimo on stevedoring services, bringing about an immediate
reduction of the 40 percent tariffs; (ii) the state-owned company, Euapu,
which is responsible for adntering and managing all major ports, has been
given icreased decision-making power, has reduced its work force by more
than 3,000 employees, and has transferred to the private sector all stevedoring
work, the loading and unloading of cargo, and the maintenance of container
handling equipment; (iii) Legislative Decree No. 644 has fuly liberalized
marine transport routes, as well as the rules governing the purchase and lease
of new ships In addition, Supreme Decree of July 1991, has eliminated the
reserve of 50 percent of cargo transport for Peruvian ships. As a consequence
of these two measures, new companies have been created and new routes
have been established by existing companies.
(d)   Railroads - Ihe state-owned rairoad, Eoafer, which dominates rail
transportation, is in dismal condition with most of its tracks and cas in
disrepair, and an operating deficit of US$26.3 million. The GOP is clearly
aware that rehabilitation will require private sector involvement.
(e) Urban Transport - The improvement of urban transportation services requires
the reform of the reglatoxy environment to permit the private sector to
function freely. Import policy has resticted the adequate procurement of
parts, cars, etc. and fares are not commall viable. Liberalizing measures
in this area are (i) Legisltve Decre No. 640 of June 1991 eliminating all
restrictions on routes and operations in the interprovincial transport of
passengers; (ii) Legislative r ree No. 642 of June 1991 reducing the tariffs
in the    incial transpL . and (iii) the completing opening up of routes,
operations, and tariffs for uroan transport throughout the countty in July
1991.

Sa  for Reform
50.          Ihe next recommended steps for private sector development and prvatization in the
transportation sector are as follows:
(a)   Airlines - Establishment of the Special Pnvatization Committee for Acroperu
and the hiring of an airline expert to assist the committee in identifying and
negotiating with  potential buyers    Aeroper. should  prepare the
pre-qualifcation bidding documents for privatization
(b)   Highways - The GOP must outline a clear policy and reorganize the General
Directorate for Roads to handle concessions and contracts.
(c)   Ports - The folowing measures are necessary. continuing the prtvatization of
port operations, including the handling of general cargo, at the port of Callao;
priatizing the handling of general cargo at aU ports; privatizing the receiving,
storing, and loading of minerals; developing a program for the transfer of
larger structural and civil works projects to private industry, and establing
a format for attracing the private sector to the tug boat operations in the port
Of Callao.
(d) Urban Transport - Once the GOP has created an enabling environment for
private sector participation, the next step should be the privatization of
Enatr, the national bus company, through an employee buyout.
(e) Railroads - Several possibilities offer the GOP a choice for the development
of Euafer. (i) a large section of the railway, the Linea Central, could be
transferred to its primary client, Centromin, the state-owned mining company,
but this will depend on the GOP's divestiture strategy for the mining sector,
(ii) Enafer could be transferred to the private sector by means of a
concession; (iii) the GOP could retain responsibility for the upkeep of the
infirastructure and turn over operations to the private sector, either on a
concession basis or to a joint public/private operator, or (iv) the GOP could
issue several contracts for select railway operations. Regardless of which
option is chosen, the following reforms should be undertaken by Enafer
immediately:  (i) 1,500 excess employees should be laid off, with
compensation; (ii) radio train control and communications should be
intrduced; (ii) all less than wagon-load traffic should be discontinued; and
(iv) documents should be prepared for the contractig out of special services
to the private sector.

Raround
51.         Through a system of 13 state-owned municipal companies, the GOP controls 100
percent of water and sewerage operaions and distrbution. At present, only 73 pcent of the urban
population has access to water and 50 percent to sanitation. In the rural areas, only 22 percent has
access to water and 6 percent to sanitation. Average annual investment in the sector from 1985-1989
was approximately 0.15 percent of GDP, one of the klwest in Latin America.
Recent Reforms and GOP StMAteW
52.         As a first step to private sector participation in the sector, Sedapal has begun the
bidding process to delegate the task of biing to a private firm. Eight firms are already pre-qualified
to install and maintain 120,000 meters in SedapaPs west region and bil customers. The Bank and
the GOP have agreed on the utilization of the Japanese grant approved last May for the
improvement and rehabilitation of the water and sewerage infrstructure.
Sratev for Reform
53.         The existing rehabilitation program being administered by LAIIN, with a Japanese
grt is designed to be implemented by the public sector, however, a major issue to be discussed is
the role that the private sector can play. The Minister of Housing recently informed the Bank that
the GOP plans to transfer as many aspects of water and sewerage management as possible to the
prvate sector and is preparing an overall strategy and the regulatoty framework for this purpose.

54.         The State Entrepreneurial Activity includes approxiately 77 industrial companies
where the GOP has either minorty or majority control and which do not require any changes in the
regulatory enviroment prior to privatization. The companies in which the GOP has a minonty stake
include Cementos Lima - and its subsidiaries Nisa, Sia, and Larcabon; Quimlca del Paclco, Enata;
and Fertisa. The two most important companies in which the GOP has a majority stake are
Paramouga and SideVer
55.         Parmonga, natiazed in 1974, controls 60 percent of the market for paper
products and is also one of the country's most important manufacturers of chemical products. Its
installed capacity can produce approximately 250 million metric tons of paper products and
approximately 25 million metrc tons of chemical products. It uses the kalag and malaz from sugar
cane for the production of its paper products. Paramonga is the second largest consumer of
petroleum in Peru and one of the major consumers of electricity. Its situation has become difficult
as import duties for paper products have been reduced by SO percent and for chemical products by

Page 16 of 17
25 percent. The situation will worsen when the import taiffs for the Andean countnes are
eliminated in January 1992, since Pamamong cannot compete without them. Exacerbating the
problems of increased competition is a declining demand for Paramongas products, as a result of the
economic crisis.
56.         Siderpero, the major steel producer, supplied about 60 percent of domestic demand
in 1989 and operates the only integrated steel mill in Peru, with an annual installed capacity of
450,000 tons of crude steeL Its mill is located at Chimbote on the Pacific Coast about 420km. north
of Lima. Throughout the 1980s, Siderperu operated in a privileged environment protected both by
its status as priority supplier and by high import tariffs which averaged 50 percent. Under the present
Government, Siderperu lost its privileged status and consumers began to import steel products freely.
Since March 1991, import tariffs for most steel products have been lowered to 15 percent. Due to
increased competition, production this year is expected to be less than 200,000 tons.
Recent Reorms and GOP Stratenv
57.          On March 12,199'., the present administration signed a Presidential Decree (Decreto
Supremo No. 041-91-Er) authorizing a legal framework and procedures for privatization and listing
23 state-owned companies as the first batch designated for prnvatization. COPRI is doing the
preparatory work for the privatization of these companies, some of which can be brought to the point
of sale before June 1992. Tle main companies in this list are: Cementos LAma - with a GOP share
of 49 percent, 418 employees, total assets of US$107 million, and total income of US$43 million in
1990; Fertss - fully owned by GOP, with 382 employees, total assets of US$5.4 million, and total
income of US$10.7 million in 1990; and Enata - fully owned by GOP, with 221 employees, total assets
of US$3.3 million and total income of US$2.2 million in 1990.
58.         The GOP has requested the Bank's support for the privatization of Paramonga and
Siderperu, although it has not made an official announcement because of the anticipated opposition
of the local communities of Paramonga and Chimbote. A mission visited Siderpers and concluded
that privatization could proceed rapidly.
Strateg= for Reform
59.         The primary consideration must be a reliable valuation of assets. To ensure this, it
is recommended that a reputable firm be recruited, with Japanese grant funds, to: (i) assist the
companies in the preparation of the TOR for the valuations; (ii) supervise the valuation procedures
developed by auditors selected through a bidding process; and (iii) review the final valuation reports
This strategy would permit local firms to participate in the valuations, under the supervision of the
external consultant.

be made when the GOP presents the first list of companies with a timetable for their liquidation.
The second disbursement will be made only after the first has been concluded.
