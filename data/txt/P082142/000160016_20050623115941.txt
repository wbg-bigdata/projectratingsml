A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE
1. Countryandsector issues

Background
Cearii State confronts huge poverty and development challenges. Ninety-eight percent of its area
i s categorized as caatinga, an arid, thorny, dry vegetation biome that suffers serious draughts on
average once every four years. The population living innortheastern Brazil's caatinga i s
considered the poorest in Brazil. The region i s markedby low educational levels, highinfant
mortality and a paucity of social and physical infrastructure and basic services. About 70% of
Cearii's population live inthe caatinga. The remainder i s crowded into the narrow coastal strip.

Ceariii s poor in absolute terms and relative to many other Brazilian states. Its absolute ranking
across states hovers generally around #16-17 depending upon the index being used. However, a
recent study by the Government's research institute, IPEA, affirms that of Brazil's 26 states
Ceariii s the one that has progressedmost inthe social area over the decade 1993-2003. Cearii
State ranking across various composite poverty related indices based upon improvement includes
the following:


                                       Social Indicator              Rank

Governor L6cio Alchtara assumed office in2003 and has developed an ambitious fiscal, state
modernization and social inclusion agenda. However, low growth, reduced revenues andhigh
interest rates over the previous 3-4 years plus the concentration of debt repayments (2004-2009)
have conspired to seriously prejudice the State's fiscal situation (see Annex 1) and undercut
implementation of its development efforts. The State has already cut programmed investmentby
more than 50% over the last two years and constrained expenditures on basic service delivery.
Investments in 2004 will be less than one third of budgeted amounts. Resource allocation to

Government Strategy
Faced with this difficult environment, the Government has adopted a two pronged strategy.
First,it continues to containcosts and under-run programmedbudget expenditures while
attempting to preserve the integrity of priority programs and reforms. Second, it has approached
the Federal Government and the World Bank to obtain support for a large State loan-the        Ceard
Multi-Sectoral DevelopmentAPL ("CE APL")--to maintain critical growth and social programs
and ensure State modernization and fiscal sustainability inthe medium term.

         DevelopmentAxes (3)            inthree documents: the Development Agenda, the Social
          comprising Sectors (6)        Inclusion Indicators, and the Multi-Year Budget ("Plano

                                         indicators.

The PSMAxis plays the vital role of an integrating "umbrella" program that will improve
efficiency in all sectors. Much of the loan's technical assistance component i s directed towards
helping the Government to implement results-based management. This will be achieved through
programs comprising development of indicators-based sector plans, budgeting and monitoring &
evaluation reforms, with emphasis on key sectors impacting upon social inclusion goals.

The PSMAxis also addresses fiscal sustainability goals. It incorporates essential fiscal
benchmarks (primary surplus, tax revenue/GDP, debt/GDP) plus institutional strengthening
activities impacting state finances and fiduciary oversight. Activities cover procurement,
revenue, expenditure and contingent asset and liability responsibilities.




                                                  2

The HumanDevelopment Axis comprises the Education and Health sectors. Both axes are
vitally important to the State's fiscal and social inclusion goals. The Human Development Axis
addresses CearB's human resource constraint. Education and Health are the State's largest
sectors interms o f expenditures and contribute importantly to priority State (and Bank) social
benchmarks. Bothsuffer from important administrative failings resulting inpoor performance,
especially when compared with states outside of the Northeast. The loan will address these
problems and also strengthen the Social Inclusion and Youth Secretaries working with
vulnerable populations and support an important cultural renovation project inthe historic center
of Fortaleza, the State capital.

The Sustainable Resource Management Axis comprises Water Supply & Sanitation (WSS),
Water Resource Management (WRM) and Environment. It addresses Cears's other fundamental
constraint-water--plus   numerous related social and environmental problems. Key State and
Bank development priorities addressedby the loan include WSS coverage, completion of the
State's priority WRM works, legislativereform (in all three sectors), and institutional initiatives
that will strengthen the State WSS company (CAGECE) and the State WRM company
(COGERH), and the WSS-related activities of the state regulatory agency (ARCE). The
Environment Secretary's support of natural resource management efforts will also be
strengthened through zoning and coastal management programs--especially important given the
State's reliance on tourism. Natural resource monitoring and management functions will be
upgraded. And the State will establishing its first two `fully protected' parks inBrazil's only
unique biome, the caatinga.

(ii)Choiceof KeyProgramstobeSupported
The CE APL i s makinguse of a results-based Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) loan modality to
support nine key government programs infive targeted line sectors. The sixth sector addressed
by the loan, Public Sector Management, functions as an `umbrella'sector and impacts on the
other programs and sectors through its results-based management initiatives. These nine Eligible
Expenditure Programs (EEP) are presented inBox 1below. They have been selected because
they are operationally linked to the State's key development goals and priority sector
benchmarks. Each EEPconstitutes a significant budget allocation. Hence, increased
management efficiency and incorporation o f targets will benefit the programs, sectors and the
State. The choice of EEP also ensures that with relatively small annual disbursements of around
$50 million, the loan will leverage some $250 million in annual EEPexpenditures-ensuring
EEP expenditure levels and the achievement of priority benchmarks. Hence the loan will
mobilize significant reform andinstitutional strengthening efforts while guidingand supporting
the State's basic development agenda.

                           Box 1: Nine Critical Eligible ExpenditurePrograms (EEP)
  Human Development Axis
  (i)     Strengthening and Expansion of Primary Health Care (-$20 milliodyear) supports 10,500 Health
          Agents (Agentede Saude),the Family Dental Program, and the provision of basic pharmaceuticals to
          municipalities. This i s the Government's most important vehicle for delivering health services to the
          poor and in the interior.
  (ii)    Strengthening of Secondary and Tertiary Health Care-"Health         Closer to You" (-$26 milliodyear)
          promotes access of the population to institutionally and technically better managed, maintained and
          provisioned health care units includingregional hospitals, clinics, and emergency care units. This i s the
          largest program and supports the State's network of healthcare facilities.
  (iii)   Basic Standardsfor School Functioning (-$20 milliodyear) covers cost management and maintenance
          of pedagogical standards in State schools, basic school materials, rehabilitation and maintenance,
          vehicles and maintenance, and the illiteracy program for those older than 15 years of age. This is the
          main program for supporting state school system operations.
  (iv)    Progressive Universalization of Rural and Urban High School Education (-$5 milliodyear) funds
          rehabilitation and maintenance of high schools, assurance of physical standards, materials,
          maintenance, and rehabilitation and contracting of temporary teachers. The states, under the Brazilian
          Constitution, are responsible for high school education.
  (v)     Coordination and General Maintenance-Support           to Municipal Schools (FUNDEF Program)-(-$145
          mi1liodyear)-this    i s a Federally required State transfer to Municipal schools that goes to support
          teachers and physical infrastructure. I t funds municipal systems which are responsible for most primary
          education.

  Sustainable Resource Management Axis
  (i)     Urban Water and Health (-$6 milliodyear) funds increase in urban water supply, especially among
          poorer populations.
  (ii)    Urban Sanitation   (-$lo   milliodyear) funds increase in urban sanitation coverage, especially among
          poorer populations.
  (iii)    Water Basins ConveyanceSystem (Castanhao Dam-Fortaleza            Metropolitan Region) (-$18
          milliodyear) i s the critical water work for supplying the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region and that will
          eventually also provide water to 200,000 farmers and 276 rural communities.
  (iv)    Biodiversity Program-"PROBIO"($3           milliodyear) constitutes the single largest environmental
          program in Cear5 and funds management of protectedareas and related programs in key biomes,
          licensing, monitoring, inspection and natural resource management.


While no loan funds flow directly to the EEPor sectors--disbursement is to the State Treasury-
the loan establishes annual required expenditure levels for each EEP. Inthis way the loan
safeguards key EEP, assures timely release of resources by the central government, and forges a
partnership between the Secretaries of Planning and Finance and line Secretaries who must
spend budget resources and produce the results that will guarantee further loan disbursements.
Without the loan and its disbursement conditions it i s very likely that the Government's
development and reform agendas would simply not be achieved.

(iii) Results-BasedManagement: Conditions of Disbursement, Indicators, Sector Plans
The Government has specified targets in its Development Agenda, the PPA and its Social
Inclusion agenda. After selecting critical sectors and supporting EEP, Bank and Government
specialists developed a menu o f priority indicators (Annexes 3-4). These indicators are directly
linked to EEP and sector performance and supporting the loan's fiscal and social inclusion goals.



                                                            4

The most important sector indicators were incorporated into the CE APL as conditions of
disbursement andAPL#2 triggers which must be met to process the second loan. The sector
diagnostics identified other important reforms and performance targets that complete the loan's
Sector Plans (Annex 4). These Sector Plans should constitute the basis for six prototype Sector
Strategic Plans to be developed by targeted Secretaries in2005 which will guide budget
allocations, work programs and monitoring & evaluation efforts in succeeding years.

The Government o f CearB and the Bankjointly developed loan design features that support
results-basedmanagement through thejudicious use of disbursement conditions and technical
assistance. These include
    (i)      a 2005 disbursement that requires completion of the six Strategic Sector Plans
    (ii)     two disbursements, 2006 and 2007, that require*
             0    EEPexpenditure levels
             0    achievement of annual primary surplus targets
              0   "satisfactory" performance of 3 Bank portfolio loans to CearB (as detailed in
                  Annex 4, Section C, Table 4.C.1.)
              0   achievement of disbursement-linked indicators (13) across the six sectors.
    (iii)    APL#2 trigger conditions (15) across the six sectors
    (iv)      a Public Sector Management technical assistance component of up to $4 million.

This results-based loan design is supportedby three additional design features. First,at the end
of each calendar year Bank and client teams will meet to evaluate results against each of the
conditions (which are rigorously defined by protocols and specified inthe Loan Agreement) and
make any needed design changes. Second, the disbursement mechanism provides an important
incentive to carry out the sector programs since disbursements for achieving the higher, 2006
indicator levels increases by 20% over 2005 levels. Third, sector indicators have been fixed for
the APL #2 operation as well, ensuring program continuity and sustainability.

One important outcome of project design i s heightened ownership among affected Secretaries.
Officials inthe line Secretaries and SEPLAN are delighted to have guaranteed budget levels and
conditions of disbursement including "satisfactory" portfolio performance that support their most
important programs. It also forges a partnership betweenthe central Government and the
secretaries who become jointly accountable for performance. Inthe past, line and central
secretarieshad different incentives and fiscal constraints often resulted inbudgets for priority
programs being withheld or reallocated without attention to priorities.

conditions, triggers and other benchmarks comprising the expected APL#1.

(iv)Identification of TechnicalAssistanceNeeds
The CE APL's institutional development agenda i s more comprehensive than other operations of
this genre, Each Sector Planrequires institutional strengthening expenditures to achieve sector
and program benchmarks. The Plans are comparable to Sector Investment Loan (SIL) log-
frames except that indicators and triggers have consequences for non-achievement. The funding
for institutional strengthening needs identified inthe sector diagnostics and Sector Plans and not
covered by CE APL funds will come from alternative sources including other Bank and IDB
loans and Government budget sources.


2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank CAS supports integrated operations inthe impoverished Northeast region. It supports
reforms infour priority areas covered inthe CE APL. It supports State administrations



                                                     7

committed to reform, poverty alleviation and prudent fiscal management. The Bank loan plays
an important catalytic role by leveraging and guiding State efforts and resources to address
critical development issues while helping to bridge the difficult fiscal situation over the period
2004-2009. For these reasons, the CE APL i s fully justified.

Ceari has demonstrated a commitment to reform. The State's fiscal performance compares
favorably with many states andespecially Northeastern states. Regarding the targeted sectors,
Bank specialists rate health, water and sanitation, and water resource management as `good' or
`best' practice in Brazil. Education has improved markedly inrecent years and also compares
favorably with other states inthe Northeast region. The aforementionedIPEA study affirms the
State has improved social conditions more inthe past decade than any other State. In
recognition, Ceari has also been a leading recipient of Bank loans over the past decade. The
State's collaboration in developing this demanding, results-based CE APL operation further
underlines its reform commitment.

Ceari's development agenda prioritizes fiscal sustainability and poverty mitigation efforts
congruent with the Bank's country and regional strategies. However, due to its difficult fiscal
situation, the State has cut back dramatically on spending inimportant areas. Public investment
has declined from 1.8% of State GDO in 1998 to 0.4% in 2003 and 2004 expenditures are
estimated at only 28% of 2004 budget law authorizations. Debt repayment obligations for the
period 2004-09 exacerbate the situation. Critical State programs impacting delivery of essential
services, resumption of sustained growth and modernization of the state apparatus are being
jeopardized. With support from the Federal Government, the State applied to the World Bank
for assistance. The CE APL assures that Ceariwill be able to recoup its development agenda
while meeting its fiscal obligations. The loan will support nine large, central programs in six key
sectors and contribute importantly to growth, fiscal sustainability and social inclusion goals.


3. Higher levelobjectivesto which the project contributes

The CE APL will help the State to achieve fiscal sustainability, alleviate poverty, and modernize
the State. The Public Sector ManagementAxis will strengthen fiscal and results-based
management, promoting sustained improvements incentral and sector specific public
administration. The Human Development and Sustainable ResourceManagement Axes will
directly or indirectly support seven of eight MDG benchmarks including: extreme poverty
eradication, universalprimary education, reduced child mortality, improved maternal health,
combating diseases, environmental sustainability, and global development partnership.

The CE APL with its multi-sector emphasis on fiscal sustainability and social inclusion tracks
directly three of four CAS priorities:
     0   The Human Development Axis (Education, Health, and Social Inclusion) addresses the
         CAS priority, a "More Equitable Brazil"
     0   The Sustainable Resource Management Axis (Environment, WRM, WSS) corresponds to
         the CAS'S"More Sustainable Brazil"




                                                  8

           The Public Sector Management Axis (Public Sector Management including fiscal,
           financial and efficient expenditure activities) corresponds to the CAS "Foundations of
           Economy & Governance" priority.

Inthis context, the operation addresses20 of 40 targeted "medium-term outcomes" inthe Brazil
CAS "Results Framework" (Report No. 27043-BR, November 10,2003). Its focus on the
impoverished northeast i s in line with CAS lending priorities and the multi-sector, integrated
approach echoes the CAS emphasis on an `integrated' development approach-12              of 17 sub-
national loans inthe CAS'S 5-year lending program are integrated operations of which 6-8 will
be inthe Northeast. Its institutional strengthening activities will modernize the State and
significantly improve the impact of key EEP and other State programs. Hence, the CE APL
applies the CAS at the state level.


B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument

The project was envisaged in2003, at the time when the CAS was discussed, as an urban project,
which subsequently grew to integrate several other sectors under the SWAPapproach. This
decision was reached after consultations with the client (the Federative Republic of Brazil and
the State of Ceara), upon careful consideration of the client's needs. Moreover, as explained
above, the project i s in alignment with the CAS strategy, b y addressing half of the CAS targeted
medium-term outcomes under the Results Framework (for more details see section A.3. above).
It was also decided that the total lending amount (expected to be US$240 mil) be disbursed in
two phases, as an APL. This operation, therefore, i s a state-based, multi-sector Adaptable
ProgramLoan (APL) makinguse of the Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) modality to support nine
critical Cearh State budget programs (Eligible Expenditure Programs-EEPs) and reforms. With a

The loan supports fiscal sustainability by establishing primary surplus targets as disbursement
conditions. It will also address, through incorporation of Sector Plan benchmarks into the State's
Sector Strategic Plans, the important fiscal problems of tax and user charges, real estate and asset
management, contingent liabilities from legal cases, establishment o f an independent
administrator ("gestor unico") for pension administrationand fiduciary oversight improvement.

A.      EducationSector

Sector strategy is supported by the Bank's large basic education loan (BR-#45910) and
"satisfactory" loan implementation i s a disbursement condition. The strategy focuses on learning
achievement and strengtheningof the Secretary's ability to efficiently administer resources and
resolve issues outstanding from the decentralization of primary education to municipalities in
compliance with the 1987 Constitutional requirement-Cear8           i s the State that has most
decentralized education but difficult teacher and resource allocation problems must be resolved.

The Sector Plan adds to this agenda through programs that (i)        strengthen the Secretary of
Education's technical capacity through staff development studies andprograms, and (ii)
intervene inpoor municipalities to improved educational planning and outcomes. Improved
implementation of the Banks education loan to Cearii i s also addressed (see Annex 4).

B.      Health Sector

The sector diagnostic conducted for the project points to infant and maternal mortality as Cearii's
most pressing health problems. These are targetedb y the loan along with institutional
strengthening measures designed to ensure expanded coverage b y basic health providers and
increased targeting and efficiency o f service provision.

C.       SocialInclusionand Culture Sector

The Human Development Axis also includes an APL trigger for the rehabilitation of a multi-site
historic and cultural corridor inthe center of Fortaleza. And it includes a Sector Plan for the
Social Inclusion and Youth Secretaries that will strengthen targeting, M&E, implementationof
priority programs, and State:municipality collaboration plus mobilize civil society to assist in

A.       Water Resources ManagementSector (WRM)

Water i s the critica1,natural resource inthis arid State. Ceariiranks among Brazil's strongest
states in water resource management. Even so, there i s a huge institutional and development
agenda that requires implementation in order to optimize water resources management.

The Castanhao water conveyance system is arguably the most important civil works inCeariias
it will resolve aFortaleza water problem and spur development alongthe coast. It is financedby
a Bank loan and satisfactory completion of 80km and 120kmin 2005 and 2006 respectively i s a
loan requirement for WRM disbursements. Sector Plan items also include the establishment of a
modern COGERH (the State water resources management company) system for water resource
management with M&E of quantity and quality o f reservoirs' water and volume of river water,
strengthened management information systems for managing water use including upgraded
systems for registrationof users, permits, and M&E, and the creation of reservoir management
commissions.


B.       Water Supply and SanitationSector (WSS)

Cearii also has one of Brazil's best State water supply companies (CAGECE) and regulatory
agencies (ARCE). As i s the case inmost States and municipalities, the critical sector objectives
are expanding coverage, especially to the poor, and the fiscal sustainability of operations.

The Sector Plan supports expanding service coverage for small communities (through the SISAR
system). It also addresses different reforms to strengthen financial sustainability and efficiency
through upgrading CAGECE's internal functioning (HR, IT, expenditure reviews, reducing
water loss), promoting the nexus between CAGECE, ARCE and municipalities, and exploring
new business models (eg. floating CAGECE shares andpublic-private partnerships).


C.      Environment Sector

Environment has not been one of the State's better managed sectors. Nevertheless, it i s
extremely important because of its impact on scarce water resources, predatory development of
coastal biomes affecting the tourist industry, and depredation of the "caatinga" biome. The
caatinga i s the only biome unique to Brazil and i s an exceptionally rich repository of biological
diversity. Two o f the world's ten most threatened birdspecies are found in the caatinga.

The Sector Planincludes a diagnostic of the State's dwindling forestry resources and a program
to address the growing desertification problem. The Plan also adds ambitious monitoring and
evaluation programs (air and water quality, fish farming and licensing), cadastre updates (solid
waste producers, forest raw material consumers) and strengthening of protected area
management.


4. Project components

The CE APL design operates through (i)            financial support o f nine Eligible Expenditure Programs
(EEPs) across six sectors requiring achievement of a results-based benchmarks comprising
institutional reforms and performance benchmarks, and (ii)            fundingof specific technical

Component 1: Eligible Expenditure Programs and Benchmarks
These have been presented in Section 3 above (see also Annexes 3-4 for detail).

Component 2: Technical Assistance
The loan includes technical assistance valued around $4 million or about 3.3% of the APL#1
loan amount. Most of this will go to support Public Sector Management Axis initiatives to

Note that alternative funding sources totaling over $2 million have been found for technical
assistancefor key institutional development needs, originally a part o f this loan. Education and
WRM assistancewill be funded through existing Bank loans. IDB loans (PROMOEX, PNAGE)
are picking up other activities identified inBank diagnostics. Government budget allocations
will finance what remains. Hence considerable TA i s being leveraged through this operation.


5. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

Duringpreparation the team reviewedCearBoperations andESWand recent SWApsincluding
two inBrazil. The following points emerged (see also Annex 4-G)
    e   Choice of multi-sectoral model and activities. SWAps are predominately single
        progradsector loans. However, Mexico hasjust completed a multi-sector SWAp. Also,
        Bank i s emphasizing multi-sectoral approaches which i s echoed inthe CAS, Bank ESW
        and CearB's own development agenda. Hence, six key sectors were selected along with
        EEPand benchmarks with strong links to MDG, CAS and State priorities. Inclusion of
        the umbrella Public Sector Management Axis and identification of disbursement
        conditions, triggers and the technical assistance component assures that institutional
        reform synergies will take place across sectors.
    0   Disbursement to Treasury and not to sectors. The CE APL follows the $572 million
        Federal Bolsa Familia SWAPwhich disbursed to the Federal Treasury. The CearB loan
        safeguardsEEP expenditures by establishing annual minimumrequired levels and
        sectoral disbursement-linked indicators. It allows the Government to manage its fiscal
        resources and allocations while forging a partnershipbetween the central secretaries and



                                                 16

      the line secretaries who are responsible for meeting disbursement conditions and hence
      mustreceive timely disbursements from Treasury.
   0  Disbursement incentives. The Mexican infrastructure SWAP contributed the concept of
       disbursement-linkedindicators. Brazil's Bolsa Familia provided the idea of increasing
       disbursement amounts every year to strengthen results-based incentives. The
       incorporation of required EEPexpenditure levels also came out of this discussion.
   0   Ownership. Since this i s the first state SWAp, i s multi-sectoral, disburses to Treasury,
       and involves a State with 3 Bank loans that have struggled, it was deemed essential to
       ensure collaboration and ownership by line and central secretaries. Bank teams traveled
       to CearB to develop proposals with sectoral counterparts and buildprogram ownership. A
       3-day stakeholders' workshop was held to discuss and finalize the Public Sector
       Management program. The program has also been formally vetted by participating
       Secretaries, the Governor and Vice Governor. The Secretaries are also strong loan
       proponents since the APL effectively supports implementation of their key programs.
   0   Supportfor portfolio loans addressing key areas. CearBhas three Bankloans--education,
       WRM, andrural poverty. Implementation hasbeenprejudicedby weak management and
       fiscal constraints. Attending the requests of task managers, andbecause these loans
       support CE APL programs, "satisfactory" loan implementation has been incorporatedas a
       disbursement condition (see inAnnex 4, Section C, Table 4.C. 1.).


6. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

Loan design was discussed extensively with the Federal Government and CearB and within the
Bank team. Main issues and alternatives considered included the following

(9         Appropriate Loan Type
   0   Adjustment or Programmatic Adjustment Loans. These options were rejected because of
       the limited ability to undertake a broad menu of institutional strengthening reforms over
       an extended, six year period. InBrazil the Government customarily accepts only single
       yeadtranche adjustment operations. Preparing a series of loans would be difficult and
       time consuming and there would be no assurance o f Federal Government approval.
   0   SWAP vs. TraditionalSZL. The SWAPhas various advantages. It can be designed to
       disburse to the Treasury-an    explicit Cear6 request. It also allows the Bank to support
       key programs across six-sectors, include technical assistance, and link disbursement to
       the achievement of reform and output benchmarks through loan conditionality.
   0   APL or 6-Year Project. APL advantages include: (i)      reducedfront-end and commitment
       fees -the GOB would almost certainly have required an APL, (ii)       flexibility to review
       loan design features, update benchmarks and decide if a second loan shouldbe done, (iii)
       stronger incentives to meet APL#2 triggers, (iv) enhanced political responsiveness and
       ownership in light of gubernatorial elections in 2006.

(ii)       Number of Development Axes/Sectors Covered
The selection of five line sectors plus the Public Sector Management umbrella was determined in
consultations with the client and was based upon the prominence accorded these sectors inthe
CAS, Bank ESW, MDG and CearBdevelopment agenda. Proposals to add and delete sectors



                                                 17

were carefully reviewed basedupon potential impact. Major sectors eliminated from the first
APL included urban, ruraUagriculture, regionaldevelopment, infrastructure, private sector,
public security andjudicial reform. Even so, loan design makes possible the inclusion of six
sectors without diluting incentives or impact.

(iii)      DisbursementMechanismOptions
The disbursement mechanism capitalizes on processes inplace, there i s little that i s new, and
client buy-in i s strong.
    0   The decision was taken to disburse to the State Treasury rather than programs/sectors to
       better address State fiscal needs and take advantage of CearB's strong central government
        inforging apartnership with line Secretaries to ensure conditions of disbursement are
       met. MinimumEEPexpenditure levels and disbursement conditions reinforce line
        ownership. (Annex 4, Section E, Flow of FundsChart).
    0   The number of disbursement-linked indicators (13 across 6 sectors) was discussed
       internally and agreed with the client. Establishing a single price each year for
        disbursement-linked indicators and increasingthe 2006-7 price to provide added
        incentive were also decided after extensive discussion.
     0  Primary surplus,portfolio and minimumEEPexpenditure conditions were agreed with
        the client to reinforce prudent managerialbehavior.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

N/A

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

SWAps use existing client organizations and systems. Consequently, a small Project
ImplementationUnit (PIU) of full-time staff under the immediate supervision of the head of the
SEPLANResearch Institute (IPECE)--the maincounterpart duringloan preparation--will
manage the implementation. The main PIUfunctions will be
     0  Overall project management and World Bank reporting responsibility
     0  N o Financial Management specialist i s required. The PIUwill receive and vet quarterly
        reports from the Secretary of Finance usedfor determining disbursement against EEP
        expenditures prior to passing them on to the Bank. It will maintain financial records for
        the small TA component.
     0  No Procurement specialist is required full time on the PIU. The TA component is small
        and dispersed and the PIU will oversee and vet procurement which will be carried out in
        specialized secretarial units.
     0  The PIU will maintain all relevant records.
     0  The PIUwill retainat least one higher level staff to oversee progress towards meeting
        disbursement and APL#2 benchmarks including Sector Plans.
The PlU will also aggregate and vet end-of-year sector reports addressing achievement of
disbursement linked indicators (and APL triggers in 2006) prior to providing them to the Bank
and will prepare any waiver requests, including requests for partial or late reimbursement.




                                                 18

The PIUwill also respond to any legal, regulatory or political questions that may arise inrelation
to the implementation of the CE APL project and ensure that any legal requirements incumbent
upon the State and related to the carrying out of the project are met. Inthis regard, it i s expected
to support and facilitate Bank supervision of the agreed environmental safeguards framework


3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomedresults

Monitoring and evaluation i s an integral part of operational design.
    0   Validation of Eligible Expenditure Program expenditures annually inthe 2ndand 4th
        quarters will be done for purposes of disbursement. EEPwill be continuously monitored.
    0   Achievement of primary surplus, portfolio status, minimumEEP expenditure levels in
        sectors and disbursement-linked-indicators are verified annually for purposes of
        disbursement. Since these conditions have disbursement implications, protocols have
        been established for each and monitoring will be continuous. Evidence of satisfaction of
        conditions will be formally presented inwritten documents by the client.
    0   Presentation of satisfactory Sector Strategic Plans inthe six sectors will be validated at
        end 2005. The Bank will accompany preparation and review resulting plans.
    0   Progress on achieving APL triggers will be continuously tracked through the life of the
        project. Protocolshave beenestablished for triggers and results will be presented prior to
        project conclusion to allow time for decision andpreparation of APL#2.
    0   Inclusion inthe Public Sector Management component of funds to upgrade monitoring
        and evaluation, strengthen budgeting and resource allocation, and develop Sector
        Strategic Plans will support monitoring and evaluation objectives.


4. Sustainability

The CE APL addresses sustainability inthe following ways
    0   The timing of loan disbursement has been calculated to ensure that the State can grow
        and implement its development agenda while achieving a sustainable and improving
        primarysurplus.
    0   Inclusion of fiscal, financial and performance management indicators backedby technical
        assistance directed at key fiscal determinants (tax revenue, asset and contingent liability
        management, social security, fiduciary oversight) will improve the State's fiscal situation.
    0   CE APL benchmarks will be tracked over a six year period, ensuring continuous
        improvement and solidifying them within the M&Eframework.
    0   Progress against conditions of disbursement and APL triggers will be reviewed annually.
        Conditions can be recalibratedto counter any backsliding and this can be reinforcedin
        the preparation of APL #2.
    0   Inclusion of institutional strengthening benchmarks and technical assistance funding over
        a six year period will provide ample opportunity to identify and consolidate reforms and
        this will be supported by the emphasis uponresults-based management.

5. Criticalrisks and possible controversial aspects

Riskshavebeendiscussed extensively among Bank staff and CearBofficials and include:

1.     Economic Downturn. The State's growth and liquidity i s very much linked to national
growth and Federal transfers from tax revenue. Political instability, recession, highinterest rates
and currency depreciation could consequently exacerbate the State's fiscal situation. However,
Brazil growth is now projectedat 4-5% for 2005 and CearBresults could exceed this figure.
2.      State Capacity. There i s concern that the multi-sectoral, results-based APL approach
could overwhelm the State's institutional capacity. Benchmarks may not be achieved, and the
loan may not disburse. These concerns are mitigated by loan design features described below.
   EEPprograms, disbursement indicators, APL triggers and Sector Planbenchmarks have been
   jointly determinedby Bank and client sector specialists and are feasible. The GOC has taken
   ownership and committed to carrying out the CE APL program.
   EEPprojectedexpenditures have been set by the GOC at realistic levels. There is no
   dedicated EEPdisbursement and required EEP expenditure levels are set at 70% of these
   projected levels.
   EEPexpenditures and disbursement conditions will be reviewed annually andduring
   preparation of the second APL, hence adjustments can be made.
   A comprehensive technical assistance program supports achievement of CE APL targets.
   The GOC and Bank have embedded a strong M&Eframework to support operations.
   The client has taken ownership and places highpriority on loan disbursement.


   Loan conditions and covenants

Relevant disbursement conditions include the following
    (i)     The final 2005 disbursement requires government approval of results-based Sector
            Strategic Plans in six targeted sectors in accordance with the specific guidelines in a
            COGERFresolution (to be issued).
    (ii)    The June 2006 and 2007 disbursements require
            The primary surplus targets imposed by the Federal Treasury will be met or the
            surplus shouldbe $134 million andR$147 million respectively in2005 and 2006 --
            5% growth annually beginningwith the 2003 baseline.
            The three loans in the Bank's loan portfolio must be rated "Satisfactory" on
            Implementation and Development Objectives (see inAnnex 4, Section C, Table
            4.c.1.)
            Minimumannual expenditure levels ineach sector mustbe met each year for
            disbursement linked indicators amounts to be disbursed inthose sectors.
            The borrower must present evidence satisfactory to the Bank that disbursement linked
            indicators have been met.

There i s one loan covenant. The State will, during the first twelve months of project
implementation, formally apply to BAMA for a license to regularize operation of the ocean
outfall that discharges sewage collected inFortaleza. The outfall was designed and operates in
an environmentally sound manner and did not require such a license when built. Obtaining one


                                                  20

now would reflect a regularization of the State-federal relationship that has since been
established inBrazilwith regard to environmental regulation. If regularization requires any
changes or eventual State investments the Bank may require that they be addressed in a
satisfactory manner during APL#1 and as a condition for the APL#2 operation.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicandfinancial analyses

Despite the recent economic upturninBrazil and CearB, the State confronts huge problems
maintaining its development agenda and fundingpriority programs. Investment in 2004 i s
around 30% of budgeted amounts and over the past several years discretionary investment has
fallen well below half of what was projected inthe 2004-2007 multi-year budget (PPA).
Reduced revenues and transfers over this period coupled with highdebt repayment obligations
through 2009 combine to create a dire economic situation. If allowed to continue, the
cumulative impact on essential services and infrastructurewill seriously prejudice economic
recovery.

The CE APL i s a $149 million loan usinga SWAP modality. Disbursement is to the CearB
Treasury. Programs impacting upon the State's development priorities are supported by the loan
andthe key financial and social indicators are incorporated as disbursement conditions. The
increasing primary surplus and debtlnet revenue benchmarks plus initiatives to increase tax
revenues and expenditure efficiency will ensure prudentfiscal management. And CearB will be
free to recuperate its development agenda and meet financial obligations ina manner that should
contribute to financial sustainability, social inclusion, state modernization and sustainable
growth.

Fiscal and social goals are addressedthrough a results based management framework that
operates through the Public Sector Management programs, indicators and technical assistance
plus sector specific disbursement conditions. Major efficiency and social concerns are addressed
ineach sector andreinforcedby APL#2 triggers. Hence, economies and greater expenditure
efficiency can be expected inPSM and also inEducation, WSS, WRM. The technical assistance
component also includes procurement upgrade initiatives that could produce sizeable economies
exceeding several million dollars annually. And the contingent liability, asset management and
tax evasion work could also contribute importantly to fiscal well-being or limit liabilities.


2. Technical

The Bank has worked extensively inCearB and maintains very good relations with the State.
The Bank believes that CearB i s fully competent to carry out the CE APL. The loan will support
activities in 9 EEPs across five line sectors plus public sector management. Of the five line
sectors, Water & Sanitation, Water Resource Management, Health, and Education are qualified
by Bank specialists as "good" or "best" practice in important aspects. The Bank i s also currently
implementing State projects inthe Education and WFW sectors, has recently completed an
operation with considerable W&S content, and i s preparing an Environmental GEF grant to
address caatinga issues. CearB also participates in Federal projects ineach of the targeted



                                                   21

sectors. The Bank has done more recent ESW inCear6 than perhaps any other Brazilian state,
including SFAA, SFAR, State Economic Memorandum and poverty assessments. Hence, Bank
and GOC sector specialists were able to collaborate on the design of sector programs that
identified and addressed State and Bank priorities.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management. The assessmentof financial management arrangements was based on
the State Financial Accountability Assessment (SFAA), that was undertaken concurrently with
project preparation. The SFAA supports the Bank's developmental objectives by identifying
strengths and weaknesses inthe State's Public FinancialManagement (PFM) systems,
ascertaining priorities for action and informing the design and implementation of capacity
strengthening programs. The SFAA also helps the Bank to meet its fiduciary objectives by
identifying the risks posed to Bank loan proceeds by the State's PFMarrangements, and
proposing appropriate risk mitigating measures.

The Cearii SFAA concluded that, despite budget rigidities and room for greater PFMefficiency,
overall the State has sound PFM systems that adequately safeguard State resources including any
Bank loan proceeds that may flow through the State's own PFM systems. Hence Ceariiaccounting
and reports will be used to monitor project implementation.

The notable exception i s inthe area of external oversight where there are significant weaknesses in
the Tribunalde Contasdo Estado (TCE) and the Tribunal de ContasMunicipal (TCM). These are
respectively the State and Municipal Court of Accounts that are constitutionally mandated to audit
State and Municipal accounts and would therefore be responsible for the audit of the priority
programs supported by the proposed loan. Weaknesses are attributable to significant
underinvestment over the years leading to, inter alia, a lack of modern auditing techniques, little
continuing professional development and an inability to recruit sufficient numbers of appropriately
qualified staff. The consequences are a significant backlog indischarging the accounts of Public
Administrators and inadequate coverage of State entity accounts. The SFAA action plan requires
the State to address these weaknesses. The State i s participating in an IDB loan (PROMOEX) that
will take over this sub-component. As a risk mitigating measure the Bank will require as trigger
conditions that (i) discharges of Public Administrators accounts are issued periodically inrespect
of all those entities responsible for implementing EEP's plus for the Secretariat of Finance, which
will be responsible for receiving Bank loan proceeds. Inaddition, the Bank i s requiringthat the
TA agendaincorporatedinto PROMOEX be implemented. Should this not happen, loan
contingency funds can be utilized for this purpose and progress benchmarks will be incorporated
into APL#1 and APL#2 in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.

Procurement. Both a State Procurement Assessment Report (SPAR) and a capacity assessment
were carried out and Bank loan portfolio experience was reviewed. The State was found to have
the necessary capacity to implement the loan. It i s noteworthy that Cear6 has also begun
implementingreforms recommended b y the SPAR-some            $800,000 of the proposed technical
assistance program for procurement has been taken over by another Bank loan. Inthe case of
procurement of major categories of goods, considerable savings have already resulted and the
methodology i s beingreplicated in other countries inthe LCR region. The Loan funds allocated to



                                                 22

the technical assistance component will also finance the ongoing reform program. It is expected
that within the project's lifetime most of the 20 most important procurement categories will be
completed.

SWAP type loans support client programs and make use of client procurement rules and
procedures to the extent possible. A procurement plan has been developed for the small technical
assistance component of $3-5 million and Bank procurement rules apply. This component
comprises mainly studies and expert assistance. The work program i s divided among the four
main central secretaries plus a large line secretary. Each secretary has its own procurement
commission and organization for managing procurement. The Project ImplementationUnit will
monitor implementation progress and provide any needed support. Given the size and simplicity
of these operations no difficulties are foreseen. Government procurement systems and procedures
will be relied upon for carrying out EEP expenditures and no procurement plan i s required for the
nine EEPs, except with respect to goods and works that need to be procured under international
competitive biddingprocedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines, and consultants' services
above a certain threshold. The Bank has decided to rely upon the Cear6 system because the loan i s
a SWAP with the following characteristics (i) CE APL disburses directly to the Treasury and
                                                the
there i s no incremental or dedicated finance flowing to the five line secretaries with EEP, (ii)the
Bank's SPAR and capacity assessment found CearA to possess satisfactory capacity, (iii)     Ceariihas
two projects operating intargeted line sectors and a third recently closed providing added comfort
regardingthe system's capacity ,and (iv) the ongoing reform program, to be financed inpart by
the Loan, will assure key areas identified in the SPAR are addressed. Ineffect, the loan is
mobilizing considerable resources to implement SPAR recommendations and assure that the State
has a "good case" system inplace. The Loan Agreement will provide that a certain negative list of
goods and services will not be included inEEPs.


4. Social

The CE APL i s built upon the dual pillars of social inclusion and fiscal sustainability and
incorporates Government social inclusion benchmarks across EEPs and sectors. Indoing so, the
loan also addresses eight of nine MDGgoals.

Operationally, the CE APL supports these key objectives by ensuring the level of key Eligible
Expenditure Programs and establishing performance benchmarks that include outputs and
institutional strengthening initiatives considered to be Government priorities. Cearii's Social
Inclusion program i s ratedby Bank staff as "best practice" but requires institutional
strengthening. Hence, a Sector Plan dedicated to the new Social Inclusion and Youth Secretaries
has been included and should be incorporatedto those Secretaries' own Sector Strategic Plans.
The Sector Plans and social benchmarks are detailed inAnnexes 3-4.

Finally, monitoring and evaluation of social results will be done through (i)   the annual vetting
and resetting of disbursement linked indicators, (ii) validation o f the APL#2 triggers and Sector
Planbenchmarks, (iii)   the implementation (disbursement-linked indicator) of a social inclusion
cycle, and (iv) monitoring and evaluationby the Social Inclusion and Planning Secretaries.

5. Environment

Environment i s a component sector under the Sustainable Resource Management Axis. The
Bank and State collaborated to produce a program that addresses key State environmental issues
including
         0   Indicators for (i)establishing 2 protected areas inthe vulnerable Caatinga biome, and
             (ii) completing economic and environmentalzoning (ZEE)for critical state biomes.
         0   State Strategic Plan (condition of disbursement) and APL triggers including (i)
             reformed environmentallegislation, (ii) management programs, (iii)
                                                      coastal                            forestry
             and desertification diagnostics, (iv) continuous monitoring, evaluation and upgrade of
             cadastres including air and water quality, forest raw material consumers, shrimp
             farmers, solid waste, (v) upgrade of protected area management, and (vi) licensing
             improvements.

The project also makes important contributions to mitigation of environmental problems through
its support o f the WSS component which has important sewerage expansion sub-components in
Fortaleza and the interior. Safeguard arrangements discussed below will also contribute to
environmental improvements.

6. Safeguard policies

The CE APL i s an "A Category" rating owing to the fact that it supports an EEPthat
incorporates counterpart funding for the Bank's "Ceard State Water Resources Integrated
Management Program" ("PROGERIRH", BR-PE6449) which is an "A" project. PROGERIRH
safeguard questions were resolved inCY2000when the loan was presented to the Board and
implementationhas been satisfactory. If not for PROGERIRH, the project would have received
a "B" rating. The safeguards explanation and framework for each EEP and Sector program are
indicatedbelow and detailed inAnnex 10. Inline with Bank requirements, the Environmental
Management Programhas been translated and published in Ceara and compliance with that
program will be required inthe Loan Agreement.

Without the CE APL, it will very likely be impossible to maintain critical State investment
programs-including     the nine large Eligible Expenditure Programs-at        levels necessary to
ensure basic service delivery, public sector modernization andthe relaunching of the Ceari
development agenda. Given budget rigidities, the fiscal effort to repay debt and meet other State
obligations will further cut into seriously underfunded investment programs and make even more
difficult the returnto sustainable growth.


I.      Background2000-2003: Fiscal Dqficulties.

Ceari's economy and fiscal well-being i s closely linkedto Brazil's economic environment
including Federal laws and agreements governing Federal debt and transfers. Brazil's good
economic performance in 2000 was followed by a series of adverse events in2001-2002,
including the domestic energy crisis, uncertainty arisingfrom corporate corruption scandals
overseas, the September 11terrorist attacks, collapse of the Argentine economy and market
uncertainty surrounding the October, 2002 presidentialelections. As a result, growth fell from
4.5% in 2000 to 1.5% in 2002; sovereign spreads rose from 700 to 2,400 basis points; the
currency depreciated from R$2.4 to R$4 to the dollar; and the debt to GDP ratio grew from
49.3% to 58%. The newly elected Lula administration responded with tight fiscal and monetary
policies to restore credibility and curb inflation. The results were impressive andby July, 2004
spreads had fallen to 600 basis points, the exchange rate to R$3.00 and the annualized inflation
rate had fallen from 27% at the beginning of 2003 to 9% by year end. The high interest rates and
fiscal contraction, however, resulted in almost no growth in 2003'. But recovery was apparent
by the fourth quarter of 2003 and the most recent growth projections for 2004 are inexcess of
5%.

The impact upon CearA and other states duringthis turbulent period were predictably negative.
CearB's contractions in 2001 and again in 2003 were worse than Brazil's recession.

The State's fiscal adjustment during this period also exacted a huge toll on its growth and
development agenda. The current situation i s further exacerbated by circumstances beyond
State's control. First, 1997debt renegotiations concentrated debt service payments, especially
during theperiod 2004-2009. Ceari has low indebtedness-one             of the lowest inBrazil. Federal

  InDecember2004, the GDP growth rate for 2003 was revised from -0.2% to 0.5%.

debt renegotiationswith states took place in 1989 and 1993 and established amortization
schedules for the period 2000-2010. Ceari's debt was renegotiated in 1997, at which time the
State chose a 15 year maturity--most states opted for 30 years. This decision further
concentrated amortization payments (Figure 1).
Second, the negative shocks during theperiod 1999-2002 increased the cost of Statedebt. The
shocks gave rise to exchange rate devaluations in 1999 and 2002. The debt renegotiations
established an interest rate of 6% plus the variation of the IGP-DIprice index, which i s
notoriously sensitive to exchange-rate movements. In2002, the IGP-DIincreasedby 28%
affecting dramatically the cost of the state debt.

Third, the decline in Brazilian growth diminished Federal transfers and Ceara' tax revenues,
further complicating thefiscal situation. Three years (2001-2003) of negative or weak growth
seriously prejudiced CearB's fiscal situation. The CearBICMS declined 11% in2002 and the
Federal Government's FPE(Fundo de Participaglio de Estados), the tax source for revenue
sharingbetween federal and state government declined 15971, also resulting in an important
reduction inconstitutionally mandated Federal transfers to states. The reduction of federal
transfers impactedmore heavily Ceari and other less developed states, which are more
dependent upon federal transfers than developed states, with larger tax bases.

ZZ.     Improved 2004 Resultsbut ContinuedFiscal Challenges
On the revenue side, preliminary data through November, 2004 indicates that tax revenue should
increase inreal terms by 11%, more than 10% o f state GDP. This increase was possible owing
to strong economic recovery in 2004 and strengthened tax collection effort. The Brazilian
economy's growth in 2004 should exceed 5%, the highest in 10years2. The Cearii economy
accompanied Brazil's economic recovery. KBGE (the FederalGovernment's statistical bureau)
data indicate that through November, Cearii industrial output growth exceeded that for Brazil
suggesting that Cear6 growth will equal or exceed Brazil growth. The growth of the Brazilian
economy benefited Cearii through increased federal taxes and consequent intergovernmental
transfers and spurredCearii's recovery which increased State tax revenues.

Cearii achieved a primarybalance of R$98 million, which was lower than the 2003 primary
balance target o f R$ 116 million or 0.45% of state GDP-the target negotiated with the National
Treasury Secretary (STN) inthe Fiscal Adjustment Program for 2003-05. Given economic
conditions in 2004, the Government will exceed by perhaps R$30-50 million the target agreed
with STNof R$170 million or 0.65% of state GDP inthe Fiscal Adjustment Program for 2004-
2006.

This fiscal turnaroundwas accomplished through significantly increasing revenue and reducing
expenditures. The adjustment strategy was largely dictated b y the rigidity of public spending
characterized by highcurrent mandatory expenditures. As a consequence, the Government was
obliged to increase taxation and reduce investment expenditures which severely constrained
economic growth.
Growth and improvements in tax administration contributed to the increase intax revenues. But
most of the increase was obtained through one time measures to recover tax debts. The State was
able to increase tax revenue through rescheduling of tax debt payments and relief on interest
payments and fines for those indefault. While these measures increased revenues in 2004, they
could have a negative impact inthe longer run since tax debt relief tends to create an incentive
for future defaults.
More important was the adjustment on the expenditure side. As a consequence of the budget
rigidities embedded inthe Constitution and laws, public investments bore the brunt of the
adjustment. Accelerating a trend begun inthe late 1990s, Cearii government investment fell
from 1.8% of state GDP in 1998 to 0.4% in 2003. Investment expenditures executed with State
Treasury funds in 2004 fell to R$ 120million -- 0.4% o f state GDP and only 28% of the State's
Annual Budget Law (LOA) authorization for 2004 of R$420 million (1.3% of state GDP).
Considering the totality of state public sector expenditure (direct and indirect administration), the
investment shortfall i s even more striking. In2004, total investment expenditures were R$394
million (1.2% of state GDP) or only 20% of the Multi-Year Plan (PPA 2004-2007) and L O A
investment programs for 2004 o f R$ 1.9 billion.
While the near-term growth prospects for the Brazilian and Cearense economy are favorable, it i s
 clear that the combination of increased taxation and reduced investment have had a strong
 adverse effect on economic growth. A number o f studies point to emergingbottlenecks in


  Accumulated growth up to the 2004 third quarter achieved 5.3% and shouldend 2004 with arate 5.5%

physical infrastructureresulting from fiscal adjustments and the recent economic ~cenario.~     The
bottlenecks constrain resumption of stronger economic activity andconsequently threaten
sustainable expansion, thereby makingfiscal adjustment even more difficult.


III. ThePrimary SurplusChallenge

Figure 1demonstrates that the most critical period i s 2005-2007, the period covered inthe first
APL. It is worth noting that the primary surplus requiredto cover the State's financial
obligations inthe next years i s about 3% of state GDP (R$600-750 million), a level that i s
unlikely to be achieved given that the state has not generated a primary surplus above 1% over
the last eight years.


                                                FIGURE2

                  1.0% ,                                          ,

However, primarysurpluses of this magnitude are not necessary for debt sustainability. Given
the low State indebtedness (less than 20% of GDP), its cost (real interest rate of 6%) and
reasonable assumptions about economic growth (long runrate of 3%-3.5%), primary surplus
levels can be much lower without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability. The primary surplus
necessary to maintain the debt ratio stable i s given by the long rundebt dynamics equilibrium
equation:
                                     Ps" = [(r - g)/(l   + r)(l + g)] d
where Ps* i s the primary surplus that stabilizes debt to GDP ratio, r is the average real interest
rate, g i s the real growth rate of GDP and d i s the debt to GDP ratio.
Using the correspondingfiguresfor Ceard, theprimary surplus required to guarantee debt
sustainability is only 0.42% of GDP. Hence, Cearii does not need to undertake an enormous
fiscal effort to guarantee debt sustainability in the longrun. Furthermore, Cearii's fiscal
difficulties are mainly the result of the accumulation of debt service payments inthe short run
rather than an unsustainable fiscal stance. Nevertheless, the State needs to increase its current

fiscal effort to return to a sustainable path for primary surplus, which i s higher than the results
observed inthe last five years.

Due to its low indebtedness level, Ceari can use the Fiscal Responsibility Law sanctioned space
to obtain financial support that will allow a smoother adjustment than that required to meet its
short term financial obligations. Financial relief inthe form of the Ceari SWAP will guarantee
debt sustainability, continuation of the investment program and maintenance of basic service
provision. The loan requires a medium term fiscal adjustment program and measuresto improve
theefficiency of venue cdec:tionandthe quality 0-fpublicexpenditures. Hence,inadditionto
its poverty reduction objectives, the operation establishes an annual disbursement profile over
the six year period, 2004-2009, that attends two objectives: flattening the debt service profile
and guaranteeing primary surplus levels compatible with debt sustainability.
The state must still maintain its fiscal effort observed in 2004 in order to return to a sustainable
path. Hence, the operation establishes annual minimumprimary surplus throughout the life of
the CE APL. Annual disbursements were calculatedto achieve medium term debt sustainability
defined as primary surpluses of 0.42% of GDP at the end of the project period. The proposed
disbursement schedule and consequent debt restructuring, represented in Figure 3 by the shaded

bars, will reduce 2004-2009 debt service payments from R$700-750million to R$500-600
million, increasing repayments for the period 2010-2029. It also defines an increasing pathof
primary surplus from the 0.33% of GDP (2003) to 0.42% of GDP (2006 through2009.)


This base case scenario assumes agrowth rate of 3.5%, a real interest rate of 6 percent, annual
inflation of 5.5%, and an exchange rate devaluation of 5%. The results are highly sensitive to the
assumptions. A debt simulationexercise was performed with three different scenarios for
assumptions. The base case primary surplus levels leadto a sustainable path for the debt to GDP
ratio under optimistic and baseline scenarios, but fail to guarantee debt sustainability in an
adverse scenario. Hence, the State's primary surpluses can not be lower than the levels
established inthe World Bank program. Lower levels or a worsening of macroeconomic
environment could endanger the State's fiscal sustainability. For this reason, the Ceari APL
conditions disbursement on meetingannual primary surplus benchmarks.

A.     Why CeariL-Performance Management

The Government of Ceari, with support from the Federal Treasury, approached the World Bank
to request loan assistance to help the State implement its development agenda and provide
essential services over a difficult six year period, 2004-2009, when revenues are constrained and
Federal debt repayments are especially high. The State's fiscal constraints are undercutting its
ambitious development agenda and poverty mitigation efforts, including plannedinstitutional
reforms. CearB has earned a reputation as one of Brazil's best run states notwithstandingits
poverty and difficult fiscal situation. Hence, over the last decade, Cear6 has been a leading
recipient of Bank loans. It has also been the focus of, and participatedin, numerous Bank
studies.

A central theme underlying the CE APL is its strong emphasis on results-based management and
one of the strongest factors mitigating infavor of the CE APL i s the State's record of fiscal
prudence, reform and performance management. It i s expressly because of recent CearB
performance intargeted sectors that the loan proposes retroactive disbursement of 20%. A recent
IPEA (Government Research Institute) survey of all Brazilian states' progress inaddressing
social conditions for the decade 1993-2003 found that Cear6 has advanced more than any other
state. Of particular interest are the following study findings linked to CE APL disbursement
conditions.

B.      Sector Choice

Followingincreasingly common Bank practice inBrazil and elsewhere, an `integrated', multi-
sector approach to Cearfi development was developed. The Brazil CAS pipeline for 2004-07
includes some 15 "integrated" operations.

The Bank and client agreed thatfiscal sustainability and social inclusion should be the primary
pillars driving project development and that results-based management should underpindesign
and reform initiatives. Client development agenda priorities, CAS and ESW priorities were
evaluated to identify leading sectors. Evaluations of sector needs and capabilities nine sectors
were undertaken jointly by sector specialists (see table 4.B. 1.). Three Development Axes were
identified -Human Development, Sustainable ResourceManagement, and an umbrella Public
Sector ManagementAxis that will address modernization and reform incentral and line
secretaries. Within this framework, six primary sectors were identified as essential to Cearfi's
development and social equity. The six will be supported by the CE APL: Health, Education,
Water & Sanitation, Water Resource Management, Environment, and Public Sector
Management.


                                           Table 4.B.1.

Inaddition, anAPL trigger condition was set for the development and implementationof an
historickultural corridor inthe center of Fortaleza that will substantially enrich the other cultural
attractions inthe locale. And an analysis of the Social Inclusion and Youth Secretaries were
undertaken and a Sector Planelaborated and agreed with the Government to be included inthe
Secretaries' own Strategic Sector Plans.


C.      Conditions of Disbursement (Indicators), APL#2 Triggers, & Strategic Sector Plans

Bank teams working with clients developed diagnostics and results-based programs for the CE
APL. Inthe process of identifying leadingissuesto be addressed, the teams also developed
indicators to be usedto measure progress. The results are summarized below and inthe Sector
Plans, which follow.

All disbursements will be made against Eligible Expenditure Programoutlays usinga
disbursement percentage of up to 35%. Disbursement conditions have also been established for
various disbursements.

The third disbursement of $25 million requires completion of six results-based Strategic Sector
Plans by the Government intargeted sectors. The fourth and fifth disbursements of $25 and $30
million respectively require the following general conditions:

        a. Annual increase inthe primary surplus of at least 5% starting with the 2003 baseline
            figure
        b. Satisfactory implementationof the Bank's three portfolio loans, to be decided in
             accordance with the protocol explainedinthe table below (Table 4.C.1.)

Disbursement conditions have been established for each of the 6 sectors. Each sector has 1-3
disbursement-linked indicators for a total of 13 that are also conditions of disbursement for the
fourth and fifth disbursements. The value attributedto these indicators i s the total disbursement
amount divided by 14. Hence the indicators will be valued at about $1.78 million ($25414) and
$2.14 million ($30414) respectively-a       20% `incentive' to achieve the second year's
benchmarks. Also, for the amounts in any of the 5 sectors with EEPto be disbursed, a minimum
agreed expenditure level for each of the sector's EEP will need to be met. This i s to protect each
EEPandensure that significant GOCexpenditures take place. The disbursement mechanism i s
explainedinthe disbursement sections D&Ebelow.

1.   Health. The sector is considered a good practice inBrazil and the "Health Agent"
     Program (Agente de Saude), has gained national and international recognition. The
     Bank diagnostic revealed that maternal and infant mortality and morbidity were the
     most important issues confronting the State's health apparatus. Consequently, the
     Sector Plan establishes indicators for infant and pre and post natal maternal medical
     consultations. It also requires institutional strengthening across the numerous
     institutions, agencies, and public care givers. Accordingly, indicators require
     expanded population coverage by Family Health units, sets staffing levels and
     provides for training directed at infant and maternal health. Institutional
     strengthening includes improvement inclinics, performance contracts between the
     Health Secretary and municipalities and M&E and reporting inregional hospitals and
     Centers of Regulation. Finally, several important initiatives impacting vulnerable
     populations are addressed including pharmaceutical and dental programs and the
     creation of emergency care units.




                                                                55

2.   Education. The Bank has an ongoing CearAeducation programthat continues to
     struggle owing to lack of counterpart funds and bureaucratic delays inprocessing
     budgets and expenditures. Hence, Bank knowledge of the sector i s extensive. CearB
     also benefits from the Federal FUNDESCOLA Program.

     The Bank mission determinedthat sector priorities included: (i)     continued progress in
     eliminating illiteracy among individuals 15 years of age and older, (ii)  increased
     learning achievement b y implementing a `follow-up' cycle for SPAECE (State) and
     SAEB (Federal) test results, and (iii)   improvedmanagement of the Secretary's
     organizational overhead expenditures-including        CREDEs (regional education units).
     The remainder of the program will focus on basic institutional strengthening efforts
     common to other education systems including: (i)      career reform, (ii)
                                                                             performance
     `management, and (iii)   resolution of fiscal issues surrounding the decentralization of
     State primary schools to municipalities.

3.   Social Inclusion& Culture. These sectors will include no disbursement-linked
     indicators and only one Culture APL#2 trigger. The Culture project converts the old
     area inthe center of Fortalezainto an historic quarter and tourist attraction.

     The CE APL, which has social inclusion as a defining pillar, also includes a Sector
     Plan program to support the Social Inclusion and Youth Secretaries that were set up
     two years ago under Governor Alciintara. Although considered among the "best
     practices" inBrazil, they are not without problems. These secretaries are small
     (Social Inclusion has a staff of 12) and without self-managed projects. Rather, they
     are charged with liaising with the large secretaries to ensure that important programs
     affecting the most vulnerable populations and youth are coordinated and
     implemented. They also perform monitoring and evaluation. Social Inclusion tracks
     53 indicators of varying priority across at least eight large secretaries responsible for
     related program delivery. The Secretaries face problems with focus and mobilizing
      stakeholders to carry out key programs.

The SustainableResourceManagement Axis

1.    Water Supply & Sanitation. The Bank Team confirm that the State water company,
      CAGECE,and the State regulatory agency, ARCE, represent "best practice" examples
      inBrazil of WSS provision and regulation, respectively. Nevertheless, expansion of
     WSS services, andcmtinud improvement of their financial andoperational
      efficiency, are deemed priorities by the State and Bank teams. Consequently, CE
     APL indicators will include increasing WSS coverage. Another indicator will focus
      on CAGECE's profitability by establishing targets for its operating ratio. New State
      WSS legislation, tariff and subsidy analyses, and CAGECEaccounting reforms, are
      other important initiatives. The Sector Plan will be rounded out with a variety of
      institutional strengthening initiatives that will improve the efficacy of service
      provision, including in small communities (under the SISAR program), strengthen
      ARCE's regulatory capacity through municipal agreements, and diagnose CAGECE
      business units, private sector participation, and finances.

2.      Water Resource Management. Sector management by Secretary of Water
        Resources - SRH, and its associated institutions: COGERH, the State WRM
        company, and SOHIDRA, which i s responsible for the water infrastructure works.
        The WRM Sector inCearii i s also considered a "best practice" inBrazil. Sector
        priorities incorporated into the plan as indicators will include: (i)
                                                                            water legislation
        reform; (ii) charging different categories of water users; (iii) the construction of
                                                                       and
        key water infrastructurelinking the Castanhao dam with the Metropolitan Region of
        Fortaleza and eventually to a large number of communities inthe large area traversed
        by the canals. Priority institutional strengthening efforts inthe Sector Plan will
        include: (i) registration of water users; (ii)upgrading of systems; and (iii)
                                                                                    consequent
        monitoring and evaluation of water availability and usage of the CearB's vital network
        of dams and reservoirs.

3.      Environment. The overall management of this sector has been undistinguishedand
        as a result, the State faces serious problems that could adversely affect important
        industries, including tourism. However, performance i s improving. Inan effort to
        further promote progress, Bank staff and SEMACE officials agreed on priority
        programs including: (i)   the creation two "limited use protected areas" of at least 5,000
        ha. each-the    State's first--in the vulnerable caatinga and carnauba biomes; and (ii)
        completion of economic and environmental zoning (ZEE) inkey biomes throughout
        the state including the coastal, caatinga and hill areas. The Sector Planwill also
        include critical coastal management in an attempt to minimize the depredation caused
        by unplannedand predatory development, and reformof environmental legislation.
        Other CE APL program priorities will include: efforts aimed at managing forest
        reserves and recuperating some 80,000 ha devastated by desertification, management
        of protected areas, licensing, upgrading of cadastres, and monitoring and evaluation
        across a number of areas including water and air quality, solid waste, forest raw
        materials consumers, and fish and shrimpfarmers.


ThePublic Sector Management Axis

This `umbrella' axis will address central and line secretaries' programmanagement with an
emphasis onfiscal sustainability and social inclusion. It will therefore target policy reform,
institutional strengthening and efficiency. Inaddition to primary surplus targets which have
been elevated to general disbursement conditions, fiscal programs will target several areas
including:
    0   FiscalManagement. The CE APL requires (disbursement condition) the
        maintenance of primary surplus targets in 2005 and 2006 o f R$134 million and
        R$147 million respectively to ensure fiscally sustainable growth. It also includes as
        triggers a debt servicehet current revenue ratio o f no more than 1.4 and the effective
        operation of the newly created Fiscal and Results-based Management Committee
        (COGERF) to oversee and manage the state's short and longer term fiscal and
        financial affairs. To support management of contingent fiscal risks and liabilities, the
        CE APL supports strengthening o f the government capacity for strategic management
        of legal cases against the State.



                                                57

           Revenue Administration. A CE APL disbursement linked indicator calls for tux
           revenue/GDP of 8.5% or more, increasing to 9% in2007. The Sector Plan targets
           revenue diversification across sectors (to be measured with the Herfindhal Index), and
           effective control of tax evasion and arrears in an attempt to increase State revenues.
           Upgrading of asset management is another area to be addressedunder this rubric and
           includes establishment of a new policy and central asset management unit, the sale of
           public assets, upgrading of management and accounting, and inventory policies and
           practices.
           ExternalAudit. Based uponthe SFAA, a large programwas identified including
           indicators, triggers, and a $1million technical assistancecomponent to upgrade
           policies, framework and to provide training and IT equipment. IFIDB i s successful
           indeveloping aloantargeting Federal and states' audit agencies itwill take over this
           TA activity.
           Social Security. Cear6 social security administration is also a `good practice' in
           terms of implementation of new laws andregulations. The Sector Plan includes the
           establishment of a new administration (gestor unico) as required by the Federal law.
           DuringAPL#2, the feasibility of acomplementary pension fund andupgradingthe
           cadastre for all public servants including the Executive as well as the Legislative and
           Judicial branches, will be considered.

Results-basedmanagementalso occupies a privilegedposition inthe Public Sector
Management approach. First, six Sector Strategic Plans will be prepared by six target Secretaries
following COGERF (Fiscal & Results Based Management Committee) guidelines and assisted
by expert consultants. This has been elevated to a condition for the third disbursement of $25
million. The Plans will guide development, budget allocation and provide the basis for
monitoring and evaluation. In addition, there i s a trigger condition requiringevidence that
COGERF i s functioning according to its mandate, overseeing periodic budget allocations
according to program priorities and the development of performance reports.

Through the technical assistance component, the CE APL will support gradual introduction of
results-based management procedures inthe government. The objective i s to buildthe
government's institutional capacity inperformance goal setting (through strategic planning),
results-oriented monitoring and evaluation of priority programs, andeventual utilization of
performance information inkey policy andbudgetary decision-making. The initial emphasis
will be on fostering the capacity of SEPLANto coordinate the performance management cycle in
a handful of priority sectors with a view toward eventual rollout government-wide.

D.       DisbursementAmount

Cearii approached the Bank with the support of the Treasury Department to obtain loan financing
to enable it to continue implementing its development agenda while repaying Federal debt as
requiredunder its Federal Debt Agreement. The State faces a pronounced bulge in debt
repayments over the 2004-2009 period which, coupled with slow growth, has seriously reduced
its capacity to maintain operations. The annual disbursement amounts were calculated based on
updated State financial projections, including revenues, costs and debt obligations, impact of the
disbursements on the primary surplus, State commitment to the demanding CE APL reform
agenda, and a State request to front-load the operation to the extent feasible to help it cope with
2003-2004 shortfalls that have reduced discretionary investment expenditures to half of their
PPA budgeted targets andjeopardized provision of essential services. After runningnumerous
iterations, the Bank and GOC agreed on annual ceiling loan disbursement amounts presented
below. Annual amounts are carefully calibrated to notjeopardize primary surplus targets.

1.       EEP. There are nineEligible ExpenditurePrograms (EEP) whose quarterly and 12-
month expenditures will be pooled and verified and against which a percentage (up to 35%) of
CE APL loan funds will be disbursed up to the annual disbursement ceiling that has been pre-
established. The nine EEP are large PPA programs linkedto the State's priority development
agenda, fiscal sustainability and social inclusion objectives (see Table1 intext). The amounts
that have been projectedfor 2004, 2005 and outer years represent the State's best estimate.
Table 4.E.2 provides the projected disbursement amounts.

One of the EEPs includes the "Municipal Participation from FUNDEF"program which
contributes about $140 milliodyear to the pool. The program comprises about 60% municipal
teacher salaries and 40% school maintenance costs. Inclusion i sjustified for several reasons and
i s also allowed under the Bank's new disbursement guidelines. First, the programprovides a
large part of the funding of municipal schools which are largely responsible for primary
education and also cover the poorest regions. Second, these are State funds that are obligated
under Federal law to be pooled with municipal and Federal funds inorder to support municipal
school operations consistent with a legally mandated costlstudent formula. Hence, these funds
support salaries of municipal teachers and not State employees. Third, because Ceariihas
decentralized primaryeducation to municipalities more quickly than other states, in compliance
with the 1987 Constitutional reform, and because Federal contributions have been curtailed (a

fact contested by Cearh and other states in Federal courts), infact the State i s paying from $130
to $150 milliodyear over the period 2004-2007 to sustain municipal schools, which constitutes a
huge resource drain and one of the principal fiscal reasons that the State i s requesting a Bank

    including their scope, content, and the use o f indicator based performance measurements.
    Consultants will be retainedto assist six targeted sectors inthe preparation of the Plans. The
    targeted Secretaries include Health, Education, Social Inclusion, Infrastructure (WSS), Water
    Resources, and Environment. These plans will guide the State's development agendas,
    budget formulation and allocation, monitoring and evaluation and will serve as prototypes for
    the remaining Secretaries.

4. Conditionsfor fourth andfifth disbursement
      a. Primary Surplus Condition. The fourth and fifthdisbursements will have as
          conditions of disbursement achievement of a primary surplus calculatedto increase at
          5%/year starting at 2003 as a baseline. This condition i s to assure prudent fiscal
          management and assist the State in achieving fiscal sustainability. The targets are as
          follows.

              Primary surplus targets are
              2004            R$l20 mi

      b. "Satisfactory Rating" for 3 Bank portfolio Loans. Protocolshavebeen agreed
          determining what constitutes "satisfactory" for the 3 loans (see in Annex 4, Section
          C, Table 4.C. 1.)which include:
              o Ceari Water Management (#45310) which is fundingthe construction of the
                   Castanhao canal and completion i s a condition of disbursement
              o CeariBasic Education(#45910) which is fundingthe loan's disbursement
                   conditions, triggers, and Sector Planbenchmarks
              o CeariRural Poverty Reduction Project (#46260)
      c. Disbursement-Linked Indicators. There are 13 such indicators across 6 sectors.
          They have the same value which i s the relevant disbursement amount ($25m or
          $30m) divided by 13. They are conditions of disbursement. If EEPexpenditure and
          all other conditions are met then these amounts can be disbursed providing evidence
          satisfactory to the Bank of their achievement i s presented.
      d. Sector EEPDisbursement Condition. For the amounts corresponding to the
          Disbursement-Linked Indicators to be disbursed, at least 70% of the projected(Table
          4.E.2) EEP $Re& amounts must be expended ineach EEPfor the 12 month period.

5. Pooled EEPs & Disbursement Percentage. The EEPprogram expenditures will be pooled
   and the loan will disburse up to 35% of the reported EEP expenditures up to the annual
   disbursement limits which must be maintained owing to primary surplus concerns. By
   "pooled" it i s understood that EEPexpenditures will be aggregated for purposes of
   calculating loan disbursement without regard to individual EEPdisbursement amounts.

6. Disbursement to Treasury. Loandisbursement will go to the Secretary of Finance (Treasury
   Department). With the exception o f Technical Assistance, no CE APL funding i s dedicated
   or obligated to any of the EEPs. There i s also no requiredEEP incrementality and loan funds
   will go directly to Treasury andbe commingled with other GOC resources to be usedas the
   Government sees fit.

F.      Technical Assistance Sub-component

CearA and the Bank have agreed that up to $4 million intechnical assistance will be provided to
strengthen institutions and support achievement of loan benchmarks. Some $3 million in
specific activities have been identified and preparatory work has begun. A $2 million
contingency has been provided to cover external audit needs should IDB's PROMOEX loan not
be implemented and other TA needs. Inthe event all of this TA funding i s not neededit will be
reallocated to one or more of the EEP expenditure based disbursements.

Most TA funding will support Public Sector Management Axis initiatives including (i)      an action
plan derivedfrom SFAA and Capacity Assessment recommendations, (ii)         an action plan derived
from SPAR and Capacity Assessment recommendations, and (iii)       a broad-based agenda targeting
fiscal and results-based management. Technical assistancefor other axes i s limited to
institutional strengthening work inthe water supply & sanitation sector. Note that each Sector
Planconstitutes a challenging institutional strengthening effort for the corresponding Secretary.
However, Bank technical assistancefunding i s limited inthe targeted sectors because a decision
has been taken to fund the work from alternative sources. Inthe case of procurement, education
and WRM agendas other Bank loans will be drawn upon. IDB loans will also fund PSM and line
secretary activities identified in the Sector Plans. CearA PPA budget allocations i s also an
important technical assistance funding source. CE APL funded TA components are described
below.


1. PublicSector Management TechnicalAssistanceSub-Components

a. Financial and Internal ControlComponent

CEAPL project preparation and the State Financial andAccounting Assessment (SFAA) were
carried out simultaneously, ajoint workshop was convenedto confirmpublic sector and
fiduciary management programs, and a $1.7 million technical assistance component was agreed
to implement the SFAA action plan. The most pressing issue uncoveredby the SFAA was the
needto upgrade External Audit. Once concluded, the diagnostic was usedto structure an IDB
loan component which will address the same problems. The IDB loan PROMOEX will take
over the $1million component. The Controllers Secretary will receive $650,000 to implement
performance monitoring. InTreasury, $180,000 will be spent to support the development of a
management framework and single account concept including IT support.

b. Procurement Component

This was originally a &activity, $1.9-million component. However, the GOC, recognizing the
importance of the proposed work program, funded two large components (reform of procurement
processes and the project portal) and part of a third (cost reduction strategies for important
categories of expenditures) reducing the SWAP component to 3 items for $600,000. The two
programs taken together will substantially improve Ceari procurement, address important SPAR
and Capacity Assessment issues, and should result in a `good practice' example in Brazil. The
current components include the following
   0   Cost reduction strategies for 8 important categories of expenditures ($530,000). Note
       that the first four categories resulted in annual savings of $10-15million.
   0   Pilot of a new administrative model for managing hospitals through contracting out
       ($17,000).

H.       Justifications for Retroactive Disbursement


A retroactivedisbursement of 20% of loan proceeds against EEPexpenditures is allowed by the
Bank. This has been incorporatedinto the CE APL and i s fully justified on the basis of need and
performance as indicatedbelow.

State Need. Cear6 i s one of Brazil's poorest states. Annex Idescribes the economic
environment that resulted in serious underfunding o f critical State investment programs that will
end 2004 at less than 30% of PPA and budget authorization amounts. The State's development
agendahas been seriously jeopardized and without the Bank's intervention there i s little
likelihood that state modernization, social inclusion and fiscal sustainability goals can be
achieved. Debt repayment obligations are also highfrom 2004-2009 exacerbating the situation.

State Fiscal Performance. Cear6 has followed a path of fiscal adjustment-increasing                     tax
revenue and containing expenses-to           cope with its difficult fiscal situation. The State has been


                                                         95

relatively well managed and the finance situation i s sustainable when compared with most other
states and especially those in the Northeast. Debt indicators are lower and have been maintained
at a level well below the ceilings established by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). The net
consolidated debt/net current revenue ratio i s 1.15, versus the Brazilian states' average of 1.79,
and the LRFceiling i s 2.0. Thepersonnel expenditurednet current revenue ratio i s 41%, versus
the Brazilian average of 45%, and below the LRF ceiling of 50%. These results have been
maintaineddespite constrained growth and reduced taxes and Federal transfers, which has a
largerimpact on poorer states.

Performance Management. It is important to note that CearB i s credited generally with being
one of Brazil's best managed state governments. It has a strong record of reform and sensitivity
to social inclusion and fiscal sustainability concerns. The decision to incorporate retroactive
disbursement takes into consideration the importance of recent and continuing reforms inkey
sectors targeted by the loan. These are enumerated in Section 4.A and Table 4.1 above. A recent
PEA studyhas also established that CearBi s the State that has most progressed inimproving
social conditions over the past 10years. Hence, there i s a very real link between recent levels of
effort, reforms and results-based performance whichjustify a retroactive disbursement.

Loan Design. Finally, it shouldbe noted that the State has helpedprepare and committed to a
demanding loan design that exceeds SWAps and most SILs interms of performance-based
results including significant disbursement conditions, APL triggers and Sector Plans. This also
warrants recognition and supports the retroactive disbursement. Retroactive disbursements have
long been allowed under Bank loans. The current level i s 20% against 12 months of activity.
The recent India SWAP (the India Elementary Education Project)disbursed 20% retroactively
against Eligible Expenditure Program expenditures.

I. CeariiAPLGrowthImplications
The CE APL contributes importantly to CearB's growth agenda in several, critical ways. First,it
addresses fiscal sustainability, recognizedinthe CAS as a precondition for long run, sustainable
growth. Fiscal sustainability i s incorporatedthrough conditions of disbursement and triggers
including: primary surplus, tax revenue/GDP, revenue diversification debthet current revenue.
CE APL Sector Plans also include sector specific tariff and expenditure reforms. Supporting
institutional reforms include strengthening of the External Audit function, functioning of the
Comite Gestor, and implementation of the social security system's Gestor Unico.
Second, in the short runthe budget support would allow the state to implement its investment
program which isessential for growth. The PPA has been cut significantly due to the State's
highdebt obligations andreduced revenues. Inthe last two years, less than a thirdof the
investment program was executed and without the CE APL it i s highly probably that further cuts
would be needed. Infrastructure bottlenecks and reduction o f essential services wouldjeopardize
the returnto sustainable growth even given the favorable near-term growth prospects
Third, growth requires quality State expenditures. The public sector management program
includes development of Cear6 Secretaries' Strategic Sector Programs incorporating CE APL
indicators, triggers and Sector Plans, and monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, each sector
program includes institutional strengthening and reforms addressing expenditure targeting and
quality issues and these are embedded inthe indicators and triggers. Quality expenditures



                                                  96

increase the growth impact of State investments. And these sector programs will serve as
prototypes that will be extended to other sectors promoting similar reforms.
Fourth, the Health and Educationcomponents, through fiscal and institutional strengthening will
enhance human capital also crucial for growth.


Fifth,the reforms inkey infrastructure sectors (WSS,WRM) sponsored by the CEAPL impact
on economic growth by alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks that inhibit growth prospects.
Support of EEPs, institutional reforms to strengthen management o f CAGECE and COGERH
and the regulatory authority, ARCE, plus the adoption of outputkoverage benchmarks should
result inbetter resource allocation, increased productivity and an improved environment for
private sector participation. Environmental reforms governing the exploitation of natural
resources including coastal areas will also contribute to sustainable growth objectives.

                             Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
              BRAZIL: Cearii Multi-sector Social InclusionDevelopment Project

SWAps emphasize usingexisting organizations and systems. Consequently, a small Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) of full-time staff under the immediate supervision of the head of the
SEPLANResearch Institute (ZPECE)--which has been the main counterpart duringpreparation--
will manage the loan. The main PIUfunctions will be:


    0    Overall project management and World Bank reporting responsibility
    0    NoFinancialManagement specialist is required. The PIUwill receive and vet quarterly
         reports from the Secretary of Finance used for determining disbursement against EEP
         expenditures prior to passing them on to the Bank. It will maintain financial records for
         the small TA component.
    0    N o Procurement specialist i s required. The PIU will oversee and vet TA procurement
         which will be done in specialized secretarial units.
    0    The PIUwill maintain all relevant records.
    0    The PIU will retain at least one higher level staff to oversee progress towards meeting
         disbursement and APL#2 benchmarks including Sector Plans.

The PIUwill also aggregate and vet end-of-year sector reports addressing achievement of
disbursement linked indicators (and APL triggers in 2006) prior to providing them to the Bank
and will prepare any waivers including requests for partial or late reimbursement.

The PIUwill also respond to any legal, regulatory or political questions that may arise inrelation
to the implementation of the CE APL project and ensure that any legal requirements incumbent
upon the State and related to the carrying out of the project are met. Inthis regard, it i s expected
to support and facilitate Bank supervision of the agreed environmental safeguards framework.
For instance, the Bank and the GOC have agreed that the State will, duringthe first twelve
months of project implementation, formally apply to IBAMA for a license to regularize
operation of the ocean outfall that discharges sewerage collected inFortaleza. The outfall was
designed and operates in an environmentally sound manner and didnot require such a license
when built. Obtaining one now would reflect a regularizationo f the State-Federal relationship
that has since been established inBrazil with regard to environmental regulation. The loan
agreement will address this matter through a loan covenant, providing also that the State will
facilitate the IBAMA licensing review and implement its recommendations, if any, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank. If the Bank determines that the State i s not incompliance it may, at its
discretion, suspend disbursements against WSS eligible expenditures inFortaleza inthe APL #1
andor exclude themfrom APL#2 operations.

              Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
             BRAZIL: CearsiMulti-sector SocialInclusionDevelopmentProject

                             Financial Management Arrangements

All financial management aspectsof the project will be managed by the Finance and Planning
Secretariats in conjunction with a Project ImplementationUnit (PIU) at IPECE (Secretary of
Planning), usingthe current systems and existing organizational arrangements inthe State.

The Secretary of Finance i s responsible for managing the State's financial management system
(SistemuZntegrudode Contubilidude -SZC) which i s a robust information system designed to
comply with the State's fiscal and budgetary laws. SIC has budgetary andfinancial execution
modules that allow it to track the State's program expenditures against budget. It i s centralized
at the Secretary of Finance and extends to all executing agencies responsible for State budget
execution, including Secretariats like Education, Health, Infrastructure, Transport and others.
SIC identifies the programs (EEP)that will be supported b y the Bank through accounting codes
where all sources and uses of funds will be recorded. Financial statements will be produced on a
regular and timely basis basedupon this information.

The Secretary of Finance keeps a single treasury account, connected to SIC, where payments
originate. SIC captures automatically all the records required for producing financial reports.

The SFAA evaluated the robustness of SIC and concluded that it can provide financial
information for the purpose of supporting the Bank project. Adequate internal control
mechanisms and procedures are also inplace.

Staffing. There will be a Secretary of Finance liaison person who will prepare financial
management reports. This person will maintain contact with the PIU and track eligible
expenditures and assure that reports are prepared in a timely and satisfactory fashion.

The PIU will also liaise with the participating Secretariats and Tribunal de Contusto verify that
the requisite audits are done and made available to the Bank. Currently, the participating
Secretariats are staffed with financial technicians who understand the State accounting and
financial processes and who operate SIC.

Finally, the PIU will be the point of contact for the World Bank team. It will support Bank
supervision providing, as needed, a bridge to participating Secretaries. It will respond to Bank
requests for information, both regular reports and ad hoc inquiries relevant to project
implementation, financial management, procurement, disbursement, and sector issues. It will
host the annual end-of-year meetings at which the final accounting of eligible expenditures and
performance against benchmarks are assessed, disbursement calculated, and new benchmarks are
set.

ProgramExpenditures Component. This component finances about $144 million of program
expenditures meaningthat the Bank will periodically disburse a percentage of Eligible
Expenditure Program (EEP) expenditures. The expenditure mechanism satisfies Bank policy, in


                                                 100

particular OP 6.0's three pillars (a) expenditures are productive, (b) they contribute to solutions
within a fiscally sustainable framework, and (c) acceptable oversight arrangements are inplace.
Specifically, inrelation to cost sharingthe State has demonstrated ownership and commitment
for these programs. However, State funding of the targeted EEP and many other programs has
been threatened by a combination of factors-funding       of discretionary investment expenditures
i s less than 30% this past year and social safety net programs are also constrained. The Bank i s
filling a temporary financial shortfall and Bank assistance will help the State to achieve
sustainable growth and satisfactory, increasingprimary surpluses.

  Loan disbursements will include a retroactive disbursement against actual EEP expenditures
incurred followed by three 6 month advances against projectedEEPexpenditures and a final
disbursement against actual EEPthat will conclude the loan and reconcile disbursement
conditions and Bank disbursements. Annual disbursements are capped in order to assure that
primary surplus targets are met and to better meet client funding needs while assuring that
sufficient incentives exist to complete the entire program of loan activities and benchmarks.

Regarding the financing of recurrent costs, Bank funding fills a temporary gap caused by a
combination of several years of recession and a period of unusually highdebt payments. The
State will be able to sustain these recurrent costs after the project as State finances are expected
to improve and debt payments will be less and public sector modernizationinitiatives will
contribute to growth and greater liquidity.

All financial management reports containingEEPprogramexpenditures will bepreparedby the
Secretary of Finance liaison person. Preparation o f quarterly financial and accounting reports by
the Secretary of Finance i s part of the normal routine required b y the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
These reports show program expenditures ineach quarter compared to the budget and variation
and will be used for the documentation of eligible expenditures financed with Bank advances.
The reports will also show achievement of, primary surplus, Sector Strategic Plans (2005) and
portfolio, targets and disbursement-linked indicators. An appropriate format for the required
reports has been agreed and the ability of the Secretary of Finance to generate themhas been
verified. They will also be used by the Bank and client to calculate the end of year disbursement.

Finally, client and Bank resources that will finance EEPexpenditures will be pooled as the Bank
will disburse its percentage of these expenditures to the State Treasury. Hence, the auditor will
be responsible inthe year-end audits for determining that EEPeligible expenditures, excluding
negative list items and any sub-programs that have been expressly excluded, are sufficient to
jmfiy(exceed) B& disbttrsemeRts.

TechnicalAssistance Component. Upto $4 million of the Ceara APL will be dedicated for
technical assistance expenditures including studies and expert consultant assistance for public
sector modernization initiatives and fundingfor the project implementation unit. These funds
will be disbursed and accounted for similar to normal sector investment loan procedures. Bank
procurement and disbursement rules will be used for these activities and eligible expenditures
incurredwill be reimbursed usingBank statements of expenditures (SOEs).




                                                  101

Accounting Procedures and Policies. The State's accounting procedures and policies will be
followed and be the basis for preparation of project Financial Statements. These accounting
policies and procedures reflect the Fiscal and Budgetary Law. The State has consistently applied
these public accounting standards which are acceptable to the World Bank (cash-basis
accounting i s the methodology to be used). These statements will be audited in accordance with
acceptable auditing standards. A section covering Financial Management will be included inthe
Operations Manual and will provide guidance on applying the State's financial and
administrativeroutines, procedures and policies to the project.

ExternalAudits. It i s a Constitutional requirement that the State Court of Accounts - Tribunal
de Contusdo Estado (TCE) verify the Governor's account every year and submit a report to the
Legislative Assembly for approval. The Bank will receive a copy o f this report ineach year. In
addition, the TCE "discharges" Public Administrators' annual financial statements. The Bank
will require a copy of the discharge issued for each Administrator responsible for an [EEP].
Copies of the annual audited Governor's report as well as the certificates of discharge will be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end o f each fiscal year.

The External Audit risk rating i s "high" inthe table below. Chronic understaffing and
insufficient attention to maintaining standards has resulted inaudit delays and backlogs. Despite
it's weaknesses, the TCE i s acceptable as the project's external auditor, satisfying minimum
acceptable standards as verified in the SFAA and its performance inother Bank portfolio loans.
This is also consistent with the SWAPapproach of reliance upon client systems. Furthermore,
the project includes an APL trigger condition that addresses the need for timely audits and
reduction of the audit backlog. It i s worthwhile noting that the IDBhas also accepted the TCE as
its external auditor for its PROMOEX loan which i s initiating a nationwide state audit
organization strengthening effort that includes Ceara.

The Bank developed together with the TCE, and as part o f the SFAA and Ceara APL design
exercises, a $1million technical assistancecomponent to strengthen TCE performance.
However, the component was incorporatedinto the IDB's PROMOEX loan andwill be
implemented at the same time as the Ceara APL. PROMOEX progress will be monitored closely
and contingent funds have been set aside to cover TCE initiatives should Ceara's PROMOEX
program for any reason not go forward.


                        Disbursementsand Flow of Funds Arrangements

Disbursements will be based on quarterly expenditure reports prepared by the Secretary of
Finance as part of normal Government of Ceara (GOC) reporting arrangements. The reports will
identify program expenditures incurred inthe programs supported by the Bank under the project
thereby facilitating the calculation o f Bank financing.

 Inaccordance with normal Bank procedures, disbursements will be for eligible expenditures
 incurred or to be incurred under the program. Disbursementswill also be subject to
 disbursement conditions as described below:

Indicators. As further detailed inthe Operations Manual, decisions on indicators will be made
on the basis of GOC reports to be presented to the Bank with necessary documentation verifying
that they have been satisfied. The Bank will, at its convenience and with the full assistance of
the State, verify the findings presented in these reports. Should there be any discrepancy found
such that the satisfaction of the indicator i s not validated then the Bank will, at its discretion,
determine whether none or partial compensation i s justified

RetroactiveDisbursement. The project includes aretroactivedisbursement of up to $29
million to take place immediately after Loan effectiveness This retroactive financing relates to
eligible expenditures already incurred inthe previous 12 months prior to signing [2004/5].The
Bankwill require acopy of the annual audited Governor's report for FY04as well as relevant
discharges of Public Administrators Accounts to be submittedby June 30,2005.

Bankingarrangements. Bank disbursements will be from the loan account to the State
Treasury single account maintainedby the Secretary of Finance inBrazilian reals. U S dollars
will be exchanged with the Brazilian Central Bank, as customary, to make the disbursements. A
Special Account will not be used. The State's accounting system can be reliedupon to record
the use of Bank resources so a Special Account to separate Bank cash i s not required. The
Treasury will disburse to the EEP and other programs as usual except that particular care will be
taken to ensure that disbursements to EEP are timely and sufficient to ensure conditions of
disbursement are met.

             BRAZIL: Cearh Multi-sector Social InclusionDevelopment Project


A.       General

The proposedoperation i s a $240 million, two loan multi-sector Adaptable Program Loan (APL).
Itmakes use of the Sector Wide Adjustment Program (SWAP) modality to support critical
programs and policy and institutional reforms aimed at promotingfiscal sustainability and
social inclusion inthe State of CearB. The first APL is $149m for the period 2005-2007. The
second i s for $89m and covers 2007-09. The operation's innovative design calls for: (i)
disbursements directly to the CearBTreasury and not to SWAP programs, (ii) SWAP  nine
programs whose expenditure will be pooled and against which up to 35%/year can be disbursed
providing the predetermined ceiling amount i s not exceeded, (iii) an initial retroactive
disbursement of $29 million, (iv) a system o f disbursements that includes annual ceiling amounts
to be disbursed and disbursement advances. See Annex 4.E.2 Disbursement Table.

A total of $4 millionintechnical assistance (including approximately $3.0 million inTA and
approximately $2.0 incontingencies) i s contemplatedto support the implementation of key
activities identified in SFAR and SFAA action plans plus state modernizationinthe public sector
management and Water Supply and Sanitation sectors. TA inother sectors will be funded from
non-Bank sources. Bank procurement guidelines, including a procurement plan, will be prepared
for the loan's technical assistance component. However, since funds flow to the Treasury and
there i s no SWAP program incrementality, it has been determined that no procurement plan will
be requiredfor the SWAP program expenditures. Since this i s a SWAP modality loan,
procurement under each of the nine Eligible Expenditure Programs will continue to be done
makinguse of local laws, procedures, systems and organizations subject to caveats below and
reiteratedin the loan agreement. The Capacity Assessment, the State Procurement Assessment
Report and a series of Bank loans, including in targeted sectors, confirm that the Government i s
capable of carrying out procurement satisfactorily for this operation. It i s also worth noting that
the CE APL technical assistance component and a second Bank loan are funding a significant
state procurement reform, based inthe SPAR, that i s expected to result in a "good case" example
among Brazilian states.

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection andEmployment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreedbetween
the Borrower and the Bank inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan for the TA
component will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Request for Proposals will be used for
Bank-financed ICB goods and consultant services, respectively. For NCB procurement of goods,
the Economic Research and Strategy Institute of Cearii (Instituto de Pesquisae Estrategia
Econo'micade Cearci-ZPECE)will use the model standard biddingdocument issuedby SEAIN
(Secretaria de Assuntos Znternacionas.)The electronicpregco may be used as an alternative to
the shopping method for off-the-shelf items inall project components. The project procurement
method for each category i s summarized in Table A of this Annex.


World Bank-FinancedProcurementof Goods

Under the Technical Assistance Component, goods will be procuredby the individual Secretaries
makinguse of their procurement unitsand the process will be overseenby IPECE's procurement
unit, and consist of computer equipment, peripherals, software, printingservices, communication
equipment, and logistics for workshops and training. The following methods will be used for
this project:

    0  International CompetitiveBidding (ZCB). Goods estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent
        per contract or more may be procuredthrough ICB procedures. The package associated
        with the procurement of computer equipment and audit software to be installedinthe
        Tribunal de Contas do Estado and the Tribunal de Contas do Municipos (totaling of
        $660,000), identifiedduringproject preparationwill be coveredby IDB's PROMOEX
        funds. Therefore, there are no ICB packages currently contemplated under this loan.
    0   National CompetitiveBidding (NCB). Goods estimated to cost more than $100,000 but
        less than $500,000 equivalent per contract may be procured under contracts awarded
        through NCB procedures. Duringpreparation, one contract to purchase computer
        equipment and audit software to be installed inthe Comptrollers Secretary for $360,000
        was identified as eligible for procurement under this method.
    0   Shoppingandpregao. Goods estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per
        contract, may be purchased on the basis of shopping procedures, including a form of such
        shopping, the electronic biddingprocurement system @regao eletronico). A total of
        $655,000 will be allocated to finance eligible goods including such things as office and
        computer equipment and supplies for the PCU and scattered printing services, small
        technical services, computer equipment and peripherals, office equipment and logistics
        for training events and workshops.

Procurementimplementationand Supervision

Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) for hiringof international consultant
services, and purchase of goods under the ICB procurement method mustbe publishedinthe
United Nations Development Business. The Notice needs to be updated annually for outstanding
consultant services and ICB goods. Detailed consultant services and assignments will be
advertised, on the basis of availability, in at least one national newspaper o f a large circulation.
The participating Secretariats may also seek "expressions of interest" by contacting embassies,
professional organizations, or firms that they know or that are registered inDACON' (in
accordance with paragraph 1.15 of the Guidelines for Selection and Employment of
Consultants). Inthis case, the information required would be minimum, limited to make a
decision on the firm's suitability. Sufficient time (but not less than 15 days) will be provided for
responses, before preparing the short lists.

ProcurementRecords. Detailedprocurement records, reflecting the project's supply of goods
and consultant services, including records of time taken to complete key steps inthe process and
procurement activities related to supervision, review, and audits will be maintained by the
Operations Department at each of the participating Secretariats. These records will be maintained
for at least two years after the project's closing date. The records for goods will include the
followings: public notices, biddingdocuments and addenda, bidopening information, bid
evaluation reports, formal appeals by bidders and outcomes, signed contracts with related
addenda and amendments, records on claims and dispute resolution, and any other useful
information.

Schedulingof Procurement. The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurementplan for the
tasks to be carried out duringproject implementation. The procurement plan for the TA
component consists o f (i)     procurement plan for the project's goods, including applicable
procedures and process scheduling; and (ii)       a consultant and training providers selection process
plan for the project's training and consultant services, including applicable procedures, selection
criteria, etc.

The procurement plan and consultant selection process plan will be updatedperiodically, and
shall be submitted to the Bank inJanuary of each year. Such updating shall include (a) list of
contracts completed, under execution, under procurement, to be procured inthe upcoming
calendar semester and, tentatively, inthe subsequent semester; (b) costs o f completed and under
execution contracts, estimated costs for upcoming contracts; (c) schedule of biddings. The
mkmgimtmetiomwillbein &e Operatha1bktmd,wkiehwillcontain standardbidding
documents, request for proposal, formats for reporting on procurement, forms of contract,
timetables, model of TOR, and any other relevant information related to procurement.
Prior Review. The Bank's procurementreview will be made inaccordance with Appendix 1of
the Guidelines for Procurement and Appendix 1of the Guidelines for Selection and Employment


'A numberof   consultingfirms or full-timeprofessionalswho wish to work with any member of the World Bank
Group are registeredwith the World Bank's DACON Center. (Registration i s done through the web-site of the
Center or by contactingdirectly the Center at: DACON Center, World Bank, Room# MC10-446, 1818 HStreet,
N.W., WashingtonD.C. 20433, USA, Fax: (202) 522-3317, Email: dacon@worldbank.org)

of Consultants. A review process similar to individual consultants will apply to training and
workshops.

The following bidding processes will be subject to the Banks prior review (refer to Table A1
above). The adoption of the alternative of specifying the said thresholds in the procurement
schedule of the Loan Agreement i s recommended:


        0    all I C B tender processes, irrespective of the estimated amount of the contract;
        0    all firms contracts estimated to cost the equivalent to US$200,000 or more. In this
             case the following documents will be reviewed: terms of reference, requests for
             proposal, short lists, terms and condition of contracts as well as evaluation reports and
             recommendationfor award;
        0    all individual consultant contracts estimated to cost the equivalent to US$50,000 or
             more, in which case the qualification, terms of reference, evaluation justification, and
             draft o f the contract will be forwarded to the Bank and will be awarded only after the
             Bank's concurrence. A review process similar to individual consultants will apply to
             training and workshops.

Ex-Post Review. All biddingprocesses regardless of their value are subject to ex-post
procurement review. All documentation including terms of reference, biddingdocuments, and
requests for proposal, bids or proposalreceived, communication regarding all bids either prior or
following of award of contract and any subsequent amendments should be maintained until at
least two years following the closing of the project.

Frequency of procurement supervision missions. The Bank will carryout ex-post and
supervision missions on procurement twice a year.


B.       Assessment of the agencies' capacity to implement procurement

Under the Technical Assistance Component, procurement activities will be carried out by each of
the participating Secretariats. This i s in line with the SWAP design feature, which encourages
the use of the existing systems. The decision to make use of in-house procurement systems and
capacities i s further rooted inthe satisfactory rating of the State's procurement management
capacity inthe recent SPAR coupled with the positive procurement capacity assessments (CAPs)
and favorable procurement management track records of the principal participating Secretariats
inrecent Bank sponsored operatiom2


* Refer to emails 05/17/04, E.Jimenez to Chris Parel, TM: One indicated that apart from SEINFRA and SDLN
CAPs that were undertaken for the purposed of this project, other SWAPL secretariedagencies responsible for EEPs
would not requireheed CAPs and were satisfactory based upon work undertaken for other Bank operations. These
include: Small Municipalities Project (SEINFRA, CAGECE); Family Health and Education Project (Ministry of
Health); CastanhalProject, PROGERIGH, and PROAGUA (SRH); Ceard Education Project (Ministry of
Education).
    A secondemail (05.17.04- 10:20am) explains that the CAP of WSS, SEINFRA, and CAGECE was undertaken
as part of the Small Municipalities WSS; the Secretariat of Health was assessed under the Family Heath Project; and
the Secretariat of Education was assessedduring the Ceard Education Project. Finally, since the amount to be

allocated to the Ministry of Environment would be less than $4-5 million, there would be no needto undertake a
CAP. Hence, no more capacity assessmentwork would be necessary.


                                                        113

0   The selection of core PCU staff, the procurement of Office and computer equipment and
    supplies; and the contracting of external auditing services will be undertakenby the PIU
    within SEPLAN--IPECE, ($130,000).

Contingencies
0   Management of contingencies or any other financing needs that may arise duringthe
    project's implementation up to a total of $2,118,000, will fall under the auspices of the PIU

ProjectImplementation. A core group of staff comprisedof (i)Head, who will be the Head
                                                                            a
of IPECE, (ii)    a Coordinator; (iii) qualified technicians; and (iv) Secretary will make up the
                                         1-2
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the IPECE. The PIU's role will include overall
coordination as well as consolidation of the Technical Assistance Component's procurement and
auditing functions. Specifically, the key responsibilities to be undertaken by the PIU will
include: (i)  consolidation and submission of the project's annual procurement plan for
consideration and approval by the Bank; (ii)         coordination of procurement requests; (iii)
monitoring of results indicators for the TA subcomponent and preparation o f end of year reports
for purposes of verifying loan disbursements; (iv) validation of Eligible Expenditure Program
expenditures inthe lSt,     2ndand 4thquarters for purposes of verifying loan disbursements(v) the
maintenance and consolidation of financial records associated with TA under the loan for
auditing purposes; and (v) the annual contracting of an independent auditing firm.

As explained above, procurement activities will be carried out by each of the participating
Secretariats, by makinguse of in-house procurement units, systems and procedures. The overall
project risk for procurement i s ranked as average, based on the satisfactory rating of the State's
procurement management capacity inthe recent SPAR,3 together with the positive procurement

 SPAR`Shave beendone inonly 2-3 Brazilian states. A procurement component was funded (and a SFAA action
plan) within the loan, developed in collaboration by WB staff (Efraim Jimenez) and CearB. I t originally was
estimated at $1.6m and included:
-Redesign of the purchaseprocess for key categories of purchases;

capacity assessments (CAPS)? and favorable procurement management track records of the
major participating Secretariats inthe latest Bank supported operation^.^

As part of an ongoing effort to upgrade Cear6procurement, a significant (and innovative) effort
i s being undertakenthat goes well beyondwhat i s usually contemplated. Ceari may well
constitute a `best case' in Brazil when this work i s completed.

The CPAR for Brazil, dated March 2004, indicates that the use ofpregao and other modern
procurement methods will add efficiency and transparency to procurement. Other specific issues
concerningprocurement for implementation of the Eligible Expenditure Projects and relevant
sectors have been identified in the existing CAP (inthe project files). The risks and main
concerns regarding procurement incomponent Secretaries (Infrastructure and Regional
Development) include transparency and predictability o f the agencies' implementation o f the
procurement process. Issues identified include: recordfiling systems, need to consolidate
procurement scattered instructions, need to organize a continuous training program (SEINFRA),
and newness, flow of documents, recordfiling systems, need to organize a continuous training
program, and need to consolidate procurement scattered instructions and develop official
standard documents (regarding Regional Development).6 Since SWAPmodality operations
make use of existing client systems and procedures it i s expected that the ongoing reforms and
TA programunderway and includedinthis loan will resolve many of these issues and transform
Ceari into a state prototype.

Regardingthe $5 million inprocurement for the TA component that i s coveredby Bank
procurement guidelines, standard measureshave been agreed, including: audits, post reviews,
and recommendations of prior review thresholds for ICBs and other procurement methods.


C.        ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation, which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team duringnegotiations and i s available at the Secretaria do
Planejamento e Coordenacao, Instituto de Pesquisa e Estrategia Econdmica de Ceara`. It will
also be available in the project's database and inthe Bank's external website. The Procurement

   (a) List of consulting assignments with short-list of international firms.

   N/A.

   According to paragraph 2.7 of the WB Guidelines - Selection and Employment of Consultants
   by WB Borrowers (May 2004) and the Thresholds for Procurement Methods, Prior Review, and
   Standard Disbursement Percentage, listed inthe Brazil CPAR (March 2004), the short list may
   comprise entirely national consultants (firms registered or incorporated inthe country) if the
   assignment i s below the ceiling approved by the Bank (not exceeding inthe case of Brazil

US$500,000). Underthe procurement plan for the project, there is no consultancy, inwhich the
amount exceeds the above mentioned ceiling, therefore there will be no short-list of international
firms.

(b) Consultancy services and single source selection of consultants (firms) for assignments
estimated to cost above $200,000 per contract will be subject to prior review by the Bank.

(c) Short lists composed entirely of national consultants: Short lists of consultants for services
estimated to cost less than $500,000equivalent per contract, may be composed entirely of
national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines.

EligibleExpenditureProgram(EEP) Procurement
As was previously mentioned, local procurement rules and procedures will be used for EEP
expenditures with the following exceptions.

0   ICB will be applicable to civil works contracts estimated to cost US$10,000,000 or more, and
    to contracts for goods estimated to cost US$500,000 or more;
0   Consulting firms' contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 or more will be procured under
    QCBS procedures and individual consultants contracts estimated to cost US$50,000or more
    will be procuredin accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of the

                           Annex 9: Economicand FinancialAnalysis
              BRAZIL: CearhMulti-sectorSocialInclusionDevelopmentProject


Cearii has elaborated a strong development agenda prioritizing fiscal sustainability and poverty
reduction. Due to its difficult current fiscal situation, the State, with support from the Federal
Treasury, applied to the World Bank for assistance. The CE APL will assure that CearA i s able
to carry on its development agenda and meet its fiscal obligations while improving cost
effectiveness and expenditure quality.

Fiscal sustainability and cost effectiveness are targeted through the setting of disbursement
conditions, APL#2 triggers, Sector Planbenchmarks and institutional strengthening initiatives
(see Annex 4). These include a number of initiatives that will generate not only significant
improvements in expenditure efficiency and quality but also increase revenues and reduce
expenses. For instance, it i s reasonable to assume that procurement and social security reforms,
contemplated inthe technical assistance (TA) component and Sector Plan respectively, could
generate $15-20million annually in savings based upon previous experience-a                  pay-back period
of roughly 7.5 to 10 years. Hence, there are grounds to believe that the CE APL can generate a
reasonable return on investment.

At this time, conceptual anddata limitations make it difficult to define with precision most CE
APL costs andbenefits. However, the table below identifies expected financial and economic
gains.

                                   FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY

The operation i s supported by the Federal Treasury, which also confirmed the State's
indebtedness capacity to assume the loan. The GOC's financial soundness was addressed
through inclusion of conditions of disbursement, triggers and Sector Plan benchmarks as
indicated above. Loan disbursement caps were established in order to preserve the primary
surplus conditions requiring growth inthe surplusby 5% annually beginning with a 2003
baseline.

 Fundingi s expected to benefit the Stateby enabling itto


    0   relaunch its development agenda including investment expenditure which has fallen to
        around one quarter of budgeted, and
    0   achieve growth and fiscal sustainability while addressing a broad social inclusion agenda.

The project i s a SWAp, disbursement i s to the Treasury, and there i s no dedicated finance
beyond the approx. $4 million technical assistance component. There i s no required
incrementulity in expenditure or outputs beyond what i s currently plannedby the Government.
Hence, there are no loan linked increases inrecurrent or investment costs and the operation will
support the Government's current fiscal situation including repayment of debt obligations. The
loan will disburse at a rate of 35% of Government expenditures innine Eligible Expenditure
Programs (EEP), which will be pooled. There are no counterpart funding requirements other
than a sector disbursement condition requiring expenditure ineach EEPof at least 70% of the
realistically projected annual expenditure level.

              BRAZIL: Ceari5Multi-sector SocialInclusionDevelopment Project

  SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

I. Overview

This annex describes the project's environmental and social safeguard implications, and the
mechanisms for ensuring that Bank supported activities are managed incompliance with the
safeguard policies. The assessmentsand arrangements outlined below are included inthe
project's Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), which will be part of the
Project Operational Manual.

A.      Project Background, Structure and Safeguards Applicability

The Ceari Multi-Sector Reform APL supports, through fundingand capacity building,key
programs across sectors, which contribute importantly to the State's development agenda. Nine
Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP) covering six key sectors are beingsupported by the
operation. The operation i s an Adaptable ProgramLoan (APL) usinga Sector Wide Approach
(SWAP)modality. Loandisbursements will be against pooledEEPexpenditures usinga
disbursement percentage of up to 35%. Loan proceeds will be disbursed to the State Treasury.

The CeariAPL supports State and Bank priorities through
                      ~~
        disbursements against EEPexpenditures and a requirement that at least 70% of projected
        EEPbudgets are actually expended
        conditions of disbursement requiring satisfaction of primary surplus and loan portfolio
        implementationbenchmarks
        conditions of disbursement requiring satisfaction of 13 benchmarks linked to the EEP
        across the six target sectors
        APL#2 triggers linked to the EEP across the six target sectors.

Notwithstanding the fact that the CE APL does not disburse funds directly to sector programs
and makes use of important sectoral conditions o f disbursement, it makes use of the investment
lending instrument and disburses against expenditures. Hence the targeting of EEP and sector
activities triggers the requirement that the operation perform due diligence to ensure that Bank
safeguard policies are satisfied. It should also be clarified that these EEP are specific line item
budget programs whose content and purpose are specific to the achievement to limited and
identifiable objectives and EEPexpenditures for each program are captured and reportedby the
accounting system. Inother words, the CE APL is supporting specific programs and not the
reform of entire sectors, and the Safeguard policies will apply to these specific programs and not
to entire sectors.

The purpose of this document i s to demonstrate that the Bank's safeguard policies, which have
been reviewedby Bank experts during loan preparation, are and will continue to be complied
with duringloan implementationowing to measures already inplace and application of the
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), which consolidates the Borrower's


                                                 121

 safeguard-related obligations in accordance with the discussion below. The ESMFhas been
 agreed b y the State Government and will be implemented over the course of the loan. It was also
 translated and published on the State's website on the Internet and a formal memorandum
 committing the State to carry out these activities has been received and i s archived inproject
 files.

 B.      SafeguardCategory

 The overall safeguard category of the project i s Category "A" owing exclusively to fact that it
 co-finances one component of another Category "A" Bank-financed project. Inall other
 respects, the CearA Multi-Sector APL would be categorized a "B" under the Bank's
 Environmental Assessment policy (OP/BP 4.01) because of their more limitedpotential
 environmental and social impacts. More specifically, the "A" designation stems from the
 inclusion inthe CE APL as an EEP to be financed by the loan the counterpart fundingfor the
 Bank operation "CearB State Water Resources IntegratedManagement Program"
 ("PROGERIRH", BR-PE6449). This loan was approved by the Board in 1999 at which full due
 diligence was performed as required of Category "A" projects. Documentation is available in
 project files attesting to this and project supervision confirms that infact the client i s in
 compliance with Bank safeguard policies andcommitments undertaken at the time of project
 approval and signing. Continuing supervision of PROGERIRH safeguard policies will be relied
 upon to verify that Bank safeguards are being respected throughout the life o f the loan. This i s
 explained in greater detail below;

C.       Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

It should be noted that the operation benefits the State by ensuring safeguards compliance over a
multi-sectoral agglomeration of programs. It should also be noted that Ceariihas been the first or
second largest Brazilian stateBank borrower for a decade. Current portfolio projects include
loans for WRM, education, rural poverty reduction, and a Federal urban transit project. Also, an
urban/WSS project closed last year and a follow-up project, which will stress regional
development, has recently been approved by the Federal Government. The State also participates
inmany of the Federalprojects that constitute 50% of the Brazilian portfolio. Consequently, the
Bank knows well Cearii's institutional capacity to manage safeguard policies. Insome areas,
such as resettlement policy, the State i s considered to be good or best practice inBrazil.

D.       Summary of CE APL SafeguardsStatus

communications rather than expend resources and efforts on a general announcement approach
which would be easier but far less effective. Infact, each sector i s characterized by a unique

11.     Detailed Presentation of EEPSafeguards Impact and MitigatingProcess
        Frameworks

Inwhat follows therelevant safeguardsanalyses andprocessframeworks arepresented.

A.      Study of Rehabilitation of the Historic Center of Fortaleza (Cultural Property OPN
        11.03).

The CE APL includes as an APL#2 trigger condition the requirement that a $30,000 study be
completed to define a cultural-historic corridor rehabilitation project inthe center o f Fortaleza.
The area inquestion i s centered along Rua Dr. Joao Moreira (street) and would include, inter
alia, the following landmarks: Seminario da Prainha (1864), a public library (collection
froml867), Sao Jose Theater (1915), Nossa Senhora da Assuncao Fort (1649), large central
market of handicrafts and local foodstuffs, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Fortaleza (1978), a
tree-lined public aredplaza dating from 1824, the Santa Casa da Misericordia (1843, and the
tourism center, an ancient prison (1866) and several theaters. Inclusion o f a new art museum
with a significant collection i s also contemplated.
                                                                                                 ~




As part of loan preparation a brief survey was carried out. The area inquestion is run-down and
has lost its economic dynamism, hence the project being contemplated would also contribute to
urbanrenewal andeconomic rejuvenation. It would also integrate the target area with the large,
dynamic neighboring Dragao do Mar cultural center and surrounding businesses that today
constitute one of the main city attractions. The project i s supported by the Government and
received specific input from the Culture and Tourism secretaries. Part of the economic benefit i s
hoped to come from creating a legitimate tourist attraction that would induce visitors to spend
more time inthe center city.




                                                     128

Because the CE APL trigger requirement i s a study and no actual rehabilitation work i s expected
duringproject implementation the initiative i s benign and should invoke no Safeguard concerns.
However, should the project be funded and implemented with APL#2 funds then the Bank would
ensure that due diligence i s done with regardto OPN 11.03, Cultural Property.

B.      Managementof HealthCare Waste DisposalRelatingto HealthEEPs(OPBP4.01)

A Bank specialist reviewed the two Eligible Expenditure Programs included inthe health sector
program: Primary Health Care and Secondary & Tertiary Health Care. Civil works (i.e.,
hospital construction) are not includedinthese programs. The review considered existing
legislation and regulations governing hospital waste disposal and evidence of compliance with
these regulations inhospitals and the network of community health centers that comprise the
State's Family Health Program (Programade Saude Familiar).

Regardinglaws and regulations, health care waste disposal i s governed by Brazil's National
Organic Law #8080 of 19/9/1990, which establishes norms and defines the State health system
("Sistema Unico de Saude"--SUS) as the competent agency for elaborating and ensuring the
enforcement of norms. Resolution RDC number 33 of February, 2003 elaborates technical
regulations for the management of medical waste. Cearii State Law established norms governing
waste disposal in a Portariadated April 1994 that i s still ineffect. The laws and regulations are
sufficiently detailed and comprehensive, drawing upon a sophisticated Brazilian health and
biosecurity capability, to ensure that if properly carried out Cearii would do a satisfactory job of
health care waste disposal.

The documentation used for periodic certification of hospitals was also reviewed and found to be
sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to satisfy health waste disposal requirements. The issue,
however, i s ensuring continued enforcement o f rules and good practice, as other Bank projects
have found that quality can gradually deteriorate. Inthis regard there was sufficient question
regardingthe surveillance data presented both in terms o f results, periodicity and
comprehensiveness to require interim enforcement of monitoring and evaluation and a full study
of the question of waste disposal duringproject implementation. A 2004 study of the 30 large
hospitals forming the regional hospital ("hospitais polo") network looked at hospital waste
disposal across ten categories including sewerage disposal, satisfactory receptacles including
plastic bags, internal transport, final destination, training and vaccination of staff for tetanus and
Hepatitis B, all items beingcovered by legislation and regulations. The results demonstrated
sufficient non-compliance to justify further interventions as described above. A second sample
of the performaw of municipal FamilyHealthProgramu & s ina healthm~crarqhx-(guahQ
                                                                                                       ~


also indicated some problems and possible inattention to satisfactory waste disposal measures.

Given this situation, this project will require interim enforcement of health care waste guidelines
along with enhanced monitoring and evaluation responsibilities to establish good practice inthe
short term. More specifically, the project will support the following mitigating measures as part
of the ESMF, which include a strong emphasis on consultation and participation:
    0   Federal and state guidelines will be redistributed to all clinics and hospitals inthe State
        System

    0   This mailing will be accompanied by a memo from the Secretary of Health emphasizing
        the importance of these regulations and the possible risksto health workers and
        communities if they are not followed
    0   The unit heads will be asked to discuss the policy with staff of the unit and post it

        provided for reporting and this procedure will be continued until such time as the hospital
        waste study i s completed and recommendations are formulated and implemented.

The project will require, duringproject implementation, a comprehensive study of the question
of health care waste management. This study will involve significant stakeholder participation
and will identify an actionplan for ensuringproper health care waste management inthe medium
and longterm, including suitable final disposal options. The terms of reference have been
agreed with the Bank. The study will be contracted in the first 12 month period following
effectiveness and will be concluded prior to project closing. Recommendations will be
incorporatedinto APL#2 as appropriate. The final report will be reviewed by the Bank and
made available to the public, and implementation of the action plan will be supported through
APL#2.

                   increase                                                     integration of river-
basins, (iv) rehabilitation of existing hydraulic infrastructure, and (v) watershed management in
selected microbasins.

PROGERIRH was rated as a Category "A" project because of the scale of the project works and
the nature of it's potential environmental impacts. The project also triggered the Bank's
Involuntary Resettlement policy. All of the necessary safeguard related work was prepared in
accordance with Bank policies, and the project was approvedby the Board in 1999. More
specifically, the project prepared an Executive Summary o f the EA, a Regional Environmental
Assessment Report (REA), a specific EA report of the subprojects to be implementedinthe first
year, and a Resettlement Operational Manual.

                                                                                      ~~



The Executive Summary i s available inthe InfoShop and inthe project files. It presents the main
conclusions and recommendations of the completed REA and the specific EA report of first year
subprojects, and the documents relative to the involuntary resettlement o f families inthe
undertakings of the Program. The EA summary also summarizes the environmental rules for
contractors that were applied to ensure construction related impacts were mitigated.

Specific issues addressed in the REA include: loss of natural habitats and protected areas;
environmental management of water release; cumulative water balance; salinization risks; fish
breeding; cultural, historic, and archaeological patrimony; water borne diseases; indigenous

peoples; induced regional development; and watershed management. Inaddressing these issues,
the REA looked at long-term and cumulative effects, developed environmental criteria for the
selection and implementationof infrastructure works, and examined relevant institutional
capacities.

The specific EA reports for subprojects foreseen for the first year were prepared in accordance
with Bank policies. It was found that the foreseen subprojects did not present significant
interference with environmentally fragile areas, natural critical areas, conservation units and
indigenous areas. They also did not present significant changes on the hydrological regime.
Where there were impacts, environmental management plans were prepared, which included
such provisions as reservoir operation rules, environmental education provisions, and water
quality monitoring, depending on the specific needs of the subproject. Social impacts were
generally positive, particularly regarding public health conditions being improved from increased
sanitation works and access to potable water. The main negative impacts were the resettlement
needs related to infrastructureworks, which were addressed through Resettlement Management
Plans prepared inaccordance with the Resettlement OperationalManual. The Resettlement
Operational Manual set forth the procedures and criteria used inthe characterization of the
population and area affected; the criteria and procedures to be adopted inthe elaboration of the
expropriation plan; and the necessary content of individual resettlement plans.

The primary consultation occurred on February2, 1999 through a public audience where the
contents of the state's water program and the findings of the REA were presented. Several
organizations were formally invited, such as the Water Resources Secretariat, its associated
organizations, SOHIDRA, COGERH and FUNCEME, SEMACE (the state environment
organization), and several NGOs.

The specific reports for the construction of the canal supported by the CE APL have been
reviewed and approved by the Bank, and the documents are available inthe project files. The
canal also received all necessary licenses from the Brazilian system, and the Bank i s monitoring
implementation through PROGERIRH. More generally, all applicable safeguard issues have
been examined inproject supervision, which has found that the client i s incompliance with the
policies and commitments undertaken at the time of project approval and signing. Continuing
supervision of PROGERIRH safeguard compliance will be relied upon to verify that safeguard
issues are being properly addressedthroughout the life of the loan. Further documentation on
this component is available inproject files.


D.      Involuntary Resettlement and Limitson Access to Resources Related to Protected
        Areas Creation

The Cearh Multi-Sector APL has as conditions of disbursement for the first loan the creation of
two protected areas of at least 5,000 hectares. The second APL loan will have a similar
condition. Roughly 70% of the Northeast of Brazil and over 95% o f Cearh i s categorized as
Caatinga, an arid, thorny, dry vegetation biome that i s rich inbiodiversity. It i s also a biome that
has been vulnerable to human depredation, most often from grazing and agrarian uses. Cear6 has
only 17 protected areas and no fully protected areas, comparing unfavorably with many other



                                                 131

Brazilianstates. It is for this reasonthat the creation of fully protected Caatinga protectedareas
i s considered a priority.

The funding o f the work of defining and setting up these parks would presumably come from the
EligibleExpenditureProgram, Biodiversity. Hence, it is incumbent upon the Bank andclient to
ensure that all relevant Bank safeguard requirements are satisfied. The protected areas will not
involve indigenous populations. A primarycriterion in selecting protected areas will be the
avoidance o f areas with resident populations. The caatinga is relatively sparsely settled but even
so, there i s the potential for triggeringthe Involuntary Resettlement policy (OPBP 4.12). The
selection o f Cear6 APL protected areas will be decided by the State Biosphere Committee. Once
selected, should OPBP 4.12 be triggered, the State will follow Bank Safeguard policies in
addressing any resultant issues as explainedbelow inthe Resettlement Policy Framework (for
physical resettlement) and ProcessFramework (for limitations on access to assets).

The Bank's Natural Habitat Policy (OPBP 4.04) i s considered triggered if there i s a potential to
cause significant conversion (loss) or degradation of natural habitats, whether directly (through
construction) or indirectly (through humanactivities inducedby the project). The creation of
protected areas has a primary objective of protectingnatural habitats, and hence OPBP 4.04 i s
not considered triggered by this component of the project.

ResettlementPolicy Framework

This framework sets forth principles and procedures to follow to ensure that if any physical
resettlement i s required, the project will comply with the Bank's Involuntary Resettlement Policy
(OPBP 4.12). Treatment of potential impacts on livelihoods resulting from limitations on access
to resources i s described inthe Process Framework.

Principles. Principles will include: (i) avoid as much as possible resettlement; (ii) avoid as
                                           to                                             to
much as possible community life disruption; (iii)    to restore livelihoods by assuring at least the
minimumstandard of living previously existing; (iv) to assure affectedpopulationparticipation
inplanning and implementation of any resettlement activity; (v) to assure a cadastre of affected
populationbefore deadline, while it should be properly undertaken or made available; (vi) to
assure proper application of the eligibility principles below; (vii) to assure that displacement
does not take place before providing agreed alternative compensations; and (viii) to make
adequatemonitoring and evaluation possible.

Predicted Population. The affected population will be determined on a case-by-case basis by
means of technical studies that includes field surveys, social assessment, and broad consultations
with affected people. As the goal i s to avoid resettlement, as much as possible, predicted
affected populations i s estimated as very small or nonexistent.

Descriptionof ResettlementPlans Preparationand Approval Process. Assuming that the
options to avoid resettlement have been exhausted, the process for preparation and
implementation of the Resettlement Plans would include the following activities: (i)     census
surveys o f the affected populations including among others the data needed for the application of
the eligibility criteria for claims; land tenancy studies including the documentation related to



                                                   132

permanent assets that would be lost (for example, pastures, perennial crops, fences, houses), and
the documentation on community infrastructurethat would be lost (for example, churches,
football fields, etc.). The report would include the quantities and the qualification of goods
(dimensions, types of buildings and other features), and the cost estimates for reposition at
current market values; (ii)  participatory socio-economic studies to supplement census data which
would include detailed information on livelihood, formal and informal economic activities and
natural resources use, income levels, social-cultural features, local organizations and assistance,
community infrastructure and existing services such as sanitation, health and education, among
others; (iii)analytical report on alternative solutions and the characterization o f the resettlement
area, including a description and evaluation of the predicted resettlement area (e.g., physical,
social and other conditions); and (iv) definition of eligibility criteria and compensation packages.

Eligibility Criteria. Resettlement criteria for compensation for physical resettlement would be
based on census surveys and on evaluation of assets. Eligibility criteria for persons whose access
to assets for livelihood purposes i s limitedare described below inthe Process Framework.

Eligibility                                      Compensatioflreatment
Owners with titles over the land                 Compensationat replacement value for
                                                 land and assets, and compensation for
                                                 moving allowances.

                                                 deemed necessary and appropriate
Persons claiming residence without title         Reference to grievance redress mechanism,
and not identified at the time of the survey,    with other assistance as deemed necessary
and who are otherwise unable to                  and appropriate
demonstrate residence prior to survey

Borrower Laws and Regulations. The creation of protected areas (PAS)i s governed by the
Federal Law that created the National Protected Areas System (SNUC, Law no. 9985 of July 18,
2000). It i s well known to the Bank and has been invoked inresettlement for all of the Bank's
environmental initiatives including ARPA and other GEF operations. More specifically, the
Brazilian Caatinga i s addressedinUNESCO's Man and Biosphere program and the creation of
the National Council for the Preservation of the Caatinga Biosphere prompting the creation b y
the Governor's decree inApril, 2004 of the Cearii State Committee for the Preservation of the
Caatinga Biosphere. This Committee, chaired by the State's Environment Secretary. The
Committee's mandate indudes the elaboration of euafitingu policies, guidelines, anhetion plans
including creation of protected areas and care of resident populations regarding quality of life.
The Committee comprises 14 members, seven from the Government and representing Secretaries
whose activities impinge upon the environment and seven from civil society. The latter include
representatives of NGOs, the scientific community and the private sector.

OrganizationalProceduresfor Delivery of Compensations. The procedures for delivery of
compensation payments to the resettled populations will be coordinated by the SEMACE in
partnership with the Institute for Agricultural Development o f the State of Ceara-DACE.




                                                  133

These procedures will be basedon the Resettlements' Operations Manual prepared by the
Secretariat for Hydraulic Resources-SRH which follows IBRD guidelines. The Manual defines
the procedures for resettlement andidentifies these procedures as those comprised of the
following stages:

                --  Cadastre of properties
                    Public information campaign aimed at affected population It would report on
                    procedures and aim to motivate these populations to prepare for the process of
                    resettlement.
                -   Payment of compensation packages for seized properties
                -   Confiscate/Appropriate properties
                -   Resettlement of the population

Grievance Redress Mechanisms. Affected populations will have their rights to present
grievances guaranteed. These grievances may be presented duringresettlement gatherings where
all stakeholders inthe process participate inPublic Assemblies. Grievances may also be
presented directly to SEMACE offices, through the SEMACE telephone (0833101-5562 hotline,
via fax at (085) 3101-5511or through SEMACE's internet webpage www.semace.ce.aov.br. In
SEMACE, these activities are implementedby the Coordination Office for Control and
Protection of the Environment - COPAM, under the management of Dra. Maria Dias
Cavalcante.

Arrangements for Funding Resettlement. The overall costs of resettlement are expected to be
low because of the expectation that PASwill be sited in sparsely inhabited or uninhabited areas.
Fundswill be providedby the State Treasury through special budgetary allocationsfor SEMACE
and D A C E .

Consultation and Participation
    (i)     PA selection will require a consultative process involvingthe input of stakeholders at
            all levels. This will include field visits, surveys and open-ended interviews with
            representatives from all key communities. Focus groups and discussions with local
            experts will be held to determine the main issues that are of concern to local
            communities with regardto conservation and use of PA resources, and how best to
            ensure their participation inproject benefits and decision-making in areas directly
            affecting them.
    (ii) Thedevelopmentofmanagementplansmustalsobedoneinconsultationwithlocal
            populations and interested parties. Good practice inPA management planningand
            implementation encourages civil society participation through the formation of a local
            advisory committee or multi-stakeholder groups to ensure that all legitimate interests
            are represented. Such groups will be established for parties affected by economic
            displacement in and around the PA sites. These groups will be consulted on the
            development of PA management plans, involved in decision-making and invited to
            take part in monitoring o f these plans. The local councils could also serve as a forum
            for resolution of conflicts related to MPA social issues. The analysis carried out in
            the steps above would be done with the active participation o f local communities
            through the local advisory councils or other representative groups.



                                                  134

Monitoringand Evaluation
    (i)     Independent of supervision by other authorities and the Bank, it will be the
            responsibility of the CE APL Project, and inparticular, the role of the PIU
            Coordinator to closely monitor these tasks, including causing SEMACEto undertake
            periodic participatory assessmentsby project beneficiaries, with publication of the
            results thereof. To ensure that management objectives are being met and to ensure
            that project goals are being achieved. Supervision missions by Bank Staff will also
            be usedto periodically monitor progress in implementation of the Process Framework
            and of the PA Management Plans and Operational Plans which would serve as the
            Action Plans for this framework.
    (ii)    Satisfactory carrying out of these guidelines will be considered an essential CE
            APL#1condition and will constitute an APL#2 trigger condition.

Process Framework

Notwithstanding low population densities, the possibility remains that some Project activities
mightaffect the livelihoods of certain groups living within or adjacent to these sites through
access restriction. This Process Framework outlines the criteria andprocedures which the CE
APL will follow insuch cases to ensure that eligible, affectedpersons are assistedintheir efforts
to restore or improve their livelihoods in a manner which maintains the environmental
sustainability and territorial integrity of the relevant PA. Inall cases where traditional resource
users are affected by new restrictions in access or use associated with the Project, the
Government and Project will seek to address the livelihood issues of these persons in a manner
which i s transparent, just and inaccordance with the law and consistent OPBP 4.12. Inthe
preparation of management plans, the following actions relevant to the livelihood concerns of
residents or neighbors of the PA will be carried out.

Legal Basisfor Restrictionson Use of Resources. The Federal, state and municipal
governments have the Constitutional authority, and by SNUC law, to establish through decrees
areas inwhich restrictions on use of natural resources are enforced.

Evaluation of Each PA
    (i)     A rapidevaluation of basic ecological and socioeconomic factors and conditions in
            and surrounding PASincluding legal and policy analyses and land tenure issues, will
            be undertaken inthe context of PA planning. Inthese evaluations, resources usedby
            local populations (type of use, frequency o f use, destination) and the cultural and
                              chat-acterkthof theusers asmell as their leyr=Lo f e c " I L
                                                                                                    ~


            dependency, will be identified and assessed.
    (ii)    An assessmentof the needto restrict access to previous users of PA sites and the
            types of uses allowed will be carried out along with an analysis of eligibility of these
            users for economic mitigation assistance under O P B P 4.12.

Consultationand Participation.
    (i)     PA selection will require a consultative process involvingthe input of stakeholders at
            all levels. This will include field visits, surveys and open-ended interviews with
            representatives from all key communities. Focus groups and discussions with local



                                                   135

            experts will be held to determine the main issues that are of concern to local
            communities with regardto conservation and use of PA resources, and how best to
            ensure their participation inproject benefits and decision-making in areas directly
            affecting them.
   (ii)     The development of management plans must also be done inconsultation with local
            populations and interested parties. Good practice inPA management planning and
            implementation encourages civil society participation to ensure that all legitimate
            interests are represented. Accordingly, a local advisory committee or other
            representative group, as appropriate, will be established for parties affectedby
            economic displacement in and around the PA sites. These groups will be consulted
            on the development of PA management plans, involved indecision-making and
            invited to take part inmonitoring of these plans. The analysis carried out inthe steps
            above would be done with the active participation of local communities through the
            local advisory councils or other representative groups.

Identification of Mitigation Measures.
            Inthose cases where new restrictions on the use of resources inPA sites result in
            significant economic displacement of legitimate resource users, mitigation measures
            to help offset this economic loss will be supported under the project. Assessment of
            the eligibility of affected groups and the kinds of mitigation measures to be provided
            will be conducted with the participation of local people, following the principles set
            forth in OPBP 4.12. These assessmentswill include, inter alia,
            0   Census surveys of affectedpopulations including data needed for application of
                eligibility claims
            0   Land tenancy and permanent assets that would be lost including replacement
                value
            0   Community infrastructure foregone
            0   Socio-economic infrastructure including livelihood, formal and informal
                economic activities and natural resource use, income levels, local organizations
                and assistance, community infrastructure, utility services, health and education
            0   Analysis of alternative solutions
            0   Evaluationof potential resettlement areas and mitigation proposals
            0   Definition of eligibility criteria and compensation packages.
            People considered eligible for compensation or assistance due to loss of access to
            natural resources with the establishment or consolidation o f PASwould be identified
            inthe census and inother surveys previously mentioned, with special attention drawn
            upon the more vulnerable populations (including, among others, low income, landless
            people, elders, women and children, etc.).
            Local populations whose livelihoods do not depend on natural resources use (e.g.,
            teachers and shop owners, etc.) as well as natural resources illegal users would not be
            eligible. Businessmen or craftsmen that legally trade natural resources would be
            eligible.
            Compensation for eligible persons will include, as appropriate, moving allowances,
            reference to the State for possible inclusion inrelevant social and training projects
            and programs, training, and other assistance in obtaining alternative livelihoods.




                                                   136

    (v)    The State will not provide compensation for the loss to the natural resources access
           illegally obtained. However, it could seek for sustainable alternatives for such
           activities which would be use to discourage illegal activities such as fishing, hunting,
           gold miningor capture of wildlife species for irregular trade.
    (vi)   The carrying out of the work outlined above and determination of mitigation
           measures under the CE APL may be linked to the Technical Assistance component.
           The actual mitigation measures focusing primarily on assistanceinthe development
           of alternative livelihoods that would improve the economic condition of affected
           people can also be fundedfrom this component that contains sufficient contingency
           funds for this purpose. For areasonable post-training transition period, trainees will
           be provided with the necessary equipment and resources to become immediately
           involved in income-generating activities usingthe newly acquired skills. For each
           livelihood scheme considered, the cultural, social and economical feasibility of the
           activities to be carried out under the Project will be assessedto determine their
           appropriateness and how best to integrate such mitigation measures into the
           management plans for the PA site.

Incorporation of Alternative Livelihood Schemes
    (i)    Preparation of PA master Management Plans innewly established or proposed PAS
           and related Operational Plans will serve as the mechanismfor this Process
           Framework inthese areas. Implementationof the Management Plan and Operational
           Plan will be the responsibility of government and those institutions (both public and
           private), authorizedto manage the PASin question. The CE APL Project staff will
           facilitate and monitor progress toward management plan implementation. Certain PA
           management tasks (e.g., management plan preparation and training in alternative
           livelihood activities) may be contracted out by the Government to qualified
           organizations but will be the responsibility of the Secretary of Environment. The
           Project ImplementationUnit will be responsible for liaising with all concerned parties
           to ensure that these guidelines are carried out in a correct and timely manner
           including the carrying out of any alternative livelihood programs.
    (ii)   New restrictions or limitations concerning natural resource use within PA will only be
           enforced after economic mitigation measures are inplace.

OrganizationalProceduresfor Delivery of Compensations. The procedures for delivery of
compensation payments to the resettled populations will be coordinatedby the SEMACE in
partnership with the Institute for Agricultural Development of the State of Ceara-DACE.

These procedures will be based on the Resettlements' Operations Manual prepared by the
Secretariat for Hydraulic Resources-SRH      which follows IBRD guidelines. The Manual defines
theprocedures for resettlement and identifies these procedures as those comprised of the
following stages:

    (iii)   Independent of supervision by other authorities and the Bank, it will be the
            responsibility of the CE APL Project, and inparticular, the role of the PIU
            Coordinator to closely monitor these tasks, including causing SEMACE to undertake
            periodic participatory assessments by project beneficiaries, with publication of the
            results thereof. To ensure that management objectives are being met and to ensure
            that project goals are being achieved. Supervision missions by Bank Staff will also
            be usedto periodically monitor progress inimplementation of the Process Framework
            and of the PA Management Plans and Operational Plans which would serve as the
            Action Plans for this framework.
    (iv)    Satisfactory carrying out of these guidelines will be considered an essential CE
            APL#l condition and will constitute an APL#2 trigger condition.


E.      Discussionof Safeguard Issues Triggered by Water and Sanitation EEP Programs
        and Conditions of Disbursement Relatingto Household Connections.

Overview

The Ceara APL supports the State's efforts to extend coverage of water and sanitation services.
Specifically, the Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP) include two line item budget programs:
Urban Water and Sanitation and Urban Sanitation. The EEP expenditures derive from three sub-
programs which have both water and sanitation components, "Ceara Sanitation Program"
(SANEAR ZZ), a follow-on KfW financed "Projeto KfW 11" targeting small rural communities
( K m and the Federal Government's "Projeto Alvorada" (Alvorudu). SANEAR I1i s by far the
most important and i s vital to the State's WSS sector development andreform agenda. Ceara's
counterpart funding for SANEAR I1comprises the bulk of projected WSS sector EEP
expenditures. SANEAR I1works are to be carried out inFortaleza and inthe interior. The two
smaller programs targeting towns and communities in the poorest interior areas are also included

as eligible expenditures: Germany's KfW Program ("Kw')and the Caixa Economica Federal's
Projeto Alvorada ("Alvorada"). The State Budget Programs and component sub-programs are

There are two other sub-programs in#583 and #584 that are not included as EEP and
consequently will not be subject to Bank safeguards: IDB's PRODETUR and the Caixa
Economica Federal's "PROSANEAMENTO".            PRODETURi s winding up operations and
would contribute very little to EEPexpenditures. It i s a nation-wide undertaking whose 11Ceara
sub-projects are confined to two municipalities with tourist potential, Itapipoca and Caucaia.
Two of PRODETUR's sub-projects are concluded and the remaining 9 are under


                                               139

implementation. Eight of the eleven projects are very small ranging from about $50,000-
$450,000. PROSANEAMENTO i s financed from CAGECE (a semi-public enterprise) revenues,
and hence its fundingi s not EEP eligible. PRODETUR andPROSANEAMENTOinvestments
are subject to Federal and State environmentallegislationand regulations.

The Bank has verified that that the three Sub-programs supported under the CE APL and subject
to Bank safeguard policies are stand-alone operations whose financing and works are separate,
identifiable and independent of PROSANEAMENTO and PRODETUR. They are not physically
`integrated' or dependent or commingled (inthe case of funds and accounting) with them in
ways that would necessitate the application of Bank safeguard policies to all five programs.

It should be noted that SANEAR 11,by far the largest and most important sector operation, and
the smaller KfW and Alvorada projects will bring significant environmental advantages to
beneficiary communities. Infact, the primary objective of the $29m SANEAR I1works in
Fortaleza i s to "improve water supply quality at the beaches and in the rivers in the city of
Fortaleza by expanding coverage of wastewater collection and treatment sewicesfrom the
present 52% to 70% in 2008;" (source: IDB Project Report 2795).

It should also be notedthat Ceara has extensive experience inmanaging Bank and IDB
environmental safeguards inthe WSS sector. It i s considered the most competent of the
Northeastern states and, when implementing IF1operations, among the better performing states
inBrazil. Bank projectswith major WSS andrelevant safeguard components include the
recently closed PROURBE project and the current PROGERIRHproject. IDB'sportfolio
includes SANEAR I1and PRODETUR. IDB's "Fortaleza Basic Infrastructure Program-
 Sanitation" (SANEFOR) closed in 1998. SANEAR IIdesign has benefited from a retrospective
 analysis of SANEFOR. The analysis also resultedinthe establishment in 2002 of the CAGECE
Environment and Water Resources Department tasked with managing environmental aspects
 associated with project implementation and strengthened monitoring and evaluation of
 environmental indicators.

 Ceara APL SafeguardsFramework and ComplianceProgram.

 Bank and QAT experts and Bank retainedconsultant specialists have now reviewed SANEAR I1
 project and safeguard documents indetail including EIA/RIMAdocuments and verified their
 publication, made two site visits and also reviewed KJW (which has not yet been initiated) and
Alvorada project documentation. The Bank has confirmed that the safeguards due diligence
 carried outbytheB3B m preparingSAMEAR flf i s comprePlensive, meetsBank StanaarcLSandis
 fully satisfactory. The Bank has further determinedthat the SANEAR I1safeguards framework
 i s consistent with and fully satisfies Bank safeguard requirements. Hence, all SANEAR I1
 environmental issues are considered to have been reviewed by the Bank and addressed
 satisfactorily. Furthermore, the Bank has reviewed the KfW and Alvorada projects and
 determined that the application of the SANEAR I1safeguards framework to these projects, which
 i s set out in the Operations Regulations Manual approved by the Government on 23/03/2004,
 will also satisfy Bank safeguard requirements. The State and CAGECE have agreed to apply the
 SANEARI1safeguards framework to the KfW andAlvorada projects The Bank will formalize
 and assure the Government of Ceara' s compliance with this framework by including references



                                                  140

to this document and this framework inthe Loan Agreement and by carrying out supervision
necessary to ensure that it i s being implemented. Hence, the Bank's WSS component safeguard
framework i s as follows.


1. Relianceupon the IDB Safeguards Framework. The Bank will rely primarily upon the
    extensive and well elaborated IDB SANEAR I1safeguard policies and supervision due
    diligence framework. The Government o f Ceara and CAGECE will provide the Bank on a
    timely basis with all compliance related reports and documentation and facilitate Bank
    supervision mission access to sites as needed. IDB safeguards inthis project are equivalent
    to Bank standards and reliance upon them satisfies both due diligence and harmonization
    objectives. SANEAR I1compliance will be required as evidence that Bank safeguards
    compliance i s satisfactory. The Bank will carry out its own discrete supervision of the
    safeguards processes-in addition to reviewing CAGECE/IDBdocumentation on supervision.
2. Support of SANEAR ZZ, KfW, andAlvorudu Expenditures. The Bank i s satisfied that these
    three programs are separatefrom and in no way dependent upon the work carried out in other
    programs included under BudgetPrograms #583 and #584 both interms of physical works
    and in accountingterms. Hence, the CE APL will support as eligible expenditures under
    these two Programs only expenditures resulting from SANEAR ZZ, KW, and new subprojects
    under Projeto Alvorudu.
3. Kfw/Alvorudu--Application of the SANEAR I1Operations Regulations Manual. The Bank
    will require that the SANEAR I1Operations Regulations Manual (reviewed by the Bank)
    governing constructionof civil works and services and all related safeguard issues will be
    extended to all Kfw andAlvorudu projects.
        o Application of the Manual's requirements will be done by CAGECE's Department of
            Environment (GEMAM) inconjunction with SANEAR 11's project coordinating unit
            (UGP). GEMAMcurrently carries out these responsibilities for SANEAR 11andis
            competent to assume these responsibilities. The CE APL project implementationunit
            (PIU) will also assist insupervising compliance and ensure that relevant documents
            are remitted to the Bank on a timely basis.
        o Where necessary, CAGECE will ensure that Kfw andAlvoruda projects are also
            consistent and integrated adequately with existing systems inthe beneficiary
            communities.
        o Alvorudu works already concludedor under construction will not be included as CE
            APL eligible expenditures and will not be submitted topostfucto safeguards
            verification. Only new projects demonstrated to be covered by these procedures will
            be munteditseligible expenditures and o d y f r o m effcctivenas ofthedioan      ~    ~




            Agreement.
4. Report and Site Access. The Bank will have access as needed to reports done on KfW and
    Alvorudu projects during preparation and implementation and to project sites to conduct
    supervision visits.
 5. Bank Safeguards Supervision.
         o The Bank will undertake a supervisionmission immediately following project
            effectiveness to review safeguards and work inprogress to ensure compliance with
            the SANEAR I1safeguards framework including their application to KjW and
            Alvorudu projects.



                                                 141

        o Inaddition, the Bank will undertake a second supervision mission inthe first 12
            month period and a third inthe second 12 month period to verify compliance with the
            agreed safeguard framework. Additional supervision missions will be undertaken if
            deemed necessary. The State and CAGECE will facilitate these missions, making
            accessible any documentation required and assisting as needed with site visits. The
            selection of projects to be reviewed will be at the criterion of the Bank. It i s expected
            that the Bank will liaise regularly with CAGECE, the UGPand GEMAM.
        o The Bank will also liaise regularly with IDB staff responsible for SANEAR I1
            implementationto verify if there are any compliance problems.
6. Provision of Reports. The Bank will be provided by CAGECE with all reports bearing upon
    safeguards issues as soon as they become available.
7. Mitigation of Non-Compliance. Any findings by any party including the Bank, IDB,
    CAGECE, UFC or outside agencies or groups that the agreed safeguards framework i s not
    being followed will be communicatedimmediately to the World Bank along with
    recommendations for bringingthe State and CAGECE into compliance. Any such breach
    will be monitored closely by the State and Bank and remedial actions will be implemented
    according to time bound agreements satisfactory to the World Bank.
8. Failure to Complv. Inthe event that compliance i s deemed inadequate by the World Bank,
    the following remedial actions may be taken at the Bank's discretion.
        o Suspension ofDisbursements.-The        Bank may suspend loan disbursements with
            respect to the WSS component until such time as the Bank i s satisfied that remedial
            actions have been taken.
        o Conditionfor Inclusion in Ceara APL #2. Satisfactory compliance, as determined by
            the Bank, with the agreed safeguard framework will be a condition for inclusion of
            the WSS sector inthe Ceara APL#2 operation. The Bank may also demand inclusion
            of technical assistance, systems or other institutional strengthening initiatives as
            deemed necessary inthe subsequent operation as a condition of the sector's inclusion.
        o RemedialInvestments in CEAPL#2. The Bank may require of the Government that it
            undertake investments and/or remedial actions to address safeguards problems
            identified with the outfall referredto below or any other environmental concern
            linkedto Bank support for eligible expenditures under this loan.
9. Addressed inthe LoanAgreement. These safeguard requirements will be included inthe
    Loan Agreement and will be bindingupon the Government of Ceara.

This CearaAPL approach to safeguards is made possible andjustified by the comprehensiveness
of IDB's SANEAR I1safeguards framework. It also goes further than the SANEAR I1safeguard
pfogrambyextendingt4e SANEAR I1OperationsRegulationsto the KjW andAlvorada
Program, subjecting these programs to World Bank supervision, and creating strong incentives
for compliance within the Ceara APL framework. Hence, the CE APL and SANEAR I1
safeguards frameworks are harmonized and the Bank will be assured o f satisfactory compliance
with its safeguard standards.

Description of SANEAR I1and Safeguards Framework.

Sanear II Objectives and Components
The IDB Board approved the Ceara Sanitation Program (SANEAR 11)loan inNovember of
2003. The loan amount i s $100 million and State counterpart i s $67 million. The loan has not
begun to disburse yet but three large first phase projects are nearly ready to be launched. Loan
objectives described in the loan document (PR-2795) support MDGgoals and include
   (i)      improve water supply quality at beaches and inrivers inFortalezaby expanding
            coverage of wastewater collection and treatment services from 52% to 70% by 2008
   (ii)    improve sanitation conditions for communities inthe interior with populations
            ranging from 15,000 to 100,000 inhabitants b y increasing the provision of potable
            water services from 75% to 80%, and sewage collection and treatment from 13% to
            35% in 2008
   (iii)    improve CAGECE operations management and service efficiency.

SANEAR 11,accordingly, has 3 investment components comprising the following.
   0    Fortaleza sanitation (US$29.2 million). This component proposes to increase sanitation
        service coverage by building sewerage systems incity districts and areas not presently
        served with the addition of 63,000 new connections, and of trunk sewers on the banks of
        the Maranguapinho, Coco and Ceara rivers. Collected sewage will be conveyed to the
        existing pretreatment and ocean disposal system, which has the capacity to handle the
        additional wastewater. Note that inFortalezawhere only 53% o f households were
        connected to the collection network, about half the wastewater is discharged untreated
        directly into the city's drains or watercourses endangering the quality of rivers, spreading
        disease and also prejudicing the quality of Fortaleza's beaches.
    0   Water & sanitation in the interior (US$86 million). This component addresses
        communities of from 15,000 to100,OOO inhabitants and consists of (i)    buildingsome 15
        new water supply systems so as to increase service coverage inthe interior from 75% to
        80% with the addition o f 15,000 new connections; and (ii)   construction of close to 25
        new wastewater collection and treatment systems to increase coverage, requiring some
        45,000 new household connections.
    0   Znstitutional development (US$11.5 million). Of particular interest are operations
        improvements that will strengthen the system for monitoring the sea outfall and industrial
        discharge points. It also will address unaccounted for water and includes 300,000 water
        meters.

SANEAR I1comprises 37 projects in 15 municipalities plus Fortaleza. The projects have been
identified and about 80% have been developed and negotiated with IDB and are awaiting design
finalization and initiation of procurement. Costs range from less than R $ l million (about
$350,000) for equipment purchases and installation to R$45m (US$16m) for the implementation
of a network o f trunk lines with house and buildingcollector lines inFortaleza. The 37 projects
can be divided by value according to the following table.

It is evident from the breakdown presented above that most of the projects-roughly     75%--are
less than US$5 million and are inthe interior of the State and the majority of these are less than
$2 million. The only large projects are inFortaleza although there are medium sized projects in
the US$4-9 million range in the interior. Only one project will include resettlement-125
families will be removedfrom a slum area inFortaleza to make way for sewerage works. This
case has been reviewed by Bank and consultant specialists and found to have been appropriately
addressedinthe SANEAR 11project. Note that the SANEAR I1Operations Regulations Manual
contains resettlement guidelines that have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory. Also, ininstances where resettlement occurs, civil works must await successful
relocation of affectedpopulations under SANEAR II.Technically, and in terms of safeguards
there are no projects here that cannot be adequately managed within existing project safeguard
guidelines.

SANEAR 11Environmental Safeguards
An Environmental Impact Study (EIA/RIMA)was carried out for SANEAR I1by expert
consultants incompliance with current environmental legislation and IDB recommendations.
The EIA presents the results of the specific impact study for the Fortalezaproject and the
specific environmental studies for each of the 11municipalities inthe representative sample
based on an Environmental Evaluation Study (Relatoriode Avaliacao Ambiental-RAA). The
EL4was approved by SEMACE, the State Environmental Superintendency, by COEMA, the
State Environmental Council, and by IDB. It was also reviewed by the Bank and found to be
fully satisfactory. Fullprograms of public consultations were carried out. Two rounds of
consultations were held with beneficiary communities in2002 and 2003 to discuss the
environment analyses for projects inthe interior o f the state and several consultations were held
inFortaleza in2002with affected communities. Itis noteworthy that sewerage projects require
formal commitments signed by at least 80% o f beneficiaries, and a financing mechanismthrough
CAGECE to ensure household and in-house connections once construction of Etwork
pipelinesheceptors are completed.

The EIA and RIMA were released to the public on 13 August 2002 and 14November 2002
respectively at the Public Information Center (PIC) inFortaleza.

The SANEAR I1project inFortalezaexpands the sewerage network in areas contiguous to the
three rivers that pass through the city and targets areas where no sewerage elimination network
exists. Hence, it will address a critical urban environmental problem. The effluents will be
eliminated through an existing outfall that discharges sewerage inthe ocean. The outfall was



                                                 144

evaluated as part of IDB's safeguards due diligence and found to be adequate to handle the
increased volume of sewerage without prejudice to the environment. A system of continuous
monitoring and evaluation was put inplace makinguse of the Federal University of Ceara. Also,
SANEAR I1i s investing inthe strengthening of CAGECE's capacity to monitor and evaluate the
ocean disposal system and sewerage collection and disposal in general. The Bank has reviewed
the EL4andthe framework put inplace andhas found that it fully meets Bank standards and i s
satisfactory. The Bank will, in addition, supervise the outfall monitoring and evaluationbeing
performedb y the UFC and CAGECE.

For other SANEAR I1projects, as requiredby the IDB Loan Agreement, CAGECE will prepare
environmental impact evaluations (Relatorio de Avaliacao Ambiental) and social impact
summaries-and     wherever necessary, a diagnosis of any populations to be affected by
resettlement. CAGECE will also obtain a project installationlicense (Licenca de Instalacao) for
each intervention from SEMACEor the competent environmental organization.

CAGECE will follow the social-environmental framework set out inthe Basic Environmental
PladOperations Manual that has been reviewed by the Bank and found to be adequatefor all
SANEARI1interventions. The Operations Manual sets out appropriate safeguard procedures
and includes Socio Environmental programs and Operations Regulations for civil works and
services applicable to sub-projects inthe interior. The Operations Regulations will also be
extended to cover KfW and ProjetoAlvorado (discussed below indetail).

SANEARI1implements five Socio-Environmental Programs to meet safeguard obligations
under the loan agreement comprising the following.
    (i)aProgramforEnvironmentalControlofProjectscontainingthreesetsofenvironmental
    guidelines for projects, works and operations
    (ii)aProgramforCommunicationsOutreachincludingoutreach/public information,

    (iii)aProgramforCompensationforLossesandResettlement,
    (iv) a Programfor Development of Environmental Management consisting of initiatives to
    strengthen CAGECE and units involved in environmental management
    (v)    a Program for Monitoringand Evaluation comprising sub-projects for Fortaleza
    wastewater ocean disposal, wastewater treatment plans and bodies o f water receiving
    effluents inthe interior, pumpingstations, biosolids management, and industrial sewage from
    the Maracanau industrial district.

Description of Projeto Alvorada and KfW Programs and Safeguards Requirements

WSS projects financed under Alvorada and KfWprograms are mostly very-small to small
projects inthe poorer interior areas of the State. The Bank and consultant specialists who
reviewed the programs concurred that there i s little potential for negative environmental impacts
resulting from these interventions and whose benefits to the environment far outweigh any risks.

Projeto Alvorada and Safeguards Concerns
Alvorada i s financed by the Federal Government through FUNASA-the                  National Health
Foundation. It i s directed at selected municipalities chosen for having the worst poverty indices
based upon the Government's IDHM-Indice            de Desenvolvimento Humano Municipal. The
program was initiated in 2001 and includes 407 works in the interior of Ceara in 60
municipalities. The State counterpart contribution i s 10% of each sub-project total cost.

The breakdown o f the 440 projects i s indicated inthe table below. O f this total, only 31

        Stage                Concluded                 Under                 Not Initiated
                                                  Implementation
     Projects (#)                118                     38                      251


(7%) exceed R $ l million (about $300,000). The largest i s about $1,800,000 but most are
considerably smaller. Of the 87% of projects costing less than $300,000, about half are
interventions valued at less than $50,000. The sub-project funding goes mostly to distribution
and connections (water and sewerage lines and household connections), pumpingstations
("aducao"), small reservoirs and sanitary kits and there i s very little expenditure for such
interventions as water treatment stations, elevated water storage tanks and trunk lines. Program
documents indicate that only 10% are targeted at communities of more than 1,000 beneficiaries
and of these, the large majority are directed to communities of 1-2,000 inhabitants. Regarding
the 90% of smaller sub-projects, most serve less than 500 beneficiaries and many are for less
than 100.

Regarding environmental safeguards, the projects are required to comply with extant
environmental legislation inorder to obtain environmental licenses from the competent
authorities-the  sub-projects of the first and second phases were subjected to a process of
preliminary environmental analysis and licenses (Licencas Previus) were approved for them.
They are subsequently submitted to specific evaluations resulting in the provision of an
Implantation License. These licenses have been obtained or are being processed for all of the
interventions identified.

 Summarizing, these are very small projects with little or no environmental risk directed at small,
 poor communities. Consequently, environmental and health benefits will be important. Works
  have been identified and submitted to a licensing process congruent with the extant legislation



                                                 146

and guidelines. The application of the SANEAR I1Operations Regulations Manual will provide
              further assurancethat any environmental risk i s identified and mitigated.

Kfw Program and Safeguards Concerns
The Kfw Program, which hasn't commenced operations yet, will provide Euro$8.7 million for
financing basic water and sanitation investments for Ceara's leading edge IntegratedRural
Sanitation Systems (SISAR)program. The Programtargets small communities willing to
affiliate with SISAR and that meet the following requirements: adequate water, a minimumof
300 inhabitants (the averageis around 1,000 inhabitants and 220 connections), a willingness to
accept metering and pay for water, and reasonable investment project costs guaranteeing system
sustainability. The Programfinances five activities
     0   Rehabilitation, expansion, construction of potable water supply systems
     0   Improvement, expansion, implantation of sewerage systems
     0   Creation, mobilization, strengthening o f user groups
     0   Sanitary education
     0   CAGECE/SISAR institutional strengthening.

This is a follow-on to a KfW project implemented between 1987-1996 that benefited around
90,000 persons inthe Acarau and Coreau regions. A retrospective evaluation was completed in
2002 leading to aKfw and Government agreement to replicate and improve upon the successful
SISAR program.

Similar to Alvorada, Kfw Program interventions are subject to existing environmental laws and
regulations requiring appropriate licenses from the competent environmental authorities. The
Program will produce progress reports every six months.

The Kfw Program offers even less risk thanAlvorada as the interventions are smaller. The
potential for negative environmental impacts i s considered minimal and the application of the
SANEAR I1Operations Regulations should ensure this outcome.
