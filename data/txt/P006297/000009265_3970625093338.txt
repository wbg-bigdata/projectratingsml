PROJECT COLETION REPORRT
BRAZIL-VALESUL ALUMINUM PROJECT
(LOAN 1660-BR)
PREFACE
The IBRD Loan 1660-BR provided financing for the development of
cmelting facilities to produce annually about 86,500 tons of alumdnum
ingot, slabs, andbillet fo-r the domestic market.  The project was
implemented by Valesul Aluminio S.A., a Brazilian corporation, created
specially for this purpose.  The loan, approved by the Board on March 6, -
1979, was originally for US$98 million but only US$78.8 million was
used, the remainder cancelled. Final disbursement was made on
December 2, 1983.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) is made up of two parts,
a PCR prepared by the Borrower which is preceded by comments prepared
by the Industry Department. The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive
and well documented completion report, covering project preparation,
implementation, operating performance, markets, financial and economic
performance. The Industry Department shares by and large the judgements
and conclusions of the Borrower; its _.z.ments are designed to clarify,
accentuate and provide more detail on certain aspects.
Comments received from the Borrower have been taken into
account in finalizing the report and appear as Annex 3.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - VALESUL ALUNUK PROJECT
(LOAN 1660-BR)
Highlights
In spite of the rapid 16X p.a. growth of output during the 1970s,
the primary aluminum production capacity in Brazil did not keep pace with
rising demand. Further growth was expected as per capita consumption was
low, which in turn was a function of the limited availability and high cost
of importing primary aluminum. Against this background the Valesul
Aluminum Project was designed to produce, for domestic consumption, 86,500
tpy of primary aluminum at an approximate product mix of 35Z extension
billets, 35% rolling slabs, and 30% ingots. The plant was located in the
state of Rio de Janeiro because of available port and power facilities, as
well as proximity to skilled and semi-skilled manpower, and existing
consumption centers in Rio and Sao Paulo. Construction began in 1978 and
production in 1982.
The project was implemented with a delay of about one year
(para. 17) and at current cost very close to the appraisal estimate (para.
7).  Initial problems resulting from lack of experience and leadership were
overcome at the end of the first third of project implementation (paras. 3
and 4). The training program and technology transfer (para. 18) were
successful and performance parameters stipulated in the Technology
Agreement were readily achieved as was full design capacity (para. 13).
Pollution control was the major technical problem (para. 12) during
start-up of operations in late 1982 requiring a major reduction of total
plant dust emission levels which was achieved in early 1983.
Due to the economic recession, Brazilian aluminum consumption
decreased by about 20% during 1980-83 whereas supply capacity increased by
about 22Z. As a result only 40-50% of Valesul's production are absorbed by
the domestic market, the remaining 50-60% are exported. Domestic sales are
projected to gradually increase over the next few years but Valesul is
expected to remain an exporter.
Aluminum prices are presently depressed and do not cover all
expenditures including debt service (para. 15), requiring supplemental
equity coutributions by Valesul's shareholders in 1984 and 1985.
The financial rate of return is 8.4% compared with 10.8% at the
time of appraisal. The lower return is due to higher capital cost, higher
general expenses and the inclusion of capital improvements and replacements
not originally anticipated. The economic rate of return is 11.8% as
compared with 20.4% at the time of appraisal. The reduction is due to the
fact that, contrary to expectations that Brazil would be a net importer of
aluminum, it is now and is expected to remain a net exporter. In addition,
sales revenues have been reduced to account for the CIF cost of delivery to
US-East Coast/Western Europe (para. 16).
The lessons learned are summarized in paras. 21-24 of Part I of
the PCR.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL: VALESUL ALUMINUM PROJECT
(LOAN 1660-BR)
PART I: BAIK STAFF COMMENTS ON VALESUL'S PCR
1.        Introduction. The 30.6Z maxi-devaluation of the CrS against the
USS in December 1979 is stated as a negative factor with respect to project
cost. While the maxi-devaluation lead to very high Brazilian inflation in
1980 and thereafter, and Cr$/US$ exchange rate adjustments were less than
necessary to maintain purchase power parity with the US$, i.e. the Cr$
hardened again, Valesul benefitted from the maxi-devaluation throughout the
construction period after December 1979 (para. 8).
2.        Project Identification, Preappraisal, and Appraisal (page 5,
PCR). Vales-Il mentions that control of the company would be equally shared
by state and private partners. The statement refers to 1977 and should be
supplemented to reflect a subsequent understanding, whereby Valesul is to
be simultaneously controlled by Brazilian and private capital (para. 11).
3.        Project Management (para 4, page 9, PCR). The appointmet of a
project coordinator was requested by the Bank in January 1980, because of
the critical need for one executive with the overall authority and
capability, plus adequate staff and systems resources at his disposal. to
be responsible for executing the project successfully.  Although the
project coordinator had only coordination responsibility for procurement,
which remained under the commercial director, he was able to establish his
leadership clearly, functioning as a project operations manager. His
appointment which became effective in March 1980 was a positive turning
point in project implementation.
4.        Use and Performance of Consultants (Paras. 2, 3, page 11, PCR).
The Brazilian project manager struggled with the organizational,
procurement, and construction complexities of an aluminum smelter through
1981. Among the problems encountered were the lack of proper interface
between the consulting firms in charge of project management, cost control,
technology supply and Valesul, timely and appropriate updating of budgets,
installment of a cost control system, and considerable man-hour overruns
for engineering, procurement and construction management. Eventually, as
more and more of the procurement packages had been processed, and as the
project management firm was profiting from on-the-job experience, problems
were gradually solved or at least brought under control.
5.        (Para. 6, page 11, PCR).  The fact that the firm in charge of
cost control was subcontract-or to the project manager for was not an
optimal arrangement as far as cost control is concerned. To be effective
in the latter capacity, the former at times needed to be critical of the
latter, its client. While the cost controllers acted diligently in face of
its somewhat delicate position, direct reporting to the project owners
would have been the appropriate arrangement.



6.        Capital Cost, Financing and Disbursements (Page 41, PCR).  Total
financing required for the project was US$376.1 nillion as compared with
US$370.1 million in the SAR. As uentioned in para. 3, the Cr$ was devalued
by 30.6Z in December 1979, which theoretically and based on SAR estimates
should have yielded about US$83 million in savings for local expenditures
expressed in US$. During 1980 and 1981 the Cr$ hardened again against the
US$, erasing over time much of the potential cost saving effect of the
maxi-devaluation, and thereby reducing tangible exchange rate benefits to
about US$22 million which accrued to Valesul from translation gains between
invoice date and payment date. Without these, project cost would have
increased to about US$398 million, equivalent to an overrun of 7.6Z.
7.        (Page 42, PCR). While actual project cost differs only slightly
from the appraisal estimate, there are changes in the allocation of costs
as shown below:
Appraisal     Actual     Variation       Z
- - -US$ million---
Direct Cost                         229.3      214.9 a/    -14.4       - 6.3
Project Management                   14.8       22.8       + 8.0       +54.1
Engineering Services, Procurement,
and Technical Assistance            22.0       27.2       + 5.2       +23.6
Technology Fee                        6.0        6.0
Training & Preoperating Expenses    20.6        30.8       +10.2       +49.5
Working Capital                      40.3       35.0 a/    - 5.3       -13.2
Financial Expenses                   37.1       39.4       + 2.3       + 6.2
Total Financing Required       370.1      376.1          6.U      + 1.6
a/ Valesul has included about US$6 million of capital spares in the
project's direct cost, instead of the working capital; to maintain
comparability with the appraisal estimate, this amount has been
deducted from direct cost and has been added to working capital.
Whereas actual expenditures for direct cost and working capital were below
the appraisal estimate, expenditures for project management, services and
assistance, preoperating costs, and financial expenses were above the
appraisal estimate.
8.        Bank Loan (Page 64. PCR).  US$19.9 million of the Bank loan were
cancelled and equipment financed was only US$65 million, US$25 million
lower than envisaged. About US$6.7 million of the variance are due to the
removal of certain equipment packages by Valesul from the list of Bank
financed goods. The remainder of the variance resulted from price changes,
translation gains and scope changes.
9.        Man Power Development (Para. 1, page 72, PCR).  The training
program for Valesul personnel was a full success as witnessed by smoothness
of start-up and achievement of design production (para. 15).



-3-
10.       (Para. III(b), page 73, PCR).  Staffing levels were discussed at
length during various supervision missions, because more than 1,000 staff
for a smelter of Valesul's size was seen to be too high by Bank missions.
Instead, the appraisal staff level of 806 was seen to be sufficient plus
5-1OZ to account for the need to have the inplant maintenance capabilities
that are necessary in the Brazilian environment. These discussions were
unsuccessful in terms of reducing Valesul's staff to well below 900, but
helped keep in check pressures for further hiring and prompted Valesul's
Board to establish 991 employees as maximum for regular operations.
11.       Borrower's Ownership and Organization Structure (Para. IIIc(i)-2,
page 86, PCR). The shareholder Agreement stipulates (section 3.06(b)) that
CVRD offer part of its voting stock to private Brazilian investors, so that
not more than 49% and not less than 40Z of the voting stock are held by
CVRD. This reflects the agreement that Valesul should eventually have a
majority of private shareholders and a majority of Brazilian ones.  In
early 1981, Biliton Metais S.A., bought 8.4Z of comon stock from CVRD,
increasing its ownership of Valesul to about 44%, whereas CVRD's share was
reduced to about 54%. CVRD has since attempted to sell another 12% of its
holdings to a Brazilian investment group, but the sale did not materialize
due to financial constraints.
12.       Environmental Effects (Page 99, PCR).  Pollution control was the
major technical problem of Valesul during start-up of operations. Upon
request by the Bank, Valesul agrecd in October 1982 to postpone further
start-up of pots until the total plant dust emission level was cut in half
to 2.5 kg/ton AL or less, which was achieved by January 1983. The PCR and
latest oral reports by Valesul indicate that the environmental protection
equipment is functioning properly.
13.       Build-up of Production and Capacity (Page 102, PCR).  Valesul was
very successful in the build-up of production and achieving fnll design
capacity.
14.       Markets (Table IV(i)-2, pa,te 106, PCR). Due to the economic
recession in Brazil, aluminum consumption decreased by about 20% between
1980 and 1983, while during the same period supply capacity increased by
about 22%. Demand generated by Brazil's independant fabricators, Valesul's
designated target group, absorbs only 40-50% of Valesul's capacity; and
therefore the other 50-60% are exported. Domestic sales are projected to
gradually increase over the next few years, but it can be expected that
Valesul will remain an exporter. This is at variance with appraisal
expectations of exclusively domestic sales, bowever, the generation of
foreign exchange by the project is highly desirable in view of Brazil's
economic situa:ion.
15.       Financial and Economic Performance (Page 116-137, PCR).  As a
result of low current aluminum prices, the internal cash generation of
Valesul was insufficient to cover all expenditures (including debt service)
in 1983. The cash deficit of about US$7 million was financed through
equity contributions from the shareholders, as will the projected 1984 and
1985 cash deficits.



-4-
16.       The financial and economic rates of return presented in Valesul's
PCR have been recalculated in line with Bank methodology and latest Bank
projections. As shown in Annex 1 the financial rate of return before
income tax is 8.4Z in real 1978 terms compared to 10.8% at the time of
appraisal.  The lover return is due to (i) higher capital cost in real
terms of about 7%; (ii) higher general expenses, in particular
administrative expenses; and (iii) the inclusion of capital improvements
and replacements at 1% of fixed assets p.a. which were not included in the
SAR streams.  The economic rate of return, as shown in Annex 2 is 11.8% in
real 1978 terms as compared with 20.4% at the time of appraisal. In the
SAR it was assumed, that Brazil would be a net importer of aluminum and
that all of Valesul's production would represent import substitution.
Hence, economic revenues were calculated by (i) adding 16% CIF cost to the
projected international price (US-East Coast); and (ii) shadow pricing
revenues by 30%. As mentioned in para. 14 above, Brazil is now and is
expected to remain, a net-exporter of aluminum. Shadow-pricing of revenues
has therefore been applied only to the some 40-50% of production that are
being exported, and only at 20%, the factor applicable at present. In
addition sales revenues have been reduced by about US$40 per ton below the
projected international price to account for the CIF cost of delivery to
the US-East Coast/Western Europe. These changes have reduced the economic
sales revenue in the order of US$30 million p.a. as compared with the SAR
estimate, resulting in the sharply lower economic rate of return.
III. CONCLUSIONS
1. Overall Assessment
17.       The Project was implemented with an average delay of about seven
months and at a current cost very close to the appraisal estimate.
Implementation was initially hampered by the absence of strong project
management, lack of experience by the project management firm with projects
of similar technical complexity, and a lack of leadership by the owners.
These problems were overcome or brought under control at the end of the
first third of project implementation. After the appointment of a strong
and competent project coordinator, with proper attention given by the
shareholders, and increasing on the job experience by the project
management firm, the project was henceforth implemented efficiently.
18.       From a technical point of view, the Project is a full success.
The training program, implemented by Valesul with assistance from the
technology supplier, fully prepared engineers, foremen, operating and
maintenance personnel for operations. The technology transfer was
accomplished in line with performance parameters stipulated in the
Technology Agreement and with full technical assistance support from the
technology supplier. Full design capacity was readily achieved at the end
of a well executed start-up process. None of the (smelting) pots had to be
relined or were lost during start-up, which, based on industry average, is
an achievement, and underlines the technical success of the Project.



-5-
19.       Financially, the Project bas been facing difficulties due to low
current prices of aluminum both in the domestic as well as international
market. The shareholders have supported Valesul by providing the equity
contributions necessary to cover cash shortfalls. By when the Company will
be financially viable on its own depends on future price trends.  The
severe downturn in the aluminum market which coincided with Valesul 's
start-up, highlights the risks associated with a sharp downturn in the
market and the need to be fully aware of these during project preparation.
The fact that the Company's two main shareholders are financially strong
themselves and take a long-term view of their activities in the aluminum
sector in Brazil has protected Valesul from more serious consequences.
Valesul has also profited from shareholder experience for exports of
aluminum.
20.       The economic impact of the Project continues to be positive,
although to a lesser degree than estimated at appraisal. Technology
transfer and employment benefits have fully materialized and
institution-building in form of exposing a Brazilian engineering company to
construction and management of an aluminum smelter has been an additional
benefit. The economies of smelting aluminum, however, are temporarily
reduced in Brazil and elsewhere. Their improvement is dependent upon
aluminum price increases over the coming years. By succeeding to export
that portion of production that is not absorbed by the Brazilian market,
Valesul has conserved economic benefits to the extent possible, producing
at full capacity and generating foreign exchange earnings.
2.   Lessons for Similar Projects
21.       As noted earlier in para. 5, the project management firm gained
the proper experience for construction of a smelter on the job. lWhile the
know-how transfer can and has been considered as an additional benefit of
the project, the firm's inexperience resulted in delays and additional
cost. Care should therefore be taken during project preparation to assure
that the technical and managerial capabilities of a firm already selected
by the Borrower are reviewed in depth and if necessary adequately
strengthened through outside expertise before acceptance of that firm by
the Bank.
22.       Related to this is the sub-optimal effectiveness of the cost
control function within the project organization. Initially non-existent,
it was established at the request of the Bank. Sub-contracted by the
project management firm, the cost control consultants did not report to the
pr,ject owners which would have been desirable, because project mnnagement
cost was one of the capital cost categories showing a significant overrun.
In similar future projects, cost control arrangements should be discussed
and agreed upon with the borrower during appraisal.



23.       The ownership structure of the projectl/ bas been generally
effective in creating a well-run smelting operation. The support that the
public local and private foreign sponsors provided to the project ensured
the smooth transfer of technology, access to foreign capital markets as
well as adequate equity contributions during the preva-ling depressed
market condition. However, CVRD and Shell as majority shareholders did not
provide the strong leadership necessary during the early part of project
implementation, partly because they were entering themselves into aluminum
smelting and still in the process of building up their own in-house
technical expertise. Therefore Bank supervision missions took the
initiative in suggesting to the project organization the measures needed to
ensure satisfactory implementatio progress. This experience suggests that
the functions, expertise and support exercised during project
implementation by each shareholder in a joint ownership scheme should be
defined in sufficient detail during project preparation.
24.       Since early 1983, Valesul, in the course of receiving export
prefinancing, has had increasing cash amounts at its disposal, which it
invested through a broker in Brazil's open market. In July 1983, Valesul
incurred potential losses of up to about US$11 million through bankruptcy
of a company in whose -letters of exchange-2l it had invested. While the
peculiar circumstances of this particular case suggest that little could
have been done to prevent the loss, the incident also suggests, that Bank
involvement in the design and/or review of cash management practices of
project entities is warranted. The latter should become a regular
appraisal and supervision feature, particularly for projects which are
implemented as expansion, rehabilitation or similar circumstances by an
operating company with a usually much wider range of financial transactions
than a greenfield project.3/

Re.: Project  mpletion eport - Brazil-
Valesul Aluninium Project (loan 1660-BR)
Dear  Mr. Watanabe
First of all, we would like to thank you for your request regarding
our comments on the draft prepared by your Operations    Evaluation
Department, comprisina explanations and detailing of VALESUL Project
Completion Report (PCR).
W.e ha-e given the best of our attention to your document and we
understand, according to the explanation given, the wide range   of
the performance audits mainly regarding what the organization   can
learn from past experience. Thus, with the cooperative spirit in
view of future pro,ects located in Brazil or in similar countries,
we suggest the followinc comments to be taken into consideration
1.   Chronogram  (Basic Data-Sheet  - Page ii)
Our suggestion for comparison purposes is that Rev. 2 Chrbogr=
should be considered instead of the Appraisal Epctatin, inasmuch
as the last one reflects situations which took place    before
the approval of the project by the World Bank itself, before
SHELL BRASIL S.A. (Petr6leo) particinated as a shareholder and
before CACEX authorized the beginning of the international bids,
all of these facts occurring in the first quarter of 1979. Thus,
nbr 2 review of the General Chronogram was issued in March, 1979,
better reflecting the situation of the new-born project as the
others reflected expectations not confirmed. The basic dates

of the chronograms prepared after the Apraisal are as follows

As a consequence, we suggest that you consider an average delay
of about 6 months instead of the delay of about one year indicated
on item 17, especially if we take into account, as described on
item 12, the intentional start-up postponement of the . major
quantity of po-ts due to problems with the envizoronmtal piotectimn
equipment which have been controlled afterwards-
2-    Introduction (item 1) and Capital Cost (Item 6)
Incorporated in
Part 1,      Please note that cruzeiros maxi-devaluation occurred in December
paras.l & 6   10th, 1979  and was of 30,6%.
3.    Project  Management  (Item 3)
Incorporated in
Part I,      Actually, the appointmentr  of a project coordinator  has been a
para. 3      shareholders' decision during the last quarter of 1979, which
was made effective in beginning of 1980- His leadership,
functioning as a Project Operations Manager, received the su;ort
of Valesul Executive Board of Directors.

paras. 4 & 5  company and our main shareholders (VALE DO RIO DOCE  and SHELL),
the manager company of the project (INTERNACIONAL DE   ENGENHA-
RIA S.A.) and their main sub-contractors (MORRISON-KOnUDSEN   as
construction and assembling manager, and KAISER ENGINEERS    as
planning and cost control manager), technology supplier and
VALESUL shareholder, REYNOLDS. There were seven companies which
intensively acted during the whole project and whose interfaces,
--             despite being unecuivocal, have caused difficulties to    its
progress and the need for greater coordination efforts on behalf
of VALESUL.
A smaller number of companies involved in the administration of
such an important project would, of course, allow a higher speed
in its development as well as lower indirect costs.    As far as
we can see, for the majority of implementation or expansion
cases where the owner is the technology owner contracting the
management with just one company, this would be the optinmm sc±eme.
The introduction of other companies of different entrepeneurial
cultures in the project management creates interfaces which
makes its coordination difficult.  Sharing  of tasks   and
responsibilities should only remain between the owner company,
with the support of the technology supplier if applicable, and
the project manager, thus making the communications and decisins
easier from every angle.
5.    Project  Cost  (Item 7)
Reflected in
Part I,      Although recognizing only a slight difference between appraisal
para. 7      and actual project cost, the statement presented evident changes
in the allocation of costs.  However, the majority   of  these
divergencies may be explained by the enlargement of the terms
initially forecast.

Borrower's
Report.      On Section IIIc (i) of the  PCR  where BILLITONX is mentioned,
Section III
c(i)         please read SHELL DO BRASIL (Petr6leo) instead.  The   same
correction also applies to item 11 of your  letter.
7.    Markets  (Item  14)
According to what has been mentioned in your comments, there
have been changes in market conditions due to Brazilian       ic
Incorporated  circumnstances from the demand point of view and to the structx=e
in Part I,
para. 14     of the aluminum industry from the supply point of view, which
have significantly changed %MLESUL market expectation.   Thus,
VALESUL  have allocated 40 - 50% of their capacity to the internal
market, exporting the remaining 50 - 60%.
In view of recent statistics issued by the concerned autxritiesc
from now on VALESUL will keep their position as exporter.   As
a conseauence, we request you to change the percentages mentioned
in your item 14 as well as to delete the  statement   "at least
over the medium term".
8.    Financial and Economic Performance (Item 15)
Incorporated  We suggest the second sentence reads as follows      " The cash
in Part I,
para. 15     deficit of about US$ 7 million was financed through  equity
contributions from the shareholders, as will the projected
1984 and 1985 cash deficits". The third sentence should be
deleted.
9.    Overall Assessment  (Items 17, 18 and 20)
Incorporated  As already indicated, we think it should be more  appropriate
in Part I,
para. 17     to cite an average delay of 6 months which, together with  a
current cost verv close to the appraisal estimate, could lead
to a final judgment of an efficient implementation, notwithstanding

the initial difficulties mainly caused by the excessive quaLntity
of corporations involved. Recognizing the full success from
the technical/operational standpoint obviously leads to the
recognition that all implementation steps have been performed
successfully.
In a final appreciation, there has been a perfect hanony between
the technology and the engineering which provided a good
performance of the construction, supplied eauipment and asseibling
and which, together with technical training and support, pxovided
a full design capacity readily achieved at the end of a well
executed start-up process.
10.   Overall  Assessment  (Item 19)
Incorporated
in Part 1a    We suggest the deletion of the expression (5th/6th lines)
para. 19      "present expectations are that this will be achieved during 1985"
as it is no longer applicable.   Suggest also that last sentence
of this item reads as follows    "VALESUL have   also profited
from shareholders international dimension market    wise".
11.   Lessons  for  Similar  Projects
Reflected in   a)  Your item 21
Part I,
para. 21          We kindly ask you to add that the act of contxacting outside
expertise should always be performed at client discxeticn.
b) Your items 21 to 23 :
Reflected in      As mentioned above, we fully agree that the rmanagemet ccpany
Part I,           should possess an  already demonstrated  experience in all
activities to be developed,only calling your attention to
the relationship complication factor which   is  introduced
in the managerial organization by contracting an excessive
number of companies.

We think that the capacity of the company with outside
exDertise should also be able to surmount eventual problems
of subordination with professional performance. We also
want to mention that the overrun of the project management
cost has been much more related to the postponement of the
effective start-up of the implementation than to any other
problem of functional hierarchy.
c) Your item 24
tie suggest the deletion of this item since PCR embodies the
Refelcted in      project activities only up to the end of their *nolentation.
footnote 3 to                             
Part I, para. 24   Besides, we did not have evidence of internal irzegularities
in the Financial DeDartment of VALESUL and the lawsuit
against the brokerage firm, ruled on First and Second Instanoes,
has been favourable to VALESUL with reportedly excellent
chances for recover. of the loss.
On the other hand, a more deeo involvement of the WIorld
Bank in managerial procedures in charge of the Taker is not
acceptable. If managerial practices already in the operational
phase are not satisfactory to the World Bank, you will have
to indicate them also to the shareholders for the adoption
of corrective measures, if they have not yet been iirmlemnted.

INTRODUCTION
In accordance with Loan Agreement 1660-BR. dated 7MAR79, signed between the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank -WB) and Valesul Alumfnio S.A.
(VALESUL). we are pleased to submrtit the Project Completion Report, under the provisions of
seton 3.03 (c] of sa. i Loan Agreement.
This report is in line with requirements iet forth in the guidelines attached to the W.Yorld Bank letter
dated 22DEC82.
VALESUL has sprung from the idealism of Brazilian technical experts through a successful partnership
of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD. Shell Brasil SA (Petr6leo) and Reynolds Intemational Inc.
thanks to financing by the World Bank and the Special Agency for Industrial Financing - FINAME,
and the wholehearted support of Brazilian governmrent authorities.
From the financial viewpoint, Project end-results are outstanding- Project implementation kept
within the previously set budget, in spite of several negative factors such as:
v High inflation rates.
e Maxi-devaluation of the cruzeiro in NOV79. ||  rww    t>
* American inflation itself.
* Growina oil crisis throughout the Project.
Despite tt,e detrimental effect of all these factors on Project development and the resulting world
recession, VALESUL was able to minimize iS not eliminate it. implementing its Plant within modem
technological concepts and international cost standards.
The managerial model adopted in agreementvwith theWorld Bank was clearly a key factor in attaining
such results.
A further contribution was made by all organizations involved in the Project through their expertise
and dedication. Among them: Reynolds International Inc. - REYNOLDS. Technology vendor;
IESA - Intemacional de Engenharia SA; and Kaiser Engineers International Inc. - KEIC.
This Project is certainly a first and major step for Brazilian development toward a leading role among
aluminum-producing countries, thanks to Brazil's bauxite reserves, its hydro power potential and a
growing domestic market.
The VALESUL Project is the largest-scale industrial development installed in Rio de Janeiro this past
decade, with investrnents totalling US$ 371 mitlion for implementation of an 86,000 tpy primary
aluminum plant to produce ingots. plates and billets.
This developmnent will enhance the countrys balance of payments by replacing aluminum imports
and exportr-ig part of i:s output, in response to the econcmic and financial crisis experienced by
Brazil and oaner nations.

1,      PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREAPPRAISAL AND APPRAISAL
Among developing countries. Brazil displays outstanding possibilities for integrated production of
bauxitelaluminalaluminum In addition to a significant domestic market other factors favor a strong
aluminum industry. to wit:
e Vast bauxite reserves of around 4 billion tons, ranked third in the Western World. located in
Eastern Amazon.
* significant hydrc resources in the Amazon ore province for low-cost electric power generation
and transportation-
* Adequate industrial infrastructure including a well-established capital goods industry and skilled
manpower-
Despite such favorable conditions. Brazil has been a net aluminum importer through 1981. In 1977.
when the VALESUL Project was submitted to the World Bank. Brazilian aluminum deficit forecasts
were as follows, excluding the Project's share of domestic output totals:

With these figures in hand, the Brazilian Govemment entrusted Companhia Vale do Rio Doce -
CVRD, in mid-1970, with development of the country's aluminum resources, with govemment
backing.
CVRD has always been aware that development of efficient operations in the obvious location of
choice - the bauxite and hydro resource-ich Amazon - would require time and highly skilled
manpower covering all fields related to the construction, operation and management of aluminum
plants, in addition to suitable technologies and financing.
Accordingly, in APR75, the CVRD President requested a feasibility study for implementation of a
primary aluminum plant to be located on the Brazilian southeast coast. Meanwhile, complex
Studies were then in progress through another group of experts for installation of a bauxite/alumina/
aluminum industrial center in the Amazon region.



- 23 -
Between MAYINOV75. a pre-feasibilitv study was completed for the
Project. then named ALUSUL Project, with the following summary conclusions:
Output Capacity
Based on available demand forecasts, the study recomrnendea an initial 80,000-ton annual capacity
eventually to double to 160,000 tons.
Location
Siting appraisal led to selection of the Rio de Janeiro macro-region as the most suitable area for an
aluminum plant.
mhis micro-sitina study selected four different locations within the macro-region chosen.
Plant Process
The study recommended selection of pre-baked anode electrolytic reduction cells which entail lower
energy and anode consumption, greater operational ease. lower operating cost and fewer industrial
wastes, since the process technology used provides for better pollution control.
Technology Selection
On behalf of CVRD. the study team requested bids from the twelve major aluminum companies for
supply of technology and technical assistance during construction and early operations. Nine bids
were submitted and analyzed by said team and a recommendation issued on the most suitable
technologies presented by three of the bidders. Such recommendation was based on investment
costs, output and electric power consumption defined by bidders for the aluminum plant.
Capital Structure
A joint venture made up of 1/3 domestic private capital, 1/3 government capital and 1/3 of the
equity supplied by a corporate partner which could simultaneously supply the required know-how
was felt to be appropriate.
-he pre-feasibility study was approved by CVRD which then undertook the initial arrangements for
implementation of the vanture, called VALESUL Project.
On IJUN76, CVRD applied to the Hon. President of Brazil. through the Minister of Mines and
Energy, for authorization to proceed with the project. Authorization was granted on 24AUG76
under the provisions of Statement of Reasons No. 176n6 of 22JUN76.
Furthermore, the Non-ferrous and Steel Council - CONSIDER approved the VALESUL Project
through Resolution No. 45176 dated 4AUG76. ranking it a high priority project within its industrial
sphere. The Resolution enabled VALESUL to apply for government-granted tax incentives provided
for by current legislation, under Law-decree No. 1428 of 2DEC75. In line with pre-feasibi lity study
recommendations. CVRD  selected the technoloRy supolier for the following reasons:
* Lovwer investments for the primary aluminum plant resulting from state-of-the-art process
technology affording a hicher yield per pot room surface unit.
* Lower power consumption thanks to a special additive soluticn in the reduction cell bath
(molten aluminum. cryolite and aluminum fluoride solution at 9600C).
* In the recent past, the company had successfully installed primary aluminum plait
equipped with pots similar to those offered VALESUL.

e Alonge with transfcr of technology and technical assistance aoreements. it was willing
to supply additional guarantees and to acquire a substantial share of the VALESUL equity capital:
It also agreed to provide operating personnel during plant start-up and
early years of operation.
On 1 2OCT76. a "Technology Supply Agreement" was sianed between CVRD and the technology
suppliers, whereby the latter agreed to transfer wholly to CVRI all required
information for planning, construction ard operation of a new aluminum vlant
as well as to train the CVRD operating staff.
Said Agreement was approved by the National Industrial Property Institute - INPI, under Certificate
of Registration No. 7112/77. dated 31AUG77 and registered with the Central Bank of Brazil under
Certificate No. 38210032 of 5OCT77.
Valesul Alumifnio S.A. was established on 22NOV76 with headquarters in the city of Rio de
Janeiro. RJ. at Rua Melvin Jones 35-3rd. floor.
The initially subscribed capital totalled CrS 1.5 million to be fully paid-up by 1977. of which CVRD IC
held 70% and REYNOLDS. 30%. By government decision, VALESUL control would be equally sharedt,
by State and private partners.
Engineers began a review of the overall Project budget in JAN77, and a preliminary
budget and a body of technical data were submitted to the first World Bank
mission in AIUG77.  Following discussions of the information with the World Bank
mission, VALESUL set up a task force to issue a full-scale feasibility study.
This task force completed its draft report in OCT77 for discussion and
review t; the second World Bank mission, in NOV77. The study was then revised, with the following
major changes: output increase from 83.000 to 85.800 tons as a result of a nominal power current
change from 150,000 to 155,000 amperes; investment cutbacks in technology (then owned and paid
for by CVRD). working capital and interest; and reduction of manpower from 845 to 806. The final
feasibility study report was released in DEC77. became known as the "Blue Book"' and served as a
guideline forall discussionsand negotiations between VALESU Land Federal Authorities, prospective
partners and domestic and foreign financina agencies.
Between release of the Blue Book and final Project approval by the World Bank, the port facilities
option shift,ed from Rio de Janeiro to Sepetiba. then under construction, following an agreement
to that effect between VALESUL. DOCAS of Rio de Janeiro and PORTOBRAS, with World Bank
support.
The World Bank played a vital role in the VALESU L Project. by providing both funds and technical
and political support before several departments of the Brazilian Administration. On the other hand,
the in-depth technical. economic and financial analysis made by the World Bank team assigned the
VALESUL Project an intemational status which facilitated a loan headed by a commercial
bank, in addition to obtaining better prices for equipmrrent purchased through inteemational tenders.
It also played a part in sTimuiating Shell Brasil S.A. (Petr6leo) to join the VALESUL partnership.

II.a       PROJECT SCOPE
II a       COMMENT ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF PROJECT SCOPE
VALESUL %,as planned to be a medium-scale project in line with the CVRD aluminum program for
pr;marY aluminum production. with an output high enough to be technically and economically
feasible and attract both domestic and foreign private investors. It was built in Rio de Janeiro, where.
port fwitities. roads. communications and social infrastructure were available for short-term
impen-entation- The technology selected - pre-baked anode pots - was found to be
suitable in terms of power consumption and pollution control.
The central crust-breaking process and fully-enclosed pots afford VALESUL strict pollution control
and highly automated operaticns.
Throughout its development. VALESUL provided the opportunity for a number of joint ventures
between local and foreign companies, achieving effective technology absorption in the manufacture
and assembly of equipment packages.
i La (ii)  MAJOR CHANGES IN SCOPE DURING PROJECT EXECUTION AND
THEIR REASONS
Facility 24- Rodding Room - The operating and control system designed to be run from local
panels was exchanged for a centralized system in two separate operating and control rooms apart
from the operation area due to problems detected in operating  another plant designed by the
technology supplier where large amounts of dust and particles in the production area were
found to damage the panels and cause frequent production interruptions. This, allied to the complex
control system interlocks. indicated the need for central panels to be installed in separate rooms.
Another change in scope was made regarding the Bath Removal Equipment, originally a simple
system: a more sophisticated hydraulic system was installed, combined with a Basket Dumping
Machine, wholly developed for Valesul Project.
Facility 50 - Pot Room - The original pot hood design had to be substantially altered to overcome
problems encountered by domestic raw-material suppliers during prototype construction. The
hoods were redesigned for greater operating and handling ease.

tt.bs      PROJECT MANAGEMENT
I  (i)     MANAGERIAL SYSTEM EMPLOYED FOh PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
MONITORING
Project management control was performed by a Brazilian consulting firm  in
charge of Project development, with additional specialized technical advisory
support for Construction Management, and staff support of the pertinent
VALESUL divisions.
The managerial structure entailed a General Manager from the project management
firm in charge of coordinating all implementation activities and enforcing
VALESUL corporate policies within the Project, in addition to Engineering,
Planning, Procurement and ConstructLon managements accountable for the regulation
and control of executive activities developed by project engineering, procurement
engineering, suppliers and contractors.
The cost control firm, however, acted both in an advisory and executive capacity
since, while providing technical assistance to the General Management, it was
also directly in charge of Planning Management, the Cost Control Department,
and overseas Expediting and Inspection Coordination.
VALESUL was an important part of the organization by avoiding a duplicate structure merely to
over=e the activities of consulting firms. Its staff acted as support and supplementary manpower for
tasks developed by the Project's management division and executive staffs. As activities developed. a
General Project Coordination was established at VALESU L for the implementation stage.
II.b (ii)  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION
Under the managerial model employed for Project implementation, the consulting task force
developed into a General Project Management team, acting on behalf of VALESUL before outside
Project-connected organizations, such as contractors and suppliers, as well as before the Project and
Procurement Engineering executive teams set up by the consulting firm.
VALESU L was thus kept informed of development progress, obviating the need for direct
involvement in the Project's day-to-day activities. Its action was limited to specific problems affecting
regular job performance, and to the required contacTs with government and financing agencies.
VALESUL Project development was centrally monitored by General Proiect Coordination in
conjunction with General Project Management. The latter was in charge of the flow of communication
among the many sections involved, inside and outside the Project, of information screening and
control both for the Project and VALESUL.
The managerial model provided tools for monitoring the activities of detail engineering and
procurement tearms, equivalent to those applied to supervision of outside Project activities, although
the former were under the consultants' own responsibility.
This single flow of communication and information resulted in smooth relations at all levels based on
previously set guidelines and their effective enforcement.



- 29 -
I Lb (iii)  ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS
Results obtained reflect the effi,cacy of the managerial model employed, flexible enough to adapt to
the several Project phases and devoid of weak points that might have been detrimental to regular
work progress.
I.b (iv)  THE BANK'S PARTICIF'ATIC;N IN IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Since early negotiations, an open dialogue Deiwee' the Bank and VALESUL laid the
groundwork for a mutually satisfactory Project implementation structure reflecting an exchange of
views and experience gained in many simlilarly scalea developments.
The Bank's key impact on the Project organizational structure was a demand that consultants expert
in aluminum pl-- ..nplementation be hired by the Project developer, chiefly for the areas of
Management (a General Manager Assistant). Planning and Cost. Procuremnent (a Procurement Manager
Assistant for intemational tenders, overseas expediting and inspection), and Construction-
Furthermore, the periodic Project follow-up missionssent by the Bank to Brazil have always provided
pertinent suogestions to expedite Project implementation, particularly in Planning. Cost Control,
Procurement and Construction.

-31-
The technology supplier was a key driving force behind successful Project
imDleaentation.
It made available to VALESUL its experience acquired in previous developments, and
technicians allocated to the Project did their best to transfer both to the designer and the Brazilian
capital goods market all information required to adapt basic engineering data to local conditions.
Clear specifications were also provided for items purchased abroad, ensuring high quality standards
for goods and services, whatever their origin.
Such quality standards were evidenced during final erection and pre-operation by a negligible number
of problems typical of plant start-ups, and confirmed by the high performance levels achieved in
individual equipment units and the Plant as a whole during early full-scale operations.



- 32 -
Il.d       PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
II.d {i)   ASSESSMENT OF CONTRACTORS' AND SUPPLIERS' PERFORMANCE
Handling of services and supplies required a major managerial effort to overcome contractor and
supplier difficulties in meeting contract schedules.
Both area supervisors were often called to directly coordinate the actions of contractors and
suppliers to ensure on-time delivery because of constant gaps detected in work progress, mainly
under supply contracts.
This further deteriorated existing jobsite problems because, in addition to job delays, lags in
supplier information or equipment delivery could lead to critical postponements of the Project itself.
On the other hand, additional managerial efforts both minimized the impact of major delays and
greatly contributed to assure the quality of services and equipment delivered to VALESUL Such
quality standards are evidenced by the aood overall performance of the several Plant unitsafter start-up.
Il.d (ii)  MAJOR PROBLEMS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Amnong the chief causes of contractor and supplier failure are the lack of experience of some in
large-scale contracts, the fact that many a good portion of the equipment vwas being manufactured in
Brazil for the first time, and the natural difficulties in adapting a mostly standardized foreign design
to local conditions-
Altogether, these factors caused a lag between the many activities involved, from marketing, through
engineering, manufacture and erection of the several related equipment units and services, which in
tum required special controls and actions by Project Management to minimize their negative impact
on established targets. Such controls and actions, translated into direct support and supervision ot
potentially risky contract-or/vendor day-to-day activities. became the most effective means of
preventing problems and faults in work development.
II.d (iii)    SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF POOR PERFORMANCE
* Supply and Erection Contract for the Alumina Handling System
The economic constraints of the supply and erection contractor severely affected schedules since
human and material resources quantitatively and qualitatively compatible with Project scale were
unavailable.
Erection was subsequently removed from the original scope and awarded to another company after
negotiation. The latter however also met with supply problems.
The company's economic deterioration was fast and unforeseen. A survey made approximately one
year before contract signing, during prequalification of bidders for the pot cell tender, showed
contractor to be in good economic health. The proposal submitted for the handling system was
technically and commercially fair, and there was no evidence of vendor's lack of capacity to comply
with contract.
Management had to concentrate on contract follow-up to meet Project schedules. either by direct
intervention in suppliers' activities or by providing additional funds and manpower according to
contract needs.



- 33 -
* Supply and Erection Contract for Pot Room Fume Treatment System
This contract seriously threatened Project quality for several reasons, to wit:
- The technology supplier, member of the vendor Consortium, did not appear to fully employ the
expertise acquired with similar facilities in other countries, as stated during the bid evaluation.
- The supply was split into dozens of separate subcontracts requiring special controls and use of
additional manpower for follow-up. Such split deliveries included heavy steel fabrication itemr s on
which the main supplier has a substantial background.
- A poorly-qualified Consortium coordination staff, compounded by the above-mentioned facts.
required direct intervention of tne Project management team into their activities.
- The Consortium hired a poorly-qualified erection contractor, causing contract terminati.on and loss
of precious time in engaging a new contractor.
As stated before. such problems were hardly foreseeable, since the Consortium included companies
with a vast technical background and reputation in their respective markets. The problems described
were set against an unfavorable juncture which severely hindered vendor allocation of exctra resources
to minimize existing difficulties.
e Civil Construction Contract for Miscellaneous Facilities: Water Supply, Anode Plant, Baking
Furnace, Rodding Shop
Contractor commercial and technical performance was faulty throughout contract duration.
For intemal reasons, the contractor did not have enough skilled supervisory personnel and senrices
provided were not up to par. nor were amounts met.
Thecontractor also refused to shoulder costs foradditional supervisorsand equipment for the jobsite-
After all attempts made by management failed, the contract was terminated and remaining services
hired out to other contrac-.ors.
Once again, such problems were unforeseeable and probably due to an underestimated budget which
went undetected in the tender. The contractor unexpectedly refused to seek a solution to the
problems although it had fully qualified for the services awarded.
Reassignment to other contractors at the jobsite was the effective solution at that -'me..

precualification extended through 1978. VALESUL directly invited some potential vendors to subrnit
documentation after the prequalification was under way becu  they had failed to do so in due time.
Agr prequaiification reports submitted to the World Bank were approved without resevations and a
Vendor List was generated.
A purchasing procedure was develcoed under the provisions of Ministry of Finance Edict No. 6 dated
14JANP9. and approved by CACEX on 8JAN79. The first bid inquiry letters were addressed to all
prequafified bidders. in January of the same year. for the Rectifier Substation, Green Anode Plant and
Baking Furnace.
Projecr guidelines were not applied to some biddings given the nature of the equipment involved, i.e.
water-cooled frames for holding fumace doors, where a sole bidder was invited because it was
proenly the most reliable supplier.
Special procedures were also adopted to purchase the Fume Treatment Monitoring components.
A survey was run of the domestic market througn cass associations and certified manufacturers.
International bidders were invited only for those items unavailable in the country.
In addition to commercial documents required by the Advertisement guidelines and procedures were
defined to standardize purchases. Such guidelines included bid receipt and disclosure procedures
(public or private in a single- or two-stage mnethod). interface with technical personnel until Technical
Evaluation completion and issuance of criteria for Final Award Recommendations. These
recommendations were in every case approved by CACEX and the World Bank without reservations.
Exceptions were the Anode Butt Stripper reiected by CACEX and later by the World Bank because
specifications were out of line with tender requirernents, and the Process Control Computer. whose
original recommended vendor would be unable to obtain and develop the required sofwere.
T he firsa contracts were signed in JU L79 while most intemational contracts were signed within the
following 12 months. The last major contract.was signed later, in JUL81. for the Control Computer.

II.e (i) - 1.2    Expediting and Inspeccion Services by Others
The company previously hired for expediting and Inspection abroad, performed
said services in the USA and Australia and, by prior agreement with the project
manager and VALESDL, subcontracted compan-es for other countries- such as
Europe. Japan, and South Africa, all under the cost controUer's responsibility
and at tre same prlce estabrished in the original contract.
One reason for successful performance was the use of an international pu--.hasing
expert, a Procurement Management staff member who provided a direct communication
link among the several areas involved in the process.
II.e Ii)- 13  Government Licencing
Rela;iOns between VALESUL and CACEX. chief govemmental import-regulating agency. were avways
smooth and trouble-free throughout project development import licenses took an aveage 60 days,
quite reasonable fo- developments of a simrilar scale.
The only problern encountered, at the outset. was Project approval under Edict No. 6. Discussions and
enforcement of the Domestic lndustry Particpation Agreement took several months vwith critical
reflections on procurement. in particular for three Project packages: Rectifier Subs'tation.
Green Anode Plant ana Baking Fumace.
No mapor obstacles were met for approval by the Special )nformatics Secretariat-SE, for impart
of the Procssl Control Computer.
T he National Institute for Industrial Property INPI posed no obstacle to registration of contracts
for Tecnnical Services and L_anuf acture and Erection Supervision to be performed in
Brazil by foreign technicians. There was, hovever. a cerain resistance to the number of technicians
provided to supervise erectiou   of the Rectifier Substatiort promptly resolved by
Management through direct contact with INPI which accepted the arguments submitted.

II.e (i) - 2   Domestic Tendes
II.e (i) - 21  Bidding Procedures
The philosophy adopted for domestic equipment contracts was twofold: first, interdependent
equipment from several areas were brought under a single package; secondly, similar equipment from
different areas were grouped to achieve maximum centralization of responsibilities under a single
vendor for full equipment standardization. A practical outcome of this philosophy was, on the one
hand, definition of the Fume Treatment and Alumina Handling Systems at Sepetiba port and the plant,
and, on the other, electrical equipment (switching units, transformers, panels. etc.) and conventional
overhead crane packages.
Procedures adopted for donestic tenders were to a large extent similar to those used in international
biddings regarding interfaces and decision-making policies, but substantially different in bidders
selection, based on past experience with local vendors in general, and on a lack of stringent purchase
approval requiremfents by organizations other than VALESUL.
Il.e (il - 2.2  Verdor List Criteria
The starting point for domnestic biddings - bidders selection - was based on prior experience
with maj or traditioanal    equipment suppliers in many developments similar to the
VALESUL Project.
Bidders selection resulted in a vendor list averaging six companies per item, always considering bidder
capabilities to meet supply sizes.
Under this policy, major items were supplied by large-scale Brazilian equipment manufacturers-
For key electrical equipment packages, traditional manufacturers were
called in.
One of the few excections to above-mentioned criteria was the reduction cell bidding. Thirty-six
invited bidders unde:went prequalification and, after evaluation of predefined requirements
(technical, economic and financial), the 15 top-ranking vendors were invited to bid.
In view of the large number of bidders selected. a decision was reached to award two contracts, each
for half the supply, as a contingency plan should either vendor not perform satisfactorily and also
because of the great interest generated in a market short of medium-termn orders. This decision was
reversed later on. due to the advantages offered by the lowest bidder for a single contract.
Another exception to ordinary selection criteria was a policy of stimulating joint ventures between
holders of technology (ie. for Pot Room Fumne Treatment) and domestic equipment manufacturers
to facilitate FINAME financing, since fore.gn technology holders were not registered at that Agency
for the equip!rewnt in question.
II.e {i) - 2.3  Expediting and Inspection
One of the positive outcomes of the centralized hiring system was the institution of separate teams
for expediting and inspection, some working full-timne at vendor shops.
lnspectors were locally supervised by expediters and extended their support to all subcontractors to
prevent failure of overall supply development. These teams reported directly to insoection and
expediting supervisors in Rio and SWo Paulo, and to the respective contract coordinators.



- 37 -
Servicing of purchase orders for less complex equipment and materials was individually performed by
expediters and inspectors as they arose, under the overall supervision of skilled personnel (trouble-
shooters) in charge of these activities.
II.e (ii)     DIFFICULTIES IN FOLLOWING THE BANK'S GUIDELINES
No significant problems were found in enforcement of the Bank's guidelines since they were quite similar
to the applicable Brazilian legislation (Edict No. 6/69). No legal obstacles were forthcoming and
bidders were familiar with bid evaluation criteria. Reservations and claims against award decsions
were practically eliminated.
The practice of disclosing bids in a single- or double-stage operation was common in public tenders
similar to those held under the Project, and it was accordingly well-received.
II.e (iii)    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM
PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLIERS ACTIONS
The almost one-year lag between the start of Engineering and Procurement activities caused by the
time required for governrment authorization for bid requests had a major negative impact on
Procurement activities. Equipment definition and completion of Facilities design were accordingly
deferred, demanding extra efforts by all Project sections to achieve results in line with new
development requirements.
Mlajor difficulties lay witt. Alumina Handling and Fume Treatment Systems suppliers, as reported
under item I I.d above. Although they posed a real threat to Project completion, successful results
were achieved -rough the full-time dedication of all development areas involved.
II e (iv)     SPECIFIC BENEFITS TO VALESUL PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL
B IDDI NGS
Intemational biddings resulted in multiple benefits, among vv: :ch:
Biddinas held under the aegis of the Bank. with well-defined and fully-disclosed rules, forced
bidders to submit more objctive and competitive bids, and enhanced Project credibility vissa-vis
bidders and government authorities in charge of follow-up and control.
Following Govemment authorization for use of international bidding procedures, government
approval and licencing was outstandingly fast, as a result of clearly-defined procedures. This fact also
expedited the Bank's approval of procedures and significantly reduced the time required for arriving
at key Project development decisions.
Intemational tenders eliminated the need for suppliers' credits and regional financing which would
have involved restrictions on bid origin; thus all companies considered suitable prospective vendors
were called to participate with correspondingly better purchase terms and costs.
Advantages granted to mostly domestic bids, as the 15% margin of preference on CIF prices in bid
evaluations resulted in fair participation of local industries for supply of large-scale equipment
packages through partnerships with traditional foreign vendors. The spin-off was greater manufacture
flexibility, spare-part availibility and absorption of technology applicable to future expansion plans
or new developments.

II.e (v)       COST OF EQUIPMENT/SERVICES COMPARED TO APPRAISAL ESTIMATES
The following tables compare estimated equipment and services for World Bank financing to actual
figures, as itemized at Project outset and detailed in a World Bank letter dated 1 8JUN79.
Amounts indicated under the heading "Estimated at Appraisal" are those listed in Mr. L 0.
Maraboli's letter of 18JUN79.
"Expended" column amounts are those actually disbursed by the World Bank, including erection
supervision costs but excluding amounts directly paid by VALESU L.
The "Summary" table shows a comparison between "Estimated at Appraisal" versus "Expended".
Amounts for equipment and materials cancelled or directly financed have been omitted. Allocations
for Spare Parts, Erection & Installation, Freight, Physical Contingency, and Physical Contingency
(Average) were accordingly reduced by the total cost of equipment and materials not actually
financed by the World Bank.

II. f (ii)    MAJOR FACTORS CAUSING CHANGES IN SCHEDULES
Baking Furnace
ggnature of the Baking Furnace supply contract was four and a half months late as compared lo
Schedules estimated during the Appraisal. Somc cf the reasons were late bid delivery, different
q.ipmentdesignssubmittedby  the only two bidders, and
technical complexity of the heavy equipment involved. On the other hand, fumace pre-heating started
only forty-five days after physical completion because of an overrun in the Furnace Fume Treatment
,Syem first stage.
Fsodding Shop
Significant changes in basic design and complexity of the Power & Free Conveying System required
exended deadlines for bid submittal and final scope definition by Engineering.
The contract    was signed 6 months later than estimated at Appraisal. Overruns during the
powver & Free System shop design stage due to layout, electrical design and equipmnent changes, plus
short manufacturer delays partially recovered during erection resulted in a 5-month delay for anode
Conveying system sLart-up and a 9-month delay for system physical completion.
Pot Rooms
The five-and-a-half-month start-up delay of the first 12 pots had two major caue: postponement of
the pot and superstructure tenders due to lengthy negotiations with FINAME. contract financing
acency;thecontractwasawardedto a company, poorly experienced with
pot manufacturing. Quality problems in raw materials
were the early problems that severely hindered project development and caused a first overrun.
Manufacture and erection activities were later sped up. cutting down physical completion delays to
one month.
cast House
Although the Cast House was ready for start-up only three months after estimated in the Appraisal.
actual start-up took place 6 months off-schedule because of delays in other areas (Pot Rooms).
Physical completion was achieved only in OCT82 due to VDC problems encountered by the vendor,
In view of the company' s   failure, VALESUL was forced to complete machinery
erection at the jobsite.
Rectifiers & Substation
The large number of bids received (1 3). the importance and complexity of the equipment called for
lengthy technical evaluation which in tum caused a 4-month delay in placing the purchase order.
Desoite this. the firm  selected managed to recover from the delay with VALESU L support.
and compleTed erection one month late only.
Dock Unloading & Storage
Commercial problems delayed purchase orders for the travelling unloader by seven and a half months
versus Appraisal schedules. Despite the supplier's and VALESUL efforts to partially recover
from the delay, maritime shipment of imported parts were late by over three months.
Conveyors were also considerably late due to the supplier's bankruptcy -forcing
VALESUL management to take over supply and erection responsibilities.
Fume Control
The Pot Room Fume Treatment System, a landmark in the VALESUL Project, underwent considerable
financial and technical problems. Bidding for the system was five months off Appraisal schedule because



- 58 -
of lengthy financing negotiations with FINAME. All technology owners were basically foreign
corporations and thus did not meet with FINAME requirements. VALESUL was forced to support the
incorporation of joint ventures with domestic companies under transfer-ov.-technology agreements. On
the other hand. technical bid evaluation took four months against the forty-five days foreseen in the
Appraisal because of system complexity and operating and performance problems detected in units
alreadyonstreamrequiringcorrectivechanges. The winning Consortium
lacked adequate coordination because of the large number of subcontracts and a highly complex process
as yet not fully developed (handling system replacement).
VALESUL was forced to increase its follow-up efforts with the Consortium and its subcontractors
causing an impact on overall Project development up through erection. The Consortium did not seem
willing to adopt contingency actions to overcome crucial problems. Actions were initiated only after
strong demands made by VALESUL Management and serious disagreements between the parties
involved. As a result of VALESUL pressure, the westside system was incipiently put on stream in
JAN82, laying the ground for start-up of the first 12 pots. As a result of design revision caused by
equipment failures, the Consortium has just ended the process of changing the system.
Process Control
Delay in final delivery of the computer was partially caused by late placement of the purchase order due
to a joint Bank and VALESUL decision to revise purchase specifications. Final start-up was postponed
to adjust to the new reduction section start-up schedule. Multiplexers were delivered in stages and had
been fully received by start-up time.
Laboratory
The tender for laboratory-equipment and materials was seven months late due to late arrival in Brazil of
the consultant    who was to aid VALESUL in drafting technical specifications for laboratory
equipmnent. Such delay however did not affect Plant start-up.
Compressors
The late start of civil works resulted from the time required to define the number cf air compressors
to be supplied, which would affect buildingdimensions.Civilworkswere
completed on time. Delay in switchgear bidding was due to the need of defining load of other facility
equipment connected to Facility 18 switchgear. This time gap. added to late delivery o f
electrical items, required strong action by VALESU L to minimize delay effects on subsequent
operations.
Ill.f (iii)  EFFECTS AND IMPACT OF DELAYS ON PROJECT BENEFITS
A comparison of the Appraisal and actual schedules shows a difference that must be analyzed in the
light of Project progress. The chain of activi-ies created the need for an agreement between VALESUL
and the Bafik to adjust assumptions made during Appraisal to actual data obtained within the universe
of organizations involved in the Project - such as time extensions requested by bidders to submit
proposals, time required for issuing and obtaining all approvals for award recommendations - quite
different from original estimate.



- 59 -
Thts the resulting revision of targets. as per late 1979 estimates, followed criteria reflecting the
scenario at that time; and Project milestones were met with minimal deviations causing only slight
impact on Project benefits. Absorption of this impact was further helped by a particularly unfavorable
aluminum market situation due to world economy conditions.
II.f (iv)    ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIE- BORROWER TO AVOID OR REMEDY DELAYS
Major causes of Project irclementation overi uns are reported in item 11 .d above which explains
measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the effects thereof.

Il.g          CAPITAL COST, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
This item presents a breakdown of Project total and unit costs and the required financial statement
Equipment/materials cost summary by area, as well as comments on cost variations from the Appraisa l.
are included in this Report's ATTACHMENT.
The following comments are periinent to the Historical Summary of Applications.
* All figures in the applications table not related to Project direct costs and I ESA costs are based on
cash flow.
* All Project direct costs and I ES;. indirect costs are based on invoice flow.
* All information reoorted as "Project Payables- on the Applications side is an estimated or balance
figure consistent with the DEC82 balance sheet. Such figures may not check with the actual historical
accounting balance at quarter end due to subsequent reversals of entries by the Accounting Department.
* The quarterly financial adjustments were arrived at by applying a percentage consistent with the.
respective years inflation and a standard two-month lag between invoicing and effective payment.
The financial adjustment for foreign items was derived from the direct comparison of the total of such
items as registered by the Cost Control System and as paid by the World Bank.
When related to World Bank payments to Brazilian suppliers. the same difference shows a higher
percentage than that applicable to the average of local payments.
The grand total of financial adjustments (USS 22.4 million) corresponds to the totat of translation
gains and financial income during construction up to JUN82.
* Starting from DEC82 long-term fund sources and short-term loan balance. VALESU L should generate
a cash surplus f*r n operations in the amount shown in the applications table, sufficient to reimburse
all such short-term transactions. This figure was entered strictly for the purpose of balancing known
sources and does not correspond to VALESUL projected results for 1983

Nofts on Workdng Capital Requifent
The variance between the projected working capital requirement of USS 40.3 million in the Appraisal
and the final Project estimate of USS 29 million can be attributed mainly to:
* Transfer of permanent inventories of anodes and cryolite from working capital to capital assets of
Area 50- Pot Room.
* Elimination of compulsory deposits due on imports of alumina.
* Provision for sales taxes payable (ICM and IPI) not included in the Appraisal.
Other accounts in the composition of working capital show offsetting variances as demonstrated
in the working capital comparison below.

I1.g (viii)  DISBURSEMENT PROBLEMS DUE TO BANK RULES
The World Bank loan provided for partial payment of domestic and foreign suppliers was
intermediated by government and private banks. VALESUL also made advance payments to
vendors for later World Bank reimbursement.
Foreign suppliers werepromptly paid via Letters of Credit opened in their respective countries.
Some payments made out to domestic suppliers were late because of time-consuming paperwork for
which the World Bank was not responsible.
In conclusion, no overruns were incurred by the World Bank.
I1.g (ix)    PERFORMANCE OF OTHER FINANCING ORGANIZATIONS
Some remarks are in order about other financing organizations.
Chase Manhattan Bank
Loan terms required funds to be held by the Central Bank; short-notice withdrawals for payment of
expenses was therefore possible. Operations followed standard procedures.
Finame
FINAME-financed supplier paymnents were regularly made on due dates.

XIL.          COMMISSIONING AND START-UP
lII a (i)    MAJOR COMMISSIONING AND START-UP PROBLEMS
A Manual containing all procedures required, highly qualified tearns combining experience previously
acquired and skilled superv'sors provided by vendors for erection
laid the groundwork for outstanding equipment commissioning and start-up performance despite the
complexity of several units.
The expertise displayed is based on the technology supplier's experience and reflects a
comparison of VALESUL results achieved with similar recently started plants.
Serious start-up problems occurred with the Pot Room Fume Treatment System as a result of
difficulties described in item l .d, made worse by the under-qualified erection and start-up supervisory
staff provided by the vendor Consortium. Nevertheless, redoubled efforts by all involved and technical
system changes have managed to improve job performance.
Another key issue was the excessively long eight-month period spent on final Green Anode Plant
commissioning. Frequent equipment adjustment and replacements due to faulty components
manufactured by domestic and foreign subcontractors caused performance to fall short of contract and
schedule standards. Despite halting manufacture, anodes ultimately used were of acceptable quality
and allowed VALESUL to proceed with subsequent baking. rodding and, later, reduction operations.
IlI a (ii)  EXTENT TO WHICH PERFORMAiNCE GUARANTEES WERE MET
Nearly all equipment already on stream at full charge are performing at least in line with design
specifications. Monthly output rates often indicate current efficiency. Reduction and Green Anode
Plant output above expected averages, which indicate total enforcement of established performance
guarantees.
Three factors have played a key role in achievinc such high quality levels: clear and objective contract
guarantee provisions and specifications, close equipment design and manufacture follow-up, and
extensive use of qualified erection and start-up vendor supervisors. From design through start-up,
therefore, each equipment item was carefully handled to arrive ax present reliability levels.
lILa (iii)   SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITIES IN START-UP AND COMMISSIONING
Test and start-up teams were set up for this Project stage with staff members from all organizations
involved. The purpose was to equally allocate responsibilities for activities and results as well as to
ensure VALESUL complete transfer of the know-how provided by manufacturers and erectors.
Test and Start-up Teams organization is indicated in Figure I llIa (iii) - 1.

Ill.b         MANPOWER DEVELOPMENTS
lll.b Ci)     MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
In mid-1982, it became increasingly apparent that the VALESU L training program was achieving
favorable results which were still evident at year end.
This report will review the basic program followed to meet the original training objectiv, and describe
other contributing factors.
Before entering into the more formal aspects of the program, attention should be directed to the
groundwork laid for training.
The VALESUL recruiting program was well executed during earlier selection of a highly qualified
management staff. hiring of supervisors and lately, operator. Appropriate recruiting practices led to
an organization that was both willing and able to leam the skills required for efficient operation.
The technology supplier was equally diligent in selection of a staff suitable
for this type of operation and on-the-job training.
VAIML and the txeloy supplier joinly developed a 3-stage trairig plan: prior to ope°t1on, duin
start-up. and under normal operating conditions. This plan was reviewed by the World Bank for
commments and suggestions. Basic training goals and objectives were set at this time, and despite
adjustmenis ,-quired by changing conditions or schedules. the basic plan has been met to date.
Under the original plan. and prior to operations. VALESUL personnel began training overseas.
Prcgraw. were tailored to eah trainee at locat    selected   g the ten techology suppliexs plarts.
So far, 1M umz/xtbs of trainig abro  habve ben copleted by 71 employees, as coupared to the
forecast 294 manlmonths for 59 employees. There were three main reasons for reducing the period of
training overseas:
* The hiring of more highly qualified engineers and foremen, some of whom with a long backaround
in the aluminum industry.
* Labor agreements in the plants visited prevented VALESUL foremen from working 9 months as
operators at each job within related areas. The training period was accordingly reduced to
2-4 months.
* 4 baking fumace shi ftforemen and 4 pot room foremen were trained fully at VALESUL.
An altenate pln was also deveoped to bd a te loy supplier's Redtction Researi& Seminar at tie
VALESUL jobsite. This seminar provided 444 man-hours of lectures to an average II employees per
session.
Still I    the original plan, written tedholog was forwarded to VAtEL by the tedxilogy supplier's
operational training concem of Venezuela. Such operations courses have been used in VALESUL
training activities. REYNOLDS also developed Orientation to the Aluminum Industry for new
untrained employees. This orientation course has been given to 461 new VALESU L employees for a
total of 25,474 man-hours.
In additim to the traihrg mmils , the tedklnoX   supplier has furnished a  nmber of trining or
operations   -3, as we1l as other forns of written technolog, sudi as RLM Reduction Researdc report.
In 1982 alone. over 6,000 pages of technology were received by VALESUL. At this time, over 30 such
-3al or reports wee ca route frcm the technrolog  spplier to VA=J
Many other operations or maintenance manuals have been received from equipment manuf2cturers,
to be indexed and filed by the-technical library.

The rnore signifficant achievements have been in on-thejob training. From early start-up to date. on-the-
job training has been a significant part of daily activities. Skilled VALESUL personnel have been
eager to learn, technology has been presented in an orderly manner. and a wvell-trained organization is
beginning to emerge. A brief review of the training program is presented in Table IlI.b (i).
IlI.b (ii)    TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES REQUIRED FOR PROJECT OPERATIONS
At present (30JUN83)                 984
At full capacity (31DEC83)          1P017 (*)
Appraisal estimate                   806
The nearly 27% staff increase was jutstified by initially underestimated skilled manpower for
the aluminum industry.
Plant headcount was expanded to include adequate maintenance manpower for trouble-shooting.
particularly during early operation. Further hiring was needed because VALESUL cannot subcontract
maintenance services as is common practice in other countries, such as Germany.
As a result, the Company defined a maximum 991 emp:oyees for regular operation, excluding:
* Additional manpower to implement the Computer Master Plan authorized by the Board of
Directors after committee recommendations were issued.
i Additional Sales manpower reporting airectly to the Executive Director, also by decision of the
Board. Committee recommendations advised a 6-strong sales team, as indicated in the Blue Book, with
additional marketing support from shareholders for promotion at home and abroad, sales policies and
forecasts. Changes were introduced after issue of committee recommendations, as before-
No personnel had been allocated for the 1982-1983 VALESUL transition from construction to
operation. Temporary manpower was hired for this purpose, thereby overshooting the ceiling
established.
Figures reflect VALESUL's cautious personnel policy considering the nature and peculiarities of the
Brazilian labor mnarket. The Board is engaged in a staff cutback to the minimum level required for
regular plant operation.
It has been therefore reviewing corporate practices and procedures to eliminate all jobs unessential for
effective, safe and profitable operations.

III.c        BORROWEWRS OWNERSHIP AND ORGANiZATION STRUCTURE
IIlI.c (i)   CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP
I,Ic (i)-1 MI____Ment
VALESUL instituted a few organizational changes during Project implementation to suit the different
development stages.
Until early 1979. VALESUL top management comprised a President, a F,iancial Director and a
Technical Director, to whom corporate executive divisions reported. In early 1979. VALESUL
management was altered: the President was additionally appointed Technical Director and the former
divisions were replaced by two new ones - Finance, Control and Commercial. and Administrative.
This pattem remnained in force through early 1980. when a General Project Coordination - CGP
office was established for Project implementation, at the same corporate level as remaining
divisions.
The Finance. Control and Commercial Division was also split into two new sections - Finance and
Control, and Commercial. Figure II,.c (ii) - 1 shows the organizational structure in force through
implementation completion in MAY82.
The current VALESUL organization has been operating since then, as seen in Figure IlI.c (ii) -2. with
the addition of the Industrial and Administration and Purchase Divisions. the latter replacing the
Commercial section. General Project Coordination was retained until final implementation completion
when CGP sections and/or staff connected with plant operations were gradually deployed to
corresponding jobs under the Industrial Division.

IlIC (Ci)    ORGANIZATIONALSTRUCTURE
The VALESUL organizational structure underwent major changes from incorporation through start-up
of its first reduction cell in early 1982.
Exduding top management changes described in the previous item, the first major structural
modification introduced was the establishment of a General Project Coordination - CGP in charge
of project impementation. This top managemert function was vital for subsequent stes.
Through 1980, the CGP Coordination Office was set up to centralize project management. The
resulting VALESUL organization chart is indicated i n Figure l llc (ii) - 1 On 1 MAY82 an Industrial
Department was established to take over operation of plant facilities already commissioned while
CGP completed final implementation stages.
The Executive Board then decided on. and the Board of Directors approved, a new organizational
structure for VALESU L as shown in Figure II L.c {ii) - 2. in force to date.

I.c (ii     IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BORROWERS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
In the Construction Stage, VALESUL felt an area was needed to coordinate and define with the
Other corporate areas the Management and Operational Inforrnation System for the Company's
Operating stage.
On 1 1AUG80 the Systems and Methods Managemnent was created for the purpose of implementing
the VALESU L Management and Operational Information System. automating subsystems whose
volume and cost x benefit studies indicated advantages and keeping others manual.
VALESU L decided to base its Management and Operational Information Sys-em on the one used by
the technology vendor (Reynolds Intemational Inc.) with the nece3ary adaptations to Brazil's
characteristics, legislation and other peculiarities.
Key corporate staff members, both operational and support, received training at the technology sup-
plier's plants abroad. Furthermore, VALESUL requested their experts to help adapt an
implement the Management and Operational Information System. An expert in Industrial
Engineering, Cost Control and Data Processing took over this task for 3 months; an
expert in Information Systems and Data Processing for 2 months and another in Finance
Control, Budget, Cost and Property for 1 year. Their technicians were also assigne4
to the different Industrial Area activities.
In conjunction with consultants, VALESUL prepared a detailed studv
to determine the best form in which to supply timely information for control and decision making.
Through interface modules VALESUL was able to customize the technology-vendor's Information
System philosophy to some CVRD systems and suitably use the SICOC (Integrated Accounting,
Budget and Cost System), Personnel System. Materials System and Property System.
After identifying needs and priorities of each area, the VALESUL Master Informatics Plan was
defined, indicating automated subsystems, implementation dates and
required resources.
The principal subsystems which make up the VALESUL Management and Operational Information
System are:
* Integrated Accounting, Budget and Cost System
* Variable Budget System
* Materials System
* Property System (Fixed Assets)
* Personnel System
* Maintenance Planninc and Control System
* Maintenance System
e Sales System
* Invoicing System
* Credit and Collection System
* Cash Flow System
e Production Planning and Control System
* Finished-products Control System
Flowcharts of the Integrated Accounting, Budget and Cost System (SICOC) and the Materials System.
Personnel System and Property System are attached. Variable Budget (flowchart also attached).
Cost. Accounting and Budget Reports are based on these systems.

-I1d          ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
IlI d (i)   VALESUL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE
FUTURE
The environmrnnal performance of VALESU L has always been of prime concern tO its shareholders and
staff. For this r.ason environmental control equipment was specified to meet Brazilian and intematonal
emission star jarIs.
Key VALESUL environmental control equipment includes dry scrubbers for the fumes collected from
hooded pots. a dry electrostaic precipitawtor to collect dust and tars from the Anode Baking Fumace
fumes, an adequate sewage treatment plant, several dust collector systems and a storm-sewer system.
An important part of environmenmal effort is the monitoring program using stack and roof fume
samplers. watr sampling at all waste-wer sources around the Plant, vegetation sampling in a grid
around VALESUL and two outside ambient air stations to measure fluoride. SO2 and dust levels as
well as wind speed and velocities.
VALESU L's first training pots were started up in JAN82. and the start-up prograrnm was completed
in APR83. ; t is therefore not yet possible to fu3ly assess VALESU L's effect on its environment One of
VALESUL ambient air stations has just become operational, the second one will become operational
in short time, after replacernent of missing essential parts- The star-up of VALESU L's dry scrubber
systems had been quite troublesome. both from operational and ernvironmental points of view. An
wxensverevampbythesystem'smanufacturer. res1lted in significant
improvement by DEC82 The total Plant particle emission in JAN83 was 1 94 kglt aluminum produced,
and total fluorideemission 0.47 kgItAl. These numbersare well biiow the limits set by State authorities
(6.50 kg/t dust - 1.75 kgJt F monthly. 5.00 kgft dust - 125 kglt F annual average).
These results and the waste water analyses show that VALESU L's envi ronmental protection equipment
is now functioning properly.
Initial problems could possibly have been prevented by contract provisions for onsite experts from the
scrubber system technology supplier during engineering, manufacturing and erection, either
MI KROPUL USA or Germnany personnel. The experience level of their local affiliate. Ml KROPUL-
DUCON, has proved to be too thin.
It would also have been advantageous to establish a higher priority on installation of the ambient air
stations to -make available ample preoperational environmental data for monitoring emissions to the
enrvironment and for later comparisons with operational data.
I I.d (ii)   PROS AND CONS OF ALTERNATIVE POLLUTION CONTRO L EQU IPMENT
Pot-room Fumes
The only other viable environmental system is a wet scrubber linked to hooded pots. Its performance
may be similar but the economics are in favor of dry scrubbers as installed at VALESU L Design
specifications forthe two dry scnrbber systems considered, were similar;
the latter was chosen because of price.

Carbon Baking Fumace Fumes
Smelters built in areas with more SO2 emitting industries will need to install a wet electrostatic
precipitator in line with the dry ESP as used in VALESUL This would also take care of the fluorides
originating from the anode butt fraction.
Chlorine Used in Metal Degassing
Man degassing systems use pure chlorine necessitating a fume treaurent system. VALESUL opted for
the use of the best available technology to minimize the use and emission of chlorine instead of the
cleaning of larger emissions. A chlorine/nitrogen blend and optimization of this gas distribution in he
metl in a separate filter box instead of the holding fumace result in a reduction of chlorine consumption.

II.I         BUILD-UP OF PRODUCTION AND CAPACITY
The first reduction cells went on stream in JAN82 using imported anodes (4.000 units) and a small
percent2ge of domesticaily-produced alumina. The driving factor behind this start-up was to provide a
3-month training opportunity and to test all sections under low charge conditions. For reduction cell
start-up continuity VALESUL required in-house baked anode production and a reliable pollution control
system, both achieved in MAY82 when the Green Anode Plant passed the performance test and the
Anode Baking Furnace Fume Treatment System electrostic precipitator came an stream. The cell
start-up schedule was delayed because of construction problems and operational difficulties in reduction
furne treatnent and alumina handling equiprment
By DEC82. emission rates were excellent. Treatment system drag chain conveyors were replaced by air
slides (JAN/FEB83) and the full line of reduction cells went on szream on 1 APR83. It should be
noted that at no time was any cell down for repair or relining.
Capacity and production build-up of the three VALESU L production units is specified in Table I I I e

IV (I)        COMPARISON OF ACTUAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT WITH APPRAISAL
Prevailing aluminum market trds are widely different from 1978t79 as a natural outcome of market
adjustments to overall adverse economic conditions affecting developed economies worldwide.
The market is now strongly price-regulated to more accurately reflect supply and demand interplays
than did producer price lists.
The expected 4.5% world demand increase from 1980 onwards did not materialize because of the
widespread economic crisis.
Most new developmnent projects were accordingly slowed down. Some plants were temporarily shut
down and other older facilities scrapped because it would not be economically advisable to resume
operation after prolonged shut-downs.
Thus, even after supply cutbacks, available inventories continued to grow and strongly depressed
prices through year-end 1982.
The sellers' market practice of following producer price lists was discarded for all intents and purposes
since listed prices were largely unrealistic. Given the circumstances. world aluminum purchase and sales
activities shifted from a more conservative stance to a more realistic attitude throuah LME mechanisms.
Loan required and to be secured by metal production found good receptivity in Tradiag Companies
generally associated to major ban ks. As a result, a significant portion of available aluminum stock was
traded outside traditional producer x consumer patterns and became a commodity, falling under usual
LME marketing standards for non-ferrous metals.
A look at Figure IV (i) - I shows changes in several international pricing mechanisrns and major
inventories on a monthly basis, from JAN79 through APR83.
In contrast with the rest of the world and despite severe economic hardships, the Brazilian shortage of
primary metal pushed prices way over intemational figures. As a result, expansion projects and new
plant development were strongly stimulated. Primary aluminum supply and demand trends
observed in 1979 have been confirmed with the exception of a better integrated (verLicaiized) pattern
for this basic commodity, while other expansion projects and new plant developments were
accomplished as scheduled.
These apparently trouble-free market conditions remained in force until 1982 when VALESU L becan
regular producrion and marketing activities. The internal economic scenario deterio.rated during the
second half of that year causing the Brazilian market to fail to absorb marketed produczion which.
according to 1979 forecasts, should not have been sufficient to cover domestic demand for the metal.
Primary metal producers came to a pricing deadlock.
Strongly-held vievws and inexperience with adverse market situations kept prices at levels ranging .rom
USS 1,500 to USS 1.700 per ton while inventories built up: on the other hand, international market
prices were hardly attractive or high enough to cover the USS 950/ton oroduction cost of most
Brazilian primary metal producers.
Year-end 1982 inventories indicated how disastrous the year's sales strategy had been - primary metal
stocks held by producers on 31DEC hit 22.527 tons, although VALESUL output was then at only 60%
rated capacity. The 1983 forecas therefore indicated a difficult situation and increasing inventory
build-ups as a result of a futher economic slump.
The supply and demand balance forecast for the Brazilian market in 1983 as wel I as 1982 statistics are
shown in Table IV (i) - 7.

Future prospects for the supply/demand balance in the intemational market indicate faster demand
growth than supply recovery rates. Considering a current 35% idle capacity of international producers
and accelerated demand growth indicators. in addition to clear signs of world inventory reduction (over
4.5 million tons in DEC82 and about 3.5 million tons in APR83). it is believed that a balance between
supply and demand will be achieved only by mid-1985 or early 1986. Should expectations be
confirmed, a push toward higher prices can be envisaged.
Domestic market forecasts are shown next in Table IV (i) - 2.

Price trends are closely tied to recovery of the domestic economy, however. If. on the one hand, the
FEB83 maxi-devaluation of the cruzeiro significantly stimulated competition of Brazilian producers in
intemational markets, on the other, it has adversely affected domestic prices and generated pressures
toward government pricing controls.



- 126 -
Therefore. should growing export prices be considered in combination with higher domestic sale
revenues through a more balanced product mix, and with higher income from exports backed by tax and
credit incentives, VALESUL average sale prices in both markets are expected tO reach the following levels:
US$ 1,650 in 1983; USS 1.700 in 1985; USS 1,800 in 1990; and USS 2,000 in 1995.

IV U')       COMPANY SALES BY MAJOR PRODUCT LINES
VALESUL primary aluminum sales started in FEB82. Primary aluminum ingots were the first product
marketed and subsequently somne slabs were test-sold to domestic consumers, followed by a smaller
amount of billets
The rationale behind this policy was the fact that VALESUL had just come on stream and ingots would
be a more reliable product to market than others requiring finer machinery adjustnents with less reliable
outcome and r arketing prospects.
1982 sales figures are given below, where ingots account for almost g8;6

A total 16.601 tons were delivered to the domestic market.
Because of a poor domestic economic outlookand clear recovery of international prices. VALESULwas
forced to seek foreign markets as main sales targets. Domestic consumers were not neglected however.
A distribution plan was implemented to keep VALESU L supply share at adequate levels. Inventories
were prevented from building up or becoming depleted to a level where VALESUL average prices miaht
drop to a point detrimental to the company's economic health.
Tables IV (ii) - 1 and 2 reflect VALESUL sales planning for 1983.
1984 and 1985 domestic consumption forecasts and sustained improvement of international market
prices have resulted in the sales forecasts and product mix indicated in Tables IV (ii) - 3. 4. 5 and 6.
Projections beyond 1985 would seem somewhat premature. However, account taken of current
prospects, 1985 plans are thought to apply to subsequent years.

V.a           SALES PERFORMANCE
The Appraisal's sales estimate of FEB79 was based on a 1977 CONSIDER market study, which estimated
an increase of nearly 11% per annum by 1980, and about 15% per annum in the B0s. In fact ihe world
recession of recent years shows a completely different picture, as seen in the table below:
BRAZiLIAN DEMAND
(t X 103)
1979         1980        11981         1982          1983
79 Estimate                 348           385          443          508           583
Actual                       342          361          289          311           321
The decline in demand accounted for a surplus in the Brazilian domestic market, since JULB2 at a
time when the Brazilian domestic output reached 26,000 tons per month.
The increase in VALESUL CBA and ALCAN (Aratu) production to 33,000 tons/month
generated a sustained 7,500-ton surplus, higher than the VALESUL output.
During 1982. domestic prices ranged between USS 1,700/ton and USS 1,600/ton versus the USS 950 -
1,050 of the intemational free market, an additional barrier to surplus exports.
As of FE883, extemal market prices increased to USS 1,300 - 1,400,'ton and a simultaneous
maxi-devaluation of the cruzeiro depressed domestic prices to USS 1,1 50/ton, dramatically changing
the whole scenario.
An export drive was therefore considered as an outlet for domes.ic surpluses.
However, agreements between producers and the Brazilian government seek to ensure domestic supply.
Brazilian authorities, not least of all CACEX, demand that only aluminum surpluses be considered for
export.
This wil l be the trend throughout 1983. while domestic and intemational prices are expected to even
out in 1984.
Under the circumstances, VALESUL has assured a regular supply to traditional domestic customers.
Surpluses will be exported.
By JUN83, around 40,000 tons of aluminum had been sold to both domestic and international markets,
for total revenues of USS 52.000,000.

V.b           PRODUCTION COSTS
Comparative analysis of the VALESUL unit cost breakdown staff appraisal report estimates versus
actual DEC82 figures.
V.b - 1      COMMENTS
An objective analysis of the VALESUL cost breakdown must bear in mind that key cost components
such as alumina, basic inputs, electric power and depreciation account for about 80% of total cost
Their variation has been slight as compared to values estimated by the World Bank Staff Appraisal
Report.
V.b- 2       GENERAL REMARKS

V.c (iii)    COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVEEMANTS
Along the period, VALESU L kept the debt/equity ratio within the 7020 !imits established by the Bank.
Item C. clause i, section 5.0.4 of the Appraisal.
The current ratio is within the 1:1 limit, as agreed with the Bank. On 31 DEC82 the ratio was 2.3:1.
No dividend was paid or distributed to meet the current ratio.
All loans meet with provisions of the original contract and its DEC82 amendment.
No debt3 or investments were entered into with other companies in the period.
No stock was sold by the shareholders.
Since 1979, annual financial statements audited by independent auditors have been forwarded to the
Bank.

V.d           FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN FOR THE PROJECT
Financial forecasts are expressed in constant 1981 USS thousand.
The following inflation rates were applied throughout the financial analysis to have the item expressed
in current 1981 USS thousand.
INTERNATIONAL PRICE INFLATION 1%)
1981                   8.66 (actual)
1982                   3.88 (actual)
1983                   8.0 (estimated - WB telex 28APR83)
1984                   7.5 (estimated)
1985                   7.0 (estimated)
1986 on                6.0 (estimated)
It has been assumed that full production will be reached in 1983, and that salestonnage per year shall be:
Year                   Tons
1982                   16,601
1983                   88.794
1984                   86,000
1985                   86,000
1986 on                86,000
Only ingots will be available for sale in 1982 and 1983.
The 1984 product mix is estimated to be 50% ingots, 25% slabs and 25% billets, changing over to
30% ingots. 35% slabs and 35% billets from 1985 onwards.
It was assumed that Brazilian ingot prices in current USS will be as follows:
Year                   USS/ton
1982                   1.434
1983                   1,475
1984                   2,000
1985                   2.100
1986                   2.247
A 7% increase over the 1986 ingot price was assumed for 1987 onwards.
A 12% premium over the ingot price was estimated for billets and slabs.
Production costs were based on estimated unit production costs for VALESU L in DEC83.

Subtotal              111.28
Total                  90924
To compute production costs in constant 1981 USS over the 25 year period analyzed. its was assumed
that:
Alumina price is 12.5% of the ingot price for 1984 onwards. For 1983. the price shown above was
deflated at rates already mentioned.
"Electrolytes" were also deflated, and prices were assumed to remain constant over the period analyzed.
Anode prices were converted into cruzeiros using an estimated exchange rate, and from cruzeiros
into "ORTNs" (Indexed Treasury Bonds) by applying 1981 rates, we arrive at anode prices in
1981 USS. for a constant value over the period analyzed.
T he same method was applied to convert "Other Materials". "Electric Power". "Labor: VALESUL".
"Insurance" into 1981 USS, remaining unchanged over the period analyzed.
For."Fuel". we deflated the DEC83 price, using the inflation rates mentioned, for constant values over
the period analyzed.
For 'Labor: tchnoovey Suppier" the inflation rate was used as a deflator to produce prices in 1981 USS.
As for "Other Expenses" we used the same method applied to "Other Materials".
For 1984, wve assumed a reduction of 5096, and from 1985 on there is no cost involving TeChDalOg s5miau
manpower. For 1982 we used the same produaion cost as for 1983.
The expected Project financial rate of return is:
rate of retum before taxes 12.1%
rate of return after taxes    8.2%
years to recover        17.8

The Case WB - US - FA computer lists (see ATTACHMENT) contain our Financial Forecast model as
well as Financial Statements and corresponding rate of return computations.
For the saer item, a sensitivity test was run (Case WB - US - FA1) considering that the Project
investment is 100% equity-financed. The financial rate of return is as follows:
rate of return ber--taxes 11.8%
rate of return after taxes    7.9%
years to recover        153

Va           ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND RATE OF RETURN
V.e {i)      MAIN ECONOMIC BENEFITS
The main economic benefits arising from the VALESUL Project can be listed as follows:
* Development of auxiliary industries to supply
-special travelling cranes for pot rooms and baking fumace, with imported technology;
- insulating and firebricks with higher quality standards, especially closer size tolerances;
- special pollution control equipment, with imported technology (dry scrubbing); and
- special equipment for computer process control.
* Importation of new technology for
- pot operation;
- forming and baking of large carbon shapes;
- use of process computers together with development of related software;
- manufacture of special-purpose travelling cranes;
- manufacture of pollution control equipment; and
- developmnent of new envir.onmental protection standards.
* Increased employment to meet manpower requirements of the Santa Cruz smelter as well as
installation of potential spin-off industries mentioned above.
* VArESUL smelter output, under normal market conditions, to fill the aluminum needs of Brazilian
manufacturers, thus decreasing the out-flow of foreign currency associated with imports of an
equivalent tonnage of the metal.
V.e (;)      FOREIGN EXCHANGE BENEFITS
At full production, the Project's output will be about 86.000 tons.
Considering a heavy debt service year (1987), the Project will replace an estimated USS 232 million in
imports which, net of imported raw materials, is estimated at abou; USS 206 million. After principal
andinterest payments on foreign loans, the Pioject would still generate exchange savings of
approximately USS 159 million.
See Case WB - US - EA computer list showing such forecasts in the ATTACHMENT.
V.e (iii)    ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
The Project economic rate of return is derived from the financial rate of return, with the following
adjustments.
The aluminum ingot price used was given by World Bank telex on 28APR83. It is expressed in 1981
constant USS according to the US - Producer Price List (FOB):



- 153 -
Year                USS/Ton
1982                 1.668
1983-1984              1.617
1985-1989              1,651
1990-1994               1,791
1 995-2001              1.858
The product mix is the same as for the financial analysis as well as assumed slab and billet premiums
112%).
The FOB aluminum ingot price was raised by 16% to consider freight. insurance and port-handling costs.
Over this a 30% shadow pricing facior was considered to reflect foreign trade distortions caused by
anport tariffs and restrictions, export taxes, incentives and subsidies.
Unit production costs were taken into account and some financial cost adjustments made for the
economic analysis, as follows:
* The cost of alumina was assumed to be 12.5% of the aluminum ingot price (FOB) after 1984 and
deflated for 1983. but a 30% shadow pricing factor was added since it is an imported raw material.
* Electrolytes and fuel were deflated as in the financial analysis, but a 30% shadow pricing factor was
also applied to account for the fact that they are imported raw materials.
* For "Anodes". "Other Materials", "Labor: VALESUL", "Insurance". Lalr-Tacbnasly SuppiuT". and
-other Expenses", financial analysis cost estimates were used.
* Electric power costs are identical as for the financial analysis, because at current DEC83 values
VALESUL cost is 18.64 mills. After conversion into cruzeiros. into ORTNs, and further conversion at
1981 rates, we arrive at a cost of 2298 mil's. As the cruzeiro/USS devaluation rate is higher than
domestic inflation, we decided to use the 2298-mi 11 cost which is nearer intemational prices and will cover
currency fluctuations.
The economic rate of return derived from the financial projection is:
rate of return before taxes 32.5%
rate of return after taxes    24.1%
years to recover          9.3
See in the ATTACHMENT a Case WB - US - EA computer list containing our Financial Forecast
mnodel with corresponding Financial Statements and rate of return computation.
A sensitivity test was run for this item (Case WB - US - EA2) considering a 100% equity-financed
Project investment. We arrived at the economic rate of return as folloys:
rate of return before taxes   24.7%
rate of return after taxes    17.9%
Years to recover          10.5
The Case WB - US - EA2 computer list is included in the ATTACHMENT.
Another sensitivity test was run considering the US aluminum ingot price for shipment to Europe
free market price (Case WB - US - EA1) given in World Bank telex of 28APR83. The economic rate
Of return will be as follows:



- 154 -
rate of return before taxes   27.6%
rate of return after taxes    20.6%
years to recover         10.6
Considering a heavy debt service year (1987), the Project will replace imports at estimated
USS 232 million.
Net of imported raw materials, this estimate is about US$ 206 million. After principal and interest,
payments on foreign loans, the Project would still generate exchange savings of approximately
USS 159 million.
The Case WB - US - EAl computer list is included in the ATTACHMENT.
The previous sensitivity test (WB - US - EA1) was used once again, under the heading of Case WB -
US - EA3, considering a 100% equity-financed project investment. We arrived at the economic rate of
return as follows:
rate of return before taxes   21.9%
rate of return after taxes    15.8%
years to recover         11.1
See Case WB - US - EA3 computer list in the ATTACHMENT.
In addition to replies provided to items requested, two Financial Forecasts were prepared in current
dollars, one at US - Shipment to Europe prices (Case WB - US - STE) and the other considering
the US - Producer Price List (Case WB - US - PLP) provided by World Bank telex dated 28APR83.
The basic assumptions are shown in Tables V.e (i ii) - 1 and 2.

Vta&b         BANK INVOLVEMENT. APPRAISAL AND CONTRIBUTION TO PROJECT
FORMULATION
World Bank participation in the Project was a major asset for implementation of the VALESUL Plant
Bank involvement was timely and the Loan Agreement condusion delay was caused by resistance of-
Brazilian authorities to application of Ministry of Finance Edict No. 6 unless the Domestic Industry
Participation Agreement was simultaneously signed to ensure allocation of a share of materialVequipment
supplies to local manufacturers. However, once participation of the domestic industry was shown to be
feasible even under intErnational tender conditions. the support lent by those same authorities was a
key factor for Project success.
During Project appraisal, the Bank played a vital role in different spheres always aiming at greater Plant
operating reliability, improved implementation costs and production, particularly in:
* Bidder prequalification.
* Electric power supply through two separate transmission lines.
* Alumina supply assurance from more than one source.
- Construction of a maritime terminal near the Plant in Sepetiba to avoid traffic problems-and shorten
alumina inland-transport distances with provisions for expansion when and if required. at reduced
investment rates.
a Demand that the Green Anode Plant. Anode Baking Fumace, Main Substation and Rectifier System
be purchased in packages that would ensure overall system performance.
e Special attention to fume treatment systems for improved polluticn control at Plant site.
Bank suggestions and effective involverment with third parties were highly positive.
Specifically in th-- area of pollution control, the Ban k's firm stand forced VALESU L. c*ze t:1ologD suppller and
State environmental authorities to extensively research up-to-date and stringent intemational codes
and standards. It should be underscored that domestic engineering profitted from true techrology
tansfer on pollution measurement and control methods and procedures.
The relations between the Bank and VALESUL throughout Project implementation were outstanding,
particularly because almost 100% of the recommendations for contract awards were acceoted quickly
and without reservations. These facts laid the ground for fast placement of orders while the Bank
stimnulated issue of letters of intention even before formal approval of recommendation. Design
engineering and construction, activities not financed by the Bank. were nevertheless closely followed
for work progress, reliability and improvement assurance.

VlC           EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT OF BANK SUPERVISION ACTIVITIES
Bank performance in setting basic engineering, construction and procurement criteria was over and
beyond what might be expected from a financing agency, thanks to the technical expertise evidenced
by Bank representatives, their professional stance and interest in rendering the Plant a model for future
development
Thus, the Bank's supervision was effective and had a positive impact. Allied to the efforts of VALESUL
and itsConsultants and Contractors, it permitted the timely resolution of problems that might otherwise
have jeopardized Project success.
From a different viewpoint, we believe that experience gained by the Ban kin dealing with problems
and seeking solutions for future financing projects in Brazil is an added asset.

VI.d    OVERlALL ASSESSMENT OF COVENANT USEFULNESS
An overall assessment of the advantages derived from World Ban klVALESUL covenants can be made
by studying item E.8.14 of the Staff Appraisal Repcrr - Major Risks.
The current situation of aluminum pricing by the Brazilian government is stable. Past the initial stage of
operations with an increased output due to both improved equipment adiustmts a-id operator
performance, production costs have fallen. But the profit margin is stili unsatisfactory.
On the other hand, there is an increased foreign market demand keeping the Plant at full.scale
production which further cuts operating costs.
With regard to CVRD's lack of experience in the aluminum industry, the Bank's expectations that
no managerial problems should arise from Plant operatian were fully met. The effective involvement
of REYNOLDS and SHELLVBI LLITON in Project implementation and their comprehensive
training program assured Plant operation reach a satisfactory level in short time.
Due to careful and serious attention given by all parties involved, ecology and pollution control
problems were conveniently overcome. VALESUL regular measurements vouch for it.
Considered another risk in the Appraisal. Project management was developed at a high level.
not only because VALESUL formied a task force familiar with the aluminum industry, but also
through theeffortsof the consultants who lent the best
of their experience and potential to Project implementation.
Thus, these facts allied to other facts already mentioned in this Report prove that covenants between
the World Bank and VALESUL positively contributed to Project success.

VII.         CONCLUSION
Experience gained by all those involved in the VALESUL Project was most attractive.
Developed at a time of worldwide economic-financial upheavals due to well-known facts, it proved
that diligence can effectively solve problems even if mostly unexpected.
One of the first effects of this fact, considering world recession, was the highly competitive
intemational biddings (ICB and shopping) resulting in advantageous prices foc key supplies.
Also, the lack of short-and medium-term orders on their portfolios led bidders to submit tenders with
thinner profit margins than usual at no damage to quality. Furthermore, manufacturing time was
also shorter than estimated, enabling VALESU L to recover part of the time lost in starting
biddings.
Considering Brazil's economic-financial crisis, more severe than the world crisis, local contracts for
construction, equipment supply and erection permitted recording several situations that influenced
Project development:
e Companies that submitted bids with a small saftey margin for contingencies and were unable to
meet commitments.
* Even companies that made commitments at market par values, during service execution found
themselves pressed by adverse economic-financial conditions and lacking funds to complete contract.
* Companies without orders on hand, and consequently with idle manpower, were able to lend
heavy support to the Project at good prices and reduced time.
* Companies with no condition to overcome lack of orders had to cutback manpower and were
unable to meet deadlines.
* Companies that took on the obligation of manufacturing equipment, and were unfamiliar with the
specific technology. had to develop a great effort in manufactuing engineering and in the manufacture
of such equipment.
Each situation had to be dealt with on a one-by-one basis, a daily exercise in ingenuity and
dedication to which every organization and especially the people involved added their effort towards
a solution. Solutions had to protect both VALESU L's and contractors' interests, because if
contractors failed to meet obligations it would be more damaging to the Project.
It is noteworthy that in spite of setbacks in several areas, they were managed so as not to interfere
with start-up of dependent units. Thus, start-up of completed units did not suffer interruptions
awaiting completion of other units, excluding Cast House.
Another outstanding point was the smooth transfer of technology.
In fact, both VALESUL and its local Consultants had the opportunity to absorb modem technology
in the field of aluminum production during Project development - a priceless asset for future
projects in Brazil.
