I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Government of Brazil and Valesul Aluminio S.A. (Valesul) have
requested a Bank loan of US$98 million equivalent to assist in financing a new
plant for the reduction of alumina with a capacity of 86,500 tons per year
(TPY) of aluminum ingots, slabs and billets, to be erected at Santa Cruz, Rio
de Janeiro (Map IBRD 13211). Alumina will initially be imported and eventually
supplied from alumina refineries planned for the Amazon region. Santa Cruz
has been designated as an area of future industrial development. Located 54
km. west of the centre of the city of Rio de Janeiro, it is near the Bay of
Sepetiba, the site of the Mineracoes Brasiliera Reunidas' (MBR) 1/ iron ore
loading terminal, future bulk unloading port facilities, and the present site
of Companhia Siderurgica de Guanabara S.A. (COSIGUA), a privately-owned steel
plant 2/.
1.02        Valesul's capital will initially be 61% owned by Companhia Vale do
Rio Doce (CVRD), a public sector enterprise primarily engaged in the mining
and export of iron ore, but it is intended that steps be taken to make the
Valesul venture simultaneously controlled by Brazilian and private owners.
A 35% participation is to be taken by Shell Brasil, a subsidiary of Royal
Dutch Shell (UK/Netherlands), and a 4% participation by Reynolds International,
Inc. (RII), a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals, Ltd. of the US (Reynolds), whose
prebaked-anode reduction process is being used in the plant. Brazilian
private participation is eventually expected through the sale by CVRD of part
of its shares.
1.03        The project is expected to be completed by December 1981 and is
estimated to cost about US$370 million equivalent, including US$186 million
in foreign exchange. It will be financed with 40% equity from CVRD, Shell and
Reynolds; local credits from FINAME 3/ and a commercial bank loan, as well as
the proposed Bank loan.
1.04        The project was appraised in November 1977 by a mission consisting
of Messrs. H.E. Wackman (Chief), L.O. Maraboli and W. Bertelsmeier of the
Industrial Projects Department, and J. Loyer (Consultant). Follow-up missions
took place in May and July, 1978.

II. THE BRAZILIAN PRIMARY ALUMINUM SECTOR
A.   Structure of the Sector
2.01       With its substantial reserves of bauxite, abundant hydropower and
an aluminum market with enormous growth prospects, Brazil is particularly well
placed for the long-term development of an integrated, large-scale aluminum
industry. First significant aluminum production commenced over 25 years ago,
and the Brazilian primary aluminum sector is now comprised of three private
companies that operate bauxite mines and facilities to produce alumina and
aluminum. These companies are: (i) Alcan Aluminio do Brasil, which is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan Aluminum Limited of Canada; (ii) Companhia
Mineira de Aluminio (Alcominas), 1/ which is owned by the Aluminum Company of
America (Alcoa-US) 50%, the Hanna Mining Company (US) 42.5% and by local
investors 7.5%; and (iii) Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio (CBA), fully owned
by the Brazilian Votoratim family enterprises. These companies are presently
producing at installed capacity, and their output has been approximately as
follows:

2.02       Alcan is the oldest primary aluminum producer in Brazil.  Its opera-
tions were started in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais (Map IBRD 13222) in 1951, in
a plant of 2,000-TPY capacity, which had been operated briefly by Electro
Quimica Brasileira in 1945. At present, it has capacity to produce 32,000 TPY
in Ouro Preto and 28,000 TPY in Bahia. All the primary aluminum output is
consumed by local, downstream fabricating plants also owned by Alcan. Alco-
minas has been operating at Pocos de Caldas in Minas Gerais since 1970. It
is not involved in fabrication and is the sole supplier of local, primary
aluminum to independent fabricators. Finally, CBA started to operate in
1/   The Alcominas plant, with an initial capacity of 25,000 TPY, was partly
financed by IBRD Loan No. 526-BR of January 1968 for US$22 million
equivalent. Completion report is dated July 28, 1972.



Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, in 1955. Its level of integration includes fabrication
of all output and self-generation of hydropower. At present, apart from the
Alcan and CBA fabricating facilities, semi-fabrication of slabs, ingots and
billets into extrusions, sheet and coil is also carried out by a number of
independent companies, 44 of which consume approximately 80% of non-integrated,
primary aluminum output. Semi-fabricating capacity is at present significantly
underutilized, owing partly to insufficient supplies of primary aluminum,
which are restricted partly by import deposits and licenses (para. 2.22).
2.03       Production of local alumina and bauxite, as shown below, is vir-
tually sufficient to supply all present demand from the Brazilian aluminum
industry. During 1977, however, Alcominas produced 50,000 tons of alumina
above its own requirements, in order to supply Alcan with 20,000 tons and
CBA with 30,000 tons.

US$1.0 million p.a. (para. 2.24).

2.04      Profits of the existing companies in the industry have attained
quite high levels, given the continuing shortage of metal, growing demand and
the integrated nature of the industry, from the mining of good-quality bauxite
through to fabricated products. Profitability has been higher among the
longer-established companies (Alcan and CBA), reflecting the greater profit-
ability of fabricating operations, the output of which, unlike primary alumi-
num, is not subject to Government price control. Also, the older companies'

assets were acquired mainly prior to the substantial increase in capital costs
for plant in the early to mid-1970's; and in the case of CBA, its captive
power costs are very low, as are its financial expenses, given its policy of
minimum debt financing.
B.   Sector Development Program
1.    Background
2.05       In spite of the rapid growth of output of about 16% p.a. during the
1970's, the local, primary aluminum industry has not kept pace with the rising
demand. Further growth is favored by expected increases in the presently low
per-capita consumption, which has been restricted by the limited range of
aluminum applications in Brazil, in turn a function of the limited avail-
ability and high cost of importing primary aluminum.
2.06       Current plans to develop the sector are oriented to substituting
for imports and saving foreign exchange. The industry's development is also
envisaged as having a significant role in developing the Amazon region near
Belem, because its major development thrust will eventually be focused in
that area, close to large deposits of bauxite and hydropower sources.
2.07       The major elements comprising the sector's investment into the
mid-1980's are: (i) expansion of all existing private alumina and alumi-
num facilities; (ii) implementation of new alumina and aluminum plants mainly
promoted by CVRD; and (iii) development of new bauxite mines by CVRD and
private interests.
2.    Expansion of Existing Sources of Aluminum, Alumina and Bauxite
2.08       Plans for the expansion of existing aluminum plants by the exist-
ing producers also encompass development of increased capacity to produce
alumina and bauxite. Some of these projects are already under execution,
and the completion of these and the other planned expansions are projected to
result in expanded output as follows:

2.09       According to studies prepared by CVRD, investments between 1977-
1980 for the above-mentioned expansions of production amount to approximately
US$270 million in 1977 terms, broken down as follows: Alcan, US$90 million;
Alcominas, US$80 million; and CBA, US$100 million.
2.10       Given that domestic primary aluminum production still only satis-
fies less than two thirds of consumption and the fact that aluminum can be
produced economically in Brazil, the local market will absorb substantial
further expansion of the existing producers, and with the continuing strong
growth in demand, there is ample room for more local production. Rather than
market potential, the main constraint to growth of the industry continues to
be access to capital. This is especially true of CBA, which unlike the for-
eign-owned Alcan and Alcominas, is more dependent on local sources of funds.
Furthermore, it has followed a policy of expansion largely through self-gener-
ated funds. Its ultimate growth constraint at its present site is its own
power-generating potential.
3.    Development of New Aluminum and Alumina Plants
2.11       New aluminum and alumina projects being promoted by CVRD encompass
investments of approximately US$3.0 billion in 1977 prices. They include the
320,000 TPY ALBRAS (Aluminio Brasilieiro, S.A.) aluminum reduction plant;
the 800,000 TPY ALUNORTE (Aluminio do Norte, S.A.) alumina refinery and the
86,000 TPY Valesul reduction plant (Chapter VI - The Project). The first two
projects would be established near Belem in the Amazon region (Map IBRD
13222). Their ownership and development have been under negotiation for about
three years between CVRD and a consortium of 32 Japanese companies under the
sponsorship of the Governments of Brazil and Japan. According to present
plans, ownership of ALBRAS would be 51% by CVRD, and 49% by the Japanese.
Production would be distributed in equal portions between both partners.
ALUNORTE is envisaged as having a 63% CVRD/377% Japanese ownership. Its
alumina output would be consumed entirely by the ALBRAS and Valesul smelters.
2.12       The feasibility study for ALBRAS was prepared by CVRD, Montreal
Engenharia, Mitsui Aluminum, and NIPPON Light Metal (Japan) in 1976. It
indicates that the project could start production by 1981 if implementation
had started in 1977. The feasibility study for the ALUNORTE project, pre-
pared by CVRD, Alcan (Canada) and Montreal Engenharia also in 1976, indicates
that production of alumina could start in 1982 if implementation had started
in 1977. Both schedules are no longer attainable because CVRD has only
recently concluded certain agreements on these projects, and only engineering
work has commenced. Based on present data, it appears that both the ALBRAS
and ALUNORTE projects will yield very low economic rates of return. The
estimated total investment requirements for the ALBRAS/ALUNORTE projects and
associated infrastructure are presently estimated to be at least US$2. 7
billion equivalent, at 1977 prices, to be spent over a nine-year period.
2.13        Plans for a fourth project (i.e. in addition to ALBRAS, ALUNORTE
and Valesul), the Aluminio de Pernambuco (ALUNE) smelter proposed for Recife,
in the northeast, have been halted largely due to lack of Government support



- 6 -
and the uncertain availability of adequate power; it is not clear whether the
project will be developed. An aluminum reduction plant similar to Valesul,
this project would have an annual capacity of 80,000 tons. No operating
sponsor exists, although Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlman (France) has shown some
interest, and the plant has the support of BNDE and SUDENE (Superinten-
dencia de Desenvolvimiento do Nordeste). Aluminio S.A. (ASA), an aluminum
fabricating plant in Recife, which has experienced financial difficulties and
with some modifications could reach a capacity of 60,000 TPY, would supposedly
benefit from the proximity of a smelter.
4.   Development of New Bauxite Mining Projects
2.14      The most important bauxite prospects are located in the Amazon
region (Map 13222). According to CVRD, this region has approximately one
billion tons of proven reserves plus 3.2 billion tons of probable reserves,
as compared to present domestic bauxite output of about 1.0 million TPY. The
first project in the Amazon Region, already nearing completion, is Mineracao
do Rio Norte's Trombetas mine, which is owned 46% by CVRD and 54% by the
following firms: Alcan (Canada) 19%; A/S Aardal og Sunndal Verk (Norway) 5%;
Billiton International Metals (Netherlands) 5%; CBA (Brazil) 10%; Empresa
Nacional del Aluminio S.A. (Spain) 5%; Norsk Hydro A.S. (Norway) 5%; and
Reynolds Metals (US) 5%. Planned initial production is 3.35 million TPY
of bauxite with the first shipment scheduled for 1979. The mine and ore
processing facilities are located near the Amazon River. Ore will be shipped
down the Amazon to the Atlantic, and later possibly to the port of Belem.
Total project cost is estimated at about US$350 million, of which US$15 mil-
lion is being financed by IFC 1/. An alumina plant to be implemented at
the Trombetas mine is also being considered.
2.15      Several other bauxite projects also in the Amazon are now being
studied. The most important ones are: (i) Sociedad Mineracao de Santarem
(SOMISA), a 100% Alcoa (US) prospect located northeast of Trombetas; this
could become an Alcoa/Ludwig joint venture with the Brazilian Ludwig group
contributing its Mineracao Santa Monica reserves, which are located in the
vicinity of Trombetas; and (ii) Mineracao Vera Cruz (Paragominas), a prospect
located south of Belem, which is being promoted by CVRD and Rio Tinto Zinc
(UK). Paragominas, however, is unlikely to be developed in the near future
because of difficulties in transporting the bauxite at reasonable cost either
to the Amazon river, or to the Atlantic.
C.   Sector Priorities
2.16      Historically, the aluminum sector has been privately owned.  Hence,
at present, the ownership of Valesul and other public or mixed public/private
sponsored projects to be developed in the North is a matter of some controversy
within the industry and within the Government. To reassure existing producers
of its intentions to leave new sector projects under private control, the
Government has authorized CVRD to develop Valesul on the condition that its
ownership includes substantial private Brazilian participation and that simul-
taneous Brazilian and private control be established as early as possible.

- 7 -
2.17      Another matter of some current controversy is the location and the
timing of the various proposed projects. In this connection, the development
of Valesul in the south, close to major markets but, therefore, also to populated
areas with high demand for electrical power, has been justified not only on
the basis of the project's economic attractiveness, but also on account of
speedy execution and resulting faster import substitution which is important
until the northern projects come on stream, although even then aluminum
imports are expected to continue (para. 3.31). This approach is realistic
because, as noted above, the schedule of the northern projects is not yet firm
and current plans are still subject to potential delays. These projects are
highly unlikely to start producing before the mid-1980's given the substantial
issues still to be resolved by the sponsors, the construction difficulties to
be faced in the Amazon, and the enormous financing requirements. Moreover,
economic projections made on the basis of information from the respective
feasibility studies show that their return on investment is likely to be low.
2.18      Therefore, development of Valesul is well justified because its
economic and financial returns are satisfactory (paras. 8.11 and 9.05), its
location is advantageously close to aluminum consumers and sources of labor,
and its substitution for imports at an earlier date can be predicted realis-
tically (para. 5.01). Furthermore, since CVRD will be involved in both
Valesul and the northern plants, the project will also serve as a training
ground to prepare skilled management and manpower needed in the future for the
execution and operation of the northern projects. Finally, market projections
(para. 3.31) indicate that there is room for both Valesul and the northern
projects, in accordance with a more realistic schedule of implementation, as
well as in the expansion of the existing plants. There is, however, the
problem of the availability of local financial resources to cope with the
enormous investment requirements for all these plants.
D.   Government Regulations and Incentives
2.19      In January 1975, the Government set targets to develop non-ferrous
industries. According to these, production of aluminum was to reach about 1.3
million TPY in 1983, with a total investment of approximately US$3.9 billion.
These ambitious targets were based on very optimistic assumptions for project
timing and capital costs, and aluminum production in 1983 is more likely
to be on the order of 0.4 million TPY.
2.20      Primary aluminum prices are set by the Inter-Government Price
Council (CIP), and are adjusted according to cost changes, supposedly allow-
ing for a reasonable return on assets for the industry. There are no indica-
tions that current pricing policies will be modified in the near future al-
though this is always a possibility, given the Government's efforts to control
inflation. It is expected that aluminum prices will increase in real terms as
additional production will have to be attracted from new projects with higher
investment costs. Future price assumptions are discussed in Chapter VIII.
2.21      At present, several incentives are being studied to interest in-
vestors in developing aluminum projects in the Amazon region. Potential



- 8 -
incentives under consideration are: (i) tax exemptions for periods of 10-15
years; (ii) availability of lower-priced subsidized electricity; and (iii)
tax incentives to favor purchasers of aluminum. These would be similar to
the IUM 1/ tax presently applied to local consumers of bauxite and would be
applicable for periods of 10-15 years. An incentive already 4n use by the
aluminum sector is a 98% discount on the compulsory bonds which power-consuming
industries must buy from ELETROBRAS, which reduces the effective cost of power
by about 20%. Another major incentive for establishing aluminum projects in
the Amazon is the current development of the 4,000 MW Tucurui hydroelectric
project, which is expected to start generating power by 1982.
2.22      Aluminum imports are free of import duties (Resolution 2841 of
Customs Policy Council). They are, however, regulated by CACEX (Carteira do
Comercio Exterior) which requires an advance deposit in cruzeiros, of an
amount equivalent to the FOB port of shipment price, to be paid at least 360
days before the delivery of aluminum in Brazil. This deposit has the effect
of an indirect tax of approximately 45%, because it does not gain interest,
and because it is not corrected to compensate losses Erom inflation. Addi-
tionally, there are nonmonetary restrictions to metal imports: each importer
needs a CACEX license which, in turn, is contingent upon CONSIDER approval.
Independent manufacturers have two sources for their supplies of primary
aluminum: imports and the output of Alcominas, which as mentioned previously
is the only non-integrated local producer. Such a situation is expensive,
risky, and inflexible for independent fabricators. They thus have a consider-
able interest in seeing the establishment of an additional non-integrated
primary metal producer.
2.23      Environmental regulations and controls on the aluminum sector are
the responsibility of the Secretaria Especial Do Medio Ambiente (SEMA).
SEMA's guidelines on industrial effluents are still not very specific for the
aluminum sector. This is expected to change before long, however, because
residents and authorities of aluminum producing regions, such as Ouro Preto
where Alcan has a smelter, are expressing growing interest in the need to
regulate and control the disposal of effluents.
E.   Contribution to the Economy
2.24      The sector has played a significant role in saving foreign exchange
by substituting for imports. These savings are estimated at approximately
US$200 million in 1977. All aluminum production has been for local consump-
tion, supplying an increasingly larger segment of the Brazilian market, from
approximately 47% in 1966 to 64% in 1977; this trend is expected to continue
1/   The IUM Tax (Impuesto Unico Sobre Minerios) is the sole tax applied to
mineral products. In accordance with Decree 66,694 of June 1970, bauxite
produced for export is taxed at 4% of its FOB value. Bauxite ores for
local consumption are taxed at 15% of FOB, in accordance with Decree 1172
of June 1971. This latter tax, however, is refunded to the purchasers.



- 9 -
(Chapter III - The Aluminum Market). On the other hand, exports have been
limited to relatively small quantities of bauxite valued at about US$1.0
million p.a., which have been shipped mostly to Argentina. The foreign
exchange used for importing in 1977 is estimated approximately at US$150
million for aluminum and at US$10 million for fluorides and carbon needed as
raw materials to produce primary aluminum in Brazil.
2.25      The sector's contribution to Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP)
is relatively small, reaching approximately 3% in 1977. There has been,
however, a slow and steady increase in this share in real terms since 1966,
illustrating the relative growth of the aluminum sector in Brazil's economy.
It is expected that this increase will continue following the proposed sector
expansion program.
2.26      The primary aluminum sector makes a relatively small contribution to
fiscal revenues. In 1977, taxes paid to the Government were only about 0.1%
of Government revenues, a much higher contribution than in previous years,
owing to the increase of producing capacity as well as to the improved metal
prices and the resulting impact on sector profits and income taxes.
2.27      Although the primary aluminum sector (i.e., bauxite, alumina and
aluminum, but excluding fabrication) has been a very modest source of employment
of Brazil's labor force, it is particularly important in the Ouro Preto
region. In 1977, direct employment in the sector was slightly over 4,000, with
approximately 1,200 employed by Alcan and 1,800 by Alcominas. The proposed
sector expansion program should expand direct employment by about 6,000 jobs
by the mid-1980's.
III. THE ALUMINUM MARKET
A.   The International Market for Aluminum
1.   Consumption/Demand
3.01      Due to its specific properties of light weight, recyclability,
corrosion resistance and high thermal and electrical conductivity, aluminum
is being increasingly used in construction, transportation, packaging and for
consumer durables, electrical installations and machinery. Aluminum consump-
tion by sector in major countries is shown below:

3.02      The fastest-growing market for aluminum products has been packaging,
particularly in the US which accounted for about two thirds of consumption in
that sector in the countries mentioned above. Consumption of aluminum in
building and construction and in electrical applications also rose faster
than the average. In addition to its physical properties, aluminum's rela-
tively low and stable prices (prices in current terms remained virtually
unchanged between 1956 and 1973) in comparison to competing materials have
increased the incentive to use aluminum. As a result, aluminum has become the
fastest-growing metal, with consumption increasing after World War II at an
average rate of 9% per annum until 1973, before the start of the recession of
1974-75. The income elasticity of demand for aluminum in developed countries
averaged 1.8 between 1960 and 1977. World aluminum consumption more than
tripled from 5.2 million tons in 1960 to 18.2 million tons in 1977.
3.03      Aluminum consumption is concentrated in the industrialized coun-
tries, which accounted for 75% of the world total in 1960 and 71% in 1977
(excluding CPE's). The geographical distribution of aluminum consumption
is summarized below:

3.04      The expected, sustained slowdown of world economic growth will con-
tinue to affect future demand developments. Economic growth rates for the
next 5-10 years are expected to remain at rather modest levels, barely exceed-
ing 4% per annum on the average for developed countries. Additionally,
factors indicating that the income elasticity of demand for primary aluminum
might decrease include increasing market saturation and scrap recycling as
well as lower competitiveness with other materials like steel, copper, tin-
plate, glass and plastics due to recent increases in relative aluminum prices.
Past long-term trends of the price ratios of aluminum to steel and to copper
for selected years since the late 1930's are shown below:

3.05      The recent increase in the relative aluminum price might reduce
future demand increases, given the substitutability in a number of applica-
tions. However, efforts to conserve energy and to increase fuel efficiency
are expected to open new markets for light-weight aluminum products, espe-
cially in the automotive industry and in construction. These conflicting
factors are projected to result in a somewhat lower-average income elasticity
of demand of 1.6 into the mid-1980's (as compared to the historical 1.8).
Projecting total world aluminum consumption from the 1977 level of 18.2
million tons according to the assumptions of about 4% per annum economic
growth and the 1.6 elasticity factor results in an annual growth rate of
6.4% and a 1985 consumption level of about 30 million tons.
2.   Supply
3.06      Primary aluminum, i.e., aluminum in its non-fabricated forms of
ingots, slabs and billets, is produced mainly by smelting or reducing a
basic semi-processed raw material, alumina, which is in turn produced by
refining bauxite. About 20% of total aluminum production is obtained by
melting scrap and known as "secondary aluminum". Primary aluminum is pro-
duced in highly capital-intensive reduction plants, most of which are owned
by large multi-plant, integrated aluminum groups (para. 3.07), while secondary
aluminum is mainly produced by small and medium-size companies. Total in-
vestment costs per ton of annual capacity of primary aluminum in 1977 prices
(excluding the stages of alumina and bauxite) was about US$3,000. Although
it can vary with local conditions, the present minimum economic size of a
greenfield aluminum reduction plant of, say, approximately 70,000 TPY
has required large investments of at least US$200 million per project and
contributed to the predominance of big multinational corporations.
3.07      The six major multi-national aluminum companies 1/ are vertically
integrated from production of bauxite to manufacturing aluminum and fabri-
cating aluminum products. These corporations account for between 50% and 60%
of world production capacities of bauxite, alumina and aluminum. 2/ The
balance is distributed among other private companies, publicly-owned enter-
prises and state enterprises of the centrally planned economies.
3.08      World production of primary aluminum increased from 4.5 million
tons in 1960 to 14.2 million tons in 1977, an average annual increase of
7%. The geographical distribution of aluminum production for selected
years is summarized below:

3.09      The lowest growth rates during 1960-77 were recorded in North
America while the fastest increase in production took place in Australia,
the country with the largest bauxite reserves. The developing member coun-
tries of the International Bauxite Association (IBA) 1/ and important non-
members like Brazil and India accounted for the fast rise in LDC aluminum
production. Primary aluminum production in LDC's increased by nearly 10 times
over the 1960-77 period, pushing their share of world production from 2.5% to
7.5%. This trend reflects a tendency to install facilities closer to raw
material and energy resources and to evolving markets in developing countries.
3.10      The trade pattern of the international market for primary aluminum
has been characterized by the predominance of North American exports but these
have decreased in relative terms over the past 15 years as shown in the
table below:

3.11      While the US and Canada provided nearly half of world exports in
1967, this percentage had decreased to about 21% in 1975. Simultaneously,
Norway, the Netherlands and Germany began emerging as major exporters, reach-
ing a combined market share of 27.8% in 1975 compared to 18.7% in 1960. The
USSR has been a fairly steady major source of supply. The rise in the export
market share of "other" developed countries reflects the spreading of reduction
facilities over a larger number of countries. Several countries that did not
have production facilities in 1960, such as Greece, Turkey and the Netherlands,
became exporters in the 1970's. More than half of the 1975 exports of "other"
developed countries came from the EC (excluding Germany and the Netherlands)
and about one fourth from Eastern Europe (excluding the USSR). The pattern
of trade among developed countries shows primary aluminum flowing mainly from
Canada and Norway to the main fabricating areas of the US, Western Europe and
Japan. The participation of LDC's in world exports remained at a rather stable
rate of roughly 10%, indicating that most of the increase of the LDC share in
world production (para. 3.09) was for domestic markets.
3.12      The aluminum industry has traditionally developed in the industrial-
ized countries and particularly close to sources of bauxite and low-cost
hydropower. Thus, even countries with comparatively small markets, e.g.,
Canada, Norway, Australia, have become important alumina and aluminum pro-
ducers and exporters. Other countries, such as Japan, have become important
producers by virtue of the large and growing local demand. Certain developing
countries, such as Brazil and India, have combined at least one of the major
two manufacturing inputs (bauxite and power) with a substantial market
potential to form the basis for a growing local industry.
3.13      Apart from market and natural resources, the major constraining
factors on aluminum industry development in the LDC's have been the sizable



- 15 -
investment funds required and the need to acquire the closely held production
technologies. Such a situation has led to more extensive involvement of
the major integrated multi-national companies, which are particularly well
equipped to combine their technology with access to capital and the ability
to coordinate widespread bauxite mines, alumina refineries, aluminum smelters
and fabricating facilities with the varying needs of international markets.
The recent upsurge in energy prices, the worldwide economic slowdown, and
dramatic increases in equipment and construction costs have made the search
for expansion opportunities in the industry particularly difficult, competi-
tive and widespread. The search has led to an industry trend towards the
LDC's and particularly those with bauxite, competitive energy sources and
substantial market potential, such as Brazil. LDC share of world primary
aluminum production is projected to increase from 8% in 1977 to 17% in 1985.
3.   Supply/Demand and Price Outlook
3.14      About two thirds of world primary aluminum production are moved
within the large multi-national aluminum corporations. The balance is mostly
traded under long-term contracts at a reference or posted price. The reference
price most widely used is Alcan's posted price ("ALCAN's World List Price").
The remainder of primary aluminum production (perhaps 5%), together with
quantities of secondary metal, is traded at the "spot price" fixed at the
London Market and published in the "Metal Bulletin." Historically, the
spot price has tended to be below the "posted price" with an extreme sensi-
tivity to market forces, such as heavy variations as a reaction to relatively
small over-supplies or shortages. However, changes in the trend of the
spot price have often anticipated and preceded similar developments of the
posted price. In October 1978, the London Metal Exchange (LME) commenced
trading in aluminum. It remains to be seen to what extent the LME price will
be used in international trade, but the introduction of LME trading does
provide a market of last resort and may become used by aluminum traders for
hedging. Past trends of Alcan's posted price in current and constant 1975
US dollar terms for selected years are given below:

3.15      The behavior of the aluminum ingot posted price has historically been
characterized both in constant and in current terms by considerable stability,
except for extraordinary situations, such as the Korean War boom in the
early 1950's, or the energy crisis of the 1970's. In constant terms, the
price remained virtually unchanged between the mid 1950's and the beginning
of the 1970's.  In current terms, compared to 1956, the ingot price in 1970
was only US$0.04 higher, an increase of less than 1% p.a.  The disruptions of
rapid inflation, world wide recession and the energy crisis of the early and
mid-1970s caused a steep price increase in 1972, followed by a breakdown in
19 75.  Between 1974 and 1975 the spot price--which as noted reacts most
sensitively to market forces--fell by nearly 30%. Still, compared to other
commodity prices, the aluminum price has shown considerable stability and
few heavy fluctuations. The principal factor limiting downward movements
of aluminum prices in periods of sluggish demand is the industry's relative
concentration and ability to reduce output.
3.16      Resistance against excessive price increases, on the other hand,
results from the relative prices of such competing materials as steel, copper,
glass and wood. Besides the technical advantages of aluminum and several new
uses successfully introduced, the basis for the penetration of aluminum into
various markets has been its low relative price resulting from technological
advances after World War II and subsequent cost reductions.
3.17      The main factors determining the price level are the demand/supply
balance and the cost structure of the industry. The influence of the demand/
supply balance prevails in the medium term. After tight supplies or even a
shortage have led to increased prices, incentives are created for new facil-
ities; and, after the time necessary for project implementation, a new equilib-
rium is restored at a new price level. In the longer run, however, trends in
production costs tend to determine the price level.
3.18      The high investment cost in the aluminum industry, coupled with
sagging demand and a cost/price "squeeze," have held back expansion projects
over the last few years. Taking into account a normal lead time of three
to four years for an aluminum project, known investment plans indicate that
capacities would increase until 1980 by only about 3% per annum and by a
slightly higher rate of about 4. 5% thereafter, compared to average demand
growth rates estimated at about 6. 8%. By mid-1978, capacity utilization rates
averaged about 87.2% worldwide, compared to a normal industry objective of
95%. It seems unlikely that the industry is able to produce at more than 95%
of capacity over sustained periods of time. Demand is expected to exceed
total world capacity by 1980, thus exerting considerable upward pressure on
prices. Based on the assumption of a 95% capacity utilization on average, the
long-term supply/demand situation is projected to be somewhat tight, as shown
below:

3.19      The projected supply/demand situation thus indicates that aluminum
prices are likely to rise in real terms during the next few years, until
price increases have attracted enough new capacity to restore an equilibrium
situation. This is expected to occur in the early 1980's after which prices
are expected to stabilize.
3.20      The aluminum ingot price, 1/ which was US$0.56 per pound in
December 1978, is projected to be US$0.61 in 1978 constant US dollars by
1981, which would be equivalent to US$0.73 in current terms. Thereafter,
the price is projected to remain constant in constant US dollar terms, as

B.   The Market for Aluminum in Brazil
1.   Consumption/Demand
3.21      Aluminum consumption in Brazil grew at an average rate of 14% p.a.
between 1967 and 1977 and somewhat more than 16% p.a. between 1970 and 1977.

3.22      The Brazilian aluminum industry is characterized by the predominance
of two, fully-integrated aluminum companies (ALCAN and CBA) which account for
more than 60% of primary aluminum production and 40% of primary consumption in
Brazil. The remainder of primary supply is consumed by independent fabrica-
tors, of which the biggest 10 non-integrated consumers accounted for 27% of
total ingot consumption and the 34 next largest consumers for another 13%.
The two, integrated aluminum companies and the 44 main independent fabrica-
tors together process more than 80% of Brazil's primary aluminum. About 90%
of fabricating capacity is located in the southeastern area of Brazil, within
300 km of Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo. About 90% of fabricated products are
consumed in the Rio/Sao Paulo region.
3.23      The sectoral distribution of consumption of fabricated or semi-
fabricated aluminum products in Brazil shows that construction, transporta-
tion and the electrical industry have been the main users of aluminum, with
construction becoming the most important consumer as shown below and compared
to the consumption pattern in developed countries (para. 3.01):

3.24      Rolled products accounted for about a third of total consumption,
and extrusions as well as cables and wires for more than a fifth each. While
consumption grew for every type of aluminum products, extrusions were the
fastest-growing aluminum product between 1972 and 1977, reflecting the fact
that more than half of these were consumed in construction applications, which
grew rapidly in the first half of the 1970's.
3.25      In spite of the fast development of the Brazilian aluminum industry,
consumption levels are still low compared to other countries, as shown below:

3.26      Foreign exchange constraints and the shortage of metal have limited
aluminum consumption in Brazil and constituted a disincentive for new appli-
cations. Compared to the present consumption structure in industrialized
countries, the penetration in Brazil of aluminum into such sectors as pack-
aging and machinery and equipment is very low, whereas in other countries
in these sectors aluminum products such as beverage cans, packaging foil
and equipment applications are highly used. In view of the low per capita
consumption of aluminum, the limited extent of new applications in a number
of sectors, and expected continuing growth in the aluminum-consuming sectors
of the economy, there seems to be considerable room for future aluminum growth
in Brazil.
3.27      The potential of future aluminum demand growth in Brazil has been
analyzed by CONSIDER in a market study conducted during 1977. This study
projected the historical 1.7 income elasticity of demand for aluminum into the
future which seems reasonable, particularly since 1.7 has been close to the
average international income elasticity of demand of 1.8 for aluminum observed
between 1960 and 1977 (para. 3.02). Brazil's economic growth rate is expected
to return from the 6.3% average estimated for the late 1970's to a growth
trend of about 9% p.a. after 1980. This assumption is supported by the Bank's
latest Economic Memorandum. 1/ The assumptions outlined above result in an
1/   IBRD Economic Memorandum on Brazil, October 13, 1977.

increase in the Brazilian aluminum demand of nearly 11% per annum to 1980
and about 15% per annum in the 1980's as compared to 16% annual consumption
increase during the 1970-77 period. However, the study done by CONSIDER in
cooperation with CVRD and Valesul covers only the overall demand for aluminum
and does not provide detailed analysis by product and sector. Valesul and its
shareholders have agreed that a more detailed study will be done on future
demand and be submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1979.
2.   Supply

3.29      Aluminum is imported by the main fabricators and by the integrated
aluminum companies. However, the only non-integrated primary aluminum producer,
Alcominas, does not import aluminum. Since the prices (even without consider-
ing the cost of the compulsory deposit) for imported aluminum, which is exempt
from direct import duties, are generally higher than the Government regulated
prices for ingots, slabs and billets, primary aluminum imports are only
interesting to companies producing semi-fabricated or finished goods not
subject to price regulations.
3.30      A breakdown of Brazilian imports during 1977 shows that the nine
main importers accounted for over 90% of all foreign purchases. Among the
nine largest importers are the two integrated companies (Alcan and CBA), six
fabricators and CVRD. Two of the six, Aluminio S.A. Extrusao e Laminasao
(ASA) and Aluminio Ind. S.A. produce mainly extrusions, while two others,
Kaiser/Furukawa and Termocanada fabricate cables. The other two companies are
engaged in a wider range of products. The second largest aluminum importer
during that period was CVRD, which through the Valesul project is expanding
into the aluminum business and considers its entry into trading as a means of
gaining experience under its longer-term strategy to become more extensively
involved in the production and marketing of aluminum.

3.   Supply/Demand Balance
3.31      The comparison of the future demand potential and the plans for
capacity expansions shows a continued gap between supply and demand which
would have to be filled by imports, as illustrated below for a few selected
years and shown for all years through 1990 in Annex 3:

3.32      The projections of the supply/demand balance are based on the pres-
ently known plans for new projects and expansions with a two-year slippage
assumed in the startup of the ALBRAS project from the originally intended
1982, and on an annual growth of aluminum consumption of about 11% to 1980
and of about 15% in the 1980's (para. 3.27). However, even an annual growth
rate of 10% would be sufficient to absorb the output of the planned projects
and still leave Brazil with a net import position. Even an 8% demand growth
rate would--in view of the intended Japanese export marketing contracts for
160,000 tons of ALBRAS aluminum--not result in oversupply, so that Brazil
still would have to import metal. Under the above assumptions, the Brazilian
aluminum market would be large enough to sustain at least one other large
project in addition to Valesul and ALBRAS by the mid-1980's. In the long
term, there appears to be ample scope for the continuing growth of the exist-
ing suppliers as well.
4.   Pricing Policy and Outlook
3.33      Present Government price regulations only control primary aluminum
products such as billets, slabs and ingots, whereas semi-fabricated products
(extrusions, sheet, etc.) are not subject to price control. Prices are fixed
by the Inter-Government Price Council (CIP) on an ex-factory basis for the
industry as a whole. Prices are adjusted according to cost changes up to six
times a year. The average production cost is derived by weighting the opera-
ting cost per ton of each producer with his market share. Additionally, an
average 15% return on assets for the industry as a whole is supposedly allowed.

3.34      Historically, the Brazilian ingot price has been above the interna-
tional posted price as shown below:

3.35      Through the 1960's, Brazilian prices (on the basis of the official
exchange rates) were about 30% above international prices; but due to the rapid
increases of the international aluminum price in the 1970s, the difference had
virtually disappeared by 1977. Subsequent price adjustment by CIP again
resulted in a national price level being 10% above the international price by
January 31, 1979. The international price increase of 1973/74 from 25 to 39
cents/pound was not matched by comparable Brazilian national price adjustments,
so that the CIP price was below the FOB-Alcan price in 1974. Furthermore,
the cost of imported metal in Brazil, which is exempt from import duties--
including freight, insurance and port handling, but exclusive of the compulsory
deposit--has exceeded the posted FOB ingot price in New York by an average of
16% over the past four years. Since on average the Brazilian ingot price has
been roughly 10% above the posted price (FOB New York) the CIF cost of imported
metal has generally been about 5% higher than the Brazilian price (excluding
the compulsory deposit).
3.36      As noted in para. 2.19, there is no indication that the pricing pol-
icy applied in Brazil in the past would be changed. Furthermore, in view of
the Brazilian demand/supply imbalance, a deregulation of prices would tend to
drive prices up. Since an increasing part of the Brazilian aluminum demand
will be supplied from new plants or expansion projects which have higher
capital costs in real terms per ton of capacity compared to existing plants,
the expected continuation of the present price policy will tend to increase
aluminum prices in real terms.
3.37      The Brazilian ingot price is projected to increase in constant 1978
US dollars by 8.5% from US$0.59 per pound to US$0.64 per pound by 1981. A 13%
increase in the international price is projected over the same period, which
would result in the Brazilian price being about 5% higher than international
price, or roughly in line with the policy over the last two years. After
1981, it has been assumed that the price will be maintained in real terms,
as shown in the table below:

The Government has agreed to take all action required on its part regarding
price levels which will enable Valesul, operating efficiently, to achieve a
reasonable return on its invested capital.
5.   Marketing
3.38       Since a company limited to production without any marketing would be
restricted in its managerial and financial independence, and since this would
make the company less attractive to prospective investors, it has been decided
that Valesul would handle its own marketing. Any purchasing of aluminum from
Valesul by its shareholders will be done on an arms-length commercial basis.
3.39      Apart from this basic decision, little detailed planning has been
done regarding Valesul's marketing organization and strategies. Valesul
has recognized the need for the development of a more detailed plan and has
begun to carry it out. The organizational structure for this activity will
be simple and straightforward, but the formulation of strategies will be
important, given the propensity of the industry to tie its markets through
forward integration, and the risks this presents for a non-integrated new-
comer to the market like Valesul. Valesul and its shareholders have agreed
to prepare a detailed marketing plan on the basis of a detailed market study
(para. 3.27) for the Bank's review by December 31, 1979.
IV. THE COMPANY AND THE SPONSORS
A.   Ownership
4.01       Valesul Aluminio S.A. has received a high priority status by the
Non-ferrous and Steel Council (CONSIDER) for its project. The Government
authorized its sponsor, CVRD, to proceed with the project on the condition
that Valesul be simultaneously controlled by private'and Brazilian capital.
Although no specific timing was specified to achieve this type of ownership,
it had always been envisaged that control of the company would be roughly
divided into one-third State, one-third private Brazilian and one-third
foreign private and that this ownership pattern would be achieved during the
early operation at the latest.



- 24 -
4.02      CVRD's decision to promote the development of the Valesul plant
was largely based on the results of a pre-feasibility study prepared by
the Brazilian firm, Montreal Engenharia S.A., in 1975. In connection with
that study, proposals to supply technology to produce aluminum were invited
from 12 international aluminum companies. 1/ In total, nine firms 2/ responded
and, following lengthy negotiations, a series of agreements were finally
reached with Reynolds International, Inc., (Reynolds) to have a 30% ownership
in the project. The initial subscribed capital was Cr$1.5 million (US$127,000)
paid 70% by CVRD and 30% by Reynolds. In October 1976, Reynolds agreed to
supply CVRD with its technology and technical assistance to implement the
Valesul plant. Subsequently, in April 1977, a supplemental agreement was
reached between CVRD and Reynolds on the details of Reynolds' services, but
also agreeing that Reynolds' ownership position would be held in abeyance for
a year, pending the conclusion of a financing plan, arrangements for alumina
and power supply and confirmation of the project's viability. At that
time, it was also agreed that the project would be developed using a long-term
debt-to-equity ratio of 60:40 and that Reynolds would have a conditional
option until April 1978 to acquire a minimum interest of 15% in common and
preferred shares. Part of this interest was to be paid by reinvesting Reynolds'
fee for technology. Reynolds has reinvested the first two payments, which
amounted to US$1.5 million each, and has decided to take a share of Valesul's
equity of about 4%, represented by the full reinvestment of its US$6 million
technology fee. Reynolds has for the time being decided not to take a larger
share in the project in light of its overall investment priorities related to
its medium-term cash flow expectations.
4.03      Negotiations have been concluded with Billiton International Metals
(BIM), and Shell Brasil, subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell (UK/Netherlands).
It has been agreed that Shell Brasil will subscribe common shares equal to
35% of Valesul's total capitalization. An agreement between the principal
shareholders has been negotiated and reviewed and approved by the Bank. Any
change in the agreement not approved by the Bank will be a condition of
default. Registration of the Company by-laws will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
4.04      Various alternatives to attract Brazilian investors to the project
have been studied over the past two years, including some form of underwrit-
ing of private share placements by Brazilian banks, a CVRD/IFC underwriting
of a convertible debenture issue and participation by prospective customers
who might wish to secure a local source of primary aluminum. There are
various practical problems, however, in finding private Brazilian interest
willing to participate in a joint private/Government venture and/or who have
the necessary available capital at reasonable cost. In many respects, it

would be easier to attract investors once the project is producing. This
would mean, however, that a higher price per share might have to be paid
to reflect adequately the value of the shares in a profitable operating
enterprise.
4.05      It may be that before completion of the project or shortly after its
start-up private Brazilian investors can be attracted to participate in
Valesul's equity, so that private and Brazilian control could both be increased
to over 50%. It has been agreed by CVRD that, in the event the objective of
private and Brazilian control of the Company is not achieved by the time of
physical completion of the plant facilities, CVRD will offer for sale to
private Brazilian investors a third of its holding in excess of 49% of the
capital stock of Valesul in each of the three 12-month periods following
physical completion so that CVRD's holding is reduced to below 50%. Any
shares remaining unsold from these offers will be re-offered during the next
sale. If any of these sales are not made, CVRD shall, in consultation with
the Bank, seek the advice of an expert third party to determine the most
appropriate methods, terms and conditions for the sales. In the meantime,
voting shares will be divided approximately as follows: CVRD 61%, 1/ Billiton
35%, and Reynolds 4%. The shareholders have agreed not to dispose of any of
their shares without the prior approval of the Bank.
B.   The Sponsors
1.   Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD)
4.06      The primary sponsor, CVRD, is mainly engaged in the exploration,
mining, transport and export of iron ore, although it also has subsidiaries
and associated companies involved in fertilizers and in forest industries,
including pulp and paper. The Valesul project will be the third CVRD-spon-
sored project with Bank Group participation, the first being the Trombetas
bauxite project with US$15 million IFC participation made in 1977 (para. 2.14),
and the second, the US$294 million Valefertil fertilizer project, 2/ with a
Bank loan of US$82 million also extended in 1977. The Government is increas-
ingly using CVRD's financial and managerial resources as a base for the State's
role in a number of key, basic industrial projects.
4.07      CVRD's gross revenues increased dramatically from US$524 million
in 1974 to approximately US$821 million in 1977. About 70% of this growth,
until 1975, was due to increasing prices of iron ore and 30% to larger sales
volume. CVRD accounts for about 70% of total Brazilian iron ore exports.
Iron ore sales volume fell by 10% in 1977 compared to 1976. At the end of
1977, the long-term debt/equity ratio (28:72) was satisfactory; the current
ratio was 1.1. In 1978, despite increases in the production (49 million

ficantly lower, owing to generally lower iron ore prices which still prevail
in the international market. Its financial performance for recent years is
summarized below:

4.08      During 1973-77, CVRD's capital investments averaged US$288 million
annually and are expected to increase substantially during the next five years.
CVRD's investment program for 1978-82 might require financing commitments of
about US$2-3 billion equivalent, including sdme part of US$3-5 billion total
financing requirements for the Carajas iron ore project in the northeast, a
share of the US$2.7 billion requirements for the ALBRAS and ALUNORTE aluminum/
alumina projects (para. 2.11), and US$89.2 million for its equity in the
Valesul aluminum project, plus normal replacements and improvements. This
program is expected to be financed with domestic and foreign loans, with new
capital subscriptions and Government funds and with possibly up to 50% from
internally generated resources. Possible Bank financing is also being dis-
cussed for the Carajas project which has been postponed and is still at the
project preparation stage.
4.09      To meet its broader responsibilities in areas other than iron ore,
CVRD's organizational structure was reorganized in March 1977. Its Adminis-
trative Council has nine members, including the President who is appointed by
the President of Brazil. The other eight members are elected by the Ordinary
General Assembly. Functioning below this Council is the Board of Directors,
also presided over by the President, and which consists of six members elected
by the Administrative Council. For operating purposes, the company has been
structured into ten divisions, operating under CVRD's President. Although
CVRD functions under the Ministry of Mines, it is organized and operated as a
private entity. The members of its Board and of its Administrative Council
are selected from the private and the State sector.
2.   Shell/Billiton
4.10      Billiton International Metals is a service company coordinating
the development and operation of a group of companies within the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group (UK/Netherlands). The Billiton group companies are
engaged in exploration, mining, metallurgy and trading of non-ferrous metals
and their by-products. It has wholly owned companies in Surinam (bauxite) and
in Thailand (tin). In addition, Billiton has interests in: the MANISIVIK
lead/zinc project in Canada (11.25%); the Cuajone copper project in Peru



- 27 -
(11.5%); the Caballo Blanco Co., Ltd., a zinc/tin mining company in Bolivia
(12.5%); the Trombetas bauxite project in Brazil (5%) and several metallur-
gical plants located in Holland and in France. Its exploration activities are
presently located in Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, South America and
Canada. Billiton does not publish separate financial reports as these are
consolidated into Shell's financial results. The present turnover of the
Billiton companies is approximately US$1 billion. Shell Brasil (Petro-
leo) S.A., which will be the Shell group company holding 35% of Valesul's
shares, is well established in the production and marketing of Shell's
petroleum and chemical products in Brazil. It is a financially sound company,
with annual revenues (1978) of about US$2.5 billion, cash generation of about
US$50 million, assets of US$480 million, a low long term debt to equity ratio
of 3:97, and a current ratio of 1.3.
3.   Reynolds Metals Company/Reynolds International, Inc.
4.11      Reynolds Metals Company (US), of which Reynolds International, Inc.
(RII) is a wholly owned subsidiary, is a major worldwide producer and manufac-
turer of aluminum products (1977 production of primary aluminum: approximately
one million short tons). In recent years, RII has successfully participated
in aluminum reduction projects in Iran, Germany and Venezuela. By the end of
1977, it was engaged in the startup of production in Venezuela from expansion
of the Alcasa smelter, and in the construction of the Venalum smelter, which
started production during 1978. Reynolds Metals' recent performance is
summarized as follows:

Reynolds International, which is responsible for Reynolds' overseas activities
and will hold the Reynolds 4% participation in Valesul as well as provide
technical services, had revenues of US$599 million and net profits of US$12
million in 1977. Its US$6 million investment in Valesul's equity will be
offset by the technology fee due to it under its technology transfer agreement
with CVRD.
C.   Organization and Management
4.12      Valesul's organizational structure is presented in Annex 4.  The
Company's Administrative Council will be comprised of five members and re-
spective alternates, elected by the Ordinary General Assembly, in which
each shareholder or group of shareholders will have the right to appoint
members according to their respective shareholding and as defined in the
shareholders' agreement negotiated in late 1978 and early 1979 by the major



- 28 -
shareholders. Valesul will also have a Fiscal Council composed of at least
three members, appointed by the shareholders. The Executive Committee of
Valesul will be composed of five members: the President and four other
Directors elected by the Administrative Council.
4.13      The President of Valesul is responsible to the Administrative
Council for all Valesul's business and activities, including planning, opera-
tions, finance, accounting, marketing and public relations. Four other
Directors report to the President, with following functions: (i) Administra-
tive Director: responsible for personnel and legal services; (ii) Control
Director: responsible for accounting and management information; (iii)
Financial Director: responsible for financial planning and securing finance;
and (iv) Technical Director: responsible during project execution for organiz-
ing and coordinating project engineering, construction and erection and
procurement, during which period he will be assisted by a firm of project
management and engineering consultants (para. 6.02). The Technical Director
will also plan the future operation and maintenance of the smelter complex and
later be responsible for carrying out these functions. A former Reynolds
employee, well experienced in aluminum smelter projects, has been appointed
to the position.
4.14      Valesul's shareholders plan to establish, in addition to the Fiscal
Council mentioned above, three committees to monitor and advise on the execu-
tion and operation of the project: one for engineering, procurement and con-
struction, one for operating and one for finance.
D.   Financial Situation
4.15      As of October 31, 1978, Valesul had a subscribed capital of US$12.3
million and total assets of US$15.0 million. Preparation expenses were fi-
nanced with a loan from CVRD. This loan was transformed into equity in
February 1978.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope and Objectives
1.   Basic Objectives
5.01      The project has been designed by Valesul and Reynolds.  It will use
the Reynolds pre-baked anode technology to produce approximately 86,500 TPY of
primary aluminum in a final product mix envisaged as approximately 35% extru-
sion billets, 35% rolling slabs and 30% in 50-lb. ingots, with perhaps some
liquid metal for sale over the fence. Casting equipment will be sufficiently
flexible to handle variations from this mix; but, as part of the market study
to be done by the company (para. 3.27), a more precise determination of the
likely production mix will be made. Initial production is expected to start
in the third quarter of 1981, and full capacity to be reached during early
1982.



- 29 -
5.02       The technology is basically the same as that used for many years by
all the major international aluminum producers. Since early 1974, Reynolds
has used its own version of this technology in its plant in Hamburg, Germany,
and in two other projects in Venezuela: the Alcasa plant expansion (from
54,000 TPY to 124,000 TPY), which started production at the end of 1977,
and the 310,000-TPY Venalum smelter, which started production during 1978.
Following completion of the present project, the plant can easily be expanded
to about 170,000 TPY with a relatively low investment to take advantage of
better economies of scale.
5.03       The final feasibility study, prepared by Valesul with assistance
from Reynolds, was completed in December 1977. The basic conditions set for
the Valesul project were that the most modern aluminum-reduction technology
should be used to build a relatively small plant to supply the domestic
market and to be located close to consumer centers. This plant was to be
built within the shortest time possible to start substituting imports, and
to serve as a training center for larger aluminum products to be developed
later in the Amazon region. Another condition for the project was that it
should be profitable enough to attract foreign and local investors to share
in the ownership. The selection of technology and foreign private investment
to be used for Valesul was made by inviting proposals from international
aluminum companies (para. 4.02).
2.   Plant Location
5.04       At CVRD's request, extensive studies were carried out by Montreal
Engenharia (Brazil) to determine the most appropriate location to establish
the Valesul plant, given the objectives described above. For this purpose,
the coastal strip between Bahia and Sao Paulo was carefully examined. It was
determined that the State of Rio de Janeiro was the best area, mainly because
of its available power and port facilities as well as for the proximity of
large quantities of available, skilled and semi-skilled manpower. Another
important factor in chosing this general area was the closeness to large,
existing aluminum-consumption centers in both Rio and Sao Paulo. Subsequent
detailed studies carried out within the State pinpointed available land
designated for industrial development close to Santa Cruz. The site is
approximately 60 km southwest of Rio, and 10 km northeast of the Sepetiba
port project and is located near main highways, a railroad, major trans-
mission lines, and a power station. Finally, the site is satisfactory from
a construction point of view and needed only relatively minor upgrading.
It was formerly owned by the Rio de Janeiro State Housing Development Company
(Companhia Estadual de Habitacao de Rio de Janeiro-CEHAB), which has exchanged
it through subscription of Valesul shares by Banco de Desenvolvimiento do
Estado do Rio de Janeiro, BD-RIO (about US$1.0 million equivalent).

3.   Project Description
(a) Plant Components
5.05      The aluminum reduction process is based on the electrolysis of
alumina at approximately 950 C, in which oxygen is generated and must be re-
duced using consumable carbon anodes. The main project components needed to
produce primary aluminum are: a carbon plant to provide anodes, a rectifying
substation to supply direct current, a potline of electrolytic cells where the
reduction process takes place and a cast house in which liquid aluminum from
the potline is cast into the selected aluminum products. Service and support
facilities include storage and material-handling components, fume-control
units and maintenance equipment. The project components are described and
discussed below. The material flow diagram and the plant layout are shown in
Annexes 5-1 and 5-2, respectively.
(b) Raw Material Handling Facilities at the Plantsite
5.06      Alumina will enter the plantsite by truck, and possibly by rail
later. It will be unloaded into a hopper and lifting system that will dis-
charge into a silo. Petroleum coke, liquid pitch and other raw materials
will be unloaded from trucks into storage tanks.
(c) The Carbon Plant
5.07      The purpose of this facility is to produce anodes as well as carbon
paste needed to repair worn cathodes. It is composed of four sections, as
follows:
(i)  Green Plant.  This section, known also as the "green mill,"
will produce green, unbaked anode blocks. Petroleum coke
will be ground, blended, combined with liquid coaltar pitch
and formed on vibrating tables into green anodes. Although
all equipment could operate continuously, the design criteria
of 18 tons per hour of anodes is based on operating only 12
shifts per week, because Reynolds wants to provide the same
margin of safety which it uses normally in its other oper-
ations. This is a critical part of the plant and will be
procured on a turnkey basis, to be financed out of the Bank
loan.
(ii)  Baking Furnace.  In this section, the green anodes will be
baked into blocks, weighing 870 kg each, in a continuous
bake oven with oil burners.
(iii)   Rodding Shop.  This section will be used to install steel
yokes and aluminum connector rods into prebaked anode blocks.
It will also reprocess spent anodes from the reduction cells,
to recover the carbon, rods, yokes and cast iron used in
connecting the rod to the block.



- 31 -
(iv)   Cathode Paste Shop.  This section uses part of the green plant
facilities as well as its own to prepare about 28 tons per week
of carbon paste to replace worn cathodes. It will form part
of the turnkey contract for the green plant.
The cathodes of the electrolytic cells have a life of three to four years.
This results in normal repairs of one or two cathodes per week, with repair
peaks of up to five cathodes per week. Reynolds' design for the Valesul
plant provides that this work will take place in a cathode repair shop. This
is a desirable method, with lower costs and less risks than more conventional
in-line repair procedures.
5.08      The design criteria concerning utilization of the above-mentioned
units are conservative, especially in the case of the green plant and the
rodding shop. The oversizing of these units is considerable, and these
two shops could handle two potlines without any additional equipment if they
were operated on an about three shifts-per-day basis rather than two shifts as
envisaged. On the basis of its experience, Reynolds has consistently applied
this conservative criteria throughout its various plants to eliminate operat-
ing risks and to provide a margin of safety, particularly during startup.
It results, however, in higher costs which might add up to 5% to the total
cost of the project. This additional investment can be regarded as well
justified, as it very economically enables the subsequent expansion of
the plant to a more profitable capacity.
(d) The Potline
5.09      A series of 216 identical, electrolytic cells constitute the "pot-
line" wherein alumina is "reduced" by high-amperage, direct current into
molten aluminum. The cells are controlled by a computer, and are positioned
side by side in two parallel potrooms of slightly more than 700 meters in
length. The main-process operating parameters essentially reflect results
obtained by Reynolds in its recent Hamburg plant, as adjusted to Valesul's
lower capacity. These parameters are shown below:
Valesul: Projected Process Operating Parameters
Rated Production        86,500 TPY         Line Voltage               920 volts
Cells in Operation      216                Volts Per Cell             4.3 volts
Production Per Cell    1.1 tons/day        Power Consumption, D.C.   14.6 kwh/kg
Amperage                155,000 Amperes   Power Consumption, A.C.   15.5 kwh/kg
Electric Current
Efficiency             88%                Cathode Life               3-4 years
5.10      Amperage, current efficiency and voltage levels are vitally impor-
tant factors, as they determine the production capacity of each electrolytic
cell. It is expected that once the plant is operating normally electrical
current levels could progressively be increased, on an experimental basis,



- 32 -
possibly to 157,500 amperes in a first stage, and later further to a level to
be determined on the basis of operating results, thus increasing the produc-
tivity of each electrolytic cell. Achievement of such an amperage level
could increase output from the plant by as much as 10% above the level
assumed as the base case.
5.11      Projected current efficiency for Valesul is higher than the Hamburg
plant's 87% because the latter was adversely affected by extensive phosphorous
contamination, which originated from processing impure alumina with a high
phosphorous content. Such difficulties will be avoided in Valesul by more
stringent specification and control of alumina supplies. The operating
parameters assumed are well within the reach of a modern, computer-controlled
and reasonably well managed plant.
(e) The Cast House
5.12      The cast house will include furnaces, casting units and related
saws, cranes and support equipment. This facility will easily handle the
expected average Brazilian product mix of 35% rolling slabs, 35% extrusion
billets, and 30% remelt ingots, or substantial variations therefrom.
(f) The Rectifying Substation
5.13      This facility consists of a switchyard, a rectifying station with
six rectifier-transformer units rated at 35,000 amperes and 1,000 volts, to
convert the 138,000-volt alternating current power from the transmission
lines to provide direct current voltage for the operation of the electrolytic
cells. This facility also includes a conventional 13.8 kilovolt plant supply
system for service equipment and utilities.
B.   Raw Materials
5.14      Summarized below are the projected rates of consumption of raw
materials for the Valesul plant at full capacity (86,500 TPY) when operating
with a current of 155,000 amperes:

- 33 -
1    Alumina
5.15      Alumina is the major raw material for the plant and its consumption
will reach approximately 166,000 TPY at full capacity. Valesul is projected
eventually to obtain alumina from CVRD'-s planned ALUNORTE project in the
Amazon region or from an alumina plant under consideration at CVRD's Trombetas
bauxite project. But since it is unlikely that alumina could be produced at
ALUNORTE or Trombetas much before 1985 (para. 2.12), Valesul needs at least
four years of interim alumina supply. Suitable contracts for the supply of
alumina from refineries in Guyana and Surinam have been signed. In view of
Brazil's substantial resources for the production of alumina and aluminum
(bauxite and hydro-power), and to ensure the continuing import-substitution
benefits of the project, the shareholders have agreed that Valesul will,
following the initial alumina supply contracts, purchase all further alumina
on an arms-length, commercially competitive, basis. Any importation of
alumina will, of course, continue to be subject to Government import policies.
2.   Petroleum Coke and Coaltar Pitch
5.16      These are the other two main raw materials, with consumptions of
about 33,000 TPY and 10,000 TPY, respectively. Petroleum coke will be sup-
plied by PETROCOQUE from a calcining plant located in Cubatao, Sao Paulo.
Coaltar pitch will be obtained from either of the three large State-owned
steel plants, CSN near Rio de Janeiro, COSIPA near Sao Paulo or USIMINAS
near Belo Horizonte. The final supplier will be selected after pitch samples
have been produced and tested. Other less significant raw materials are
cryolite, aluminum fluoride, fluorspar, anthracite coal, cathode pitch, cast
iron, soda ash and alloys. Although no firm commitments have been secured
yet, there should be no serious difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of
these materials, most of which are readily available from Brazilian producers.
C.   Infrastructure
1.   Power Supply
5.17      The Valesul substation will receive alternating current from both
of two new 138-kilovolt line extensions connecting to a LIGHT-owned 1/
substation, which will be located at the plantsite. The two 4-km extensions
will be on separate towers as a security measure to guard against the very
serious consequences of a sudden, prolonged power outage, that, were it to
last for more than one hour, could result in the freezing of the molten
aluminum in the potlines, which are run continuously. The line extensions
will be connected to one of the three existing 138-kilovolt transmission,
double-circuit lines owned and operated by FURNAS, 2/ between the Jacarepagua
1/   LIGHT is the power distribution company with which Valesul has contracted
its power.
2/   FURNAS, a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS, is the power-generating company which
will supply power to Valesul via the distribution company (LIGHT), which
recently also became an ELETROBRAS subsidy.



- 34 -
substation (25 km east of the plantsite) and the Santa Cruz 360-MW thermal
generating plant substation (9 km west of the plantsite). Both substations
are connected to the large 18,000-MW power grid of the southeast of Brazil.
5.18      Valesul's power demand of 160 MW is less than 1% of that of the
southeast power grid capacity, and the Santa Cruz generating station provides
a very satisfactory backup in case of a failure of the Jacarepagua line.
Nevertheless, in view of the vital importance of a continuous power supply,
ELETROBRAS has agreed to ensure that any of the Government agencies respon-
sible for supplying power to Valesul will take all possible action to avoid
supply interruptions that could lead to freezing up of the potlines. An
analysis of past records of power outages in the Rio area indicates that,
provided appropriate physical and contractual protective measures are taken,
the chances of a significant interruption at the plant would be negligible.
The power supply contract with Rio Light S.A. has been reviewed by the Bank,
and its recommendations included. Power tariffs are discussed in para. 8.06.
2.   Port
5.19      Raw material unloading facilities (primarily for alumina) will be
located in the Port of Sepetiba about 17 km from the plantsite. Discussion
between the Bank, Valesul, Docas de Rio and PORTOBRAS concluded that it would
be possible to obtain facilities at Sepetiba on time and without interferring
with the coal-unloading facilities presently under construction there. This
is a much better alternative than the originally proposed port site at the
Port of Rio about 60 km from the plantsite. The Sepetiba location is more
advantageous because it (i) involves a shorter, less-expensive haulage to the
plant; (ii) can handle larger vessels; and (iii) avoids the movement of trucks
through the congested port and build-up area of Rio. Also, unloading capacity
can be increased for possible later expansion of the smelter without excessive
costs. According to present plans, alumina will be transported to the plant
in rented trucks. PORTOBRAS has agreed to take all actions to ensure that the
infrastructure for the installation of Valesul's unloading facilities will be
completed on time.
3.   Road
5.20      The plantsite is connected to a main highway to Sao Paulo through an
800-meter dirt road. Another main highway connecting Rio with Santos is
located at a distance of 2,000 meters. Paving of the access road to the plant
will be undertaken by the Municipality of Rio at a cost of about US$100,000.
4.   Water
5.21      Valesul's overall consumption of industrial and potable water will
be approximately 2,000 m3 per day.  Potable water will be supplied from a
water main which will also supply the town of Santa Cruz and be installed by
the State of Rio water and sewage company (Compania Estadual de Aguas e
Esgotos-CEDAE) by early 1979. Industrial water, mainly for construction and
plant cooling, will be supplied from wells on the site. Water availability is
satisfactory and has already been confirmed.



- 35 -
5.   Housing
5.22      The location of the plant, close to available, skilled and semi-
skilled manpower in Rio, Santa Cruz and other nearby townships, has eliminated
the need to build housing facilities as part of the project.
D.   Ecology
5.23      Although detailed pollution control regulations for an aluminum
smelter in Brazil are not yet in existence, Valesul has recognized the need to
exercise strict control over all aspects of environmental pollution, to avoid
potential adverse effects that could stem from the proximity of the plant to
highly populated areas, and intends to apply similar standards to those used
by Reynolds for its Hamburg plant. The main sources of pollution from plants
of this type are fluoride fumes and dust from the potline and bake oven fumes
containing carbon monoxide, dust fluorides and tars. All the fumes from
each completely hooded potline cell will be collected and ducted to fume-
control units, where the gases will be reacted with the alumina feed to
remove the fluorides and then recycled. Fluoride particles will then be
over 99% removed from the air stream by bag-house filters before being
exhausted through a stack of about 40 m height, of which the design, when
completed, will be reviewed by the Bank. From this stack, a total of about
47 to 143 tons per year of fluorides will enter the atmosphere at the 86,000-
TPY production level. This amount of fluoride emissions is within the best
levels used by the aluminum industry. The bag-house solid products will be
recycled back to the cell via the alumina feed. Bake-oven fume control will
be done by precipitators, scrubbers or combustion, which will reduce dust,
tar and fluoride emissions to acceptable levels. The potline and bake-oven
control equipment will provide excellent levels of environmental control,
among the best in the world. Alumina dust will not escape into the atmos-
phere, as it will be unloaded and transported using equipment provided with
vacuum protection. Valesul has agreed that the project will be designed,
executed and operated with due regard to all environmental factors in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank.
E.   Employment and Training
5.24      The project will provide direct employment for about 806 people,
most of whom will be skilled or semi-skilled. Initial staff for the project
execution period have been recruited mainly from CVRD and existing Brazilian
aluminum companies. Training plans for the technical staff have been prepared
and contracted with Reynolds. The general schedules for these are satisfac-
tory. These plans will make use of training material prepared by Reynolds
for the Hamburg (Germany) and Venalum (Venezuela) plants. In total, about
720 employees will be trained, of which about 660 (totalling 3,700 man-months)
will be trained in Brazil, and 60 (totalling 300 man-months) will be sent
abroad to facilities in the US, Germany and Venezuela. The cost of this
program will be approximately US$3.2 million, of which about 30% will be
allocated to overseas training.



- 36 -
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Management and Organization
6.01      Valesul has put together a team of engineers with considerable
operating experience in the aluminum industry gained mainly with private
foreign-controlled companies operating in Brazil (Alcan and Alcominas). This
team forms the nucleus of the staff that will implement and operate Valesul.
At present, their responsibilities are basically divided into project prepara-
tion and execution and preparing for operation of the plant. This team is
well equipped to carry out the owner's representative duties in the management
of the project, the more so as it will be assisted by five permanent Reynolds
engineers, with good experience in implementing aluminum reduction projects,
and by other Reynolds personnel to be requested for specific assignments, as
required. The group, under a Technical Director, appointed from Reynolds'
staff, reports directly to Valesul's President. Reynolds is supplying the
basic engineering, including specifications for the key plant equipment
components and assistance with the development of the project costs and
schedule.
6.02      To assist it with project execution, Valesul contracted the ser-
vices of Companhia Internacional de Engenharia (CIE) in December 1977 to do
the local detailed engineering, construction supervision and local procure-
ment. CIE was formed during 1977 by the merging of the Brazilian subsidiary of
Morrison Knudsen (US) with Montreal Engenharia, a local engineering company.
While the merger partners have extensive experience in construction and
engineering in Brazil, CIE is lacking in experience in certain key areas of
execution in large international projects and has no experience in construct-
ing aluminum smelters. Therefore, CIE has subcontracted foreign assistance
from Kaiser Engineers (US) to reinforce its staff in project cost control,
scheduling and foreign procurement. For this purpose, CIE and Valesul
evaluated proposals from a number of foreign firms with recent experience
in the implementation of aluminum projects, and which were acceptable to the
Bank. The foreign exchange cost of this assistance, which is being carried
out through a subcontract between CIE and Kaiser is estimated at US$2.3
million. Average costs per man-month for foreign consulting assistance will
be about US$9,980 in Brazil, and about US$7,200 outside of Brazil. Kaiser
started work during the second quarter of 1978.
6.03      The Valesul project team is essentially using the Reynolds tech-
nical group to assist it as an owner's representative and supplier of techno-
logy and basic engineering. In this arrangement, CIE is responsible to
Valesul for detailed local engineering, construction supervision, foreign
and local procurement, cost control and scheduling. The staff of Valesul,
Reynolds, CIE and Kaiser have been working as an integrated team for over
six months now, and the arrangement is working out very well, with the
Brazilian engineers undoubtedly benefiting from the transfer of know-how
and experience. Valesul has agreed to continue to employ suitable engineer-
ing and project management consultants until project completion.



- 37 -
6.04      Construction, civil works and erection for the plant, as well as the
installation of the equipment (apart from the turnkey green mill, para. 5.07)
will be competitively tendered to Brazilian contractors. The easy access to
the site, the ready availability of labor and certain excess capacity in the
Brazilian construction industry should enable good competition and maintenance
of schedules.
B.   Implementation Schedule
6.05      The Company has received authorization from the Government to proceed
with the project and Reynolds, CIE and Kaiser are already working on engineer-
ing, planning and procurement. Full bid packages prepared by Reynolds have
been made available to Valesul and the Company is expected to receive the first
international competitive bids for time-critical components by March 1979.
Initial, long lead-time contracts, scheduled to be awarded in July 1979 are:
the green mill, the electrical switchyard and the baking furnace. Field
construction has begun with site preparation and some foundation work already
complete. A project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 6.
6.06      According to this schedule, baked anode production will commence in
December 1981, the first pots will be started in July 1981, and the start-
up will be completed by December 1981, with full production achieved by early
1982. Initial pot room production would be based on imported anodes. Full
capacity operation should be achieved fairly quickly after start-up of the
final pots, as is normal in such plants.
6.07      Reynolds, on the basis of its recent experience in Venezuela, feels
that the revised schedule, though tight, is achievable, provided the key
components mentioned above can be contracted on schedule with delivery times
conforming to the overall schedule. With the combined efforts of Valesul
staff, CIE, Reynolds and the foreign project management consultants, the
schedule is expected to be achieved.
VII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost
7.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$370.1
million equivalent, of which US$185.6 million is in foreign exchange, as
summarized below (Annex 7-1):

/a   The costs expressed in Cr$ have been calculated from the US$ costs using
an exchange rate of Cr$19.64 = US$1.00 and are therefore only notional,
as changes in the exchange rate are expected (para. 7.05).
/b   Including indirect foreign exchange of about US$37.0 million.
/c   10% on base cost; no physical contingency on fixed technology fee or land.
/d   Price escalation on civil works 12% p.a.; other items 7% for 1978, 7.5%
for 1979, 7% p.a. for 1980 and thereafter.
7.02      The equipment costs have been derived from estimates prepared in
October 1977 by Valesul with the assistance of Reynolds. Original base-cost
estimates were in terms of 1977 prices, based on quotes and budget estimates
obtained from suppliers mainly in the first half of the year. The capital
cost estimate was revised in February 1978 by Reynolds and again in November
1978 at the Bank's request, based on similar Reynolds projects (VENALUM and
Alcasa in Venezuela) still being executed in 1977/78 and a feasibility study
prepared by Reynolds during 1977 for a similar project in Mexico. The revision
by Reynolds benefited from the fact that design and equipment of Valesul is
essentially the same as in the Venezuelan projects. Reynolds staff have been



- 39 -
in regular contact with the major suppliers so that the cost estimate reflects
late 1978 actual payments or information, as well as exchange rate variations
through November 1978. Reynolds also checked construction and engineering
costs based on their Venezuelan experience. The civil works cost has been
estimated by Valesul based on similar civil construction in Brazil. The
unit costs used are based on recent civil construction costs for various CVRD
projects and have been checked with data obtained in other Bank projects in
Brazil. The construction quantities are comparable to other aluminum reduc-
tion facilities. The piling, however, is more uncertain as to the quantities
needed. A conservative estimate close to the maximum likely requirement
has been used and found reasonable by Reynolds staff. The cost of technology
and engineering is based on contracts already signed in 1977/78 with Reynolds,
CIE and Kaiser Engineering, respectively. Initial construction contracts
already signed, some of which are completed or well advanced (site grading,
foundations) indicate that the estimates are somewhat conservative.
7.03      The project qualifies for 100% exemption from import duties on
equipment, so the cost estimate includes no provision for duties.
7.04      The project cost estimates, when compared to those for other recently
completed aluminum smelters, indicate that certain equipment items and civil
works costs have increased significantly in recent years. Valesul's higher
cost reflects recent changes in the exchange rate of the US$ vis-a-vis the
currencies of countries which could provide significant portions of equipment,
e.g., Japan and Germany. Also, the fact that Valesul is a greenfield plant
and close to the minimum economic size for aluminum smelters makes its invest-
ment cost per ton higher than for larger smelters or expansions to existing
plants. Furthermore, Brazilian equipment is perhaps 30% more expensive than
foreign equipment at the present exchange rate, although this would add less
than 5% to the overall fixed asset costs since local equipment represents only
an estimated 15% of total fixed assets. Also, the US$6.0 million Reynolds
technology fee is charged totally to the project but has a broader value
because the technology may be used in other projects. Taking into account
these factors, Valesul's estimate is realistic.
7.05      Price escalation for equipment is calculated on the basis of pro-
jected price increases in US dollars of 7% per annum for 1978, 7.5% for 1979
and 7% per annum thereafter in the major equipment supplying countries. No
price escalation is applicable to the technology fee or land. International
US dollar price increases have also been used for locally supplied equipment,
goods and services on the assumption that differences in the domestic and the
international inflation rates will be accounted for by adjustments in the
cruzeiro exchange rate. This assumption is based on the current Government
policy which is expected to continue. On civil works, however, escalation
rates of 12% per year in US dollar terms for 1978-81 have been assumed, based
on experience in the recent past that the cost of civil works in Brazil
will rise faster than the general price level. The above cost estimate,
including the provisions for physical contingencies (ample at 10%, given that
basic plant engineering is virtually complete and detailed engineering well
advanced) and for price escalation is considered adequate.

7.06      The initial working capital requirement, estimated at US$40.3 mil-
lion (Annex 7-2), is based on the achievement of full operation three months
after completion of start-up. Interest during construction is calculated on
the basis of US$222 million of debt (para. 7.07).
B.  Financing Plan
7.07      The financing plan for the project is as follows:
VALESUL: Proposed Financing Plan
US$ Million             %
Share Capital                                  148               40.0
Loans:
Local Loans (FINAME)                      34                 9.2
Commercial Banks                          90               24.3
World Bank                                98               26.5
Total Loans                         222               60.0
Total Financing                                370              100.0
7.08      In exchange for the land, the Development Bank of the State of Rio
de Janeiro (BD-Rio) has received US$1.0 million equivalent of preferred
shares, which it is expected will be converted into common shares. Any such
preferred shares would receive a 6% minimum dividend which, however, could
not be paid out of capital or be cumulative. All share subscriptions in
future will be in common shares.
7.09      CVRD was originally willing to provide all of the equity funds for
the project. However, in order to achieve the simultaneous private and
Brazilian control of Valesul consistent with Government policy, CVRD has
negotiated with Shell/Billiton and Reynolds the placement of substantial
portions of Valesul's shares (para. 4.04). The composition of Valesul's
shareholders will be approximately as follows:
VALESUL: Expected Shareholder Composition
US$ Million             %
CVRD                                         89.2                60.3
BD-Rio                                         1.0                0.7
Total Brazilian Shareholders              90.2                61.0
Reynolds                                       6.0                4.0
Billiton                                     51.8                35.0
Total Foreign Private Shareholders        57.8                39.0
Total Equity                                 148.0              100.0

7.10      The schedule of equity payments will be made so that the long term
debt to equity ratio will not exceed 70:30 at the end of each fiscal year
during project execution and 60:40 on project completion and thereafter.
7.11      FINAME would finance through the Banco de Desenvolvimento do Estado
do Rio de Janeiro 80% of most of the local equipment (i.e., 80% financing of
US$43 million of eligible local equipment, out of total estimated US$69 mil-
lion for local equipment and materials). FINAME's normal terms would be an
8-year maturity, including 3 years' grace. In view of the restricted cash
flow situation in the initial years, FINAME has agreed to extend these to
10 years, including 3 years' grace.
7.12      An important aspect of the Bank Group's involvement will be to
mobilize foreign commercial bank funds on terms better than would be possible
without co-financing. CVRD has a firm offer from a US bank to lend US$90 mil-
lion for the project, on a co-financing basis with the Bank, at 1-1/8% above
LIBOR, and for 10 years, including a 5-year grace period. These funds will
finance part of the local equipment costs, civil works and erection, engi-
neering, working capital and interest during construction. The signing of
this loan will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.
7.13      A Bank loan of US$98 million is proposed for 15 years, including
3 years' grace at the standard interest rate plus a fee to the Government
to bring the total interest rate to Valesul to 10% per year in US$ terms. The
Bank loan will be made to Valesul, which will bear the foreign exchange risk
of other currencies against the US dollar, except for some offsetting of this
by a reduction in the fee paid to the Government so that the cost of the loan
would be kept at 10% per annum in US dollar terms over the life of the loan.
Should the foreign exchange cost be such that the US$ equivalent cost
of the loan would be equal to or greater than 10% per annum, no fee would be
payable to the Government. As described further in para. 7.19, the loan will
finance ICB equipment packages, equipment to be procured by international
shopping, the CIE-Kaiser engineering contract and about half of the interest
charges on the loan itself.
7.14      CVRD, Shell and Reynolds have agreed that they will not dispose of
any of their shares without the prior consent of the Bank (except for CVRD
reduction below 50%; see para. 4.05). Furthermore, the Shareholders' Agree-
ment between IBRD, CVRD, Shell and Reynolds stipulates that, should a financing
gap and/or cost overrun occur, CVRD, Shell and Reynolds will ensure that the
necessary funds to complete the project are promptly provided in proportion to
the shareholders' respective holdings on terms acceptable to the Bank. It has
been agreed that until the Compliance Date of the project, unless the Bank
shall agree otherwise, no debt will be contracted that would result in the
Company's total outstanding long term debt exceeding US$222 million equivalent
except for an additional US$20 million of debt, which, if needed for cost
overrun financing, could be contracted provided it had at least a ten-year
maturity with five years grace. For purposes of this covenant, Project
Completion as per the Compliance Date will be defined as (i) completion of
physical construction of the plant and associated facilities; (ii) maintenance



- 42 -
of an average of 90% of production capacity over a continuous six month
period; (iii) achievement of a 1.3:1 current ratio; and (iv) a demonstrated
ability to service all long-term debt during the six month period preceding
the Project Completion. It has been further agreed that any of the share-
holders or the Bank may at any time request a review of the estimated cost to
complete the project, and, should this estimate exceed US$403 million, the
shareholders will provide a plan for financing the overrun which is acceptable
to the Bank. The foregoing covenants are proposed in light of the projected
restrictive debt service situation for several years following completion of
the plant. The Government has agreed to cause CVRD to perform punctually its
obligations under the Shareholders' Agreement.
7.15      Through its involvement, the Bank is encouraging substantial foreign
private and commercial bank participation in the financing of the project;
this will greatly ease the demand on public Brazilian funds, while still
enabling a strong public sector sponsor to play a leading role in the project.
C. Procurement
7.16      Equipment, materials and the initial set of spare parts, valued at
US$159 million for the project, have been divided into the following procure-
ment categories: (i) items to be bid only among Brazilian suppliers, with an
estimated ex-factory value of US$69 million, most of which will be 80%
financed with FINAME loans, and the balance through commercial banks and
equity funds, and (ii) items to be purchased using Bank's guidelines, with an
estimated CIF value of US$90 million, of which about US$86 million will be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) and the balance
through international shopping for items not exceeding US$250,000 in value.
An amount of US$1.0 million is allocated for retroactive financing of con-
sulting services for project management (para. 6.02).
7.17      Brazilian manufacturers are expected to supply about 40% of the
equipment to be procured by ICB. This arrangement means that, with an
ICB/local reserved equipment split of about 57:43, a 40% participation by
Brazilian suppliers in ICB equipment will give a foreign/local split of about
34:66. The equipment lists have been developed taking careful account of
those items which are critical for the sound technical operation of the plant
and/or in terms of delivery times, with those items reserved for local pro-
curement being generally less technically specialized and less critical on
delivery. The equipment lists have been approved by CACEX, the trade arm of
the Central Bank. Local suppliers will be allowed to participate in interna-
tional competitive bidding with a 15% (or the import duty rate, if lower)
preference margin. Finally, the potential suppliers of critical equipment not
financed by the Bank will also require prior Bank approval, i.e., pot room
furnace and gas treatment systems for anode baking plant and pot rooms.
7.18      As mentioned in para. 6.04, construction, civil works and erection
for the plant will be competitively bid among Brazilian contractors.

D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
7.19      The Bank loan will finance goods and services as shown in the
table below:
.Allocation of Bank Loan
Amount of the      % of Expenditures
Category                     Loan Allocated      to be Financed
(US$ million)
Equipment                         90.0 /a       100% of foreign
expenditures or
100% of ex-factory
cost
Consultants' services              3.0          100% of foreign
expenditures
Interest during construction       5.0          Amounts due
Total                           98.0
/a Includes estimated US$4 million for foreign expenditures for
imported items costing less than US$250,000 each, to be pur-
chased through international shopping; also includes contin-
gencies of US$10 million, which in Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement are separately shown in an unallocated category.
7.20      It is expected that about 80% of the Bank loan will be disbursed
against foreign exchange expenditures. The loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by June 30, 1982 (Annex 7-5). Any funds remaining undisbursed
at that time will be cancelled.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenue and Operating Cost Estimate
8.01      Due to the difficulties in estimating future inflation rates in
Brazil, the financial projections are expressed in current US dollars instead
of cruzeiros, assuming an annual inflation rate in US-dollar terms of 7% in
1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6.0% thereafter. This approach assumes that differences
between domestic and international inflation are taken care of by appropriate
exchange rate adjustments, which has generally been the case in the past and
which is expected to continue in the long run.



- 44 -
8.02      Commercial production is expected to begin in mid-1981, with the
first pots being put on power in July 1981. Since the last pots will be
started in late 1981, the plant will not reach full production until early
1982. The average electrical current efficiency during the startup period
is estimated to be 85%, increasing to 88% thereafter. This will result in a
gradual reduction of unit costs (Annex 8-1). The product mix at full pro-
duction is estimated to be 70% ingots/30% slabs and billets progressively
changing to reach 30% ingots, 35% slabs and 35% billets by 1985.
8.03      It has been assumed that the 1981 ingot price in Brazil would be
64 cents/pound in 1978 US dollars, and that adjustments would be made for
inflation (para. 3.37). However, it has been also assumed that operating
costs would increase at 1% more per annum than general inflation in order to
reflect the time lag between cost increases and the approval of price adjust-
ments by CIP, to reflect the alumina supply contract formulae under which
alumina prices (which account for more than 30% of production costs) would
increase slightly faster than the international metal price (para. 8.05), and
to allow for possible real increases in power tariffs (para. 8.06).
8.04      Valesul's production cost breakdown per pound of aluminum metal, at
86,500 TPY production, is summarized below (Annex 8-1):
VALESUL: Production Cost Estimate Per Unit of Output

Total (Excluding Financial Charges
and Income Tax)                                 55.6                100.0
8.05      The most important cost items are alumina, accounting for 38% of
production cost excluding depreciation and financial charges, and electric
energy, equal to 25%. Valesul has negotiated two four to seven-year (seven
years optional) contracts of alumina supply beginning in 1981 (para. 5.15).



- 45 -
The two contracts are with Billiton Aluminum B.V. of Surinam and Bauxite
Industry Development Company, Limited (BIDCO) of Guyana. The alumina price in
both contracts is expressed as a percentage of "ALCAN's World List Price."
While the BIDCO contract is based on a flat 12.75% of the metal price less
US$20 per ton, the Billiton contract specifies the percentages increasing over
time so that in relation to the international metal price the cost of alumina
would rise from 12.9% (1979) to 14.9% (1985). The CIF alumina price of US$188
per ton which was used in the financial projections reflects the arithmetic
average of the two contracts.
8.06      Power tariffs in Brazil have been adjusted in January 1978 by an
average 38% in cruzeiro terms over January 1977, resulting in a January 1978
rate in US-dollar terms of 15.44 mills per kwh for aluminum plants. This is
the rate used in the above table. The increase of power tariffs is equal to
the official inflation rate for 1977. The power cost in January 1977 for a
high load factor user such as Valesul would have been 14 mills per kwh in
US-dollar terms. Since power tariffs remained constant in cruzeiro terms
during the remainder of 1977, the cost of electricity in December 1977 was 27%
lower in current US dollars due to the devaluation of the cruzeiro. On the
average, electricity costs to aluminum plants in 1977 were about 12 mills in
current US-dollar terms. Since power tariffs have been adjusted in the past
only once per year, the average power cost has been lower than the January
rate in US dollar terms. Such a trend is expected to continue for the next
few years, but in the longer term the cost of generating capacity will likely
result in increases in real tariffs, which are taken into account by using the
January rate as the average for the year in the projections. Labor represents
6% of production cost excluding depreciation.

8.08      Based on the important assumption that Brazilian aluminum price
levels will be approximately 5% above international prices (para. 3.37),
financial forecasts indicate that Valesul would have a very tight debt-service
coverage during its early years, as production build-up coincides with the
period of heaviest debt service. Over the past months, discussions between
Valesul and CVRD and the Bank and other prospective lenders has resulted in
some easing of this restricted situation. As already noted (para. 7.12), the
commercial bank loans will be for ten years, including five years' grace.
FINAME has extended its terms beyond the proposed eight-year period, including
three years' grace to a ten-year maturity, including three years' grace (para.
7.11). These terms have been assumed in the financial projections.
8.09      The projections indicate that it may not be possible to pay divi-
dends until about five years after plant startup. Even though the company
may accumulate some cash, it is expected that its accumulated losses from the
production build-up period, while giving it some tax relief, will prevent its
paying dividends until about 1987.
8.10      The financial projections indicate that the company's revenues would
not cover its operating expenses (including depreciation) until 1984, the
second year of full production. In 1983, the first year of full production,
Valesul would be able to finance its cash requirements out of its resources



- 47 -
with a capacity utilization above 71%. In 1985, the year of maximum debt
service, the cash break-even point would be 83%. Thereafter, the financial
situation would progressively improve, with diminishing repayments and interest
on the debt financing.
C. Financial Rate of Return
8.11      The current US-dollar cost/benefit streams for the calculation of
the financial rate of return have been deflated at 7.0% p.a. for 1978, 6.5% p.a.
for 1979, and at 6% p.a. thereafter. The results are summarized below (Annex 8-8):
VALESUL: Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return (Before Tax)
(in %)
Base Case (before income tax)                        10.8
Capital Costs up 10%                                  9.4
Capital Costs up 10%, Production down 10%             7.7
Operating Costs up 10%                                6.8
Selling Prices up 10%                                15.8
Selling Prices down 10%                               4.7
Production down 10%                                   9.1
Production up 10%                                    12.5
Base Case (after income tax)                          8.7
8.12      The resulting returns are somewhat low at 10.8% before and 8.7%
after income tax. The rate of return is most sensitive to changes in the
sales price and least sensitive to changes in the capital cost. In view
of the pricing outlook and covenant (paras. 3.33-3.37), the technical and
managerial competence of the project participants and the reasonably conserva-
tive nature of the operating and cost assumptions and estimates, the downside
risk is considered to be low, with there being a reasonable probability of
some upside potential (para. 3.37). The project presents an attractive oppor-
tunity to the investors in spite of the somewhat low financial return, given
the possibility of even higher prices (based on an increasing proportion of
more expensive new capacity in the sector), the opportunity for further
profits from alumina supply and downstream fabricating, and the higher
returns which would result from expansion of the plant.
D. Financial Covenants
8.13      Valesul and its shareholders have agreed to the following financial
covenants, to be applicable at all times after project completion: (i) to
maintain a long-term debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60:40, with short-term
debt in excess of US$3 million to be counted as long-term debt in calculating
the debt-to-equity ratio; (ii) to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1;
(iii) to limit its dividend distribution or any other cash distribution, or
its financial commitments or prepayment of any debt if such action would cause
its current ratio to fall below 1.3; (iv) not to contract any debt if, on the
basis of financial projections prepared by Valesul and acceptable to the Bank,
its projected debt-service coverage would be less than 1.5 and its debt equity



- 48 -
ratio higher than 60:40 including the debt to be contracted; (v) not to create
subsidiaries, grant or guarantee loans to other companies or make investments
in other companies without prior Bank approval; (vi) not to sell or assign any
voting shares held by CVRD or each of the principal foreign shareholders
without the Bank's consent; .and (vii) to have its annual accounts audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and submit these to the Bank
within three months after the end of the fiscal year.
E.   Major Risks
8.14      Valesul will face some financial risks in that the prices of all
its products--ingots, slabs and billets--are subject to Government policies
and regulations, and thus outside Valesul's control. Since Valesul's finan-
cial performance will depend on these prices, assurance has been obtained
from the Government that it will take all actions required to enable the
Company to earn a reasonable return on its investments under efficient
operations (para. 3.37).
8.15      Although CVRD has extensive iron ore experience, Valesul will be its
first aluminum reduction plant. The project is not expected to face major
management-related operational risks, however, since Valesul's technical and
administrative staff has considerable operating experience in the aluminum
industry. Moreover, the involvement of Shell/Billiton and Reynolds in the
project and the implementation of a suitable training program are expected to
improve the prospects for successful plant operation considerably.
8.16      Ecological and environmental risks are considered to be adequately
covered by the measures to be taken and the proposed covenant in this respect
(para. 5.23).
8.17      The risks related to project management seem to be minimal given
the Reynolds, CIE and Kaiser support. The involvement of Reynolds, with its
considerable experience in a large number of successful aluminum projects,
helps ensure that risks associated with project management will be minimized.
8.18      A common risk in the aluminum industry is the reliability of power
supply. The physical and contractual measures being taken (para. 5.17) are
judged to be such that the risks in this regard are being minimized as far as
realistically possible.
8.19      Valesul's entry to the market presents some risks (para. 3.39), but
the growing demand and demand/supply gap, coupled with its location close
to markets, should enable it to evolve sound strategies to reduce this risk,
which strategies will form part of the marketing plan to be presented to the
Bank (para. 3.39).

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
9.01      With its huge bauxite reserves and enormous hydropower potential,
Brazil is particularly well endowed for the development of an aluminum indus-
try. Nevertheless, Brazil's three primary aluminum producers have not been
able to grow fast enough in order to satisfy the country's increasing demand.
With between 30 and 40% of aluminum supply being imported in the past, the
increasing volume of the market has exerted growing pressure on the balance
of trade. The prospect of continued high aluminum imports in an environment
of considerable balance-of-payments constraints and the desire to increase
the Brazilian participation in industrial development led the Government
to take an active role in stimulating the future development of the industry.
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
9.02      For the economic analysis of the project, which will essentially
substitute imports with domestic supplies, the economic ex-factory prices of
the Valesul products have been estimated on the basis of the delivered cost
of imports CIF Rio de Janeiro. For 1981 and thereafter, the international
ingot price (FOB New York) has been estimated at 61 cents/pound in 1978 US$
(para. 3.20). The cost of freight, insurance and port handling (excluding
taxes) is about 16% of the FOB value. Additionally, since 70% of Valesul's
output will consist of slabs and billets which sell at a 12% price premium
over ingots on average, a weighted average 8.4% adjustment has been applied
to the international ingot price.
9.03      In the economic analysis, inputs have been taken at their financial
values, except for power, because there are indications that the financial
power cost (15.44 mills/kwh) does not represent the economic cost, i.e., the
marginal cost of power from additional capacity. Also, Valesul as an alumi-
num producer would receive a virtual subsidy on the power tariff due to its
substantial exemption from subscription of ELETROBRAS bonds. The marginal
cost of power has been estimated by Regional Energy Projects Staff at about
23 mills versus the 15.44 mills cost used in the financial analysis.
B.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
9.04      At full production, the project's output will be about 86,500 tons
per year, substituting for an estimated import value of about US$145 million
(in constant 1978 US dollars), using financial prices. The direct foreign
exchange savings of the project, net of imported raw materials, is estimated at
about US$120 million per year in constant terms before principal and interest
payments on foreign loans. Net of foreign debt service, the project would
still generate annual foreign exchange savings of approximately US$75 million
in the years with the heaviest debt service. Valesul will thus have a con-
tinuing and increasingly favorable impact on Brazil's balance of payments.
Even with the Valesul project and other new projects and expansions expected,
Brazil is projected to be a net importer of aluminum at least through the
1980's.



- 50 -
C.   Economic Rate of Return
9.05      For the economic analysis, four adjustments have been made to the
financial costs and benefits (Annex 9): (i) a power price of 23 mills (para.
9.03); (ii) shadow pricing of foreign exchange costs and benefits by 30% to
reflect foreign trade distortions caused by import tariffs, export taxes
and subsidies, as well as other forms of import restrictions and export
incentives; (iii) the exclusion of all transfer payments and taxes; and (iv)
Valesul's output has been valued at projected international aluminum prices
(para. 9.02). The economic rate of return is satisfactory at about 20%.
The economic sensitivity analysis shows the following:
VALESUL: Sensitivity Tests on Economic Rate of Return (in %)
Base Case                                               20.4
Capital Cost Up 10%                                     18.4
Capital Cost Up 10%, Production Down 10%                16.3
Operating Cost Up 10%                                   17.1
Revenue Down 10%                                        14.7
Power Cost 30 Mills                                     17.5
Base Case (without shadow pricing
foreign exchange)                         12.3
D.   Plant Location
9.06      Although the Government's overall development strategy is to
encourage more investment away from the southeastern part of the country,
the decision for the site in the Santa Cruz area is fully justifiable. The
site is in an area designated for industrial development in which a number
of other industrial projects are located and planned, such as steel plants
(Companhia Siderurgica Nacional's future No. 2 plant and Companhia Siderur-
gica de Guanabara S.A. (COSIGUA), which has been partly financed by three
IFC investments totalling US$75.5 million), 1/ and a nuclear power plant. To
help reduce the congestion of the port of Rio de Janeiro, a new port is under
construction at Sepetiba Bay, some 17 km from Valesul's site. The area is
more than 50 km southwest of the center of Rio de Janeiro and well served by
road and rail.  The Santa Cruz region has had very little economic activity
outside limited agricultural activity. The project therefore would have a
beneficial employment impact in an area outside metropolitan Rio de Janeiro,
particularly considering the prospect for the future downstream development
of more labor-intensive fabricating facilities nearby. Furthermore, about 90%
of Brazil's primary aluminum consumption is in the southeastern part of the
country, and this proportion is expected to change little over the life of the
plant. Ample power supplies are available nearby (the plant will consume less
than 1% of the present total demand in the southeastern grid system), required
raw materials will have easy access by water, workers for plant construction
and operation are easily obtainable nearby, and investment in infrastructure
will be relatively small.

E.   Employment Effects
9.07      The project will directly generate about 845 permanent jobs.
Employment directly generated during construction is estimated at a total of
about 5,000 man years. Additional jobs will be provided in the engineering
and equipment industries. Moreover, permanent employment will be created
indirectly through upstream and downstream linkages in raw material supply
and fabricating industries. Training benefits will accrue from the executive
level on down, particularly important in view of the planned Amazon projects.
F.   Other Benefits
9.08      The non-integrated primary aluminum consumers in Brazil have indi-
cated that they strongly welcome the establishment of a new aluminum producer.
These consumers have so far been dependent only on two sources of supply:
high-cost imports and Alcominas, the only non-integrated producer at present.
The independent fabricating industry--with limited access to metal in the
past--is concerned about the possibility that Alcominas might expand into
fabrication. This would result in the total absorption of Brazilian primary
aluminum production by the integrated aluminum companies. In this environ-
ment, the project will improve the tight supply situation in a part of the
market presently dependent on one producer ana on imports and with the risk
of relying in the future on imports only. The increased availability of
metal is likely to increase capacity utilization and profitability of the
consumers and would be an important stimulus to the whole industry.
9.09      The project would also provide the introduction to Brazil of the
aluminum reduction technology of Reynolds, the third largest international
aluminum company (after Alcoa and Alcan). Majority ownership will be Brazil-
ian, however, thus improving the basis for Brazilian leadership in the devel-
opment of the huge aluminum potential in the north of the country.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The following major agreements and assurances have been obtained:
(a) From the Government that it will:
(i)  take all pricing actions to enable Valesul's achieving
a reasonable financial performance (paras 3.37 and 8.14);
(ii)  cause CVRD to perform punctually its obligations under
the Shareholders' Agreement-(para 7.14);
(b)  From CVRD, Billiton and Reynolds that they will:
(i)  assist Valesul to carry out a detailed market study
and develop marketing plans by December 31, 1979
(paras 3.27 and 3.39);



- 52 -
(ii)  take appropriate steps to achieve private and Brazilian
control of Valesul (para 4.05);
(iii) not dispose of voting shares in Valesul without Bank
approval (paras 4.05 and 8.13);
(iv)  agree to Valesul's retaining freedom to purchase
supplies of alumina on a commercially competitive
arms-length basis (para 5.15);
(v)  provide funds on suitable terms to complete the
project and preserve sound financial ratios; limit
total amount of Valesul debt (para 7.14); and
(c) From Valesul that it will:
(i)  carry out a detailed market study and develop
marketing plans by December 31, 1979 (paras 3.27
and 3.39);
(ii)  ensure that the project is implemented and operated
with due regard to environmental factors (para 5.23);
(iii) observe certain financial covenants including limita-
tion of debt (paras 7.14 and 8.13); and
(iv)  submit documentation on potential suppliers of critical
equipment not financed by the Bank for prior Bank
approval (para 7.17).
(d)  From ELETROBRAS that all actions will be taken to avoid
power supply interruptions (para 5.18);
(e)  From PORTOBRAS that infrastructure for port unloading facili-
ties will be completed on time (para 5.19).
10.02     The following are conditions of loan effectiveness:
(a)  registration of Valesul's by-laws (para 4.03);
(b)  effectiveness of the commercial bank loan contract
(para 7.13); and
(c)  effectiveness of the Shareholders Agreement (para 7.14).
10.03     Given the above agreements, the project provides a sound basis for
a Bank loan to Valesul of US$98 million equivalent for a period of 15 years,
including 3 years' grace.

BRAZIL
VALESUL ALUMINUM PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. Inflation Accounting
1.        Brazil has been forced to cope with considerable rates of inflation
over the past two decades. In 1964 it promulgated a system of "monetary
corrections and flexible exchange rates" to obtain better control over rising
inflation rates. The "Brazilian Model" worked satisfactorily until the oil
crisis provoked a sudden push of imported inflation in 1974 which let infla-
tion rates rise up to a level of about 40% p.a.
2.        To avoid unnecessary distortions as a result of an uncertain
development of Brazil's inflation and to facilitate comparisons with other
similar projects, it was decided to express all financial projections in
current US Dollars. Assuming that the policy of the Government taken in the
past of adjusting the foreign exchange value of the Cruzeiro according to
the difference between domestic and international inflation rates will con-
tinue, the following inflation rates were applied in the financial analysis:

3.        Since the formulation of the monetary correction system in 1964,
a series of laws and decrees were introduced regulating the use of the
monetary correction factors in the financial statements of companies. The
regulations--especially for income tax purposes--change from time to time.
For the purpose of the financial projections, the latest accounting rules
were applied, with the difference that instead of the domestic "monetary
correction factor" the international inflation rate as "indexing factor" was
used.
4.        According to Brazil's accounting principles, fixed assets, as well
as local long-term loans, are subject to monetary adj-ustments and are indexed
respectively. The difference between the revaluation of fixed assets and of
the local long-term loans is added to equity to restore the balance between
assets and liabilities. Since the financial projections are expressed in
current US Dollars, there is no need to consider adjustments reflecting
increases of principal repayments for foreign loans due to changes in the
exchange rate between the cruzeiro and the US Dollar.
B. Production Build-up
5.        It is assumed that the first pots would be put on power in July 1981
and that full production would be reached by early 1982, resulting in the
following production build-up:

1983              86,500
C. Revenues
6.        In Brazil, aluminum ingot prices are controlled by the Governmett.  In
January 1979, the Brazilian ingot price per pound (ex-factory) was 59 cents com-
pared to ALCAN's World List Price (FOB N.Y.) of 56 cents at the same time. The
international price is expected to rise in real terms to 61 cents/lb in constant
1978 US Dollars by 1981. For the purposes of the financial projections, it
was assumed that the Brazilian price in 1981 and beyond would be 64 cents/lb in
constant 1978 US Dollars. The price of slabs and billets was assumed to be at
a 12% premium over that of ingots, as has been the case for several years.
D. Operating Cost
7.        The operating cost per ton is projected to decrease over time until
it stabilizes 6 years after startup. The higher production cost per ton in
the first years is mainly due to a high consumption of cryplite after startup.
Thereafter, production cost drops from US$1,183 to US$920 per ton in 1983.
By 1984 expenses are expected to increase by US$26 per ton because of the need
for pot relining. A detailed projection of production cost per ton is given in
Annex 8-1.
8.        Depreciation and amortization have been computed using the straight-
line method. The following depreciation and amortization rates have been
applied:
Item                                Years        Rates (%)
Interest during construction          5             20

Pre-operating expenses                5             20
E. Financing Terms
9.        The financial projections are based on the following financing terms:

ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
A.  Assumptions for Economic Prices and Costs
The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of the
financial rate of return in real 1978 terms with the following modi-
fications:
(a)  Foreign exchange costs and benefits were shadow
priced by 30% to reflect foreign trade distortions
(para. 9.05);
