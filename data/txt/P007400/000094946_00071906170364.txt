3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
According to the June 1994 GET Fund Grant Agreement and the March 1994 GEF Memorandum and
Recommendation of the Director, which constitutes the basic appraisal docunent, the main objectives of
the Project were to (i) demonstrate, on a pilot scale, and over a five-year time frame, the potential for
electricity savings to reduce fossil fuel requirements for electricity generation, with corresponding
reductions in C02, NOx, and S02 emissions; and (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the electricity
sector and other relevant public and non-public agencies to engage in energy efficiency enhancement,
implement the savings programs developed through the Project on a larger scale, and develop a framework
for broadening the program on a country-wide scale. The broader, long-term objective was to develop the
basis for expanding the scope of the program (if successful), on a Jamaica-wide basis and for having
electric utilities in other developing countries replicate similar programs.
These objectives were appropriate and relevant to the issues confronting the electricity sector in the
early/mid-1990s, which remained heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels and faced serious generation
capacity constraints. These constraints have been eased since 1997 as new and more fuel-efficient
generating plants have come on stream, reducing the attractiveness of DSM measures for the Jamaica
Public Service Company, Ltd. (JPS), the electric utility and implementing agency for this Project.
Hlowever, electricity demand growth has remained robust, despite low and even negative GDP growth since
the mid- 1 990s, thereby giving DSM programs a fresh impetus for the coming years as JPS capacity reserve
shrinks.
In the Jamaican context, the Project was innovative as well as risky because there was no prior
institutional capability to carry out DSM programs nor exposure of end-users to an energy-saving program.
3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions.
3.3 Original Components:
As initially designed, the Project had six components:
*   Measures to achieve electricity savings in commercial buildings;
*   Electricity savings program for the residential sector;
*   Assessment of potential energy savings in the industrial sector;
*   Program monitoring, evaluation, and quality control;
*   Institutional development of the DSM Unit set up to implement the Project; and
*   Institutional development of related entities such as the Jamaica Bureau of Standards, the Natural
Resource Conservation Authority, and local environmental NGOs.
Based on prior results, two renewable energy components were added in the fnal year of project
implementation, i.e., (i) dissemination of solar water heaters to commercial (hotels) and residential
consumers, thereby reducing demand for electricity; and (ii) pilot testing of solar photovoltaic systems for
isolated rural communities that are unlikely to receive grid-supplied electricity in the foreseeable future.
This was made possible through cost savings and the scaling back of other project components.
Assessment of Design
While adequate overall, the project design had two important inadequacies, which had a significant impact
on project implementation. First, the project design should have incorporated greater autonomy for the
-2-



DSM Unit, backed up by an inter-institutional advisory board, to ensure that JPS's corporate goals did not
constrain the objectives of the DSM program. Second, revolving fund arrangements should have been
incorporated in all those components where project funds were on-lent to, and subsequently reimbursed by
consumers who purchased efficiency enhancing equipment.
3.4 Revised Components:
Component; Cost; Rating
COMMERCIAL SECTOR; $3,600,000; S
RESIDENTLAL SECTOR; $1,400,000; S
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR; $100,000; S
MONITORING, EVALUATION, QUALITY CONTROL; $1,200,000.00; S
INSTITUTION BUILDING; $1,200,000; S
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Satisfactory
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Project has substantially achieved its objectives, by demonstrating considerable potential for saving
electricity. For the residential sector, the energy savings mobilized indicate that there would be significant
potential for additional savings at low cost, so the Project provides an adequate basis for extending the
lighting, solar water heating, and solar P.V. programs on a larger scale. On the other hand, results in the
industrial and commercial sectors are below expectations and the project experience indicates that
important obstacles need to be overcome to attain substantial energy savings in these sectors. While this
was not a primary project objective, the greenhouse gas reduction targets were not attained (14,000 tons
instead of 86,000 tons as expected), largely because of the low participation rate among commercial
consumers.
Public awareness of energy conservation and of environmental impacts of fossil fuel use was enhanced
under the Project, which successfully involved relevant NGOs. The Project's institutional development
objective was met through creating an indigenous capability for DSM activities, the first of its kind in the
Caribbean, both within JPS and among major energy consumers, NGOs, and educational institutions. This
was achieved through dissemination of best practices including for energy efficiency auditing. The
acceptance in principle of the DSM Unit's business plan by JPS' senior management and the establishment
of a revolving fund for financing energy-efficiency related expenditures provide some certainty that these
achievements are sustainable.
For the above reasons, the ICR assesses the overall project outcome as satisfactorv. despite the shortfall in
meeting the electricity savings and emission reduction targets.
4.2 Outputs by components:
In physical terms, the Project's energy savings targets were 7 peak MW or 30,000 MWh by December 31,
1998, the original completion date. At the time of the mid-term review (November 1996), the contribution
of the different components to the overall targets was revised to take account of implementation experience
during the Project's first two years, but the final overall targets remained essentially unchanged. With
hindsight, these targets were unrealistically high and should have been reviewed more thoroughly at the
time of the mid-term review.
The Project only partially achieved its physical goals, essentially due to cutbacks in expected participation
- 3-



by large commercial energy users related to the cut-off in funding by JPS and Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB). At completion, the Project is estimated to have cut grid-based electricity demand by about
4MW and produced annual energy savings of about 13,000 MWh, about 60% and 40%, respectively, of
the initial targets.
Residential Program: In terms of public impact, the residential lighting program was the most successful
component of the Project. By the time of project closure, over 32,000 households participated in the
program and almost 100,000 CFLs (costing about US$1 million) had been sold to JPS consumers, thereby
cutting peak demand by about 1.7MW. This component had a difficult start, with both poor consumer
response to the pilot test and quality problems with the compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). However, the
DSM Unit's flexible and creative approach to promoting and marketing helped to overcome these problems,
and by the end, the Project exceeded its initial targets. A consultants' review has concluded that the
program was popular with consumers, satisfaction is high and a solid basis exists for replicating it on a
larger scale, given that nearly 10% of JPS residential consumers participated in it. However, the fnancing
of an expanded program would make it necessary that JPS transfer back to the DSM Unit some of the
funds collected from consumers who purchased CFLs during the first phase of the Project.
Since the solar water heating program was completed only recently (late 1999), evaluation of the actual
benefits could not be undertaken at this stage. However, a 0.6 MW reduction in peak demand is projected
as result of the 300 SWHs installed in residential households. For this component, a revolving fund was set
up to ensure that the repayments over two years are plowed back into funding an extension of the program.
Commercial Program: Energy audits of 15 large-volume commercial consumers were carried out by the
DSM Unit and six of these consumers implemented the recommended energy efficiency measures. The
major barrier to broader implementation was the lack of low-cost financing, the weakness of the Jamaican
economy, and the inability of firms to self-finance the necessary investments. JPS' decision to reverse its
prior commitment to pre-finance the necessary investments seriously affected this component. The
commercial program is estimated to have produced energy savings of 3,700 MWh p.a. and 0.2MW of peak
demand reduction.
Institutional development: The bulk of project expenditures and outputs relate to capacity building in
DSM techniques through training, technical assistance, and consultants' advice. The DSM Unit has
developed into a valuable resource of experienced and well-trained staff. The Project also channeled about
US$ 0.4mn to Natural Resource Conservation Authority (NRCA) and two NGOs (Jamaica Environment
Trust and the National Consumers League) that participated in public awareness campaigns to promote
energy conservation.
Program monitoring and evaluation: Because its nature as a pilot project - which was intended to serve
as basis for larger DSM programs both in Jamaica and elsewhere - the project design attached considerable
importance to monitoring and evaluation of results by independent consultants: 10% of project funds were
allocated to this purpose. The results of each major component were reviewed and assessed by consultants
who were not previously involved in project implementation. The information on energy savings obtained
from these evaluations provide a useful basis for the DSM Unit to market its services to other potential
clients in the future.
Project Components financed by other Sources
JPS provided approximately US$3.0 million to cover the DSM Unit's personnel and administrative
expenses, as well as funding for a public education campaign directed at residential and commercial
-4 -



customers (US$0.34 million).
IDB As part of an US$80.0 million Energy Rehabilitation Loan, US$4.0 million (later reduced to US$2.6
million) were made available for dissemination of CFLs, retrofitting of the JPS head office, assessment of
solar water heating and refrigeration options, and energy audits for commercial consumers.
'Rockefeller Foundation US$0.237million were made available for feasibility studies on cogeneration
options and implementation of one project.
Canadian Trust Fund US$0.16 million financed 19 assessments of large-volume industrial energy users.
There was no investment follow-up by these users.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate ofreturn:
At appraisal, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed programs were evaluated using the societal, total
resource cost (TRC). including taxes and subsidies, and participation tests, which are commonly used in
North America to assess DSM programs. The resulting benefit/cost ratios were 1.47 for the societal test;
1.31 for the TRC test; and 3.5 for the participation test. Based on actual project data, the ex-post results
are 4.52 for the societal test; 4.03 for the TRC test, and 7.78 for the total participation test. These results
were achieved despite the scaling down of the Project, largely because the results from the residential
component exceeded original assumptions by a considerable margin.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
As result of substantial capacity building in DSM techniques that took place under the Project, the DSM
Unit now constitutes a valuable resource of experienced and well-trained staff. Given that the Project has
identified considerable potential for expanding DSM activities, there is a strong case for preserving and
expanding the DSM Unit which contains a pool of expertise with the potential to apply its skills to future
programs both in Jamaica and in other Caribbean countries.
The participation of NGOs in the Project proved to be useful to furthering the goals of DSM, while at the
same time better equipping these agencies to pursue their own activities. However, the substantial
assistance (US$ 0.6mn of IDB loan funding) planned for the Jamaica Bureau of Standards to carry out
energy efficiency tests and labeling of appliances and to disseminate building codes was eliminated due to
the Govemments failure to provide in time a site needed to construct laboratory premises, as well as lack
of other counterpart resources.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
International petroleum prices were low for most of the project period, thereby reducing the incentive to
conserve energy. (It has not been possible to gauge the effect of the resurgence of this price since early
1999.) No other significant factors outside the control of the Govermnent or the implementing agency
affected project implementation.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The macroeconomic deterioration since the mid- 1990s and attendant financial crisis greatly reduced the
willingness and ability of industrial and commercial consumers to invest in energy efficiency investments.
At the time of appraisal, annual GDP growth was projected at 3.5% and energy demand was projected to
increase at about the same rate. Instead, the Jamaican economy experienced stagnation and even decline
for the past several years (while electricity demand continued to increase at about 50/op.a.), which altered



the context within which the Project was implemented.
The Government was supportive in principle of energy efficiency programs but provided little effective
assistance. It was not until the end of the Project that the Government through the Ministry of Mining and
Energy (MME) exerted pressure on JPS to pursue DSM programs.
There was insufficient involvement of other energy sector entities or major consumers in monitoring and
supporting the DSM Unit's activities. The Unit depended almost entirely upon JPS senior management and
external donors to set its priorities and finance its work program. As such, the Unit did not benefit from the
guidance of many important players in the Jamaican energy scene. The Unit was over-reliant on the sole
commitment of JPS, which was not always forthcoming.
According to larger energy users, the lack of attractive financing or tax relief for energy efficiency
investments has deterred investment in efficiency enhancing equipment. Interest rates on local borrowing in
Jamaica were very high during the project period and in conjunction with the sluggish business
environment, they were a major reason for the poor response by individual and commercial energy users.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
In the initial financing plan for the Project, JPS committed itself to provide US$4.3mn in local currency,
and would have been the single largest contributor project fnancing. However, the implementation period
coincided with an electricity tariff freeze, which was aggravated by JPS' financial crisis in 1995-96
resulting from the accidental destruction of a significant part of its generation capacity. JPS was forced to
reduce its financial contribution to the project component for large-volume commercial consumers. This
led to a sharply lower participation rate of the largest energy users and thus, a disproportionate shortfall in
overall energy savings resulting from the Project.
During project implementation, JPS management exhibited an uneven degree of commitment to DSM goals.
Initial support during project preparation and the early implementation phase was high, given JPS
generation capacity constraints at that time. However, the justification of DSM programs within JPS
became more difficult once supply bottlenecks were removed after two new IPPs initiated service. Nor did
JPS integrate DSM programs into its long-term load forecasting and generation expansion planning.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The Project was completed at a cost of US$9.85 million, 21 percent below the appraisal estimate of
US$12.5 million and 5 percent below the - revised - mid-term review estimate. This reduction occurred
both because JPS and IDB reduced their contribution to project funding (due primarily to the requirements
to allocate funds to repair the Old Harbour generating plant damaged in mid-1994) and costs of several
activities were lower than originally estimated. The GET grant financed US$ 3.57 million; the IDB loan,
US$2.68 million; the grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and Canadian Trust Fund, US$0.20 million
and US$0.15 million, respectively; and JPS, US$3.25 million. Toward the end of the Project, funds were
reallocated from consulting services and training to pilot projects for solar water heating and solar PV.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The Project's sustainability is assessed as uncertain because the institutional arrangements for future DSM
activities in Jamaica as yet have not been clearly defined in terms of their scope and location. While
supportive of DSM activities, the Government in general and MIME in particular do not yet have an explicit
DSM policy as part of its overall energy sector strategy or a vision for the future role of the DSM Unit.
Several alternative institutional arrangements have been mooted and a decision by Government and JPS is
-6 -



urgently needed on the future importance of DMS in general and the role of the DSM Unit in particular.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
At present, JPS continues to pay the salaries of the DSM Unit staff and its operating costs. JPS intends to
keep the DSM Unit as a distinct entity but integrate the Unit more closely into its mainstream activities,
pending a fnal government decision. However, DSM activities may not always be compatible with JPS'
corporate goal of maximizing electricity supplies, in terms of coverage and per-capita consumption. In
order to build on the achievements of the Project and to sustain the present public interest in CFLs, solar
water heater (SWH) and solar PV systems, it is essential that JPS and/or other sources provide the DSM
Unit with adequate funding to pursue these programs.
The DSM Unit has indicated that with adequate funding, it would be feasible, over a three-year period, to
disseminate a further 200,000 CFLs to residential users, and about 3,000 SWHs and 1,000 solar PV
systems in remote rural households. These targets need to be firmed up as part of the Unit's business plan.
Once approved and costed, they would be the basis for assessing the Unit's performance in the next two -
three years.
Further project monitoring by the World Bank in the next six - twelve months is recommended as part of
the dialogue with the Government, in order to assist in ensuring the sustainability of the DSM Unit and in
defining its future range of interventions. The value of the Project as "demonstration" of the potential for
DSM programs in Jamaica and elsewhere also depends on a review by GET and the Bank of possible
follow-on activities of this nature in other Caribbean countries.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Project's objectives fitted well into the prevailing sectoral objectives of reducing generation capacity
shortages, and the Government's overall objectives to minimize its fuel import bill and reduce power plant
emissions. Preparation and appraisal were thorough, although the design of the procurement arrangements
imposed an excessive degree of prior Bank scrutiny. Arrangements for more ex-post reviews of
procurement decisions would have helped to reduce the extent of micro-management by the Bank's task
managers that resulted from the need for prior clearance of even nominal expenditures. Finally, the
appraisal did not sufficiently recognize the risk of: (i) non-implementation of efficiency audit
recommendations due to financial constraints; and (ii) uneven commitment by JPS management to DSM
goals.
7.2 Supervision:
Overall, project supervision by the Bank was satisfactorv, with nine missions in five years that provided the
required expertise. However, there should have been more intensive supervision during the first two years
of the Project when substantial delays in project start-up and changes in management of the DSM Unit
occurred. At that time, other - considerably larger and more complex - Bank-financed projects and major
sectoral policy issues (such as JPS privatization) dominated staff and borrower attention. The Project also
suffered from a rapid turnover in task managers during 1996-98 and a hiatus in task management in late
1997 and early 1998. Thereafter, closer supervision by the Bank ensured that the demonstration
components proposed by the DSM Unit were implemented expeditiously and the Project was completed
within the extended closing period, with nearly all available funds being utilized.
-7-



7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
On account of adequate project preparation and supervision, the Bank's overall performance is rated
satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Project was based on the recommendations of an ESMAP study on energy efficiency options (e.g.
building codes; equipment labeling) and work by the Conservation Law Foundation and Rockefeller
Foundation which recommended pilots for enhancing energy efficiency of commercial users. A PPF was
granted for project preparation undertaken by consultants.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
While the Government's energy policy document acknowledged the importance of energy efficiency
enhancement, the Project did not receive the necessary effective support from MME whose participation in
the Project was generally limited to monitoring progress. An urgent decision by the Government is needed
on the institutional arrangements for future DSM activities in Jamaica.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
DSM Unit: Project execution was slow in the first two years but accelerated considerably later. Unit
management and staff were committed to making the Project a success, and showed initiative in seeking
solutions to the difficulties encountered during implementation. Project results were satisfactory overall,
despite the cutback in JPS' financial contribution. However, the Unit should have been more proactive
toward the end of the Project to ensure the sustainability of its operations beyond project completion.
JPS: JPS management exhibited uneven support to DSM. The decision to reduce its financial support to
the program, although understandable in the circumstances, impeded the Project's impact on the
commercial and industrial sectors and thus reduced the degree to which the energy savings targets could be
met. Toward the end of project implementation, JPS did not actively explore alternatives for transfonning
the DSM Unit into an energy services company, which has added to the uncertainties about the Unit's
future.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory on balance, on the strength of the DSM Unit's performance, notwithstanding the lack of
effective government support.
8. Lessons Learned
The key lessons that can be drawn from this Project are:
* A supportive policy environment, through strong and proactive commitment by the Government and the
major energy sector entities, is essential for DSM programs to succeed;
* There is a potential conflict between a narrow goal of maximizing electricity supplies and a DSM
program;
* The institutional arrangements for DSM programs need to ensure that the implementing agency has
adequate managerial and fnancial autonomy;
* Public awareness and promotional campaigns are critical to the success of DSM programs;
* Energy efficiency audits in the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors need to be accompanied
by appropriate financing, if there is to be adequate investment follow-up to the audit recommendations;
and
* Prospects for sustainability are enhanced if revolving fund mechanisms to recycle consumer
repayments are incorporated in the project design and adhered to.

Exeutive Summary
Ihe Jamaica Public Service Company developed a Demand Side Management Demonsuaion
Project in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Banrk the Global Envionment Trust
Facility/World Bank (tustee), the Rockefeller Foundafion, and the Canadian Trust Facility/IDB
(trustee).
The total project cost was originally estimated at US$12.5 milon, with the IDB Loan 605/OC-
JA providing USS4.0 million, the Rockefeller Foundation providing a grant of USS237,000, the
Canadian Trust Fund providing a grant of USS150,000, the World Bank/GET Facility providing
a grant of USS3.8 million and parallel financing by JPSCo of USS4.31 million. The total project
cost was revised to US$] 0.37 million subsequent to the Mid-term review undertaken by the
World Bank over the period November17- December 2,1996 The final date for disbursement
under IDB's Loan Contract was February 1999, and the closing date for the World Bank/GET
grant was December 31, 1999.Total disbursement under the GET Grant as of December 31, 1999
was US$3.568 million.
Project Objectives
. The principal objectives of the project were to: (i) save fuel consumption; (ii) defer generation
capacity expansion; (iii) reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; (iv) build institutional capability
in the Jamaica electric power sector and the energy-related private sector, (v) support the ongoing
efforts in testing and adopting energy efficient equipment; (vi) increase public awareness; (vii)
demonstrate the potential gains to utilities of other developing countries; (viii) provide cost
savings to JPSCo and participating customers; and (xi) expand the use of new technologies in
Jamaica  The project had an energy savings target of about 7 peak MW and 30,000 MWh by
1999. Additionally, the project included institutional stengthening for the JPSCo DSM Unit,
and other institutions such as the Jamaica Bureau of Standa ds (JBS), Natural Resource
Conservation Authority (NRCA), Jamaica Environment Trust (JET) and other Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs).

Project Implementation Performance
Ihe Demand Side Management Unit, within the Corporate Services Division executed the
Project, which becam effective on June 1, 1994. Cooperation in the implementation and
enhancement of individual DSM programme plans was provided by the Jamaica
Environment Trust, the National Consumers' League, the United Consumers in Action, and
the Natural Consevation Resource Authonty. The Jamaica Bureau of Standards was also
involved in the testing of energy efficiency lighting equipment and in providing information
on Solar Water Heating Standards and Energy Efficiency Building Codes and Standards.
The programmes falling under the umbrella of the Demand Side Management
Demonstration Project were as follows:
*     Residential Phase I and i,
*     Small Commercial Phase I and II,
a     Lage Commercial Retrofit,
*     Large Conmercial New Construction,
*     Assessments of Solar Water Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning systems,
and
*     Cogeneration component targeted to hotels and industial facilities.
*     Solar Water Heating Pilots in the Commercial and Residential Sectors
*     Photovoltaic Pilot Programme in two rural villages
This report provides an encapsulated revicw of the Demand Side Management
Demonstration Project by outlining the main project tagets, accomplishments, lessons
leamt and recommended actions to enhance the project's future sustainability.
The Project faced severl risks to the realization of projected benefits- These were
technical, institutional and market The technical risks relate to the issues surrounding the
unique characteristics of the power in Jamaica which is supplied at II OV, 50Hz. The
insitutional risks relate to the ability to adequately staff the DSM Unit, and supporting
areas. The market risks relate to the possibility of weak interest or paricipation in DSM
programs, which would affect penetration and savings targets.
A major factor contributing to the slow pace of implementation during the first two years
was the deterioration in JPSCo's cash flow, which was aggravated by the June3, 1994
explosion at the Old Harbour Power Station This situation was further compounded by the
fact that the Govermment decided not to award a rate increase at the time. Consequently,
expenditures were restricted to essential core functions only which impacted on the timely
hiring of staff for the DSM UniL

Achievement of Project Objectives
Residental Phase I and II programmes
The Residential Phase I and H energy-efficiency programs wee launched in March 1994
and Febluary 1996, under the umbrella theme " Power Saver Programmes - increasing
energy efficiency and building awareness." These programmes provided customers with
new ener  efficient compact fluorescent lamps, low flow showerheads, faucet and sink
aerators, refrigerator gasket replacement its and technical assistance in appliane operation
and maintance. The Phase I programme was a direct installtion deivery method and
Phase I was implemented through a direct contact delivery metbod At JPSCo commecial
offices over a three -year period.
Residential Phase 1 Programme
*  Provision of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and other energy efficient devices at
no cost to 100 participants. The group of 100 participants was selected via an Essay
Competition conducted for students between the ages of 10 and 18. Both winning
students and their teachers were selected
*  The objective was to establish thc technical criteria regarding equipment performance,
customer response and installation problems.
* Engineering estimates exceeded the original targets of 2kW and 18,000 kWh. The
programme resulted in reduced annual energy use of 58,021 kWh and peak coincident
demand reduction of 5.2 kW and saving of 835,965 gallons of water each year.
JPSCo's school based publicity strategy generated a geat deal of press coverage as
well as contact with students, teachers, and parents, concerning changes in apliance
usage patterns and purchasing habits. Pilot participants expressed a high level of
satisfaction with the products and services received.
Feedback from customers was used to enhance the design and development of the
Residential Phase 1 lProgranme.
Residential Phase 11 Power Saver Programme
The second phase of the residential powcr saver programme sought to increase the
saturation of high-efficiency electrical equipment, boost consumer demand, and the
commercial viability of the equipment in the residential market.
T1his programme involved the provision of energy efficiency measures to 30,000
customers at a discounted price. Implementation was carried out over a three-year period,
1996-98. Contact was made with customers directly at JPSCo commercial offices. The
4
-23-



*bemand Side Manayement
Demonstration Project
aim was to solicit participation from customers ftrough our customer service offices
island-wide
This was the first time that JPSCo had embarked on a project of this type. In particular,
the development of new accounting procedures and a computerized subsystem was
complex and encountered many delays. As a result, this impacted severely on the ability
of the DSM Unit to respond to customer needs in the early stages of the programme. For
instance, the subsystem required frequent modifications to the database tracking
programme by the IS department. This affected the implementation of the computer
subsystem in the Customer Service Offices through the non-programming of cash-
receipting machines. The DSM Unit was also constrained by this deficiency in that the
database tracking system was at first limited. The link to the mainframe, which facilitated
the approval of customers for the programme, was frequently out of service, resulting in
futher delays.
The distribution of equipmcnt to various JPSCo Customer Service Offices island-wide
was at first tardy and the DSM Unit had to exert additional coordination efforts in this
area.
At the end of December 31 the target of 30,000 participants were achieved.. The
programme's original savings targets of 1.0MW and 4,393 MWh/ year were substantially
exceeded With actual savings of 1.67MW and 5,437 MWh respectively.
Commercial Componejnts
The Commercial program components were launched in October 1996, after much
preparaton and the dissemination and review of programme plans. These programmes arc
more complex dtan the residential programmes because they are hinged on the Energy
Efficieny Building Code, which was only available for dissemination in January 1996.
The Jamaica Bureau of Standards held their first traiing course since the official printed
copies were available in the beginnin of October 1996. Prior to the Launch, the DSM Unit
was not only involved in developing the programs but also in recruiting and training
additional persons to cany out the implementation and direct contact marketing required to
realize healthy participation rates. Details on these programmes are presented below.
Large Commercial Retrofit Programme
This programme was a major facet of the commercial-scctor component of the Project
The objectives of this programme were:
establishing of technical potential for energy conservation in the large
commercial sector,
a demonstration of the means for achieving conservation in large existing
buildings;
5
-24-

DemonsfrOtion Project
establish the steps that will be taken - and the resources - required to foster
conservation in the large commercial sector cost effectively on a broad scale;
achieve a limited amount of energy conservation savings commensurate with
the program budget - peak shaving of 2.72 MW for the utility and an energy
savings of 11,907 MWh for the customers were targeted.
increase customer awareness of energy saving measures and reduce technical
nsk.
The programme design involved the provision of financial incentives for the
implementation of energy efficiency measures in 13 large commercial facilities (in the
R40 and R50 rate class).
An energy auditing consulting finn, DSE Consultants Inc., of Canada completed energy
audits of fifteen large facilities. The quality of the audits and recommendadons were of a
high standard. Implementation achievements were, however, severely curtailed by the
decline of the Jamaican cconomy and the concomitant scarcity of relatively cheap capital
The adoption of new energy efficient technologies was further limited by JPSCo's
corporate decision to withdraw offers of financing for large customers and minimize
financing subsidies to small customers. At the end of the programme on December31,
1999, six facilities had completed installations of energy efficiency retrofits resulting in
esimated energy savings of 3,703 MWh equivalent to cost savings of USS978,504.
Large Commercial New Construction Programme
This programme involved the provision of financial incentives for the implementation of
energy saving devices in seven (7) new large commercial facilities (in the R40 & RS0
rate class). The programme had several broad objectives which included:
*  Establishing the technical potential for conservation as well as the likely market
penetration in the large commercial new construction sector.
* Providing information and technical assistance to help builders, architects, engineers,
and developers early in the planning and design stages of new commercial buildings
to maximize the level of achievable savings.
The prograrmnme had a specific goal of reducing the peak utility demand by 3.07 MW and
conserving 9,459 MWh.
A listing of all new commercial buildings for construcion islandwide, approved by the
relevant Parish Councils, was developed in-house. From this listing 47 buildings met the
criterion of size( >1000m2). Letters were sent to these developers and owners informing
them about the New Construction Progranmme and inviting them to express interest in
participating. A mailing soliciting participation was also made to architects and engineers
6
-25-



*bemand Side Management
Demonstration Project
for buildings not captured in the above method. A total of 15 responses, were received
and these were invited to attend the October 25 launch.
However, given the depressed state of the economy, new construction activities were
practically non-existent in the commercial sector.
Small Commercial Direct Installation Program.
The Small Commercial Programme sought to give businesses a boost by offsetting
operating costs with the provision of financial and technical assistance to owners of
existing buildings under 1000 square metres in size- The small buildings (R20) tariff
class represents the most commercial customers in Jamaica. A major objective of the
programme was to determine the technical potential and market penetration for
conservation in the small commercial sector.
The programme was launched as a part of the Commercial 'Power Plus' Progranme on
October 25, 1996.Ten small commercial (R20) facilities were targeted for audits and
retrofitting. Under this programme, selected facilities received financing to purchase
state-of- the-art energy-efficiency measures at attractive interest rates. JPSCo also
provided fimding to reduce the payback period of the recommended measures to three
years, based on data gathered during the site audit. The customer will therefore pay only a
portion of the total cost.
The energy audits were conducted free of cost, and the energy efficiency measures
installed directly by a contractor provided by JPSCo. Under the programme ten facilities
were retrofitted with estimated energy savings of 111,268 kWh and demand savings of
41kW.
Technology Assessments
The DSM Demonstration Project features four Technology Assessment studies:
* Solar Water Heating
* Industrial-Sector Efficiency-Enhancement
* Refrigeration Efficiency-Enhancement
* Air Conditioning Efficiency-Enhancement
The basic purposes of these studies were: (1) to identify the segment-specific market
potential for one or more energy-efficiency technologies that could be promoted within
one or more applicable market segments, and (2) if the results of Step I are favorable, to
develop an appropriate Pilot Programme to promotc the technology(ies) on a limited
scale, to gain actual experience with customer reactions, acceptance barriers, etc. All
studies have been satisfactorily completed.

Solar Water Heater Commercial Programme
This programme involved the supply, installation and maintenance of solar water heating
systems in approximately 15 hotels, primarily to promote the use of solar energy and to
test the technical efficiency, customer acceptancc and cost-effectiveness of commercial
solar applications. Two contracts were awarded to undertake this activity, Solar
Dynamics (EC) Ltd. and (2) Energy Services and Products Ltd. Participants will repay
costs through electricity bill over three -year period in order to create a revolviag fund for
future solar activities.
The programme has been moderately successful with (13) thirteen facilities participating
in the progmmune, encompassing largc and small hotels as well as student
accommodation halls of residence at the University of the West Indies.
Solar Water Heating Residential Promramme
The Residential Solar Programme involved the installation of solar water heating systems
in 300 domestic households. Participating customers will repay the cost of each system
over a two-year period on electric bill., thcreby establishing a revolving fund for future
interventions in the solar water heating market.
As of November 30, 1999, the contrctor Isratech Jamaica Ltd., had installed aIl 200 solar
water-heafing units. The programme had been very successful.  Approval was
subsequently given by the World Bank to expand the programme to include another 100
insllatons.  These additional units havc also been installed. Plans are currently
underway to expand the programme through the revolving fund to be established, during
fiscal year 2000.
Photovoltaic Pilot Programme
This progamme represented a pioneering effort at using environmentally benign
technology to provide energy to isolated rural villages as a cost-effective complement to
traditional grid expansion. The programme involved the installation of photovoltaic
equipment (pancls, cables, batteries and inverter) in about forty homes in small remote
rural villages. Two villages were targeted, 28 homes in Middle Bonnett in St. Catherine
and 14 homes in Ballymony in St. Ann.
Implementation was undertaken by a local contractor Automatic Control Engineering Ltd.
and completed by December 31, 1999. A solar powered streetlight and lighting for the
local church was also installed at Middle Bonnet

Project Sustainabiity
A business plan has been prepared by the DSM Unit, which charts the way for the fature
sustainability of encrgy efficiency activities. It is proposed that the existing DSM Unit
will contnue to operate as a quasi energy services entity, fully owned by JPSCo. or by
some type of joint venture arrangement between JPSCo and other public/private sector
agencies. The principal performance indicators of the new DSM Unit will include inter
alia
1. Sale of 200,000 compact fluorescent lamps over a 3 year period.
2. Annual sale and maintenance of 1000 Domestic Solar Water Heaters over the next
three years.
3. Sale of 1000 photovoltaic systems to rural homes over a three year period.
4. Provision of energy auditing, training and performance contracting services to the
public and private sectors.
5. Installation and lcasc financing of solar water heating systems to 12 hotel/institutional
facilities.
A energy performance-contracting pilot is planned with assistance from a North
American Energy Services Company.
Bank Performance
The Bank demonstrated noteworthy flexibility in granting approvals for use of the GET
financing for activities, which were not previously earmarked under the original financing
plan. These included the residential and commercial solar water heating programmes,
the photovoltaic pilot programme -the first of its kind in the English speaking Caribbean-,
as well as assistance to corporate efforts to review the tariff structure and to reduce
technical and non-technical losses. The quality of bank supervisory staff was in general of
a very high standard and committed to the achievement of the goals of the programme as
evident in support given for the granting of two extensions to the project's original
closing date. On a broader level, efficiency gains in procurement administration would
have resulted from greater decentralisation at the local level, for approvals of a plethora
of relatively small expenditures.
Borrower Performance
Major delays in project implementation at the start of the project werc a reflection of a
confluence of unforeseen factors. Perhaps the most salient was the June 1994 explosion at
the Old Harbour Power Plant, aad the resultant cash flow deterioration. The latter
impacted on the ability of DSM Unit to recruit staff and to provide financial incentives to
commercial participants. Unfarniliarity with the modus operandi and procurement
proclivities of donor agencies was also another initial factor.
9
-28-



*Demand Side Management
Demonstration Project
On another level the DSM demonstration pilot contributed positively to the corporate
public image and customers perception of the local utility, given the less han buoyant
state of the economy.
Notwithstanding the initial delays the project gained substantial momentum in later years,
achieving several objectives and targets.
Overall Assessment of Project Results
The Demand Side Mnagnt Demonstration Project achieved one of its major
objectives, that of sensitising and generating public awareness of the benefits of energy
efficiency. The contribution of the Jamaica Environment Trust (JET). The National
Consumers League (NCL) and the Natural Resources Conservation Authority (NRCA) in
the dissemination of information cannot be overstated.
Another major achievement was the significant institutional capacity building resulting
from trinng on energy efficiency matters received by the staff of DSM Unit, other
project stakeholders and participating customers. DSM staff has already replicated several
of these training exposures to wider interest groups.
With reards to market transformation, the spill over benefits of the pilot programmes
have becn evidenced in substantial increased sales of energy efficient equipment by local
vendors particularly compact fluorescent lamps, electronic ballasts and Tg tubes.

Dear Mr. Richter:
Ena!a3PDemandSi,ka., 8mtnt Pilot F'roect
i have read with interest the draft tmplementation Completion Report and have found it to be
quite frank and reftective of the way in which tee project was n1pfemanted aa weU as the re3ults
optained. I agree with your flndings irn regard to s te fact that thw energy conservation
opporlunities presente{j to ffteen memnbers at the industrial sector were not fully exploited
because of a lacr of sutflcienty attractie tinding.
In regard to the claim by some large energy consumera that there is a lack of tax relief for energy
effciency investments, I have to art or remind you that Energy Saving Devices are zero-rated
tor purposes of the Geeneral Consumption Tax. The followingr is an extract from the Tax Guide
which has been published for generai information:

4. Solar cells designed to produce electricity from the sun.
5, Apparatus or machine'y designed to produce motive power, hest, light or efectrcity
through the utdization of renewable sources of energy, for example, sun, wind and
water.
In addition, the Customs Duties on these items have also been effectively reduced from 20% to
5%.
On the matter of the DSM Unit, the position of the Govemment in general and the MME in
particular is that the Unit shall continue to operate on a long-term basis. Bearing in mind the
apparent contradictions in having such a unit to be fully dependent on the power utility, the
arrangement will be for the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica to play a majority role in the future
operation of the Unit. The mechanism (Energy Service Company?) has not yet been finally
decided but you will be further advised.
The pilot-scale achievements of the Demand Side Management Project have been so convincing
in regard to the efficient use of energy, the containment oF energy costs at both the micro and
national level and in terms of alternative energy development that Jamaica must continue with its
implementation. The primary question is a matter of sufficiently attractive funding to hold the
interest of consumers, including the large users. Even if the Jamaica Public Service Company
returned to the DSM Unit some of the funds from the sale of CFLs, more financial support will be
required to establish an independent DSM entity firmly on its feet. I believe that the World Bank
can be of considerable assistance in this regard and I urge you to consider this,
Kindly accept my sincere apologies fbr such a delay in this response. I had hoped to be able to
be more specific in regard to institutional arrangements for the future of the DSM Unit.
Yours sincerely,
Godfrey W. Per  s
Permanent Sec tary.
