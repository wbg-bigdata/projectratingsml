Project Completion Report
SENEGAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
(Credit 336-SE)
PREFACE
Credit 336-SE for the Senegal Sites and Services Project for
$8 million equivalent was signed on September 29, 1972 and was made effective
on August 31, 1973. The Closing Date was extended several times and
ultimately set at December 31, 1981. The Credit was fully disbursed except
for a cancellation of US$450.000.
This report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared
by the Western Africa Region Urban Projects Department. The PCR was
prepared on the basis of the Government's Project Report on the Sites and
Services Project, on information contained in the Project Appraisal Report,
several reports produced by the Bureau d'Evaluation, a review of Bank files
including supervision and progress reports, and interviews and discussion
with Senegalese officials and Bank staff.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The
draft Project Completion Report was sent to the Borrower. The reply is
reproduced as Attachment.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.        This Project Conmpletion Report reviews the performance of the
Bank's first urban project according to the following criteria:
(a) Policy: How fully did the project meet its policy
objectives of (i) demonstrating the viability of the
sites and services and upgrading approach and
(ii) mobilizing private savings for house construction?
Did the project contribute to a change in shelter policy
as a result?
(b) Provision of Basic Services: Were affordable, acceptable
services delivered to the population as intended?
(c)  Institutions:  Did the project succeed in creating a
capacity to plan and execute sites and services projects
over the longer term?
(d) The Role of IDA: What has been the effect of IDA investment
on the mobilization of public and private funds? and
(e) Economic Justification: From an economic point of view,
was the project justified in retrospect?
2.        The experience of the Senegal Sites and Services Project is one
of innovation and experiment. When the project was designed in 1970-71,
Governments of developing countries were just beginning to recognize the
impact of rapid urbanization. Projections suggested that the accelerating
pace of urban growth was likely to continue, and that by the year 2000, would
dramatically transform even the most rural of countries.
3.        Throughout the 1.960's, Governments did little to prepare for the
pressures of this urbanization which had begun to strain services, institutions,
and financial resources. While urban policies were sweeping in their intentions,
urban practice  was, in cc'ntrast, quite limited.  The projects which were
financed were mostly expensive and heavily subsidized public housing schemes,
reaching only a minority of the population. In contrast, the phenomenon of
rural migration, which was bringing increasing waves of predominantly poor
people to the cities, was largely ignored.
4.        Senegal in the 1.960's was already one of the most urbanized countries
in Africa, with 23% of its residents living in urban areas. The drought of
1968-74 had a marked effect on the country's predominantly agricultural
economy, driving down rurELl incomes and accelerating rural- urban migration.
The overall annual urban growth rate went from 3.4% in 1960 to 4% by 1975.
Dakar increased its rate to about 6% per annum, well over double that of the
country as a whole.

5.        At the same time, Government sought major investments for the
modernization of Dakar. During 1965-1969, as a part of this policy,
Government provided about 120 ha of free sites and minimal services
on the outskirts of Dakar for low income households who were
forced to relocate from the city center to make way for new commercial and high
income housing development. This program, which was to be significantly
expanded during the 1969-73 Plan period, attracted the attention of the Bank.
6.        It was at this time that the Bank began receiving requests for
assistance in the development of efficient and equitable solutions to the
provision of urban setvices and the management of urban growth. Given the
scarcity of public funds, agricultural development priorities, and the
mushrooming urban sector, the Bank was especially interested in solutions which
provided low cost, affordable and acceptable services to the urban poor. With
the Bank's urban lending strategy just being defined, conditions in Senegal
seemed to suggest that the environment was appropriate for a demonstration project.
7.        The Bank agreed to support the Senegal effort and identified a
project which was appraised in 1971. It included the following components:
(1) 400 ha of sites and services including community facilities
in the capital of Dakar, providing 14,000 plots for 140,000
people and 60 ha of serviced sites in the secondary center
of Thias, providing 1,200 plots for 12,000 people;
(2) technical assistance to assist in planning for urban growth
over the longer term, in preparing detailed design, and in
project execution; and
(3) a study to determine criteria for upgrading of squatter
neighborhoods and funds for a pilot upgrading scheme.
The objectives of this project were to: (a) demonstrate an affordable and
acceptable alternative to conventional housing solutions, (b) mobilize private
savings for the production of shelter and (c) develop an institutional capacity
to plan and develop similar projects for other urban areas. Project costs at
appraisal were about US$12.9 million of which US$8 million was financed by an
IDA Credit. The Project was to be executed over a 5 year period by the
Direction des Parcelles Assainies (DPA) to be newly created under the project
within the Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere (OHLM), the middle-income
public housing agency. Approximately 100 ha were to be developed and settled
each year after start-up.
8.        Inadequate project preparation contributed to a difficult implementation.
This was due primarily to the novelty of the approach and Bank inexperience in
the sector. There were serious misunderstandings and misperceptions about
project objectives and disagreements over design standards (paras. 3.18 & 4.11).



- vii -
Fundamentally, the Government's prime focus was on the provision of subsidized
middle income housing, while the Bank aimed to address the majority of the
urban population which was overwhelmingly poor and had little or no access to
adequate shelter and basic services. The Bank erred in not recognizing more
clearly the extent of difference in views (para. 3.17).
9.        Inadequate project preparation was dramatically translated by
the steady backsliding on design standards. Because design standards were not
pinned down at appraisal, agreements were fragile at best. Throughout the
decade of the 1970's while real incomes were declining, Government hardly
budged on the standards issue, and indeed, imposed unrealistic expectations
concerning housing standards on project beneficiaries. Even when it was
demonstrated that funds were scarce and standards excessive, Government held
to its position and frequently pressed for changes upward.
10.       These factors, combined with a shortage of counterpart funds caused
by the economic stagnation of the 1970's, an overly large demonstration project,
and an inordinately cumbersome bureaucracy repeatedly frustrated project
execution. While projects in Senegal generally average a 2-3 year delay in
implementation, the Sites and Services IProject is four years behind schedule
and house construction is not yet completed. Many mid-course revisions to
project design aimed to correct errors and oversights and improve implementation.
The project was reduced from 400 ha to 300 ha in Dakar and from 60 ha to 40 ha
in Thies.  The number of community facilities was reduced in Dakar and
construction of community facilities was postponed in Thies. The pilot upgrading
scheme was eliminated and Lt was agreed to concentrate on completion of civil
works on the Dakar site by December 31, 1981, the third and final Closing Date.
However, even with these modifications, the major disagreements over design
standards and ensuing delays contributed to over a 100% increase in per ha
costs of the reduced project (para. 6.02).
11.       The rate of housea construction and occupancy fell far short of
appraisal estimates for four main reasons. Firstly, the estimated occupancy
and consolidation pace was extremely optimistic. Secondly, there was a delay
in completing physical worlks which delayed availability of water for house
construction. The third reason was the lack of finance for house construction
which was not included in the appraised project. A fourth reason was the
unrealistic expectations oi the beneficiaries concerning the type of houses they
would build. In 1977, the DPA developed a construction loan program, using
downpayments and monthly payments on plot purchases to encourage house
construction. As of December 31, 1981, this program had provided over
2,500 loans. Over 4,500 houses were under construction on 10,500 plots in Dakar;
2,000 houses were occupied and over 20,000 people were in residence. About 500
housing starts are undertaken each quarter and it is expected that the Dakar
site will be fully occupied by 1986. To further accelerate construction and
occupancy, Government lent US$2.5 million to OHLM under the Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL) of 1981. When this loan is fully disbursed, it will provide an
additional 1,400 construction loans, bringing the total number of loans for
house construction to 3,900. The remaining 8,320 beneficiaries (68%) are
financing construction out of their own savings, demonstrating that the project
has been successful in mobilizing private resources for house construction.



- viii -
12.       The many difficulties and delays led to a proposal to cancel the
project in 1976. The decision to continue was taken with considerable
reluctance, and indeed, today is a subject of intense discussion. In terms of
its regional implications, the decision appears sound. It was the Bank's first
project in the urban sector and the first in the Western Africa Region.
Several countries in the Region contemplating similar investments have studied
and borrowed from the Dakar experience. Overall, the experience of Bank-assisted
urban projects shows that the original aims in Senegal were overly ambitious
and required major reforms in policy and practice which could not be realistically
achieved in the space of one operation. Nevertheless, measurable gains have
been made in meeting overall project objectives (para. 8.06).
13.       Concerning policy objectives, the results are mixed.   Inroads have
been made in demonstrating that the provision of serviced sites is an acceptable
and affordable solution. The Dakar population has responded favorably, filing
over 40,000 requests for plots and continuing to pressure for new projects.
Mayors and Governors from cities and regions outside the capital have also
requested sites and services programs, and similar projects are being prepared
for bilateral funding. However, there is yet to be full acceptance of this
policy or its implications by the central ministry and other involved agencies.
Although standards for this project are lower than conventional housing schemes,
Government continues to advocate unrealistically high standards in isolation
of affordability considerations for shelter. Concerning the policy of upgrading,
no gains were made in demonstrating it as an alternative to slum removal. This
issue is today as politically sensitive as it was in the early 1970's.
14.       In the main, the project has contributed to a continuing policy
dialogue and a shift towards policy reform. The longer than anticipated
implementation period has permitted a continued Bank presence in the sector
during a period of broad ranging discussions on macroeconomic issues. These
circumstances have facilitated frequent discussions with Government officials
on this project as well as other issues facing the sector. One important result
is a Bank role in the preparation of a contrat-plan for OhLm, an agreement
between Government and OHLM which aims to define its policy objectives, and its
operations in relation to financial and institutional possibilities and
macroeconomic development priorities (paras. 5.11 - 5.13).
15.       As for the provision of affordable services, the project has delivered
over 12,000 plots to a population whose access to services was previously limited.
While standards are lower in this project than in OHLM's conventional schemes,
they could be lower, and must be lowered if these projects are to be replicable.
At appraisal, it was estimated that families between the 47th and 85th percentiles
would qualify for plots. Selection criteria were modified to enable more
(1) lower income families, (2) women and (3) informal sector households to
participate. Actual beneficiaries fall between the 20th and 65th percentiles
on the 1980 Dakar income distribution curve with the income ceiling at CFAF 55,000.
The delays, the decline in real income over the period, and the push towards
higher standards have cut into the private savings of those at the lower end of
the income range, making it more difficult for these households to build a house.
Cost recovery on plot charges is generally good compared to other projects,



- ix -
with a 22% default rate, bu.t is poor (88%) on the construction loan program
which was started in 1978 and which required additional procedures for
eligibility and disbursement. It has been demonstrated that the level of
recovery is not related to willingness or ability to pay but to cumbersome
procedures and an inadequate institutional framework, a lack of political will
to collect, ard effective sanctions (para. 6.19).
16.       Concerning institutional development, the establishment of a growing
capacity to implement and deliver sites and services projects has been most
encouraging, despite the many difficulties and recognized weaknesses in some
sections of the DPA. The DPA has developed new procedures to advertise the
project, interview and select beneficiaries and recover plot charges. It has
organized and supervised a construction loan program and mobilized beneficiaries
into effective action groups for settlement. Most importantly, it has delivered
over 12,000 serviced plots between 1976-1981 while its parent agency produced
just over 2,000 houses for the middle and higher income groups duting the same
period. It is currently preparing a sites and services project with German
assistance for 3,000 househtolds in the secondary town of Kaolack. The team
has had far less turnover i.n staff than either OHLM or its parent ministry,
a continuity which should enhance the development of similar projects in the
future, provided a suitable! policy framework is in place (paras. 5.07 - 5.10).
17.       In contrast to institutional achievements at the project unit level,
there have been few gains within the central ministry. Apart from disagreements
over design standards, the Directorate of Urbanism in the Ministry of Urban
Development contributed little towards project execution. The failure of the
Ministry to take a more active role contributed to the isolation of the DPA
and reinforced the widely held view that the DPA was "extra-governmental" and
had little, if any support. There were also no gains made in creating a capacity
to plan for the longer term management of urban growth in the central ministry,
although there is probably a greater appreciation of the issues involved than
there was at the beginning of the decade (paras. 5.02 & 5.03).
18.       IDA participation in the Senegal project has been instrumental in
mobilizing other resources to complement and augment its own participation.
In 1980-81, the Caisse Centrale assisted Government in funding its counterpart
obligations. In addition to the above-mentioned assistance provided by the
German Government, other bilateral agencies have expressed interest in financing
similar projects in other regions. By 1986, when the project is completed,
each IDA dollar invested in. the project will have generated about
US$1.80 of public funds.   In addition and of greater interest is that
each $ will generate about US$8.20 in private investment. The latter figure
underscores the viability of sites and services as an alternative to conventional
public shelter programs (involving 100% government finance) and answers some of
the criticisms concerning its acceptability by the Senegalese population.
19.       From an economic point of view, was the project justified in retrospect?
The ex-post evaluation supports the view that this project was a sound investment,
showing a recalculated rate of return of 19%. From a practical point of view,
the learning by doing experience which typifies this project has had significant



-x -
payoffs despite the many difficulties. The Government of Senegal has stated
that this project is a success, a viewpoint which leaves the door open to a
better dialogue in the future. For the World Bank, this project has made a
valuable contribution to a better understanding of the design process and has
provided important feedback on implementation. Having renewed the commitment
to execute this project in 1976, it is essential now to consolidate the gains
and strengthen the policy framework. Continuing discussions on the sector,
on preparation of the contrat-plan and on preparation of subsequent operations
should be the vehicles for achieving these objectives (paras. 7.01 & 7.06).



I. INTRODUCTION
A. Preface
1.01      The experience of the Senegal Sites and Services Project is one of
innovation and experiment. The approach embodied in this first Bank financed
project in the urban sector marked a radical departure from other urban projects
financed in the developing world during the 1960's. These projects focussed
on the construction of high cost subsidized houses for a minority of the population.
In marked contrast, the Senegal project aimed to provide basic, affordable
services to the predominantly lower income families moving to the cities in
accelerating numbers.
1.02      When the project was designed in 1970-71, few Governments had looked
beyond the early warning signs of urban sprawl to the longer run implications
of mushrooming urbanization. Fewer still acknowledged the financial burden
posed by the generous subsidies accorded to the urban sector in economies
overwhelmingly dependent on increased agricultural production. Development
policies of the Government of Senegal seemed to suggest that conditions were
ripe for change and that Senegal was an appropriate country for a first Bank
urban intervention.
B. Project Completion Report Evaluation Criteria
1.03      Although this pr:oject is officially closed, it is not yet complete.
Some civil works, house construction, and occupancy are still in progress.
This Report is therefore only an interim evaluation. Although the project was
intended to be a demonstration effort, it was in reality an ambitious experiment
to create a new town of 140,000 residents. Providing services, shelter and
settling the new residenti; have proven to be much more difficult and to take
considerably longer than originally expected. Neither the Government nor the
Bank foresaw the range of problems which were encountered during implementation,
essentially because neither had any experience in implementing sites and
services projects.
1.04      The project was officially closed on December 31, 1981 and disbursements
continued until March 31, 1982. As of the latter date, over 90% of the civil
works had been completed and all of the plots had been distributed on the
Dakar site. Over 20,000 people were in residence on 2,000 plots and over
4,500 plots were under construction. In the secondary center of Thies, about
84% of the civil works are completed. The outstanding civil works and community
facilities which were not completed under the Credit will be completed and
financed by Government. The required funding has been advanced to the project.
1.05      The length of intplementation has been a subject of considerable
discussion inside the Bank.. While projects in Senegal generally average 2-3 years
delay, this project is 4 years behind the original implementation schedule.
The costs and benefits of our 1976 decision to continue our association in the
face of seemingly insoluble difficulties have been argued for many years. This
PCR will show that the decision to continue was sound.



- 2 -
1.06      The experience of this project will be evaluated on the following
criteria:
(1)  Policy:  How fully did the project meet its policy
objectives of: (a) demonstrating the viability of the sites and
services and upgrading approaches and (b) mobilizing
private savings for house construction. Did the project
contribute to a change in Government shelter policy as
a result?
(2)  Provision of Basic Services:  Were affordable, acceptable
services delivered to the population as intended?
(3)  Institutions:  Did the project succeed in creating a
capacity to plan for and execute sites and services
projects over the longer term?
(4)   The Role of IDA:  What has been the effect of IDA
investment on the mobilization of public and private
funds? and
(5)   Economic Justification:  From an economic point of
view, was the project justified in retrospect?
C. Source of Information for this Report
1.07      This Project Completion Report is based on information contained in
the Project Appraisal Report (No. PS-lla of June 7, 1972), several reports
produced by the Bureau d'Evaluation, a review of Bank files including supervision
and progress reports, and interviews and discussion with Senegalese officials
and Bank staff. Although not required under the legal agreements, the Government
agreed to prepare a Project Completion Report as part of its own effort to
evaluate this project. A draft translation of Government's PCR is attached
as Annex 1. Government's report was prepared by a Committee headed by
Ousmane Blondin Diop (Secretary General/OHL11), with the assistance of the
Ministry of the Plan. It covers the initial phase of the project cycle up
to appraisal.

II. POLICY CONTEXT
A. Dakar
2.01      Since its founding in the early 19th century, Dakar has been a prime
magnet for growth and development in West Africa. Until 1960, it was the
colonial capital of French West Africa, and, at Independence, was the largest
urban agglomeration in francophone Africa. Economic prospects in other newly
independent countries somewhat dampened growth in Dakar during the 1960's, but,
by that time, Senegal was already one of Africa's most urbanized countries,
with 23% of its residents living in urban areas.
2.02      Heavily reliant on groundnuts and livestock, Senegal's economy began
to founder towards the end of the decade. The severe drought which struck in
1968 and lasted until 1974 caused agricultural production to slump. As rural
incomes plummeted, rural-urban migration accelerated, especially towards
Cap Vert, rapidly reversing the previous slowdown in urban growth. The urban
share of the total population went from 24% to 28% by 1975. The overall
annual urban growth went from 3.38% in 1960 to 4.03% by 1975. These trends
represented annual increases of over 100,000 persons, most of whom moved to
the Cap Vert Region. Dakar increased its rate to about 6% per annum, well over
double that of the country as a whole. By 1975, the Cap Vert Region, which
covered 1.3% of the national territory accounted for over 55% of GDP and 19%
of the total population. This renewed urban growth increased the demand for
shelter, services, and jobs.
2.03      Government began to seek a revitalized, regional role for the capital
during this period. Major public investments were programmed and a campaign
launched to promote investment from abroad, adding to the attraction of Dakar
for those facing declining incomes in the rural sector. Deteriorating conditions
in the rural areas and the drive to reassert Dakar's prominence led to a dramatic
influx of predominantly poor households in search of shelter, basic services
and job opportunities. By 1971, well over 60% of Dakar's population lived in
squatter neighborhoods, which for the most part, were located in central Dakar.
However, these areas were targeted as prime commercial and residential zones
by the Ecochard Master Plan which had been prepared for Dakar just prior to
Independence.
2.04      Government opted for a policy of relocation of the urban poor to the
city's outskirts to clear a path for the more expensive development projects
contemplated for the downtown area. However, this policy ran into an unforseen
obstacle: traditional external funding sources of subsidized housing schemes for
high income groups began to shift away from lending for housing in Africa. The
Government suddenly found itself faced with a considerable housing demand and
no sure sources of finance for its middle and upper class clientele, in addition
to the rapidly expanding demand of the lower income groups. House construction
by the Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere (OHLM), the middle income public
housing agency fell sharply, and continued to stagnate throughout the 1970's.
The Societe Immobiliere du Cap Vert (SICAP) the upper income housing authority,
also began to experience similar difficulties during this period.

B. Macroeconomic Environment during the 1970's
2.05      In Senegal, project execution, which is difficult across sectors
under the best of circumstances, was made more so by a decade of economic
stagnation. Between 1971-1981, real GDP increased by .8% per year, with an
annual fall in per capita income of almost 2%. A policy of public sector
expansion led briefly to higher growth rates in 1974-75. But, in 1977, terms
of trade turned against Senegal, and serious public finance problems began to
emerge. During 1978-1981, three crop failures triggered a sharp decline in GDP.
While groundnut exports were sharply curtailed, the price of imported oil
skyrocketed and high Eurodollar rates aggravated debt service problems. Despite
exceptional aid from multilateral and bilateral donors, Senegal could not meet
its obligations.
2.06      The Government instituted an economic stabilization program, which
included liquidating some important parapublic enterprises and increasing
taxes, tariffs for public services, and urban food prices to relieve the
cash shortage. This program weighed heavily on the poor whose incomes did not
keep pace with inflation. With increased expenditures for food and transport,
available income for housing investment declined and private savings for house
construction were strained.
2.07      This uncertain environment proved especially hostile to the
introduction of sweeping reforms in urban shelter policy. The sites and
services project was large for a demonstration project and required a major
turnaround in Government's approach to urban development. The absence of a
consensus on project objectives and of institutions and procedures for this
new style project created inevitable difficulties. Given the length and depth
of the country's economic decline, these difficulties are not surprising. What
is more surprising is the measurable progress made in reaching some of the
original objectives of the project.

III. PROJECT IDEINTIFICATION PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origins and Formulation of the Project
3.01      The origin of th:is project can be traced to an economic mission
which visited Senegal in Jtne 1969 and recommended that the Bank look into
Government policies for planning and controlling urban growth. The following
year, an urban reconnaissance mission from the Special Projects Department
expressed interest in the (Government's evolving sites and services approach
and recommended Bank support of its effort. Government's program was essentially
a relocation project which provided free sites and minimal services on the
outskirts of Dakar for households displaced from central zones.
3.02      The Government began implementation of its program during the
Second Four Year Plan (1965-1969), developing about 120 ha of minimally
serviced plots in Pikine, a large squatter neighborhood on Dakar's periphery.
The Third Four-Year Plan (]969-1973) was more ambitious, providing for 350 ha
in Dakar and 200 ha in selected regional centers. The Bank was encouraged by
discussions with Government: on this program which seemed to suggest a commitment
to a lower standard solution to shelter and services and appeared to reflect
emerging Bank policy. It also appeared that the issue of relocation could be
satisfactorily resolved. Tn Dakar, the program was to accommodate 100,000 of
the expected population increase over the Plan period, the remaining 40% to be
housed through existing public sector programs built by OHLM and SICAP and the
private sector. The mission decided to support this program.
3.03      In January, 1971, a memorandum was put to the Loan Committee on
Bank participation in urban development. Two major issues were raised:
(1) should the Bank finance housing? and (2) was Senegal the right place to
start? There appeared to be a consensus that the Bank be involved. The
benefits centered around enmployment generation, the mobilization of private
savings for shelter, and cost savings which would result from the efficient
planning and management of development in fast growing urban areas. Concern
was expressed about the extent of the housing demand in developing countries
and the risk that the Bank would be overwhelmed with requests for which it had
neither the funds nor the staff. It was generally agreed that the Bank should
not finance housing superstructures, but should limit itself to the provision
of basic infrastructure and services.
3.04      There was no clear position as to the choice of Dakar for an initial
operation. Discussions held with USAID, the UN, and other agencies and private
individuals revealed few project proposals of a similar nature which were further
advanced than that of Senegal. It was recommended that the Bank inform the
Government of Senegal that, in principle, it was willing to consider possible
financing of its program provided the project could be economically justified.
3.05      Following the decision of the Loan Committee, a preparation mission
visited Senegal in March, 1971, and identified a project providing for 400 ha
of sites and services in Dakar, and 60 ha each in Kaolack and Thies. The
objectives were to accommodate the population growth from 1969-1973 in Dakar
and to support Government's regional development strategy which aimed to siphon
off some of the population flows headed towards the Cap Vert.



- 6 -
3.06      The Bank spearheaded the preparation process, outlining the project
scope and the necessary urban studies and specifying in detail such items as
minimum service levels and plot layouts. Several consultants within the
Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development were to be responsible for
bringing the project to the appraisal stage. Parallel to the technical
preparation, the Bank was concerned about several issues which were directly
related to its emerging urbanization policy. These included: (i) justification
of an urban intervention in a predominantly agricultural country, (ii) definition
of the project population and (iii) land tenure mechanisms. These issues were
the subject of frequent and often heated discussions between Government and the
Bank.
3.07      An urban project in a predominantly agricultural environment.   The
course of Bank/Government dialqgue was heavily influenced by the fact that the
project was to be the Bank's first in the urban sector, and would be undertaken
in a country facing pressing problems in the rural areas, while, at the same
time, urban expenditures were growing rapidly. These policy contradictions
were of special concern to the Bank.
3.08      Considerable emphasis was therefore placed on the policy context
and pressures were put on Government to commit itself to Ca) eliminate subsidies
to SICAP frDm the start of the Fourth Plan, (b) reduce the number of "economic" 1/
units to be constructed by OHLM, (c) progressively eliminate subsidies on these
units over 10 years and (d) restrict subsidies on OHLM's "super economic" 2/
units to the cost of land and infrastructure. Government was also urged to
abandon its policy of slum eradication in favor of a slum upgrading program.
Government was reluctant to commit itself initially but after much discussion
and intense Bank pressure it finally agreed (see para. 3.15).
3.09      Definition of the Prolect Dopulation.   This issue centered around the
overwhelming needs of the majority of the urban population in contrast to
Government's programs which were exclusively directed to the middle and upper
income groups. Between 840 and 1,100 ha had been reserved for higher income
housing while only 300 ha were reserved for sites and services for the lower
income groups. The Bank pointed out that the area allocated to the higher
income groups was adequate to accommodate this growth for 15-20 years, while the
sites and services zones would be absorbed within a three year period. The
Government countered that the concentration of 140,000 lower income households
on one 400 ha site was socio-economically undesirable as well as a source of
potential political difficulties. The Bank did not disagree but insisted
nevertheless that the relative needs of the lower income groups were more pressing
and should receive priority attention in this project. Government eventually agreed to
1/ Conventional heavily subsidized OHLM units.
2/ Lower cost unit to be introduced as a result of project.



this solution, although as Government's PCR clearly points out, there were many
in Government who disagreed with the project formulation.
3.10      Land tenure arrangements.   In keeping with a 1964 Government law,
beneficiaries of plots in public housing schemes in Senegal were given
occupancy rights rather than freehold. However, the scant information on sites and
services led the Bank to conclude that ownership was a necessary incentive to private
investment in shelter.  The Bank consequently insisted that freehold be granted
on the site. The Government eventually agreed to this proposal although it
ran counter to both the legal context and the country's political philosophy.
B. Appraisal
3.11      During the months prior to appraisal, several missions commented on
the slow progress in preparation of preliminary engineering, It had been
agreed that technical staff in OHLM would complete the required work, but
little was done. A continuing question about the final location of the project
site further slowed preparation. It was, nevertheless, decided to appraise
the project in November-December 1971 with the team prepared to complete the
bulk of the work.
3.12      The project was appraised in November-December 1971 and included
the following components:
(1) 400 ha of sites and services in Dakar, providing 14,000 plots
for a total population of 140,000 people. Services included
roads, water supply, sewerage by septic tanks and pit latrines,
public toilets and community facilities such as schools health
clinics and community centers. Households were expected to
pay for plots at 7% per annum over 15 years. Individuals were
expected to finance house construction out of their own savings.
(2) 60 ha of sites and services similar to Dakar in the secondary
town of Thies, about 100 km from Dakar providing   1,200 plots
for 12,000 people.
(3) Technical assistance to assist OHLM for preparation of detailed
engineering, and in project execution and
(4) a study to determine criteria to be used for the upgrading
of the remaining slum neighborhoods in Dakar as well as funds
for a pilot upgrading scheme.
3.13      Total project costs were about US$12.9 million of which US$8 million
was to be financed by an IDA Credit to Government.   The project was to be
executed over a 5 year period by the Direction des Parcelles Assainies (DPA)
to be created within OHLM. Approximately 100 ha were to be developed and
settled each year after start-up. The first phase was to begin in mid-1973,
with infrastructure works completed by late 1973. Occupation of the 1st Tranche



- 8 -
(100 ha) was to begin in 1973 and be completed by 1974. Infrastructure for the
entire project was expected to be completed by late 1976 and all sites allocated
by end 1977.
3.14      Arrangements for implementation also specified that OLM was to be
reorganized into two separate Directorates--a Housing Directorate to execute
OHLM's conventional programs and a Sites and Services Directorate to carry out
the IDA project. The Direction de la Promotion Humaine (DPH), then in the
Ministry of Youth and Sports, was to manage and staff the Community Assistance
Section to be created within the Sites and Services Directorate. A Monitoring
Committee headed by the OHLM Director was to be established to assess progress.
Conditions of effectiveness required: changes in the building codes, assignment
of Senegalese counterpart staff to work with the expatriate technical assistance,
approval of legal statutes governing the establishment of the Association of
Plotholders and appointment of consultants for the criteria study.
3.15      Concerned about the project context and the macroeconomic climate in
Senegal, the Loan Committee attached a number of conditions to the approval
of the Credit. These were:
(1) a reduction in conventional subsidized public housing in
the Fourth Plan;
(2) postponment of further demolition of slum housing until
the conclusions of the criteria study were reviewed;and
(3) establishment of the DPA.
C. Assessment
3.16      Two elements characterize this period.   The first one is the inadequate
state of project preparation. The most significant example is the status of
preliminary engineering. In the first instance, there appears to have been
little or no association of Senegalese staff in its preparation either because
of the lack of qualified staff or the time constraints of the appraisal process.
Secondly, the issue of standards and its relation to affordability was not
clearly defined with Government. Thirdly, the question of power supply was
left untreated, and off-site requirements were only summarily addressed since
it was assumed that Senegal would finance 100% of the required networks. This
in itself was a serious error given the critical cash situation of the country
at that time. Finally, the failure to have a portion of detailed engineering
ready by Board presentation further weakened the already loose understanding
on standards and was a built-in source of delay. This oversight, however, can
be attributed to Bank inexperience, which was corrected in subsequent operations.
3.17      The conflicting and contradictory policy context is the second
factor and reflects the serious misunderstandings and misperceptions concerning
project objectives. Government policy and practice were oriented towards
modern commercial development and the support to middle and upper income
residents. Government's advocacy of a lower income solution was an expedient

means of freeing up valuable downtown properties. Given the extensive debates
which took place during the preparation phase, the failure to take note of the
early warning signs is puzzling. These diverging policy views persisted
throughout project execution and contributed significantly to the subsequent
delays and cost overruns.
3.18      The Bank had very farsighted objectives.   Given its emerging
philosophy, its insistence on a sound policy framework was not difficult to
understand. Yet the Bank sought major and pervasive policy changes which could
not be realistically accomplished in the space of one operation. The impact
of many of these changes was not fully understood by many in Government who
were associated only peripherally in the preparation process but who had major
roles to play in implementation. Other changes such as the introduction of
slum upgrading were simply unacceptable.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION
4.01      The implementation period can be divided into two distinct phases.
The first period covers 1972-1975--effectiveness and start-up. The second
phase spans 1976-1981 and covers the execution of civil works as well as
consolidation and occupancy. Table 4.1 compares the appraisal schedule with
actual implementation and is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.
The Credit was approved in June 1972. The implementation schedule at
appraisal was based on an immediate start-up of detailed design, i.e., once
approved in July 1972. However, because of insufficient IDA funds, Credit
signature was delayed until September 1972. Effectiveness was scheduled for
March 1, 1973, but was delayed until August 31, 1973 because of problems in
fulfilling conditions of effectiveness. The Appraisal Report called for the
consultants' arrival "soon after Credit approval". They arrived in April, 1973,
nearly a year behind schedule. Therefore, from the beginning there was a
delay of one year.
4.02     The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1978 and
to close six months later. Three extensions of the Closing Date to December 31,
1981 were required to complete civil works on the Dakar site, although by
December 31, 1981, the civil works were not fully completed. The primary reason
behind the extensions of the Closing Date was to bring the level of services
on the project site up to that required for habitation under minimal sanitary
conditions. This was thought to be a necessary incentive to spur occupancy
and consolidation.
A. Effectiveness and Start-up 1972-1975
4.03     Effectiveness was originally scheduled for March, 1973 but was
delayed until August, 1973 because of numerous complicated and ambitious
conditions of effectiveness. First, the Loan Committee conditions concerning
the sweeping policy changes required a Government side letter that was delaved.
Second, Government was required to pass three decrees: (i) establishing a new
building code, permitting the use of low-cost materials; (ii) granting legal
status to the sales contract to be used between OHLM and project beneficiaries;
and (iii) establishing the Association of Plotholders. Unanticipated administrative
and procedural complications blocked the process, and passage ultimately required
a "procedure d'urgence" in May-June, 1973 to pass all three.
4.04     Third, a reorganization of OHLM also proved more complex than
anticipated. Both the Government and the World Bank believed that the
reorganization could be carried out through a Government decree, while the
legal advisor to the President ruled that such a reorganization could only
be accomplished through passage of a law by the Assemblee Nationale.
Because of intervening elections, the law was not approved until June 12, 1973.

4.05     The reorganization proposal was also flawed.   A Community Assistance
Section (SAC) was to be created within OHLM for community development
activities under the project. The unit was to be staffed by personnel from
the Direction de la Promotion Humaine (DPH), a department of the Ministry of
Youth and Sports under the 1972 Government. DPH staff were to be permanently
assigned to OHLM, but were to continue to work under the administrative control
of their own ministry. This arrangement proved unworkable and was discarded,
but not Until valuable time was lost and morale seriously undermined.
4.06     Fourth, recruitment of qualified Senegalese counterparts took much
longer than anticipated, primarily because trained expertise was scarce in
the country and public sector salaries were unattractive. OHLM experienced
years of difficulty in assembling a staff. A Project Director was not on
board until 1977; a qualified engineer did not join until 1980. Several
Senegalese were trained on the job.
4.07     Finally, the condition requiring that OHLM hire external auditors also
met unanticipated obstacles. Government had just established the Commission de
Verification des Comptes et de Contr^le des Etablissements Publics to review
the financial performance of public enterprises. The Commission maintained
that it would serve as the qualified external auditor for all World Bank
assisted project accounts. After some delay, the World Bank's Legal Department
ruled that this was in violation of the Bank's own Articles of Agreement.
In May 1973, OHLM recruited an outside firm to audit the accounts.
4.08     Experience in subsequent projects has shown that too many conditions
of effectiveness unnecessarily delay implementation, which was the case in
Senegal. While the problems caused by the elections and intervening
administrative reforms could not have been foreseen at appraisal, the effects
of the pervasive changes in housing policy and practice could have been more
evident. Several of the other conditions such as approval of the sales
contract, the building code and the Association of Plotholders could have been
made conditions of disbursement. The time required for introduction and
acceptance of fundamental changes in policy and practice were seriously
underestimated, causing difficulties and tension between Government and the Bank
which lasted for years.
B. Detailed Design and Construction: 1975-1981
4.09     The implementation schedule forecast at appraisal is compared to the
actual implementation in Charts 29328 and 29329. Table 4.1 details the status
of project components as of June 30, 1982. The table shows that project
execution is four years behind the implementation period forecast at appraisal.
Design of the Dakar sites started seven months later than scheduled, and
required nine months to complete rather than the six which were forecast.
The procurement period l/ was estimated at six months at appraisal for each
Tranche (100 ha) in Dakar, but actually required 18 months for the 1st and
3rd Tranches and 21 months for the 2nd Tranche. At appraisal it was estimated
that civil works on each Tranche would require six months for completion.
1/ Time between completion of detailed design and start-up of construction.



- 13 -
Actually, 4 1/2 years were required for the first Tranche, six years for the
second Tranche and 5 1/2 years for the third Tranche, which was completed
5 3/4 years later than estimated. For Thias, detailed design began 5 1/2 years
later than forecast, and required 21 months rather than the three months
forecast at appraisal. The procurement period did not experience delays.
Civil works took 21 months to complete rather than the three months estimated
at appraisal.
4.10     Delays in overall project execution were due to inadequate preparation
and the lack of firm Government support for project objectives. Delays in
completing detailed design. were due to some degree to disagreements over design
standards. Delays in procurement and construction were due to: (a) cumbersome
bureaucratic procedures and (b) counterpart funding constraints.
4.11     Disagreements over design standards - The failure to pin down
agreements on standards during project appraisal was a fundamental error.
Preliminary design had been prepared for a sample of 130 ha, a portion of
which was not on the present site because of continuing disagreements over
final site boundaries. Preliminary design consisted primarily of an income
survey, alternative design options, and only very preliminary costs. In
addition, the appraisal report did not provide the level of detail which was
subsequently provided in other projects such as electricity standards. As a
result, erosion of agreemeats was almost immediate. The backsliding on
standards was further aggravated by frequent staff changes at the head of
OHLM and in the parent Ministry, which required with each change a re-examination
of the issue.
4.12     The length of time required to approve the site development plan is
characteristic. It was fi:rst rejected in October, 1973 because it interfered
with plans for zones contiguous to the project sites. Subsequently, the
Minister of Public Works announced his intention to construct a road which
required modifications of the third and fourth tranches. Three changes in
architects in OHLM during :L973-1974 led to additional modifications. After
the plan was approved in late 1974 and some contracts had been awarded, a new
Minister objected to the lower income focus, raising renewed concerns about
the project location, plot size, and the number of private water and sewerage
connections. Disagreements on standards also occured during actual physical
implementation. In the case of the low voltage network on the second and
third tranches, for example, works started in March 1975 and were completed
in April 1980. SENELEC dic not provide the contractor with detailed designs
on schedule, because of interminable discussions on the standards issue.
4.13     Cumbersome Bureaucratic Procedures - Seven steps are required
between bid invitation and award.    A recent review of the experience of
contracts awarded under this project showed that a minimum of seven months
occurred between the call for bids and award, of which about five months are
required for final approval of the contract. Many of the rejections which
occurred were unnecessary--typographical errors, inadequate number of copies,
etc., the cumulative effect of which was costly to execution. Some typical



- 14 -
delays were: (1) 10 months for sewerage and water supply on the first and
second tranches; and (ii) 14 months for the road network and water supply on
the third tranche.
4.14     Slow payments to contractors caused delays culminating in bankruptcy
in one case. About 80% of the contractors were Senegalese SSE's V/, many of
whom experienced difficulties in mobilizing for and launching of works on
schedule because of a tight cash position and limited accessibility to commercial
banks for credit. Payments to contractors for parastatal operations are made
directly by the Ministry of Finance. Before the Minister signs off on a contract,
several departments within the Ministry review the payment request, a process
which is generally long. After considerable discussion, the Prime Minister
made an exception and granted a posteriori control to OHLM in 1975. In theory,
this procedure should have permitted the OHLM Director to make direct payments
to contractors, accelerating payments somewhat when counterparts funds were
available. However, OHLM was never given full financial autonomy for purposes
of the project. As a consequence, it was able to make payments only after going
through an abbreviated, but nevertheless lengthy approval process. As a result,
payments were not accelerated to the extent required to achieve the desired
improvements in implementation.
4.15     The counterpart funding constraint was perhaps the most significant
cause of delay. Government requires that total amount of counterpart funds
for any one contract be available before the contractor is notified to begin
construction. The problem was that there were insufficient funds to permit
contract approval. Discontinuities of counterpart funding caused works to
slow down and, in 1980 and 1981, caused a total work stoppage. The counterpart
funding position progressively worsened during the decade as economic
conditions deteriorated. In 1980-1981, the Caisse Centrale assisted
Government in meeting its counterpart funding obligations, thereby permitting
an extension of the Closing Date to December 31, 1981.
4.16     Mid-course corrections.   While there were 12 supervision missions
between 1972-1974, few focussed on the above described constraints or their
implications on project execution. Eight of these missions focussed
exclusively on conditions of effectiveness and primary obstacles to start-up.
bcephysical implementation started, supervision missions regularly reported
on the delays, but underestimated the severity of the problems, and/or the
time required to findand implement appropriate solutions.
4.17     Once the problems were correctly identified, there were intense
efforts on the part of both Government and the Bank to pursue mid-course
adjustments to project design. All of the adjustments both to the physical
and non physical aspects aimed to improve project performance and reach
project objectives.  However, several modifications which revised standards
upward compromised the Bank's original objectives and were agreed in order to
1/ Small scale enterprise.



- 15 -
move the project forward. These modifications remain a subject of discussion
and controversy today. There are those who maintain that given the resistance
to the original project objiectives, the Bank should have withdrawn from the
project in the mid-1970's. Others support the view that there were errors
and misperceptions on both sides, many of which were understandable in a first
operation. Overall, project modifications contributed to fulfilling many of
the project objectives as well as vastly improving the Bank's understanding of
how these operations actually work in the field.
4.18     Revisions to Accommodate Higher Standards.   When examining the evolution
of standards, it is worthwhLile to note that this project did not have a poverty
focus as it is understood today. The appraisal report states clearly that
standards were selected to "provide a level of services higher than that
obtained in existing low and very low standard residential districts, while
keeping costs low enough tco enable a large section of lower income families
to pay for and improve upon the serviced sites". Nevertheless, the upward
shift in standards went beyond this interpretation and was the result of the
incomplete preliminary design at appraisal. Sewerage and power are examples.
During the 1973-1974 review of the development plan, Government raised
objections to the appraisea. sewerage solution of pit latrines and septic
tanks, maintaining that this system was inappropriate for a city of 140,000
inhabitants. The Bank subsequently agreed to the principle of a waterborne
sewerage system. Standards shifted dramatically during implementation from
an appraised solution which represented 4.4% of project costs to a solution
which today represents about 18% of final project costs in 1982 CFAF.
4.19     In the case of power, quantities were not estimated at appraisal.
It was assumed that power would be supplied from the existing distribution
lines serving the area and that Government would finance the connections.
However, there was no nearby network adequate to service 400 ha. In this
case, there were not even indicative design guidelines and the power company
applied its conventional and costly standards. The new project unit had no
recourse to the practices of the longer established and politically powerful
agency.
4.20     Revisions to Reduce Project Scope and Size.   By 1975 it became
evident that execution was in serious trouble. Up to that point, disagreements
over standards overshadowed the major task of coordinating the servicing of
400 ha, which was the responsibility of an institution which barely existed.
A joint Programs-Projects mission went to Senegal in mid-1975 to discuss
this with Government and recommended that the project be trimmed, a proposal
which met with stiff Government resistance. It was subsequently decided to
reduce the Bank's disbursement percentage to 45% and to accelerate execution
through streamlined local administrative procedures. The reduction in the
disbursement percentage was done to preserve Bank leverage in the execution
of all the components.
4.21     Clearly, the Bank should have taken a firmer position regarding the
reduction of project size since conditions did not markedly improve.



- 16 -
By 1976, overruns were projected over 36% above appraisal estimates (see
Tables 4.2a and 4.2b). A 1976 mission agreed with Government to reduce the
project from 400 ha to 300 ha in Dakar and from 60 ha to 40 ha in Thies.
The disbursement percentage was raised to its original 67%, a change which
somewhat relieved an already crushing burden on counterpart financing.
The Bank also proposed the elimination of the Thies component, but
Government flatly refused.
4.22      The large size of the project compounded the other obstacles to
execution which have been discussed above. It was therefore appropriate
to propose the elimination of Thies, which required considerable time and
travel. In terms of institutional development objectives, the decision to
execute the Thies component had significant payoffs. The component was
entirely designed and executed by the Senegalese staff which took over in
1977 at the departure of the consultants. Once started, it experienced a
minimum number of difficulties. It is viewed today as a "Senegalese"
component and, as such, has contributed significantly to the credibility of
the DPA.
4.23      In 1977, the upgrading component was eliminated.   A criteria study
to identify appropriate areas for upgrading was completed in 1974 but
languished in the Ministry for over a year. Its principal recommendations
were consistent with cost effective upgrading solutions, recommending
neighborhoods which were central, close to employment and community
facilities and accessible to off-site infrastructure. Application of the
criteria resulted in a choice which was politically unacceptable.
Nevertheless, a proposal was prepared for Fass Paillotte, a downtown Dakar
neighborhood. The proposal was subsequently dropped when it was recognized
that Government's position was firmly entrenched.
4.24      The loss of Fass Paillotte was not unexpected.   The scheme was
premature in a context with little sympathy for the approach and a proven
record of slum demolition which continued throughout project execution,
notwithstanding Government-Bank agreements to the contrary. A less
controversial location on the city's periphery in Pikine might have been
more acceptable and would have provided the opportunity to demonstrate the
principles involved in a less volatile environment.
C. Progress on Non-Physical Program
4.25      Execution of the non-physical aspects, such as the advertising of
the project, development of selection criteria and the organization of the
Association of Plotholders, up to consolidation and occupancy did not
experience any delays. During appraisal considerable importance was attached
to the participation of the population and start-up was immediate.
4.26      Plot Allocation.  The elaborate focus at appraisal on the community
development resulted in a comprehensive program. The consultants developed
complicated interviewing, selection and allocation procedures, requiring a
minimum of 25 staff to process applications and some 16 steps for the



- 17 -
applicant. During implementation, these procedures were simplified and the
number of required documents reduced, but the system remains unnecessarily
cumbersome and long.
4.27      Briefing of Comnunities.   This component was exceptional in its
detail and proved to be very successful. Well before civil works began, the
Community Assistance Section organized prospective beneficiaries into groups,
or associations, most frequently by profession or trade. Regular meetings
were held almost immediately throughout the Dakar neighborhoods to publicize
the project and to organize group members to save for a downpayment on a plot.
By 1979, over 25,000 peopLe belonged to these groups. Today, it is not
unusual to find applicants who regularly saved 1,500 to 3,000 CFAF monthly for
over five years in anticipation of purchasing a plot. Because of the
numbers of disappointed applicants, ancd the problems posed by tying up
family savings, the system was changed in Thies where people are organized
into associations but do not begin to save until they are selected for a plot.
4.28      The organization of plotholders evolved quickly into a cohesive
community structure. All of the groups are organized into one large
association which has its own elected board of directors. The board consists
primarily of neighborhoods elders and other community leaders. The Government
effectively used this tightly knit community structure for its own ends,
disseminating information on its interpretation of project objectives,
lobbying for higher standards and even distributing "appropriate" house
designs. This was not one sided however. The association has successfully
lobbied for improvements, such as better transport links to Dakar, more
water taps, and schools. It has also made loans to the health dispensary
for the purchase of medic:Lnes and other equipment when the Ministry of
Health was unable to furn:Lsh the material and has assisted the women in the
organization and improvement of the market areas.
4.29      Monitoring and Evaluation.   Senegal was one of the countries
selected by the Bank and :[DRC for in-depth monitoring beginning in 1976.
However, given the slow progress, there was little to analyze in terms of
implementation results. By 1978, it was decided that the unit would focus
on obstacles to occupation. The Bank viewed the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit as being independent of the DPA and reporting directly to Washington.
This framework created an atmosphere of suspicion from which the Unit never
recovered. The Senegalese viewed it as a police arm of the Bank and
generally ignored its output. The unit produced over 20 evaluation reports
as well as a series of monitoring reports with little support from the
Senegalese.  Some useful .Lnformation did, however, result.  At the close
of the Monitoring and Evaluation Project, the Unit was incorporated into
the DPA, but it is highly unlikely that it will survive.
D. Occupancy and Consolidation
4.30      Key indicators are shown in Table 4.3.   The delay in occupancy and
consolidation became the focus of intense concern beginning in June 1978.



- 18 -
Apart from unrealistic appraisal forecasts, the initial and most important
problem was the availability of water for construction which was not
resolved until mid-1976. It was hoped that occupation and consolidation
would be rapid thereafter, but this was not the case. It was expected at
appraisal that allottees would transport their baraques or wooden shacks to
the site as shelter while constructing more permanent dwellings. However,
the monitoring and evaluation showed that 67% of the allottees were rentors
and 23% were living with friends or relatives and paying no rent at all.
These households did not have shacks to transport. Over 60% of these
allottees already lived in houses built with permanent materials and were
unwilling to invest in a wooden shack. Other causes for the delays are
described below:
4.31      Unrealistic expectations:   From the beginning, applicants believed
that their participation in the project would bring them a standard of
housing far superior to that which they were enjoying at the time. A survey
conducted by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in 1976 revealed that project
candidates believed that they would be able to build a four or five room
house on the site, and that this would be made possible by a Government loan
for the purchase of materials. OHLM did little to discourage this
misconception. To the contrary, OHLM mounted a vigourous campaign for high
standard construction, distributing, as early as 1975, standard house plans
with 4-7 rooms which had been not until 1978 that the Bank and the Government
agreed on a two room unit, but by that time allottees' aspirations were
fairly well fixed. As the key indicators show, the two room unit has had
only moderate success (38% of total construction).
4.32      Financial Constraints:   At appraisal, it was assumed that the
Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS) would provide small
loans to beneficiaries where needed. BNDS, however, was not interested in
making loans, particularly to informal sector beneficiaries. Construction
was also hindered by shortages and rapid increases in the price of building
materials, particularly cement. In 1977, there was a scarcity of cement
throughout Senegal, and in 1978 the price had risen 70%. Rising costs coupled
with the high expectations of plot owners resulted in the stoppage of
construction on many plots.
4.33      By September 1978, only 20 households had occupied their plots.
Another 20 settled in between September and December, 1978. By November, 1979,
about 300 households had settled on the site. Financial constraints were
cited as the major obstacles. Those who had moved to the site faced
additional problems, however, such as lack of transport to their jobs in
central Dakar, no markets or schools, no electricity nor physical security.
4.34      Actions to improve occupancy and consolidation.   In May, 1978, the
DPA prepared an Action Plan to focus attention on priority problems
hindering occupation and consolidation. It was agreed upon with a
supervision mission in May, 1978 and was slightly revised in September 1978
to contain the following:



- 1L9 -
(1)  the establiLshment of a trial period up to May 1979, for
accelerating consolidation and occupancy in Dakar and a
hold on al:L civil works on the Thies site, pending the
results of the Action Plan;
(2)  BNDS -/ and the DPA agreed to finance a loan program, with
the former serving public sector employees and the latter
serving the private and informal sector, using downpayments
and monthly payments from beneficiaries;
(3) the DPA agreed to publicize the freedom of choice of project
beneficiar:ies to construct dwellings of their own design
and standards. The loan ceiling was established at
CFAF 275,000;
(4)  the DPA was to be reorganized to eliminate administrative
bottlenecks: (a) the accounting section was to be strengthened
to administ:er the loan program; (b) an employment section was
established and (c) the technical section was to be
strengthened to improve house construction;
(5)  administrative procedures from allocation to plot occupation
were simplLfied, and
(6) sites were to be sold, contracts signed, and loans granted
at a rate of 300 per month after the DPA reorganization.
4.35      The Bank fixed ihe occupancy targets in the initial Action Plan at
650 households by September 30, 1978, and 1,500 by December 31, 1978.
These efforts to legislate occupation and consolidation underestimated
the difficulties and were largely unsuccessful. The focus of the Action
Plan did result in some imnmediate progress in completion of physical works
and led to an increased awareness on the part of Government of the problem.
4.36      From 1978 through the Closing Date, steady pressure was applied
to accelerate the pace of occupancy through continued adjustments to the
Action Plan. The results were mixed. Prominent among the Bank's efforts
was promotion of the two :coom unit. Many claim that the failure to sell the
two room unit was due to ,:he absence of a surrounding wall, which the
Senegalese consider to be essential for privacy in a polygamous context.
Others criticized the absence of sanitary facilities. Most observers attribute
the difficulties to the failure to use the Association of Plotholders to
publicize the program.
4.37      There is also some evidence to suggest that the Bank was
unreasonable in its insis-cence on a rapid timetable for settlement of
the site. Indications from new town development in France as well as
the observed settlement rate in a sites and services project in Abidjan
suggest that the pattern In Dakar is not overly discouraging. In the
case of Dakar,    about 500 housing starts are now occurring each quarter,
the equivalent about 2,00') houses or 20,000 people per year. This is
a reasonable pace of deveLopment for a new town.
1/ The BNDS agreed, but rever participated to the extent expected.

V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The development of an institutional capacity to plan and execute
sites and services projects in the future was a main project objective. At
the national level, it was intended to build up a capacity to formulate urban
policy and establish investment priorities. At the parastatal level, the
intent was to develop an executing capacity. Principal responsibility for this
task was vested in the OHLM through the DPA, which was created specifically for
this purpose.
A. Central Government Agencies
5.02      At appraisal, the then Ministry of Public Works was the central
government ministry with overall responsibility for the projects. In 1978,
after a ministerial reorganization, the Ministry of Urbanism, Housing, and the
Environment assumed overall responsibility. The Directorate of Urban Planning
was the principal unit within the Ministry responsible for formulating
national housing policy and related investment programs. It retains the same
function today.
5.03      It was agreed at appraisal that a UNDP-financed expert in housing
policy would be assigned to the Directorate for a two year period to assist
in the reorientation of urban policy and investment programming. The expert
was never hired, due probably to the wide gap in policy positions between
Government and the Bank. The Ministry's inputs into project execution were
negligible for the duration of project execution, apart from disagreements
over the type of houses to be constructed on the project site and a steadfast
refusal to consider appropriately lower standards. The failure of the Ministry
to take a more participatory role in the project and in the resolution of its
difficulties contributed to the isolation of the project unit. It also
reinforced the widely held perception that the project unit was "extra-governmental"
and had no political support.
B. The Office des Habitations a Loyer Modere (OHLM)
5.04      At appraisal, OHLM was the principal Government agency for the
construction of urban and rural housing for wage earners coming from the upper
and middle income population groups. It sold and rented subsidized units
utilizing Government grants obtained from a housing tax on all salaries.
From 1960 through 1969, the end of the Second Four-Year Plan period, OHLM
had built 3,760 units, 1,900 of which were in Dakar.
5.05      For the Third Four-Year Plan, it had a goal of 4,500 units.   As
part of the shift in policy emphasis from the upper andcmiddle income groups
to the lower income groups, it was agreed at appraisal that OHLM would reorganize
into two directorates, one 3or the normal OHLM operations and one for sites
and services. It was also agreed that standards would be reduced, by introducing



- 28 -
a "supereconomic unit", costing roughly half the US$5,100 equivalent per
conventional unit of the program under execution. To assist in this change,
a UNDP-financed expert in building materials and low-cost construction techniques
was to be brought into OHLM. The expert was never hired.
5.06      Few planned targets were met.   Nearly half of the forecast OHLM
production was to be "supereconomic" units of which over 80% were to be
built in Dakar. Over 3,400 units were built during the Plan period of which
over 90% were built in Cap Vert. Unit costs did not fall appreciably nor
was thete any real attemptto achieve the standards agreed upon during
negDtiations. Finally, there was no reduction in infrastructure subsidies.
C. The Direction des Parcelles Assainies (DPA)
5.07      Despite the well documented difficulties of the project unit, the
evolution of the DPA is probably the most important project achievement. The
DPA was created within OHLM for the purpose of project execution. This
arrangement was agreed upon after careful consideration and rejection of the
alternative proposal which consisted of creating a unit within the Ministry.
The potential difficulties of introducing a unit within OHLM to implement a
low-cost housing scheme were recognized at appraisal, but the appraisal team
correctly concluded that fewer difficulties were involved in attempting to
build a unit within an existing agency.
5.08      According to agreements at appraisal, the Sites and Services
Directorate was to be of equal rank with a Housing Directorate which was to
continue conventional OHLM operations and would use the existing divisions
for the technical and financial aspects. A Community Assistance Section was
to be created for the community development activities which would be new to
OHLM. The Sites and Services Directorate was to have five counterpart staff
and a team of technical assistants. The creation of two distinct but equal
directorates was to contribute to a more coherent housing program, but this
was not the case.
5.09      Firstly, the arrangement was never implemented.   A Sites and Services
Directorate was created within OHLM but was not given the autonomy originally
foreseen. Secondly, Government experienced major difficulties in hiring
counterpart staff. A Project Director was not in place until late 1976.
The unit was not provided with a separate budget and its operations and funds
were incorporated into the OHLM Budget. It was quickly absorbed by an agency
which, itself was short staffed, had severe budgetary problems, and a flagging
record of production. Frequent changes at the head of OHLM caused added setbacks,
each new Director General calling into question the objectives of the project
and, in particular the standards used. These circumstances progressively
weakened the status of the project unit and eroded the institutional framework
envisioned at appraisal. This institutional erosion quite naturally reinforced
the political resistance to the proposed policy changes which together impeded
progress.

5.10      At the same time, the extra-governmental" perception of the DPA
and the resultant neglect provided an opportunity for it to flourish and
experiment. Besides the servicing of over 12,000 plots, the DPA developed
an innovative and effective approach to community organization. It organized
potential plotnolders intc associations which today have over 30,000 members,
many of whom saved from CEAF 1,200 - 3,500 monthly for as long as four years
for down payments on plots. It developed a program to advertise the project,
interview applicants, and to select beneficiaries. When it became apparent
that beneficiaries were not building because of a lack of funds, the DPA
developed a construction loan program which has made over 2,500 loans using
beneficiary down payments and repayments. It has overseen construction of over
2,000 units, organizing on-site, small scale contractors for the job. In six
years, the DPA has outstripped the production of its parent agency, producing
2,000 sites per annum and providing housing for an eventual population of 140,000.
From an inexperienced group of 5 it has grown to a team of 90 Senegalese which
has performed quite satisfactorily, given the less than supportive environment.
D. Assessment
5.11      The execution of this project has had little substantive effect on
policy formulation at the central ministry level, despite the commitment to
a substantial sites and services program in the Sixth Plan. As far as overall
institutional gains are concerned, the project has not had a major effect on
the reorientation of OHLM's programs and policies, although there is a greater
awareness of the major issues. Changes did occur in the focus and orientation
of OHLM over the project period, but they were the result of depressed economic
conditions rather than the result of enlightened policy making. OHLM built
fewer units over the period because financing was not available to permit
completion of the program. OHLM is only an executing agency; it is the Ministry
of Urban Development which makes urban policy. In the absence of a shift in
policy at the ministerial Level, OHLM can only continue its present programs.
5.12      At the same time, the poor performance of 01T12I compared to the DPA
production of serviced sites has inevitably influenced the perception of OHLM's
role and, this, in itself, could well provoke a reexamination of OHLM's mandate.
Indeed, a review is underway as part of the contrat-plan process. Secondly,
the project has created a capacity to prepare, implement, and deliver alternative
solutions to conventional public sector programs in the country. Despite weaknesses
in the technical and financial sections of the DPA, a team of capable Senegalese
is in a position to replicate the sites and services concept, and indeed has
done so in Thies, which the DPA designed and implemented without technical
assistance. It is also preparing a second sites and services project with KFW
assistance in Kaolack.
5.13      If support for the sites and services project is less certain within
the Ministry of Urban Development, the visible achievements on the site have
convinced officials in other departments and ministries that the sites and
services concept is a real and acceptable alternative to past housing projects--or



- 30 -
to no projects whatsoever. Furthermore, the population at all income levels
has expressed continued interest in the project and is pressing for the accelerated
production of serviced sites. These trends suggest that if policy changes do
not come from within the Ministry, they could be imposed on it from without.

VI.  COSTS, DISBURSEMENTS, AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Costs
6.01      Table 6.1 provides a summary of project costs as estimated at
appraisal and final costs as of June 30, 1982. (Tables 4.2a and 4.2b provide
detailed costs.) In terms of US$ equivalents, final costs exceed appraisal
estimates by 10%. The figure US$14.3 million represents the total cost of the
project as modified in 1976. These modifications were:
(a) reduction in Dakar from 400 ha to 300 ha;
(b) reduction in Tbies from 60 ha to 40 ha;
(c) elimination of all community facilities in Thies and all
but four schools and one health clinic in Dakar; and
(d) elimination of plot upgrading.
6.02      The delays, upward shift in standards, and inflation over the period
had a major effect on the actual costs of the reduced project. At appraisal
price escalation was estimated at 10% over the entire implementation period.
According to the official price-index (Table 6.2), price escalation averaged
10% per year between 1972 and 1981 for construction materials, fuel and wages.
Cement prices quadrupled. The per ha cost at appraisal (460 ha) was an
estimated US$20,876.   The actual cost per ha is US$42,020, or over a 100% increase.
6.03      Abnormal delays due to frequent changes at the head of OHLM and the
Ministry contributed to the significant overruns. These changes resulted in
backsliding on design standards, and in particular, on power and sewerage,
which were especially costly. In the case of power, electricity costs at
appraisal amounted to US$2,000/ha. As of June 30, 1982, the cost was US$7,000/ha.
Sewerage costs were estimated at US$2,400 per ha at appraisal. The actual cost
is approximately US$6,400 per ha. 1/ In addition, land acquisition costs were
severely underestimated. At appraisal, costs were estimated at CFAF 100 million
for both sites. Approximately CFAF 62 million has been paid for Thies. Dakar
land compensation was never paid and amounts to CFAF 598 million. In the case
of Thies, the DPA was obliged to pay land compensation from its own funds.
Government has not reimbursed the project account.
6.04      For the financial and economic analyses, the additional costs of
civil works to be completed beyond June 30, 1982 (close of disbursements) were
estimated. These costs include land acquisition for Dakar, some ongoing
civil works in Dakar and Thies, and those community facilities for Dakar and Thies
which were eliminated when the project was reduced. These costs amount to
1/ Reduced project. Sewerage component eliminated in Thies so calculation
made on basis of 300 ha in Dakar only.



- 32 -
CFAF 2,572 million. In addition, DPA operating costs up to 1995 (the
end of the repayment period for the construction loan program) were estimated
and amount to CFAF 1,242 million.
B. Disbursements
6.05      As of June 30, 1982, total disbursements amounted to US$7.6 million.
The actual and estimated disbursement profile is shown in Chart 23915. The
actual and estimated disbursement schedule is given in Table 6.3. Overall
disbursements are four years later than the forecast date of Project Completion
which was June 30, 1978, and fall short of a 1980-81 revised estimate which
called for the completion of all civil works on the Dakar site by December 31, 1981
and disbursement of the total Credit amount by March 31, 1982. All of the
outstanding works, which include the construction of a primary school, completion
of the sewerage network on the third tranche and power network.on the second
and third tranches on the Dakar site were in progress before the Closing Date
but, at the earliest, could not be completed beg,ore June.-30, 1982.
6.06      Delays in disbursements were due to many factors.   Actual disbursements
lagged immediately behind the appraisal forecasts because of an overly
optimistic schedule at appraisal. Principal causes of disbursement delays are:
(a) discontinuities in counterpart funding which delayed start-up throughout
execution and resulted in a virtual stoppage of works in end 1980 and early 1981;
(b) delays in completing detailed design and engineering; (c) delays during
construction due to contractors difficulties; (d) slow processing in the
Ministry of Finance. Disbursements improved dramatically towards the end of
the Credit life, when a Bank consultant worked directly with contractors to
prepare bills and when the DPA assigned a staff member to follow up in the
Ministry of Finance.
6.07      Towards the Credit Closing, the disbursement percentage was raised
to 80% to accelerate disbursements. For a brief period, disbursement requests
were still being forwarded at the original percentage and disbursements were
made accordingly. Unless the Ministry of Finance and the OHLM communicate
directly when such changes are made, valuable time and IDA funds can be lost,
since forms must be resubmitted to correct the error. Approximately US$458,000
of the IDA Credit was cancelled at June 30, 1982, or 5% of the total Credit
amount.

C. Financial Performance
6.08      The original and actual financing plans stated in US$ and CFAFrancs
are shown below. These f:igures do not include the costs of completing the
community facilities.

6.09      Because of implementation delays, the respective shares of IDA and
Government participation were altered, with an additional US$1.805 million or
CFAF 299.2 million required in counterpart funds to complete the revised project.
This 24% increase (CFAF) in Senegalese participation is particularly serious
given the country's financial situation and is of more concern within the
context of all projects under execution in the country. However, there appears
to be no information available as to the cumulative effects of these overruns
on local funding requirements.
6.10      Cost Recovery and Affordability.  Project beneficiaries were expected
to pay for detailed engineering, on-site infrastructure (except electricity)
and management prior to lat sale. At appraisal, it was estimated that
CFAF 1,406.9 million would be passed onto beneficiaries, based on assignable l/
land area totalling 242.8 ha in Dakar and 36.3 ha in Thies. With the reduced
project, 180 ha in Dakar aLnd 25 ha in Thies will be sold, generating total
revenues amounting to CFAI 1,790 million at present selling prices. Schools
and health clinics were to be recovered through general revenues. Land was to
be provided free. Repayment terms were 7% per year over a maximum period of
15 years. Allottees could. pay a lump sum for their plot, an option which was
exercised by nearly 20% of the beneficiaries.
1/ Total area minus roads, and open space.



- 34 -
6.11      At appraisal, total plot costs were estimated to range from CFAF 74,000
(US$290) to CFAF 220,000 (US$863) for plots with a water and sewerage
connection based on an average development cost of about CFAF 741/m2. Actual
development costs in Dakar are approximately CFAF 1,272/m2 and CFAF 1,146/m2
in Thias, while the average selling price is about CFAF 834/m2. Despite Bank
requests to revise the selling price to reflect actual development costs
(53% higher than current prices for plots), Government refused, arguing that
the beneficiaries, and in particular, the lower income households, should not
be penalized for the construction delays for which they were not responsible.
Table 6.4 compares plot prices and monthly charges at appraisal with current
levied charges and actual development costs per plot.
6.12      Affordability.  At appraisal, the target population was defined as
those families with incomes too low to qualify for OHLM housing but adequate
to (a) meet monthly plot charges and (b) invest in house construction. However,
no assumption was made concerning private savings required for house construction,
it being assumed that everyone was able to mobilize the necessary funds. It
was estimated that families with incomes between CFAF 14,500 and CFAF 37,900
would qualify, based on the generally held assumption that households are willing
and able to pay up to 20% of their monthly income to acquire their own house.
These families were between the 47th and 85th percentiles on the 1970 income
distribution curve. Families with incomes below CFAF 14,500 were expected to be
able to rent rooms on the site.
6.13      Research undertaken since this project underscores the difficulties in
estimating project affordability. The situation is complicated by several factors
which include the following: (a) investment in housing is shown to vary widely
from project to project, with families often willing and able to invest
considerably more than the 20% cited above; (b) frequently these additional
investments are not made from current household income but rather come from loans
or transfers from other family members. In the specific case of Dakar, the
lack of reliable information on housing investment further clouds the issue.
Under these circumstances, the best that can be done is to provide some very
general indicators of potential project affordability. For the purposes of the
PCR, the cost information which is used is based only on development charges and
loan payment which is an underestimation of total costs to participants. It
has also been assumed that households are only able to spend 20% of their
income on housing, which again according to research information probably
underestimates ability to pay.
6.14      Data on allocation show that beneficiaries fall between the 20th and
65th percentiles on the 1980 Dakar income distribution curve with CFAF 55,000
as the income ceiling. Because of the lack of serviced sites across income
groups in Dakar, there has been some "seepage" of higher incomes into the
beneficiary selettion process, bringing in some families between the 65th and
85th percentiles. The current floor differs from that at appraisal because
of modifications to the allocation criteria permitting larger numbers of
lower income families to participate. As Table 6.4 shows, charges at appraisal
for the least expensive plot represented about 6% of the monthly income of the
lowest income beneficiary and 5% of the monthly income of the higher income



- 35 -
beneficiary for a fully s3erviced plot. Using the prices levied by the DPA,
these figures are 5% and 4% respectively. At actual development costs, the
figures are 7% and 5%. 1L/ On the basis of the assumptions in paragraph 6.13,
it is reasonable to conc:lude that, even if households made relatively heavy
additional investmetits, i:he project was affordable by the project population.
6.15      However, few households began house construction before 1978, at
which time a survey revenled that lack of funds was one of the principal
reasons.  Furthermore, ii: was shown that households with incomes similar to
project beneficiaries spent over 60% of their monthly income for food and about
13% for shelter. 2/ Betwieen 1972-1988. the price of basic food staples doubled in
Dakar while the minimum wiage increased by only 50%.   The DPA, therefore, decided to
start its construction loan program, which aimed to promote construction of a
two-room unit costing CFAIF 540,000 at 11% over 15 years, or a monthly charge
of CFAF 6,260.
6.16      With a DPA loan, the percentage of monthly income allocated to shelter
for the poorest beneficiary is 30%, while that of the higher income beneficiary
for a fully serviced plot is 15% at DPA prices. Given the available data on
monthly expenditure patterns of lower income families, the addition of the
construction loan would appear to create affordability problems for low income
households, if they have to meet the total payment out of current earnings.
Unfortunately, there is no information on the amount of transfers from relatives
which would reduce the repayment burden for some households.
6.17      If it is assumed that 20% of monthly income is allocated to shelter,
all families above the median income level (CFAF 37,500) can afford a two-room
unit, covering households falling between the 40th and 65th percentiles. All
families (20th and above) could afford a one-room unit. If actual development
costs are applied, only families earning more than CFAF 40,000 per month could
afford a two room-unit, and families with monthly incomes of at least CFAF 28,000
could afford a one-room unit. If it is assumed that 13% of monthly income is
allocated to shelter, only the population above the 40th percentile can afford
a one-room unit; no families could afford a two-room unit.
1/ All percentages rounded.
2/ Research again suggest3 that this is probably a rental payment and that
households might have been able and willing to pay a higher proportion to
purchase a house.

D. Recovery Performance and Replicability
6.19      Repayment of plot charges has been generally good, with a 22%
default rate.  This compares favorably with other projects.   In contrast, the
default rate on the construction loan program is poor (88%).   Of the 4,500 houses
under construction, 2,000 have DPA loans.   Therefore about 45% of the people
constructing are in default.  Reasons for the cost recovery problems include
the following:
(a) An inadequate institutional framework.
Beneficiary accounts for both plot sales and construction
loan are mechanized and processed by the Government's
information center which handles all public sector
enterprises. The center issues separate bills for the
plot and the construction loan program which are mailed
at different times to the beneficiaries. There are
frequent delays in processing, sometimes up to six
months or more and DPA's requests for modifications to
the program or an acceleration in billings are generally
ignored. The collections section in the DPA is also
hampered by excessively complicated procedures and
does not have adequate staff to collect late payments.
(b) Lack of political will and a system of sanctions.
Deduction at source is voluntary by law for civil servants
(1/3 of project beneficiaries), and Government has been
slow to enforce it for the project. Deduction at source
for other salaried employees was only instituted in 1980,
with the result that deduction at source covers a minimal
percentage of the 40% of the beneficiaries who are salaried.
Furthermore, no legal sanctions against overdue clients have
been taken.
6.20      As of June 30, 1982, the following costs were not being recovered
from project beneficiaries:
In million CFAF
Dakar   land acquisition
(not including 4th tranche)              511.0
primary infrastructure                   530.3
community facilities                     280.9
technical assistance                     181.6
DPA administration                       158.0
Thies   land acquisition                          61.8
Total                             1,723.6
This figure represents over 50% of total project costs as of that date. Of
the CFAF 1,723.6 million, it can be assumed that primary infrastructure and
community facilities would be recovered through general or municipal revenues,
leaving 20% (US$3 million) of project costs as non-recoverable (land acquisition,



-- 37 -
technical assistance and DPA administration). Given the country's financial
constraints, Government would have to recover more project costs than at
present, if it expects to continue implementation of the Sites and Services
Program.  Under these circumstances, and with fewer delays, real economies in
design standards and fewer pressures by Government on beneficiaries concerning
the type of house to build, sites and services should be a viable housing
solution for Government.
E. Financial Position of DPA and Results
6.20      It was assumed at appraisal that the DPA would yield an operating
surplus which could be annually invested in new operations. Table 6.5 compares
the forecast at appraisaL with the DPA's current financial position without the
loan scheme. Under this scenario, the DPA's financial position would be
positive, once all plots are sold and the deferred payments recovered (1988/1989).
As of June 30, 1982, the cash surplus would be CFAF 1,707.9 million compared
to CFAF 790.6 million estimated at appraisal.
6.21      The introduction of the construction loan scheme in 1978 radically
changes these projections. Table 6.6 gives the DPA forecast with and without
the loan program. Originally fed by down payments and repayments from plot
purchases, the loan program received an additional CFAF 575 million loan from
Government to OHLM/DPA under the Structural Adjustment Loan (1981). The cash
flow of the loan program is negative from 1982 to 1990/91, with the cash
deficit peaking at CFAF L,596 million in 1985/86. After 1993, the cash flow is
positive. If the DPA financial results are consolidated to include plot
repayments and loan reimbursements, the DPA cash flow is negative until 1986/87
reaching a maximum deficit of CFAF 321 million in 1985/86. If previously agreed
measures to improve cost recovery are applied rigorously, the DPA would show a
cash surplus of CFAF 283 million in 1987/88. At the end of the operation
(1994/95), and after reiabursement to Government of the CFAF 575 million, the
consolidated cash flow shows a cumulative surplus of CFAF 2,092 million, assuming
a default rate of 20% on construction loans. Given central government funding
constraints, this surplus represents an important source of counterpart funds for
a future operation.

VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      At appraisal, quantitative economic benefits were measured in terms
of imputed rental values for the housing units to be constructed under the
project. Assuming a 20 year life of these units, the rate of return on the
total investment, which included the land value and the value of self help
labor was estimated at 18% at appraisal. Recalculation of the rate of return
was hampered by data estimation and cost allocation difficulties, but under the
method which is described below, the ERR is slightly above 19%. This rate of
return supports the conclusion that this project was a sound investment from an
economic point of view.
7.02      The Dakar and Thies sites together account for 11,000 small (150 m2)
and 1,220 large (300 m2) plots. As of June 30, 1982, about 1,570 housing units
were occupied. The economic analysis in the appraisal report utilized the estimated
rental value of completed units as the measure of benefits. However, there is
no reliable data on the rental value of the houses which have been constructed
on the site, and for the ex post analysis, the increase in land value arising
out of the provision of services was utilized as a measure of benefits. This
is in any case a more commonly used indicator in recent appraisals of sites and
services projects. Ideally one would want to be able to compare the time
series for the changes in value brought about in the project site with changes
over time in comparably located raw land in Dakar. However, it has not been
possible to obtain estimates of the latter because an appropriate index is not
published and because data does not exist from other sources. In the absence
of this more detailed information, the re-analysis used as a measure of benefits,
actual observed increases in property values on the site and adjusted them for
inflation to keep them in real terms. 1/
7.03      Field checks on average selling prices were done for purposes of
reevaluation.  Large plots are being sold at about CFAF 1,000,000 (US$4,300).     2/
Some large plots are being sold at higher prices but there are few reported
sales at lower prices. The resale price of the small plots ranges from
CFAF 600,000 - 850,000. Spot surveys indicate that little distinction is made
between service levels and/or location. A conservatively estimated average
price per plot of CFAF 640,000 in81/82 CFA Francs was used for the economic
calculation.
7.04      For purposes of economic analysis, costs at appraisal included the
value of land, the cost of materials and labor for the dwellings, and all
on-site infrastructure costs with the exception of community facilities. Certain
1/ To the extent that prices of undeveloped land increased faster than inflation,
the recalculated rate is an overestimate.
2/ Intervening year average CFAF 232.1 = US$1.00

items were excluded but should have been included such as operating and management
costs of the project unit. For the recalculation, these plus some additional
costs were included. Infrastructure costs were expandJed to include all costs
of off-site infrastructura, although this biases the ERR downward, since a portion
could have been considered to be of benefit to a larger population. Costs of
community facilities were also included. This added cost also biases the rate
of return downward since the benefits of such facilities are generally considered
to be fully reflected in the purchase price of the housing. Operating and
management costs of the p:coject unit were included in the recalculation.
7.05     All costs are wii:hout taxes.  The base year for the recalculation is
FY82. Costs are actual costs between 1973 and 1982, inflated to 1982 price
levels.   The average inf:Lation rate over the period is 10% per year.   Beyond
1982, estimated costs are given in 1982 CFAF. All costs and benefits have been
discounted at the opportunity cost of capital (11% between 1973 and 1993). The
calculations which are provided in Table 7.1 show: (a) a net present value of
CFAF 870.1 million and (b) a benefit/cost ratio of 1.10, and (c) an ERR of 19%.
7.06     By 1993, when it is expected that the outstanding community facilities
will have been completed, each dollar of the IDA credit will have generated
approximately US$1.80 of public funds and US$8.20 of private savings. 1/ Each
IDA dollar will have had a multiplier effect of 10,indicative of a surprisingly
robust project and a measure of the acceptability of the sites and services
concept.
1/ At the end of the project, 12,220 houses would have been built at an
average cost of US$4,000. Total private investment has been estimated at
US$48.9 million. In addition, 1,800 medium standard houses costing
approximately US$7,500 would have been built by OHLM/BHS on the 4th tranche,
adding US$13.5 million of private investment.

VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     Government's evaluation of the Bank's role can be found in its
Project Completion Report which is attached as Annex 1. Bank reporting on the
project and its difficulties was regular and frequent. There were 30 supervision
missions between 1973 and 1981, 10 of which were before 1975. This extraordinary
investment in staff time represents about 300 staff weeks over a ten year period,
or double the normal supervision effort. Many of these missions were joint
Programs/Projects efforts often with Director or Division Chief level
participation.
8.02     The first of these major missions visited Senegal in 1975 to discuss
the future of the project which was in serious doubt at the time. This mission
was the first of several which would take an active role in the restructuring
of the project:
(a) 1975: a reduct:Lon in the IDA disbursement percentage to 45%;
(b)  1976:  reduction of the project size by 1/4; increase of
disbursement to the original 67%;
(c) 1977: postponrmoent of community facilities;
(d)  1978:  series of Action Plans to improve consolidation
and occupancy;
(e) 1979: introduction of DPA construction loan scheme;
(f)  1980:  counterpart funding arrangements with Government
and Caisse Centrale;
(g) increase in IDA disbursement percentage to 80%.
The staffing and frequency of these missions unquestionably contributed to
progress in implementation. This frequency, coupled with attention from the
Department Director level, also injected an element of constant pressure on
Government, focusing attention on the pressing issues and forcing a decision.
8.03     This intense supervision had its negative side.    As the Senegalese
point out in their PCR, the DPA was virtually ignored until the announcement
of a supervision mission. At that time, previously agreed measures were acted
upon and efforts made to accelerate implementation. Under these circumstances,
the Bank unwittingly substLtuted itself for the Borrower, taking on increasing
responsibility for implementation. The perception that the project was a
"Bank project" can be traced to this situation and prevailed throughout the
period.



- 50 -
8.04     As the implementation period progressed, the Bank's implementation
role leaned heavily towards occupation and consolidation, indicators which
were being closely monitored at Bank headquarters. This emphasis also had
its positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, the focus led to
the development of the construction loan scheme, which was a major element
in accelerating the consolidation process. This focus also led to the modification
of the selection criteria,opening the project to females living in a polygamous
family unit who were excluded under the one household/plot criteria in the
legal agreements. Criteria were modified to permit households down to the
20th percentile to qualify for plots and to allow more informal sector applicants
to participate in the project.
8.05     At the same time, the Bank continued to underestimate the difficulties
and the importance of providing a full range of services on the site. These
problems surfaced concretely when plotholders cited the absence of services
as a reason for non-occupation. The counterpart funding question did not
receive adequate attention until the Bank tardily recognized that it was not
a question of advancing the required funds but rather a cash squeeze affecting
the national budget. Operational issues within the DPA such as the unwieldy
functioning of the loan program, difficulties in cost recovery, and the lack
of employment on the site did not receive adequate attention.
8.06     In the main, the Bank's performance in this project is perceived
as positive. The inadequate attention to the country context is the most
frequent criticism leveled at the Bank by Government. Assumptions about the
rate of policy change, institutional development, the pace of occupancy and
acceptable measures of performance all reflected the novelty of the concept
and the inexperience of the Bank at the time. At the same time, it is
acknowledged that the Bank played a key role in introducing a radical change
in the perception of shelter policy and in resolutely pursuing removal of
obstacles to its implementation. There appears to be little doubt that the
sites and services approach is a real and acceptable alternative in the
Senegalese context. A smaller project, backed by solid Government support,
would have had a smoother implementation history. The Thies experience would
appear to support this conclusion.
8.07     The question frequently asked is whether, given the many difficulties,
this project warranted the heavy investment in staff time and support. This
was the Bank's first project and the first project in the Western Africa Region.
It was also a test case for many Governments in the Region which were
contemplating similar investments. It had a wide audience and continues to
generate intense interest. Convincing results have been demonstrated on the
ground which have attracted a steady stream of applicants. While the policy
dialogue is far from that which has been achieved elsewhere, the Bank's
participation beyond that forecast at appraisal has permitted the dialogue
to be extended to other issues of the country's urban policy and is now



- 51 -
a vital element in the ongoing parastatal reform discussions. Against this
perspective, it is premat:ure to answer the question with certainty,pending
the outcome of these discussions, more complete occupancy and consolidation
results, and the more convincing evidence that a second operation would
provide.

COMPLETION REPORT ON THE
SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
SENEGAL'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE
WORLD BANK'S FINAL REPORT
March 1982



- 54 -
As indicated in the World Bank's 1972 appraisal report, the Dakar
and Thies Site and Services Project is distinguished by its apparent
simplicity and the appropriateness of its objectives. However, from project
preparation to final completion, this operation has run into enormous
difficulties, which are still not resolved in 1982. While it is perhaps
too early to make an exhaustive and definitive evaluation of the entire
operation, an objective assessment can be made of its most significant
technical, design, financial and institutional parameters so that lessons
can be drawn for future operations.
Position of the World Bank
A Bank document published in June 1972* sets forth its urban
development philosophy:
"Technical assistance on programming and institution building is
foreseen in connection with the urban projects."
"... direct lending for housing construction is not contemplated
at this time."
"The emphasis here is on the leverage effect in promoting savings
and developing capital markets in a form which will lead to amelioration
of the overall housing and employment situation."
"Close location of residences and employment, which with city
growth req.uires the establishment of new employment groupings away from
existing centers, can secure considerable economies."
"The more conspicuous successes, however, tend to demonstrate
the importance of securing involvement of the population concerned through
community groups, not only for initial implementation but also in creating
a momentum for further amelioration, in provision of communal facilities
and in the collection of payments."
*Urbanization Sector Working Paper. (Tr.)



- 55 -
"... security of tenure is an essential factor."
"The Bank is llready involved in detailed appraisal of standards
of construction and services and frequently succeeds in introducing changes
in project design which cut costs..."
"The program of urbanization projects is being coordinated with
programs of projects in more traditional sectors of Bank lending.. .including
the balance between rural development and the development of urban centers..."
These general considerations summarize certain of the Bank's
tenets regarding its urbanization and housing policy which had a bearing on
the design standards of the Dakar project. This Bank project was the
first of the "site and services" type intended to enable developing countries
to formulate less costly urban policies by eliminating government subsidies
to agencies such as OHI and SICAP* and by improving squatter neighborhoods.
This strategy was based on two principles:
(1) the making available of sites that the Government would provide
with minimum infrastructure and then sell to those who could not afford
conventional housing;
(2) having the financing of the construction borne by the people them-
selves instead of the public sector through their doing the building themselves,
mutual assistance arrangements and self-financing through household savings.
Thus, once executed, the first project was to make possible the
reallocation of funds to other projects as part of the national program.
To this end, an agency to manage the projects was to be established
and given technical and financial responsibility for future programs.
The appraisal of the project in 1972 determined the conditions
for its execution; at a cost of over US$12 million, of which US$8 million was
*Societ6 Immobiliere du C"ap-Vert. (Tr.)



-56 -
to be financed by IDA, the project consisted of the servicing of
400 ha in Dakar and 60 ha in Thies providing 14,000 and 1,600 lots,
the construction of community facilities, roads and other basic
services, the building of schools and health centers (in Dakar, 4 medical
centers, 12 primary schools and 4 secondary; in Thies 2 primary schools
and 1 medical center), the establishment of community centers, and the
provision for and promotion of business and industrial sites with a view
to creating employment on the site.
It was mutually agreed that OHLM would be the executing agency for
the project, which would constitute a major undertaking in urban development.
In point of fact, 80% of the population of Dakar, estimated at
550,000 in 1970, could not afford SICAP or OHLM housing because their income
was too low, while with an annual demographic growth rate of 6% the city
could expect to have more than 1 million inhabitants by 1980.
For all these reasons the 400-ha site at Camberene represented an
attractive solution. Because of its size it could accommodate a large-scale
operation that would be in line with the short- and medium-term objectives
(providing housing for a large number of Dakarois and demonstrating the
value of the new strategy). In addition, 75% of the land in the zone was
state-owned, which facilitated acquisition and assignment to the project.
Nevertheless, it was decided to implement the project gradually, in four
successive phases, in order to make it easier to cope with any obstacles
or difficulties that might arise during execution.
The land was to be divided into 14,000 lots (32 lots per ha) of
150 to 160 m as in the Pikine project, and larger tracts were to be ear-
marked for commercial or industrial (small- and large-scale) use. With the
10 people per household assumed by the program, the project was thus to



- 57 -
relocate 150,000 inhabitants, or about a third of Dakar's population at
the time.
Originally, each household was supposed to put in its own septic
tank but it was subsequently shown that it was possible to install a
sewer system for public conveniences and to hook up private homes if the
people wished it.
To reduce the total capital cost it was decided that
25% of the households would have private water and electrical connections
while, i.e. the majority would later be able to purchase private system
connections at their own expense. Lastly, public lighting was to be
provided on the main streets.
Both the Bank and the Senegalese authorities paid close attention
to the setting of design standards. The Bank wanted to ensure that the
project was not made inaccessible to the target group through the adoption
of high and hence costly standards, while the Senegalese authorities were
anxious to prevent the area from becoming a "bidonville," or slum.
The project WELS therefore to be within reach of a target group
defined as the "principal beneficiary," which would be able to pay the
project costs and charges over a set period (10 or 15 years). It was
agreed that in Dakar in 1972 the project would be aimed at households too
poor to benefit from OHIM and SICAP housing, i.e. those whose incomes ranged
from CFAF 12,500 to CFAE 37,000 per month. In the same year, the housing
shortage was estimated at 20,000 units and it was expected that the project
would contribute significantly toward reducing that deficit at low cost.
By leaving construction to the people themselves, the cost of the
dwellings was expected to be kept down since the main objective was to keep
recourse to paid labor to a minimum.



- 58 -
For the same reason, the use of inexpensive materials was to be
encouraged and the rate of construction was to be consistent with the
households' possibilities (savings and labor over a period ranging from
5 to 10 years). These objectives were at the basis of two fundamental
concepts behind the project: "temporary housing" and "incremental
construction." The temporary housing concept meant that households receiving
lots were allowed to put up wooden shelters so that they could move in and
live on their lots right away.
The principle of incremental or 'add-on" construction was intended
to allow house construction to go as fast or as slowly as household human
and financial resources permitted.
Project and Credit Agreements
Credit Agreement 336 SE for US$8 million was signed on September 29, 1'972,
along with the Project Agreement.
The effective date of the credit, originally set for March 1, 1973,
became in the event August 30 because the following prerequisites had first
to be met:
-    promulgation of a decree reorganizing OHLM so that it would be able
to carry out the new responsibilities entrusted to it under the project;
-    finalization of construction regulations authorizing the use of
inexpensive materials on the site, and in accordance with the Urban Planning
Code;
drawing up of a model sales contract;
acceptance of the services of the technical experts assigned
to the project;
-    establishment of a Site and Services Directorate (Direction des
Parcelles Assainies - DPA) and a Community Assistance Section (Section



- 59 -
d'Assistance aux Communautes - SAC);
-    Formulation of model statutes for the Cooperatives d'Habitat
responsible for collecting payments due from the sale of the lots and
organizing saving and access to credit, which were grouped under the
"Association d'Acquereurs de Parcelles" (Lot Purchasers' Association).
It was further agreed that the appointment of the Director of
OHLM "with appropriate qualifications and experience" would be subject to
Bank approval, that the principle of separate DPA/OHLM budgets would be
introduced and that the financial operations of the agency would be audited.
The principal of the credit was to be repaid from 1982 to 2022 at
0.5% interest, with a 0.75% service fee charged every six months. The
credit was to finance:
-    primary infrastructure (off-site works)
-    infrastructure in the prQject area (on-site works)
-    studies and technical assistance.
The cost of the primary infrastructure included all off-site works
and was financed 100% by Senegal, in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
It included external or main roads, high-voltage electricity, water piped
from the Lac de Guiers to supply the project, pumping, delivery and treatment
stations and tree and p:Lant screens.
The on-site infrastructure financed jointly by Senegal (33%) and
the Bank (67%) consisted of site improvement works: earthworks, staking,
internal and secondary road and utility networks, drainage, low-voltage
electricity and construction of community infrastructure.
The Senegalese counterpart funds were to be paid over quarterly in
advance to OHLM. The cost of studies and technical assistance, financed
100% by the Bank, covered the urban planning studies and the formulation of



- 60 -
project layout, which were contracted to the Dutch consulting firm NEDECO,
while the studies on upgrading the Fass Paillote bidonvilles were entrusted
to the Secretariat for Urban Planning and Housing (SMUH).
For project implementation, the Senegalese Government was to
assign to OHLM five engineers and experts in civil works, finance, economics
and sociology, establish a Community Assistance Section (SAC) and appoint a
project director. Selected after international competitive bidding, NEDECO
therefore represented the first team of experts charged with setting up the
project within OHLM and who were to be subsequently replaced by their
Senegalese counterparts.
It was specified that the Direction de la Promotion Humaine would
provide the SAC team and that the Government would provide "necessary and
sufficient" personnel for the running of the new schools and dispensaries.
The Government was also to be responsible for site maintenance after the
lots were sold and for providing public transportation between Dakar and
Camberene.
In addition, the Government was to hire two consultants to help it
formulate its new urban policy, arising out of its adoption of the site
and services approach.
Lastly, physical completion of the project was set for June 30, 1978
and the closing date of the credit (end of IDA disbursements) for June 30, 1979,
unless the two parties decided otherwise.
Position of Senegal
At the time of the first appraisal of the project in 1970, there
was not, in the true sense of the term, a Senegalese position regarding the
site and services concept.
The new strategy developed by the Bank was not matched on the



- 61 -
Senegalese side by an equally clearly defined strategy, although the
Senegalese Government did have an urban development master plan for the
Cap-Vert region, which demonstrated its desire to pursue the site and
services approach. Furthermore, the Senegalese urban planning and housing
officials had acquired extensive experience with similar schemes all
planned and financed exclusively with public funds for the poor in Cap-
Vert, whose demographic profile was comparable to that of the target group
of the Bank project.
It seems that on the Senegalese side there was very little
eagerness to draw up a specific official document for the Cambe'rene project
and that the urban development dimension was favored over its other
components. It was precisely those other components of the project that
were to constitute the difference in approach between the Bank and Senegal.
The difference lay in the rationale used by the two sides.
Senegal's pre-vious schemes (Pikine, Guedjawaye, Grand Yoff, etc.)
were part of a strategy to free downtown slum areas that were occupied by
squatters. Once freed, that land was to be developed in accordance with
policy decisions regarding public housing. In compensation, the Government
gave the relocated squatters permanent occupancy permits that entitled them
to move to and build on lots provided with basic infrastructure and services.
This strategy therefore enabled the Senegalese authorities to
implement progressively - i.e. operation by operation - their urban develop-
ment and infrastructure policy. They succeeded, at one and the same time in
restructuring the downtown area and in resettling through the granting of
permanent occupancy rights, large numbers of the poor of Cap-Vert. During
certain slum clearance operations, some of those relocated were even given
public housing free of charge.



- 62 -
However, once again, the objective of these actions remained
the freeing of land for public housing.
As far as low-cost housing policy was concerned, the Government
relied exclusively on the OHLM and SICAP programs, despite their modest
achievements.
It is therefore not at all surprizirng that the Camberene Site
and Services Project was very favorably received by both the Senegalese
political authorities and the technicians and planners. For the former, a
large-scale site and services operation using external financing was seen
as a means for making housing and property ownership accessible to a large
segment of the poor of Cap-Vert.
For the others, the project made it possible to: (i) find
housing for the residents of neighborhoods that were to be cleared; (ii)
anticipate urban and demographic growth; (iii) make available a very large
building area at the entrance to the city which would serve to "catch"
migrants moving in from the countryside and, lastly, (iv) eliminate a part
of the housing shortage. This rationale seems to be at the base of the
Senegalese authorities' thinking concerning the project. They saw the
Camberene project as simply a larger-scale version of the traditional sub-
divisions of the type carried out by the urban planning authorities.
This being their understanding, the Senegalese agencies involved
felt that they possessed the necessary competence and capabilities to carry
the project out successfully.
For the World Bank, however, this project was not just a straight-
forward urban development operation, but rather a response to a number of
urban-strategy-related problems. Although these differences in approach



- 63 -
did not affect the negotiations, they did influence the relations between
the two partners throughout the execution of the project.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
regarding:
(a)  The reorganization of the executing agency (OHLM) to carry out
the National Site and Services Program;
(b) The creation in OHLM of an investment fund for future site and
services projects that was to receive the principal and interest payments
from the purchasers of `,he sites developed by the project;
(c) The personnel to be assigned to OHLM by other governmental agencies
for project execution;
(d) Government provision for relocation of squatters in its present
slum clearance program in a manner not detrimental to the project.
In addition tc* these specific points, the Bank required the
Government to take the following measures: elimination of all public
subsidies to OHLM and SICAP; acquisition of the 400 ha in Camberene
and delivery of land title to the future purchasers of the improved
sites; and lowering of OHLM's housing standards.
Taken as a who.Le, the Bank's reasoning, which was based on monetarist
and macroeconomic considerations, diverged substantially from that of the
Government. The Senegalese authorities, although aware of the inadequacy of
OHLM's housing production, felt it was imprudent and dangerous to halt all
subsidies to that agency,! and preferred to wait until the completion of the
project, so as to have concrete proof as to its financial feasibility and
technical replicability. The Government therefore found the elimination of
the subsidies to OHLM to be premature and likely to push up HLM (low-cost
housing) rents, and possibly even jeopardize the very existence of one of the



- 64 -
key instruments of its housing policy.
For its part, the Bank justified its proposal by pointing out
that this subsidy, because of its size and the way it was distributed,
could not in any event constitute a long-term solution to the need for an
increased rate and volume of new housing construction. Moreover, because
it benefited only a part of the population, i.e. precisely those who needed
it least, the Bank felt there was every reason to drop the subsidy.
Recognizing in part the soundness of the Bank's analysis, the Government
accepted the principle of first changing the way that public housing funds
were allocated in order to take account of the introduction of a new non-
subsidy-type financing mechanism - the project.
The Government was nevertheless still convinced that outside of
potential OHLM and SICAP beneficiaries, there was still a large amorphous
group composed essentially of bidonville residents who needed to be
rehoused.  And in this respect, the Camberene project was, in its eyes,
fully justified.
However, the Bank felt that those without access to the public
housing programs consisted of more than one group and that they should be
made the object of a number of specific programs based on standards tailored
to their particular income levels. It was therefore recommended that the
Government carry out site and services projects as well as bidonville up-
grading programs, which would not require the residents to move and would
provide them with titles of ownership.
The question of ownership - what title to issue to the future
purchasers of serviced lots - has not been answered; the Government could
not understand the Bank's insistence on having the purchasers of the serviced



- 65 -
lots given title to the land since the beneficiaries of public projects
in Pikine, Guedjawaye, etc., who were given occupancy permits, had
achieved performances similar to those expected from the Camberene operation.
The Government therefore felt it to be sufficient, from the standpoint of
security of tenure, to issue occupancy permits.
Secondly, the Government refused, without saying as much, to
depart from the law on state-owned :Land (domaine national) which it had
decided, instead, to extend to urban property as well as rural land, in
accordance with its socialist philosophy. Faced with the Bank's firm
insistence on this matter, the Government suspected a political, even
ideological motivation that concern for the proper implementation of the
project alone did not warrant.
Further, the:r'e was no true} agreement between the two partners
regarding slum clearance measures. In this specific area, steps and actions
were taken at a very h:igh level in the Senegalese political structure that
was to a large extent beyond the control of the urban planning specialists
and technicians. Throughout the years of project implementation, a very
clear political intent emerged as regards urban planning, architecture and
urban esthetics. The liational Urban Planning Council established in 1974/75
and chaired by the President himself, was the central decision and policy-
making body.
While it mairttained a constant interest in the project and its
success, the Council also decided to prepare a list of additional slum
clearance operations iD. Dakar, despite the Government's commitments to the
World Bank. Of 11 neighborhoods identified, only Fass Paillote was proposed
and selected for upgra&ing as opposed to clearance.
These differences of approach and views occasionally made the



- 66 -
working relations between the two parties tense but more often uncomfortable,
owing to a mutual failure to understand each other's position.
To the veiled or direct reproaches made by the Bank regarding
its housing and urban planning policy, the Government responded in an inten-
tionally    vague manner.   Convinced that it had "fully" performed its
commitments "in general," the Government admittedly very often did not
respond at all.
The Bank, for its part, attributed all difficulties encountered
by the project (delays, non-availability of counterpart funds, etc.) to a
"lack of political will" on the part of the Government.
It can be stated that Bank-Senegal relations regarding the site
and services project were apparently marred by misunderstandings that still
persist, notwithstanding the stated and common concern of the two partners
to achieve the project's objectives.
OHLM and the Site and Services Directorate
Beginning in 1976, DPA staff were to be almost exclusively
Senegalese. Despite the difficulties in recruiting university graduates
for the project, OHLM gradually managed to replace the expatriate experts
with nationals.



- 67 -
Because the project was already well advanced, the Senegalese
senior staff were obliged without any true probation period, to take on
major responsibilities at a critical juncture in the project (speeding
up the works, site occupancy, solving questions, relating to
development, etc.).
Although matters were not always clear between the consultant
and the Senegalese count:erparts, a unity of approach and team spirit has
long been lacking at DPA since it came under Senegalese management.
However, although their academic and professional qualifications did
not necessarily match the requirements for such a project, the
Senegalese officials demonstrated impressive adaptability and
receptivity for retraining.
In the face of constant and mounting difficulties, the young
Senegalese DPA team, although fairly inexperienced, was also able to
increase the involvement of the authorities in the project and
thereby overcome major obstacles (see 1978 plan of action).
Nevertheless, it was not always able to resist pressures
brought to bear on it as regards the philosophy of the project or
compliance with set procedures by the purchasers' associations,
unseccessful applicants, etc.



- 68 -
In addition to these strengths and weaknesses, for completeness'
sake, mention should also be made of DPA's status within OHLM. Set up
in the OHLM central office in 1973, DPA was not always considered to be
on an equal footing with OHLM but more as an offshoot or provisional
structure. Because it had no true administrative and budgetary autonomy
DPA, at least early on, was made to feel that it was subordinate to OHLM
even though it was overseeing the execution of similar if not larger
programs.
Caught between the performance requirements made periodically by
the Bank and the weakness of its own means within OHLM, DPA staff had to
cope with many difficulties.
Lastly, it should be pointed out that the changes at the top in
OHLM took their toll, as DPA had to wait until successive directors
familiarized themselves with the project before the necessary institutional
backing and staff could be obtained.
DPA was accordingly moved to request the Bank to intervene with
OHLM and the authorities to improve its overall situation, something which
the Bank always refused to do on the grounds that DPA's problems were
exclusively a matter for the Senegalese.
Opinions of the project
Questioned about their opinions of the project, the officials
contacted unanimously acknowledged that this site and services strategy was
an indispensable and judicious complement to OHLM, SICAP and government
housing actions.
In addition, the project was carried out at a time when seekers
of housing and employers in the private sector were voicing increasing



- 69 -
scepticism about the 2'% housing tax deducted from wages and paid over to
the Senegalese housing agencies. The modest achievements of those agencies
and the increase in demand had persuaded the authorities that a new approach
to solving these problems was called for.
Thus, the philosophy behind the project - reaching those who
previously did not have access to public housing - had obtained general
acceptance.
Nevertheless, the Senegalese officials expressed certain
reservations on some aspects of the project:
1.   Choice of location
Although it did not cause difficulties during the study phase
or negotiations, the choice of location was challenged on several occasions
by the decision-makers and also certain income groups.
A first criticism, technical in nature, found fault with the size
(400 ha) of the Camber,_ne site, its topography (large sand dunes) and location
(10 km from Dakar; poo:r road access). The argument thus developed tended
to show that the project. would suffer from the negative effects of these
factors.
In the first place, development of such a site required technical
capabilities that Senegal could not marshal for the purpose without running
the risk of concentrating a significant part of its manpower on that one
project alone. Secondly, the cost of development, in view of the size of
the site and the desigrt standards, would be high notwithstanding the scale
of the project objectiv-es.
Lastly, the financial effort required of Senegal - 100% financing
of the works - was averred to be a very serious obstacle to proper project
execution.



- 70 -
The second observation on the choice of Camberene was socio-
political. It was observed, after the earthmoving had been done and the
first lot allocations made, that some Senegalese officials were quite
hostile about the choice of the site, classified as a "residential" area,
since they feared that allocation to the project target groups would
inevitably lead to the area deteriorating into a collection of "bidonvilles."
This viewpoint was defended by the wealthier or politically influential
groups in Cap-Vert.
It should be pointed out that OHLM/DPA withstood the pressures
from these groups and took their opinions into consideration solely to
prevent any additional obstacles in the execution of the project. This may
have been the reason for the standard house plans for beneficiaries, which
became a serious sticking point in relations between the Bank and Senegal.
It is still too early to tell what role urban concerns and the
defense of economic interests had in this assessment of the site selection.
It is, however, clear that the Camberene site was considered highly desirable,
particularly the areas along the sea used for the third and fourth phases,
by both decision-makers and the affluent. Without the Government's commit-
ment to the Bank, there could have been strong attempts to switch part of the
project site to private control.
The third observation, political and sociological in nature, was
that unless care was taken, the project might create "a ghetto of 140,000
people" in one single blow. This reasoning was based on the target
population, the selection criteria and the community development policy,
all of which were project elements that reserved access to the improved
lots to clearly delineated economic groups.



- 7i1 -
Although it is still too early to pronounce a final opinion
on this aspect of the project, we must recognize the legitimacy - at least
in part - of this fear, which was reinforced in the minds of several
Senegalese leaders by the Bank's insistence on having temporary shelters
put up on the site. En the eyes of the Senegalese officials who leaned
to this view, such a "ghetto" could not but become an unsafe area or a
hotbed of social tens:ion if it were occupied only by the poor.
Tne Bank defended exactly the opposite opinion, affirming that
this type of project would, over the longer term, reduce the risk of
social unrest preciseJy because it offered an opportunity to the urban
poor to find employment, own their own homes and live better.
2.   Design stancards
Despite the commitment shared by the two partners to a project
providing complete infrastructure, Senegal felt a posteriori that the
proposed design standards were "sophisticated" and too "high" for such a
project. On the one hand, they entailed considerable counterpart funds and,
on the other hand, such standards were not felt to be essential for
achieving the desired results. Once again the Senegalese officials based
their reasoning on their experience with the subdivisions in Pikine,
Guedjawaye, etc.
They also feLt that the putting up of wooden shelters, even on
a temporary basis, was out of harmony with the standards for the site in
general and the homes to be built by the purchasers. The authorities there-
fore made a particular effort to facilitate access to bank credit for the
beneficiaries rather than encouraging site occupation through temporary
structures.
Nevertheless, the project site became in the minds of the



- 72 -
authorities a "four-star" subdivision where housing construction standards
had to be closely monitored. Thus for the Bank, the infrastructure and
service standards were the main issue, whereas the Government was concerned
to prevent the project degenerating into a shantytown through the pro-
liferation of temporary shacks. To this day these two opinions have not
been reconciled.
Consequently, the lot purchasers in their turn came to have a
distorted view of this program as being different from the Pikine and
Guedjawaye subdivisions, owing to the existence and application of selection
criteria and the procedures involved that made the allocation of a lot a
privilege.
3.   IBRD supervision mission
The Senegalese project officials and Government bodies felt that
the regular Bank supervision missions were of genuine help to the project in
overcoming its difficulties. Because of the frequency of these missions (one
per quarter) progress could be closely monitored, specific targets set and
the various agencies concerned reminded of their commitments to DPA.
Nevertheless, the criticism was made that the missions did not
always consist of the same people, so that the continuity of dealings
between Senegal and the Bank sometimes suffered. In addition, the Bank
missions were perceived as "control and monitoring missions," during the
critical periods of the project.
Senegal would have liked the supervision missions visiting Dakar
to have assessed the local constraints and conveyed their findings to
Washington, with a view to obtaining greater understanding on the part of
the Bank. However, in the specific case of the Camb6rene project, the
Bank as a whole had invested so much of its institutional prestige that



- 73 -
it could not afford a failure. This meant that the supervision missions'
ability to influence Bank headquarters remained slight, despite their
desire to help Senegal.
For its part, DPA feels that the Bank supervision missions were
most diligent and valuable, especially as they served to spur on the
government departments involved in the project. However, the missions
often meant a work overload for DPA , in the form of preparation of docu-
ments, detailed summaries, statistics, etc. Added to the daily tasks of
project management, the work entailed by the supervision missions was &n
additional burden for DPA.
Lastly, there is a general feeling on the part of the Senegalese
agencies concerned that the Bank experts sought to influence, in a way
favorable to their own views, Senegalese customs and ways of thinking.
Referred to as the "expert mentality," the behavior of the Bank personnel
in supervising projects financed by it is perceived as an attempt to impose
analyses, concepts and philosophy options that do not take sufficient account
of the country's own choices.
4.   Slum upgrading:  example of Fass Paillote
The Government agreed to the inclusion of a component termed
"slum upgrading" in the site and services credit. Fass was selected
hastily, before the land tenure situation and constraints in that area
were properly taken into consideration.
Following a preliminary study by NEDECO in 1974, the upgrading
project was revised by SMUH in 1977. As submitted to the Government, the
conclusions of this second study pointed up the difficulties in carrying
out such an operation in that area and it was decided to abandon the idea.



- 74 -
However, the Government did not go back on its agreement to try
out the upgrading approach in other areas, although it let it be known that
it wanted the sites selected to be "acceptable" in the context of the
Cap-Vert master plan and expected the operations to be less costly than
the site and services projects.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director, Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Subject: Completion Report of the Site and Services Project
Ref.:     Your letter of March 14, 1983
Dear Mr. Kapur:
We have studied with great interest the completion report on the
Site and Services project which you were kind enough to forward to us with
your above-referencecd letter.
Generally speaking, we share the conclusions of this report, which
has the advantage of being an exhaustive balance sheet of not only the
achievements but also the mistakes and problems involved in carrying out this
operation.
For further programs of this type, we would recommend improvements
in project design anc a strengthening of the Direction des Parcelles Assainies
(Site and Services Directorate).
I.        Design of Site and Services Projects
Improvements needed in this area:
(a) reduce the site size;
(b) define infrastructure standards more flexibly;
(c) widen the income range of the target population;
(d) provide a system of housing loans more attuned to the target
population.
Above all, in order to avoid the stresses and strains that incurred
during this first experiment, the borrower should be allowed greater freedom
of action in project design.



- 76 -
II.       Strengthening of the Direction des Parcelles Assainies (DPA -- Sites
and Services Directorate)
As you are aware, DPA is the executing agency for projects of this
type. After ten years of coexistence with the Office des Habitations a Loyer
Modere (OHLM -- Moderate-Income Housing Office), the time has now come to
consolidate the institutional gains achieved by DPA and increase its autonomy,
so as to equip it to achieve its future goals.
To this end, increased attention needs to be paid to staff training,
to increase their capacity in the fields of project study and design,
programming of execution, and financial management.
The Bank could assist Senegal in this area through the Urban Sector
Engineering credit.
Lastly, we should very much welcome the opening of discussions as
soon as possible between the World Bank and Senegal for a second Site and
Services project.
Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.
