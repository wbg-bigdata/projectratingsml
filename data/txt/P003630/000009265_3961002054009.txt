143(OWWUND AND UECO)OIKHDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TOE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PaOPOSmD CREDIT TO
TER PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CUINA
FOR A SHIP WASTE DISPOSAL PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation o. a proposed credit to
the People's Republic of China for SDR 11 mll1ion ($15 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard terms for 35 years,
including ten years' grace. Together with a grant of $30 million from the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the credit would assist six of the largest
ports in China--Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Xiamen--in
refurbishing existing and/or establishing modern new facilities for handling
and disposing of, in an environmentally sound manner, ships' wastes that would
otherwise be dumped in international or Chinese coastal waters to the detri-
ment of the marine environment. The project would also establish a model that
could be replicated and eventually extended to other ports in China, further
enhancing GEF's global environmental objectives. Proposed onlending terms
between the Government (GOC) and the Port Authorities are: interest rate of
1.5 percent per annum for a period of 15 years, including five years' grace.
The Port Authorities will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.      Background.  China has undergone rapid economic growth over the past
decade, which has been reflected in substantial growth in foreign and domestic
trade and consequent growth in international and domestic shipping traffic
through its ports. As a signatory to the 1973 and 1978 MARPOL Conventions
(International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution), GOC has
agreed to provide facilities for the reception, treatment and disposal of
ships' wastes, including oil-contaminated ballast and bilge waters (MARPOL
Annex 1), chemically-contaminated waters (MARPOL Annex 2), and sanitary sewage
(MARPOL Annex 4) (but not garbage--MARPOL Annex 5). All six ports, at present
receiving World Bank assistance under five different operations, handle signi-
ficant volumes of traffic, foreign as well as domestic, and these generate
some 1.25 million tons of wastes annually. Much of this is now believed to be
discharged at sea or in the coastal waters of China. The problem will only
get worse in the future with further growth in traffic.
3.      In view of the above, there is an urgent need to equip the ports with
facilities to handle the wastes, thereby eliminating their discharge in
international waters. The facilities to be established at the project ports
would also serve as a model for other Chinese, as well as regional, ports.
Most of the facilities available at present in the six ports need to be
rehabilitated, modernized, and/or expanded. Provision of proper facilities
would facilitate the stricter enforcement of the relevant laws and regula-
t:ons.
4.      GOC promulgated *the Marine Environmental Protection Law of the
People's Republic of Chinaw on August 23, 1982; it came into force on March 1,
1983. It includes provisions for the prevention of pollution damage to the
marine environment by coastal construction projects, by offshore oil explora-
tion, by land-based pollutants, and by vessels. Another law was promulgated
for control of the dumping of wastes at sea on March 6, 1985. Authority for



-2-
enforcing the laws is given to the rational Environment Protection Agency
(NEPA), which oversees the Provincial Administrations that actually carry out
the work. In almost every port, there is an Environment Protection Bureau
(EPB) that polices pollution on land, the Harbor Superintendency Bureau (under
MOC) that monitors pollution in waters of the port area, and the State Oceano-
graphic Administration (SOA) which controls pollution of sea waters outside
the ports' jurisdiction.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  GOC has designated environmental
protection and improvement as on important goal under its eighth five-year
plan (1991-1996). However, heavy demands on the available resources, parti-
cularly foreign exchange resources, including demands for investments in
additional port capacity and in modernization of facilities and equipment,
constrain the ability of the Port Authorities to finance the extensive facil-
ities necessary to handle ships' wastes. Without proper facilities the
pollution by the dumping of ships' wastes in the three seas bordering China
will continue unabated, and will in iact continue to grow with the projected
growth in the country's foreign trade and associated shipping traffic. This
is a situation where a modest contrib.tion from the Association in siupport of
GEF's efforts to assist GOC in establishing modern ship waste handling facil-
ities will demonstrate not only the environmental benefits of such facilities
to China but also the feasibility of recovering the cost of such facilities
through appropriate charges to users.
6.      Project ObJective.  The objective of the proposed project is to
reduce pollution of international and territorial waters caused by ships'
wastes through: (a) improved monitoring and analysis of the nature and
magnitude of the problem; (b) improved policy, regulatory and incentive
frameworks; and (c) the provision of facilities to receive, treat and safely
dispose of ship wastes.  Towards this end, it will provide financial and
technical assistance to GOC and the six Port Authorities for the construction
and/or rehabilitation and expansion of ships' waste disposal facilities.
While limited to the six ports serving a major part of China's sea-borne
international traffic, the proposed project will serve as a model for other
ports in the country, as well as for ports in other countries, particularly
those in the region, and provide a solid basis for environmental monitoring
activities and oil spill contingency planning.
7.      Project Description.  The project has two components:  a national
component and a ports' component. The national component comprises: (a) the
establishment of baseline data on international ship traffic, related waste
types and quantities through preparation of a pilot inter-port ship waste
monitoring system to facilitate monitoring and enforcement; (b) preparation of
a comprehensive oil spill contingency plan for each port; (c) preparation of
the term3 of reference of a study for a Large Marine Ecosystem monitoring
program for the Yellow Sea; (d) undertaking of a study to assess and develop a
system for the treatment of chemically contaminated water; (e) provision of
facilities to upgrade environmental monitoring capabilities at the ports,
coastal waters as well as international waters, and promotion of coordination
among the various authorities; (f) preparation of a tarrif schedule based on
cost recovery.for ship waste reception and disposal; and (g) provision of
consultant services and training. The ports' component comprises: (a)
provision or development of appropriate waste reception and disposal facili-
ties at the ports of Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou;



- 3 -
and (b) the establishment or upgrading of environmental monitoring and
enforcem6et by the Port Authorities.
8.      The total cost of the project is estimated at $64.8 million, with a
foreign exchange component of $23.0 million. Of the total financing required,
GEF would provide $30 million equivalent, the Association would finance
$15 million equivalent, and GOC and the Port Authorities the remaining
$19.8 million. The procurement methods and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B and a timetable of key project processing events in
Schedule C. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1995, and
disbursements completed by June 30, 1996.
9.      Agreed Actions/Conditions.  During negotiations with GOC, agreement
was reached on the following key matters:
(a)     GOC will submit to the Association, by June 30, 1994, a proposal
for an appropriate tariff schedule, based on cost recovery, for
the services of the waste disposal facilities and this will be
introduced by all six ports by June 30, 1995, taking into
account the A_sociation's comments;
(b)     the Xiamen Port Authority will establish, by June 30, 1993, an
adequately staffed Environment Protection Bureau, to supervise
and operate the proposed ship waste disposal facilities; and
(c)     GOC and each of the Port Authorities will jointly set up a
coordinating team at each port comprised of representatives from
the concerned Port Authority, EPB, NEPA, and SOA under terms of
reference agreed with IDA, by December 31, 1992.
10.     Environment Aspects.  The design and implementation of the project
and the operation of the project facilities after completion would comply with
GOC's laws and regulations on environment protection, which are more than
adequate by international standards. Worker safety and environment safety
features will be incorporated in the design of all components. Completion of
the project will help to reduce pollution resulting from the discharge at sea
of oil-contaminated waters, sanitary sewage and garbage/solid wastes.
11.     Benefits.  The six ports selected for the project handle some 90 per-
cent of the international shipping serving the sea-borne foreign trade of the
People's Republic of China. In addition, these ports serve a significant
portion of the country's domestic maritime traffic. In several of the ports,
the lack or poor capability of waste reception facilities obliges the Port
Authorities to allow ships to discharge their wastes at sea or has created
considerable delays in serving the ships. This contributes to port ineffi-
ciency and to pollution of both international and Chinese coastal waters.
Provision of the proposed facilities should contribute to a major improvement
to the marine environment quality and serve as a model for establishing
similar facilities in other Chinese ports.
12.     Risks.  The main risks relate to project implementation and cost
recovery. As this is a substantially new activity for most of the ports,
technical assistance through close project supervision will be provided to
ensure satisfactory implementation. As to cost recovery, PRC's record in the
matter of introducing ^u3quate cost recovery mechanisms has so far been good,



-4
and GOC has indicated that there would be no difficulty in the ports introduc-
ing a cost-based tariff schedule for the new services.
13.     Recommendation.  I am s4tisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the credit.
