OF THU 1BRD TO TMU ENICUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PU0POSD IAA  TO NACIONAL FIUNCIURA, S.E.C.
WITH THU GUARANTEE OF TIM NWITED MEXICAN STATES
POR A sCIENCE AND UCILOGT INnRABTRUCTURU PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAPIN) for US$189 million equivalent is
submltted for your approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed
by the United Mexican States, would be repayable over 15 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and
charges. The National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), the
National Center of Metrology (CENAM); the Ministry of Commerce and
Industrial Development, Directorate General of Standards (SECOFI/DGN); and
the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI) would be the executing
agencies.
2.          Backaround.  Public spending on science and technology in
Mexico declined in real terms over the decade of the 1980s with fiscal
austerity, from 0.45 percent to .0.26 percent of GDP, and preliminary
information suggests that private sector spending declined as well. This
was lower than in comparable middle-income developing countries and far
lower than in industrial countries. The effectiveness of the public
institutions implementing science and technology policy also declined over
the 1980. from an already fairly weak base, and they lost credibility with
the scientific community. The mechanisms for science project funding were
increasingly politicized, and administrative costs consumed much of the
limited funds available. Technology infrastructure institutions providing
metrology services and intellectual property protection lagged behind
comparable developing countries.
3.          The result was a deterioration of both human and physical
science and technology capital at a time when continuing technological
change in the rest of the world, and rapid unilateral opening-up of the
Mexican economy (and the prospect of further opening-up with the North
American Free Trade Agreement), were greatly increasing the need for local
science and technology capability.
4.          With the success of the Mexican economic reform program of
stabilization and deregulation in recent years following the economic
crisis of 1982, and the prospect of sustained private sector-led growth,
new priorities have been defined. The Government has placed emphasis on
strengthening and rebuilding Mexico's science and technology capability to
facilitate modernization of the economy and integration in the world
marketplace. The Government set out a new policy framework in the National
Program for Science and Technology Modernization 1990-94, and the National
Program for Industrial Modernization 1990-94. In the context of the
proposed project, the Government has provided a statement on National
Science and Technology Modernization Policies which contains a strategy for
implementation actions over the period of the proposed project. The



Government plans to increase budgetary resources for science and technology
with the broad objective of achieving expenditures in both the public and
private sectors of one percent of CDP in 1994 and two percent of GDP in the
year 2000. Public funding for scientific research is being increased, with
increasing allocation by competitive means, and the relative burden for
investment in technology development is being shifted from the public to
the private sector. Many of the necessary policy changes have already been
made, and now the emphasis is shifting to strengthening institutional
structures and implementing mechanisms.
5.          Proiect Oblectives.  To address the concerns outlined above,
the objectives of the proposed project are to:
(i) Rationalize Public sector fundino by supporting increased public
spending fort (a) grants for scientific research projects and scientific
equipment infrastructure projects, with improved allocation on a
competitive basis, to generate relevant research and train scientists; and
(b) technology infrastructure in the areas of metrology, standardization,
and intellectual property protection to improve services to industry,
enhance competitiveness, and increase attractiveness for foreign
investment; and
(ii) Develo, institutions by supporting the restructuring of CONACYT,
and start-up of institutions providing support to industry in metrology
(CENAM), standardization (SECOFI/DGN), and intellectual property protection
(IMPI), to improve the efficiency of public support in these areas.
6.          Proaiet Descritjaon.  The four components of the proposed
project ares
(i) Science Proarams (US$765 million, 86 percent of total costs).
This component would support the first four years of CONACYT's new science
programs beginning in 1992. The main programs fund individual research
projects and equipment infrastructure projects open to universities and
other research institutions, both public and private. The programs stress
scientific merit, rather than particular sectors or applications. Award of
the grants is on the basis of transparent, competitive peer review by
evaluation committees, including foreign scientists, in eight broad areas.
The research project grants mainly fund equipment, materials, visiting
researchers, and dissemination costs, but the sponsoring institutes will
fund the affiliated researchers' salaries and overheads. The results of
the projects would be publicly available. Any intellectual property, such
as a patent, would accrue on a refusal basis, first to CONACYT, then to the
sponsoring institution, and then to the researcher. The scientific
equipment infrastructure projects are aimed at strengthening institutions'
capacity for carrying out research, and are funded co-operatively with
research institutions. Other programs fund retention and repatriation of
top quality Mexican scientists, and creation of chairs of excellence in
universities. Pilot programs in 1991 worked well, and the experience is
feeding into the 1992 programs. The level of spending on science research
would provide enough funds to get research going again, while recognizing



the "newness" of the programs and Allocation processes.  Bank financing
would be US$ISO million, for laboratory equipment, computers and Materials;
(ii) Mtrolca  (US$63 million, 7 percent of total costs).  -his
component would support the start-up of the new metrology center (CENAM) to
provide primary metrology services to industry, and facilitate the
development of a private system to provide secondary metrology services.
Technical co-operation is being provided by industrial countrJes,
particularly Germany and the Us. The construction of CENAM's premises is
being partly financed by the Industrial Technology Project (Ln. 2747-ME).
Bank financing would be US$30 million, for scientific equipment, technical
assistance, training and promotion;
(iii) Standardization (US$17 million, 2 percent of total costs).
This component would support building capacity for metrology, standards,
testing, certification and quality assurance in industry. DGN has prepared
an indicative "privatization" program for standards and quality assurance
which would encourage a larger role by the private sector. Preparatory
work to develop a national consensus on defining and implementing a
comprehensive national standardization and conformity assessent system,
and to assess existing capacities and the needs for up-grading to world-
class facilities is being financed under the Industrial Restructuring
Project (Ln. 3087-ME). The resulting standardization program would begin
in 1993. Bank financing would be US$3 million, for training and promotion;
and
(iv) Intellectual Property Protection (US$41 million, 5 percent of
total costs). This component would support the start-up of IMPI to
implement the new industrial property law passed in July 1991. A team of
consultants, including the World Intellectual Property Organization, have
completed background studies for IMPI. The institute is expected to be
created during 1992 and begin operations from January 1, 1993. Bank
financing would be US$6 million, for international consultants, computer
systems and training.
7.          Total project costs would be US$886 million.  The proposed Bank
loan would finance US$189 million equivalent, and US$1.5 million is being
provided from previous loans. Schedule A shows the estimated project costs
and financing plan. Retroactive financing would be granted for up to ten
percent of the loan amount or US$18.9 million equivalent for eligible
expenditures incurred for the science component after January 1, 1992, when
the new programs began. Schedule B shows the methods of procurement, and
the disbursement schedule. Schedule C shows the timetable of project
processing.  Schedule D shows the status of Bank group operations.  A map
and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10468-ME, dated April 30, 1992, are also
attached.
8.          Project Imgleentation.  NAPIN would be responsible for project
co-ordination. CONACYT would implement the science component; CENAN the
metrology component; SICOFI/DGN the. standardization component; IMPI the
intellectual property component. Each of these agencies would have the



capacity to implement the components, and would draw on international
expertise where appropriate. Project supervision is expected to take place
at least twice a year to monitor progress. including ensuring adequacy of
funding. Specific annual reviews would consider progress against agreed
quantitative project implementation indicators.
9.          PJeoact sustainabilit.  For the science component, the main
design feature to enhance oustainability is the new funding allocation
mechanism on the basis of transparent, competitive peer review which has
gained broad acceptance in the active scientific community. For the
technology infrastructure components, the main design features to enhance
sustainability are the institutional strengthening and involvement of the
private sector. For the metrology and intellectual property components,
cost recovery would be in line with international norms.
10.         Lessons fro exSerience.  The proposed project has benefitted
from lessons learned in similar projects, particularly the Brazils Science
Research and Training Project approved in 1990. For the science component,
the proposed project design incorporates: clearly defined funding
allocation rules to avoid discretion and gain broad acceptance in the
scientific cosmunity; comprehensive, multi-year grants to avoid wasteful
fragmentation; emphasis on dissemination and interaction with the
industrial sector; and strong administrative capability for careful
monitoring and evaluation of research results. For the technology
infrastructure components, the proposed project design foresees:
involvement of the private sector '.n the definition of the programs to
ensure they are tailored to their needs; international expertise to ensure
conformity with international norms; and strong administrative capability
to ensure credibility and sustainabi.ity.
1.        Rationale for sank Involvm_nt.  The proposed project conforms
with the Bank's overall strategy for Xexico, which is designed to support
the Government's efforts to redefine and rationalize the role of the public
sector and to lay the foundation for private sector-led growth. Basic
science research and technology infrastructure are "public goods", where
government involvement may improve both production and consumption
efficiency.
12.         The Bank has been involved in dialogue and lending to support
science and technology initiatives through previous projects. Loan 2747-ME
of 1986 provided directed credit for technology development by firms, and
funding for strengthening R&D centers and metrology services. The Loan
3087-ME supported policy improvements in foreign investment regulation,
technology transfer rules and intellectual property protection. Both loans
supported studies which contributed to the design of the proposed project.
The previous projects have been implemented satisfactorily, but because
they were focussed on technology policy and development, the experience has
little relevance for the proposed project which is focussed on basic
science research, with a secondary focus on technology infrastructure. The
Bank's role in the proposed project has largely been catalytic, encouraging
and facilitating the timely implementation of programs to which the



Govenrment is publicly committed. The Bank has mobilized international
consultants with extensive experience in other countries and other Bank
projeate on science policy and funding, public assistance for technology
development, metrolovy, standards and quality assurance, and intellectual
property protection matters to assist with preparation of the Government's
program and the proposed project.
13.         lasus and Actions. At neLotia2ons, agreement between the
Bank and the Government was reached regarding: (a) the Government policy
statement on science and technology infrastructure; (b) any changes in the
Rules of Operation of PACINZ would have to be acceptable to the Bank; (c)
the two preparatory studies on standards and quality assurance will be
discussed with the Bank In November 1992 to develop the program to be
implemented in 19931 (d) the decree creating IMPI will be issued in 19925
(e) the annual and mid-term reviews, and implementation indicators
including the process to assure adequate Federal budgets for the project;
and (f) audititg. arrangements. Conditions of loan effectiveness would be a
signed agreement between NAFIN and the Government for transferring the loan
proceeds, and signed contractual arrangements with CONACYT and CENAM. The
conditions of disbursement fors (i) the standardization component would be
provision of a program acceptable to the Bank to begin implementation in
19931 (ii) the IMPI component would be issuance of the decree creating
IMPI, appointment of the top management and their taking up their
positions, signing of contractual arrangements between NAFIN and  OIPI and
receipt by the Bank of a satisfactory legal opinion on them, and
confirmation of adequate Federal funding for 1993; and (iiI) for the
COCNacT component would be that no withdrawals in excess of US$5.0 million
equivalent be made for any science research or equipment infrastructure
project.
14 *         nvironmental Matters  The proposed operation has an
environmental rating of "Co and would incur no direct environmental costs.
Multidisciplinary reseArch on environmental issues has been identified as
an area of emphasis under the science programs. The Rules of Operation of
PACINE state that any proposed research involving high-risk transgenic
organisms would be conducted under safety standards acceptable to the Bank.
15.        Proiect -enefits.  The science component would help rationalize
public spending on research project and equipment grants, and strengthen
the responsible public institutions, generating relevant research and human
capital development, and modernizing Mexico's science and technology
capability. The technology infrastructure components would improve
services to industry, enhancing competitiveness and attractiveness for
foreign investment. By their nature the benefits of the proposed project
are broad and dispersed and hard to quantify. While it is not feasible to
estimate an ex ante economic rate of return, studies have shown high ex
post social rates of return to spending on basic science in industrialized
countries. CONACYT and the Bank are co-operating to develop an approach to
economic assessment of the new science programs.



16.        Rtpigtg g nkn.  The main risk for the science component is that
the allocation mechanism would become politicized and fragmented again, and
reinforce past patterns of science research rather than looking to future
needs. However, the new PACrME rules are clear and there is a strong
commitment to the new allocation system on the part of both the authorities
and the science community, which should make a return to previous practices
unlikely. The main risk for the technology infrastructure components is
that the close links required between responsible public sector agencies
and private industry to build confidence in the programs would still be
lacking and the services would be poorly used. However, the authorities
are cognizant of this and have built implementation mechanisms and strong
teams with close consultation between interested parties to ensure
successful implementation.
17.         Remme*ation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
