Overview
1.    The objective of the above project is tD establish capacity in the Government to ensure
the sustainable development of the country's mining sector. This is expected to be achieved
through the setting up of an effective regulatory framework to carry out all mining activities
in an envir     y sound manner. Pilot tesfting of different mechanisms and techniques
will be used tD improve the productiviy and financial viability of small-scale miners while at
the same time reducing environmental impact of these activides. The aim is to provide
incentives to small-scale miners to contain their activities tD clearly demarcated areas of land,
providing them with access to geological inmormation and technology as well as extension
services to enable mining activities to be carried out in an environmentally sustainable
manner. In addition, the project will address the environmental impact of past mining
activities through the pilot testing of different techniques and mechanisms for reclamation and -.
rehabilitation of priority areas.
2.    The project aims to provide assistance to the Goverment to achieve the following
objectives with regard to environmental management in the mining sector: (i) minimization or
pre-emption of envirommental impact of new mines; (ii) contaiment of the impact of
established mines; and Ciii) assessment of best practices and options for ensuring the
reabilitation of disturbed land. In order to achieve these objectives, the project will provide
technical assistance and capacity building support to the mining sector agencies. In addition,
the project will carry out pilot testing of alternative techniques including equipment and
processing technology which will increase the productivity of small-scale miners while at the
same time containing the environmental impact of these activities. The equipment and
technology to be pilot tested, will be limited to those that are already operational and have
been approved as being environmentally responsible in the source countries. They will be
tested for applicability to local conditions and acceptability by the small-scale mining
communities. The project will also address the reclamation and rehabilitation of land degraded
through past small-scale mining activities. The reclamation and rehabilitation activities will be
carried out on a pilot basis, to test best practices and cost-effective mechanisms.
3.    Ihis project has been classified as Category B, according to the Bank guidelines
pertaining to environmental review procedure. The design of the project benefitted from
several studies that were carried out by the Minerals Commission of Ghana, to ascertain the
impact of small-scale mining activities on the ecology and on communities. These studies
have assessed the social, environmental, health and safety impact of small-scale mining.
Summaries of two of these reports (Socio-economic Impact of Small-sale Mining and
Environmental Audit to Study Effects of Small-scale Mining Activities on Vegetation), are
attached to this document, as Annex I and Annex IL

Nature of the Project and Environmental Analysis
4.    The project is mainly a technical assistance project and the only investments are of a
pilot nature. The project contains a significant degree of flexibility in design, unlike a
traditional project where the type of investment and the resulting impacts on the eco-systems
and communities could be asessed during the preparatory stages of the project. In this
project the equipment to be utilized would be detrmined during the course of project
execution, depending upon the applicability to local conditions and acceptabBity by the
communities concerned. Likewise, the reclamation of land would be carried out on Lands
detemined by the Govemment and by communities, as being priority. Reclamation will be
carried out using community involvement and participatory methods. Once the types of
equipment and processing techniques are determined under the project, and the reclamation
methods and locations are demined in consultation with the recipients, specific
envtironmentalanalysis will be carried out as part of project implementadon, to determine best
practices and midgation measures.
5.    During appraisal of the project, a Beneficiary Particpation Workshop will be held, in
a location where small-scale miners are active to enable inputs of all stakeholders to be
incorporated into the details of project design and arangements for implementation. Ideas of
beneficiaries will be sought, particularly with regard to the implementation of the pilot
acivities.
Prject Components as they address Enviromnental Management in the Mlnii8g Sector
6.    A brief description of the project components in the context of how they address
environmental management in the mning sector is provided below:
Strengthing of Mning Sector Institutions
7.    This component comprises four sub-components:
(a)    hnproved Regulatory Framework. Under this sub-component, the project
would provide assistance to the mining sector agencies to review existing
legislation, regulations and monitoring and enforcement activities in order to
determine modifications for the improvement of the institutional and
regulatory frmework. Guidelines and standards would be developed for
environmental monitoring and control of all mning activities. This activity
would be carried Out by the Minerals Commission (MC) in Ghana, in close
collaboration with and under the guitance of the Environmental Protection
Council (EPC).
(b)   Improvement in Enforcernent. Support will be provided under this sub-
component to the Mines Department (M) to caury out inspection, monitoring
and enforcement responsibilities, particularly with regard to environmental
inpact and health hazards. Equipment will be procured for the Mines
Deparanent to carry out monitoring and sampling of air, soil and water in and
around mine sites.



-3-
(c)    Environmental Informatdon. Assistance under the project would extend to
the setting up of a mining/environmental data base which would be part of a
comprehensive mineral information system. The environmental data gathered
by the Wmes Department, petaining to soil and water quality in and around
mine sites and information pertaining to mine effluents would be fed into the
data base. This data base would fully consistent with and compatible to the
Environmental Information System being developed at the EPC.
(d)    Studies. Studies to be carried out under this component include an analysis of
appropriate mechanisms to enforce regulations, including (i) an assessment of
the applicability of performance bonds and other measures to ensure that mine
operators carry out eavironmental mitigation; and (ii) a pollution abatement,
water and sanitation strategy for the township of Obuasi, where past
environmental degradation is especially severe.
Assistance to Smalkscale Mining Enterprises
8.    Under this component, equipment and technology known to be environmentally
responsible, would be pilot tested to determine their acceptability to local small-scale miners.
The dissemination of these as well as processing technology which is environmentally
sustainable is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of small-scale mining activities.
The project aims to provide incentives to small-scale miners to contain their activities to
specific locations in order to minimize environmental impact on extensive land areas.
Extension services would be provided under the project to carry out mining activities in a
responsible manner, which would include traWing in activities such as the safe disposal of
mine wastes, handling of toxic or hazardous materials, safety in mne operations and the
restoration of the land utilized to an acceptable state.
9.    Under this component, degradation of lands through past mining activities of small-
scale miners would be addressed through the pilot testing of methods to reclaim and
rehabilitate priority areas. The MC has already commenced the idetification of priority land
areas that have been degraded, in consultation with the EPC and with the departments of land
and forestry. Reclamation work has already begun on some priority areas in the Greater
Accra area. The project would build upon the work already carried out, and carry out pilot
testing of different mechanisms for rehabilitation including participatory approaches where
community involvement would be sought in the reclamation and reforestation activities. The
aim of this sub-component would be to determine cost-effective methods for future
reclamation activities. Reclamation activities will include the closure of abandoned shafts and
surface dumps and filling of mined out areas. Rehabilitated land will be planted with fast-
growing indigenous vegetation, mobilizing community participation in the selection of plant
varieties as well as with regard to the methods of afforestation.

1.0 INTROD=NT
W          1.1  Small Scale Mining had been fraught with illegalities due
mainly to foreign exchange restrictions.   Resulting from the
t          cStructural Adjustment Programme (SAP) the sector was legalized in
May 1989 by PNDCL 218.  The Minerals Commission was charged with
the responsibility of implementing the law, thus the -Small Scale
Mining Project.  The purpose of this study is to conduct a socio-
economic impact study of the project and to provide guidelines f'or-
the second phase.
1.2  Study Area and Tarcet Group and Kethodologa
The study area comprised all the Small Scale Mining areas
(except Kibi and Konongo areas),  and the target groups were
considered to be the Project Management Unit (PMU), the Extension
-          Officers (Field Officers), and importantly, the Concession Owners,
Workers and the Licenced Buying Agents (LBA's).
The study used both Primary and Secondary Data.
2.0 GENERAL CHARACTERISTIC8 OF THE S8 MINERS
2.1  Family Size Age and Marital Status
General characteristics of the target group (the Miners) are
III        very vital for planning purposes.  The average age of the Miners
(including the Buyers) is 38; however the Workers seem to be much
younger, with an average age of 33. Eighty-eight percent of the
target group are married with a family size of seven persons, five
of whom are dependants.

2.2  ocaupation ad Re119i@n
The major occupation for about 65% of the respondents is
mining business, the rest have farming as their major occupation.
Those who have mining as their major occupation have farming as
N         their minor occupation and vice versa.    There  are two main
N         religions at the target area, namely: Christian and Muslim.  About
77% of the Survey are Christians while 19% are Muslims, the rest
being pagans.
N         2.3  Education
It is interesting to note that about 89% of the respondgnts
PU        have had formal education ranging from Middle to Post Secondary
a         School.  The LBA's have all had formal education that will enable
them to read and write some English. About 87% of the Workers have
N         had Middle School education.  Just 11% of the respondents have not
had any formal education.
2.4  EthnicitY
Most of the operators are Akans (84%), followed by North-
;l         erners (12%), and then Ewes (4%).  About 63% of the LBA's and the
Workers respectively are migrant operators however 64% of the
N          concession owners are indigene.  On the whole less than half (43%)
of the operators are indigene while majority (57%) are migrant
operators.

3. 0 DENEIICTCRY PERCEPTION OF THE PRQJECT
3.1 The Minerals Commission was charged with the responsibility
of implementing the SSM Project which made the PNDCL 218 operative.
The most important beneficiaries of the law, viz-a-vis the project,
are the Small Scale Miners, which comprise the Concession Owners,
the Licence Buying Agents, and the Workers. In order to ascertain
the authenticity of their responses, the study tested the miners
awareness of the project/law.
3.2  Awareness*
The study indicated that virtually all the three groups of
respondents were aware of the project and the Law, except-some 3%
of the Workers who expressed unawareness of the project. They all
got to know about the project/law mostly through the radio and
through friends; and most of them got to know about it in 1989.
3.3  Peroeetion
The first impression the miners got was that the project was
going to make them rich because they could then operate without
apprehension and going through cumbersome registration procedures.
They perceived the project to be job creating, also.
xv
a-



3.4 P*resnt Situation
Several responses were recorded from the respondents
concerning the benefits of the project. The Concession Owners and
the LBA's h'ave similar responses, ranging from (top priority) "I
now have enough money to look after my children in school; I am
able to expand my farm and other jobs" to "I am able to build a
hoUse". As regards the workers their first relief was that they
had no fears in working since they could now operate under 0
Licenced Concession Owners. Their main benefits can be read from
their responses. "I can now get a regular source of income to look
after myself and family; My living conditions have changed for the
better, "and, "I have been able to improve upon my farming
business". Few of the workers however expressed negative feelings
about the project, alleging that they saw no improvement in the'ir
lives because the mineral content in the land where they worked was
very low, so they got very little after hard work.
3.5 Work Problem
There is some light animosity between the LEA's and the
Concession owners since each operator is under different entities.
Thus the linkage between the LBA's and the Concession Owners is one
of uneasy Co-existence through the Workers/Diggers.

4.0 *    CZNLfi&UBDNx
4.1 The marketing function is performed by the Precious Minerals
Marketing  Corporation  (PMMC),  although  under  the  Minerals
.    Commission, but outside the project domain.  The study observed
very pertinent marketing problems from the Miners.
4;2  Differeaces in Valuation
The Cencession Owners and the LBA's find vast differences in
valuation between them and PNMC.  The LAB's complained that when
M         they sent their minerals to PMKC the valuers would not allow them
to see toe process of carat determination. The Concession ouners
5J        see another difference from the type of machines or Scales-, both
parties use, in addition to the LBA's observation.
- _           Both the LBA's and the Concession Owners feel the present
M        -mariEgtIig arrangement is too expensive and risky.  They all have to
travel to Accra to sell their stuff, incurring very high
transportation cost, hotel bills and exposing them to risks of
keeping their stuff and money safe. This encourages illegal buying
_     and selling of the minerals, since the risk of selling at Accra is
=        higher than selling a chunk of the stuff to illegal buyers.  The
*   !    Workers alleged that there are fewer buyers in their areas of
"        operation so the buyers dictate the price and thus makes the
business unlucrative.   There is always the temptation to find
illegal buyers to  ;ell to them.   PMMC's monopoly position is
_        therefore hurting the project.
xvii
rn- '



4.3  PN0C4 PriCing PrOgAt=r
The basis for forecasting weekly prices by PMMC is by using
the weekly prices on the world market, and supplementing with their
perception of the future price trends.  Using the estimated and
real prices documented by PMMC, the consultants observed that the
procedure was not based on scientific method of forecasting where
econometric or simulation methods are employed. Thus any increase
in price is due to the depreciation of the local currency not on
demand and supply of gold in the world market.
4.4 gold and Diamond Pur-chases During Proieat Pariod
One of the objectives of the project is "to increase-the
official earnings from the sector". The available data indicate
that the SSM produced (or sold) 7,717 ounces of gold valuing P984
million in 1991 only, while the PMMC purchased 548,782 carats of
diamonds worth p6.5 billion in the same year.  It is estimated that
an average of J5 billion or US$13.3 million could be realized each
year  during  the  project  life.    (This  estimation  is  very
conservative), from production of gold and diamond from the Small
Scale Mining.  There is therefore a high prospect for the second
phase of the project if management would implement sone very
important suggestions by the Consultants.

5.0 ISOCIO-EcONOKZC
5.1 Nmg thu obi.atiTia or the Proiect axm:
-    To create employment in the  rural and urban areas,
especially to absorb the retrenched labour;
-    To improve mining skills of the Small Scale Miners and to
improve the production process or techniques;
-    To improve Small Scale Miners'  access to equipment,
capital and marketing outlets.
5.2  EmblovUent
The study revealed that about 1,200 retrenched workers-were
absorbed by the project, while the total estimated employiient by
the project is in the range of 24,000 and 30,000 if we consider
those operators who are not yet registered but are operating behind
some association names.  It was thus observed that each Concession
owner employed an averaged of over 60 workers,  while an LBA
_       employed an average of 4 people.   The the project therefore, has
fulfilled the first objective.
5.3  !mproovem9at of Minig Slcills
Mining Skills were measured in our study through training
and types of training attended by or given to the SSM's. Although
very few SSM's were trained in adulterated gold, health aspects,
Safety aspects and Operation of Simple Equipments and Methods of
N  *       working, as well as Emergency and First Aid Procedures, the
xix
N-~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_U



number is so negligible that it can be concluded that the trainings
wie not effective. Perhaps the second phase will consider this
objective very seriously.
5.4  Sourc. of Iinance/Credit
One of the important aspects of the project was to improve
SSM access to equipment and capital. The study tried to find out
where the operators obtained finance/or credit. The main source of
finance at the target area is Private Money Lender, followed by
Family Money, and Own savings. Sometimes they obtained some money-
from fiends.   None of the respondents obtained credit from :the
project or the bank. The study revealed that the objective quoted
above has not been addressed.  It is hoped that the second phase of
the project will tackle it seriously, if the miners are to adopt
new technology and improve their mining skills.
6.0  HOUSEHOLD INCON END WELFARE OF THE S        SAL c 89AI"MNERS
6.1  The ultimate aim of any project is to make the beneficiaries
better off. Among the terms of reference of the study is one which
*         requests for determination of (household) income, consump-tion, and
welfare patterns of the target group of the project.
S
-~--



6.2 No.s.hold Incomes in the 8urvey area
-              The household incomes were measured via expenditure pattern
-||g      and how much respondents were prepared to sell their services.  The
LBA, on the average, spends ¢188,5OO every month and the breakdown
is as follows: 32% on food, 29% on housing, 10% each on clothing
and transportation, and the rest on Education, donations etc. This
-         suggests that an LBA in 1992 was earning approximately X2.3 million
W||S    per annum.   The monthly expenditure for a Concession Owner was
calculated to be S142,384 on the average. The distribution is
similar to that of the LBA.  Thus the annual estimated income for
a Concession Owner was 91.7 million. Similar analysis was done for
No        the worker, and his monthly expenditure was  9O,O00, suggestinn  an
annual Income/Expenditure of X1.08 million.  Asked how much they
would sell their labour/services for, the worker who spends C90,000
g         a month would sell his services for about g70,000 a month, the LBA
will settle for Z145,000 a month, while the Concession Owner will
"         be content with C122,321 a month.  Probing for more information the
" .       .-.iners said that they also earned substantial money from their
secondary occupation.   The LBA earns ¢166,000 a month from his
*         secondary occupation, the Concession Owner earns gS3,000 while the
worker earns £28.000 a month from his secondary occupation. If you
q         add the value of his services to the secondary occupation it can be
*         concluded that  the  monthly  income  far  exceeded  the monthly
expenditure, suggesting that the excess is saved.  For example the
worker's total monthly estimated income is C97,400 which exceeds
--! ehe expenditure by  Z7,400.   Thus income via expenditure is a
urn~~~~~~~~~x
'' -U



conservative measure.  If we accept the expenditure as income,i it
can be safely said that those in the Small Scale Mining
sector/business are far better off financially than Chief Directors
in the Civil or Public services.
6.3  8Lvinas
The above analysis shows that some of the respondents make
some savings (difference between expenditure and income).   The
study showed that less than 40% of the survey actually save.  Those
who save more are the Concession Owners.  The most common use of
savings of respondents is for investment in tools and equipment for
the business, however a few use their savings for consumption
q~~~
_        goods, especially electrical appliances, while some invest in'off-
mining business like farming. The usual reason for not saving is
that the proceeds are not enough.
U        6.4  Welfare of Resoondents
The welfare measurement in our study was assessed through
ownership of homes, work-days, and sick-days.  A quarter (25%) of
the respondents own their own homes; 46% of the concession owners
4'      own their own homes, followed by 31% of the LBA's and lastly 12% of
the workers.   On the average the miners work 6 days a week as
compared with the civil service of 5 days. * This may explain why
*        they earn more than the civil or public service. About 7 days a
month was recorded as sick-days.  The LBA's reported much more
xzii
U
U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 



sick-days (lO) than any of the other two. The Concession Owners
q        are more healthy than the LBA's.  About 7 sick-days a month for
_        workers are acceptable due to the labourous nature of their work.
7.0  KM.Q2MZAZIQN
7.1  The project has as part of its strategy to encourage the use
U        of improved equipment and appropriate technology, and this calls
for a viable credit scheme.  Such credit schemes can be effici-
ently effected through groupings like the Smallholder Credit Input
*        and Marketing Project (SCIMP) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA.):
The study revealed that out of the 104 respondents only 2B%-.(29
people) belong to some organizations.   Asked why they did not
belong to any organization in their community those who responded
negatively said there were no mass organisations in their
flu       communities.     Others  said  they  had  been  disappointed  by
organizations before.   The workers who do not belong to any
organization said they were not convinced by the objectives of
organizations.   All this suggests that there has not been any
deliberate effort by the project to organize the target group .nto
associations to benefit from some credit scheme. Efforts should be
made towards this direction if objective 5 of the project is to be
achieved.

8  .0 CONB!RAIN!S OF T1E OPERKTOR&
8.1  Several objectives for the successful implementation of the
project have been addressed in the study.  The study has traced the
activities. of  the  target  groups  (the  miners)  and  how  the
objectives/strategies impacted on these activities. Small Scale
Miners face several very important constraints that together limit
their ability to expand production.
8.2 Constraints Identified
The survey revealed that the most constraining resource is
mineral land, followed by money or finance/credit for operativ^t.
|lnll     Tools and EauiDment/Machines for mining ranked third.  The highest
constraint outside the domain of the project is good Drfce for
Rroduct, viz-a-viz marketing problem.  It is hoped that the second
~    phase of the project will address these issues very fervently.

I   9.0  AN ASBEBSXENT OF TNE ACHIEVEKENTS OF THE PROJECT 'I BOECTXVES
FROMX THE PONT OF VXEW OF TRE PROJECT/FIELD OFFICERS
9.1 The Nine Project/Field Officers interviewed indicated that
_         the objectives of the Project had been achieved to some extent.
They all mentioned that the objective of generating legitimate
employment in particular had been met. Another important objective
-         that a sizeable proportion (67%) mentioned as having been met was
the reduction in smuggling of minerals and increased earnings in
"         foreign exchange to the state.
9.2  Constraints ExDressed by the Project officers
"U              Some of the constraints to the effective performance and
subsequent achievement of the project's objectives were
U         identified.  The majority of the Project Officers (90%) stated that
the riaiditv of the lega1 framework was a major constraint.  More.
than half felt that the lack of adequate financial support and
aDDrobriate eguipment for mining and processinc operations had
hamPered the success of Small Scale Miners under the auspices of
the Project.   Other salient constraints mentioned was conflict
with/lack of co-operation from the staff of the Mines Department
and some district administrators.
An assessment of the delivery of the various components of
the Project that had been proposed was also made.  These included
-         training  for  project  staff;  and  technical,  financial  and
administrative assistance to Small Scale Miners.
xZV

9.3 Training for Proisot Offiar.
All project staff had benefitted from short-term (i.e. less
than three months) professional development programmes both locally
and externally under the auspices of the project.
Some programmes had been related to "Objectives-Setting" and
Project Planning. Other programmes had facilitated the develop-
ment of technical skills such as the testing and use of improved
equipment, gold metallurgy, extraction and assaying. Eighty-nine
per cent had benefitted from study-tours in Zimbabwe.
9.4  TeChniIa1 Uxuertise
The aim of the Project which is to give Small Scale Miners
access to technical expertise was considered to have been achieved
ff _    to some extent.  All Project Officers provide assistance to Small
Scale Miners by way of exposing them to more efficient methods of
mining processing and use of equipment. Other forms of assistance
<         related to technical aspects of the job given include issues in
health and safety, land reclamation and the tracing of rich gravel
zones.
9.5  Work-gethods
More than half (67%) of the Project Officers considered the
working methods of their clients economically acceptable.   The
three officers who felt that their working operations could be made
more efficient economically suggested that efforts should be made
to employ methods that will enhance recovery of the ore.

environmentally unacceptable. More than half of them stated that
while small Scale Miners destroyed the eco-system, they did not
seem to have any plans for reclamation. As such there was the need
to step up education for both Project Officers and Small Scale
Hiners..
on financial and finance - related assistance given by the
Project or under its auspices, the major form of assistance
provided has been credit/loan facilities for the purchase or hiring
of equipment.
9.6  Pro_Jet Officers'  ssistance to the SSK
As part of the package to assist Small Scale Miners, Project
Officers aee expected to provide them with administrative and
organisational assistance.  All the Project Officers interviewed
indicated that they give this form of assistance.   However in
certain key areas such as in records keeping, the formation and
management of  co-operatives and the. acquisition  of  relevant
permits, the officers indicated that they have not assisted Small
Scale Mining ventures to a large extent.

Xn view of the fact that the Field/Project Officers have
in their work, been confronted with the practical difficulties and
bottlenecks, their suggestions on improving the implementatioz? of
the project were solicited.
Their suggestions for improvement included the following:i
-    Regular training and uDdate of skills of both Proj'ect
Officers and Small Scale Minera; the Project Officers
suggested training in Business, Progect or Production
Manaaement for themselves.  They also suggested training
in   the   provision   of   extension   services   and
_           -    environmentally-friendly mining practices.
--.,        -    Amendment of Small Scale Gold Ninina Law to allow for
-limited RrosDectinc,  "blasting" and the inclusion of
other precious minerals (in addition to gold) in the law.
a              -    Intervention  of  authorities  in  the  allocation  of
concessions; namely, that government should intervene in
t- __ -the re-allocation of mined-out lands of large scale
mining concerns to Small Scale Miners.   Other viable
lands should be located, demarcated and made ready for
allocation.

-   A more conscious effort should be made to provide credit
at reasonable interest rates and ecuiDment to intended
benef iciaries; the possibility of establishing a Plant
Pool to assist Small Scale Miners was alsp to be
considered,
- -       Sg=ice centres should be stb hd at strategic places
(e.g.  District Centres)  to  offer  such  services: as
geological assistance and assaying. PMMC centres could
even be sited at the District Centres.

The study has shown that employment,. legalization of SSM,
enhancement of SSM activities, and increase of official earnings
enshrined in the project objectives have been effectively achieved.
However, two of the objectives, namely: improving mining skills,
and access to equipment and capital, have not been effectively
addressed. Marketing of the precious minerals by the SSM leaves
much to be desired.
The project officers also have observed similar achieve-
ments and bottlenecks of the project impact as stated above, and in
addition have observed anomalies in the legal framework of the
project and limitation in their capacity to deliver effective
extension services to the SS, as. vell as discordant elament
between the mines department and the district administration.
In view of the above, the study recommends that:
1.   More mineral lands of the large scale mining concerns be
released to SSM.
2.   The project should form the SSM into some groupings or
co-operatives to enable them benefit from credit, tools
and equipment lease or high -purchase.
3.   Government amend the Small Scale Gold Mining Law to
include limited prospecting and "blasting",  and the
inclusion of other precious minerals, in addition to
gold, in the law.

SHALL SCALE HINING PROJECT
Environmental Audit to Study the Effects of
Small Scale Hinina Activities on Vegetation
SUHMARY
The tormas of reference of this study required a study of
the impact of the activities of small scale gold and diam6nd&
miners on the environsenz.   The effects of the operations. on
the vegetation,  soil and ecology of 43 concessions. havo-been
studied. The concessions are in the Central, Eastern, Western
and Ashanti Regions and the majority lie in the Hoist Evergreen
and Hoist Sezi-Deciduous forest zones.   Vegetation types en-
countered are grassland,  forest regrouth, secondary thickets,
swamp forests and secondary forests.
Transects and quadrats were used during the survey. Plant
species were identified and the frequencies and families to
which they  belong determined.   The records presented include
.1      the economic inportance of the plants.  Mining is taking place
in river beds, along river banks and on land.  Operations have
greatly affected the vegetation and the soil, and some areas
which have  long been  abandoned still show a scarified land-
scape, because rehabilLtation is not being carried out.

It is proposed that mining in rivers and at river banks
should be regulated and controlled to safeguard the stability

trusted to competent organizations like the Botany Departments
of the Universities and the Forestry Departsent. At the same

Lit  regularize the operations of ssall scale ainers in

priate mining technologies.
A recent socio-economic impact study concluded in March
1992 revealed  that the  regulariisation scheme has helped  in
creating about 24,000 rural jobs.  The sector also recorded a
gross income of three billion cetis CC3bnl and contributed 13
I1       million  US dollars CUSS13a)  towards the  balance of  payment  _
(Minerals Comuiss3om. pers. cons.).
However,  in the event, sone harnful environmental effects
are beginning to appear. These include considerable destruct-
&on of %he vegetation (deforestation), excavation of deep pits
and trenches, and accumulation of tips of washed sand, gravels
_J       and stones at mining sites.   As a result, forest vegetation
with its direct and indirect benefits, beautiful scenery and
aesthetic values are interfered with or lost coMpletely.
Deforestation has serious Consequences.  With the loss of
its cover, the soil suffers from extremes of temperatures and
soil erosion which removes amuch of the valuable top soil aeces-
sary for both food crop and cash crop farming.  It also causes
rapid runoff  of ra,n water,  resulting in floods during the

rainy season.  The forest canopy is a *hleli uhik braakbslhdtba
force of rain drops allowingi the water to reach the soil uore
gently and to sink into the soil.
Rhmoval  of forest  cover also  causes rapid  drying up,
especially in the dry season, of small streams that build the
rivers.  This is even more serious when vegetation of water
shed is destroyed.  Forest destruction could also lead to the
extinction of both plant and animal species.  Herbivores die
:j.     from starvation due to  loss of their plant food, carnivores
suffer when their preys die off, and sany other specie: becoue
exposed to predators.
This study has become necessary for two reasons in line
with Part II Section II of PNDC L. 218.  The first reason is
that unatever the nature of %he smpacts of ssall scale mining,
I        they need to be documented.  Secondly, a system of mining and
processing should be designed to mitigate the unavoidable nega-
I1-      tive impacts in order to optimise the net benefits to the eco-
nosy.

Vegetation.
Forest investigations by different workers in the past,
have revealed the existence of differences from one part of the
forest zone to another in the structure and floristic composi-
.tion of a mature high forest.  This has resulted in different
classifications by the different investigators.  Taylor 11952)
.1        places the  vegetation types  of sh-  centres in the Celtts-
Triplochiton  and  Lophira-Triplochiton   Associations,   while
MCooney (1959) pLaces them  in the Ve-t and Dry Facies of the
Cel.is - Triplochi:on Association.   These tuo classificatacns
are based on the  inventory of dominant esergent trees only.
that is those stands above LOu of height.
A serious omission in this systeu of vegetation classifi-
cation is that it  is not trusly representative of the forest
flora, because  %he understoreys,  shrubs, cliabers,  epiphytes
and flora of the forest floor, which together contribute a

U             Trees in this type of vegetation are taller than in any
other type;  heights often exceed 50m and sometimes 60n.   The
I        upper canopy consists of a sixture of deciduous and evergreen
species in varying proportions but on the whole the two occur
in about equal proportions, hence the name semi-deciduous.  The
.1      understorey trees are sometimes gregarious.   In contrast  the
upper canopy is usually composed of a few species from a pOssi-
_         Xble list of about sixty.   The characteristic species include:

The m-thology of the stuiy was as follows:
h)  The  plant species  of each area  were identified  and
listed. The frequency of the spmcies was then determined using
either.quadrats or transects.
i. Transect A transact of 25 metres was taken and
plants along it were noted at one metre intervals.

ii.  Quadrat  An area of 25m  X 25m was demarcated and
all the species  in tne  area were  identified and  frequencies
determined.
_i
bi   The general  form of  the vegetation  in  undisturDea
j       -areas of the concession was  studied and used as data base  for
the determination of the extent of disturbance that has gone-on

3. VEGETATION TYPES IN THE STUDY AREA
The a-man studiud are  "ad  up  of secondary  vegetation,
plantationk and  farmlande.  There were  also highly  degraded
lands in almost all the sites.
i) Secondary Vegetation.
This is the vegetation which has regenerated naturally
after a disturbed  area has  been abandoned.   It goes  through
different phases of development.  Immediately the area in aban-
doned, any plants that survived the disturbance comence  rapid
growth.   The  bare  soil created  by  the  disturbance  allows
'I      invading seeds to germinate and become established.  Very  soon:
the area becomes covered by a tangl- of herbs, such as members
of the Acanthaceae and  Commelinaceam families, scramblers  and
climbers including Acacia pennata, Combretus sp. and  Griffonia
siaplicifolia and a  few grasses like  Panicum sp. and  Centho-
theca sp.
Trees and shrubs with e+ficient -ned dispersal mechanisms,
especially those dispersed  by wind and  animals are among  the
-,      early colonisers.   Invading  trees  fall into  two  ecological
groups; firstly those  with very short  lifespan (less than  30
years)  like  Pusan;a  cecropioides  Umbrella  Tree,  Harungana
madagascariensis and Albi ria zygia (Akan: okuro); and secondly
those which persist  much longer and  eventually become  mature
forest trees such as  Mz!icia excelsa Iroko (odum), Terainalia
il      superba  Afara  (ofram)  and  Triplochiton  scleroxylon  Obeche

3       (wawa). After about five years, the abandoned area consists of
.*4M4Ah. almost impenetrable vegutation mad. up of many young trees and
III     masses of climbers and tangles.   The vegetation at this  stage
may be termed a secondary thicket. If the land is not further
nI      disturbed, the process of recolonization and regrowth continues
-!      unutil the vegetation gradualljy changes into a secondary forest.
The area studied included different stages of regenerated
vegetation: far-m regrowth, secondary thicket, swamp forest and
grass cover.
a) Farm regrowth is very early stages of regeneration
nI      of abandoned farms.
b) Secondary  thicket  is an  intermediate  stage  of
regeneration, consisting  of  a  very  thick  and  impenetrable
vegetation of  herbaceous plants,  climbers, shrubs  and  small
trees and quite  often tall, scrambling   grasses like  Scleria
J       boivinii (Akan: aberewa sekan).
a) Secondary forest is a comparatively long-standing
forest with tall trees and much reduced undergrowth.
d) Swamp forest  occurs in  areas where  the soil  is
water-logged for a greater part of the year. The vegetation is
dominated by palms like Raphia hookeri, (wine palm) and Lacco-
sperma opacus, Rattan Palm.  There are a few broad-leaved  tree
species like Nitraqyna stipulosa (Akan: subaha) adapted to this
environment and the  undergrowth consists mainly  of ferns  and
u       forest grasses like Leptaspis cochlemta.

e) erass cowr is a rug-neration of nearly continuous
grass cover with small clumps of scrub. There arm hardly any
trees. Tht area with this type of vugutation is very close to
.J
the sea (between Apam and Winnuba) and the present vegetation
might have resulted from poor drainage and high salt content of
the sail.
ii) Plantations.
2
!           This vegetation consists mainly  of trees of a  particular
species deliberately planted. Some concessions had plantations
of Hevea brasiliensis, Para Rubber, and Cassia siamea.
iii) Farmlands.
i             These were farms of different  food crops and cash  crops.
The food farms consisted mainly of plantains, cocoyam and
4       cassava, often in mixed cropping.   There were one or two  corn
farms.   The cash  crop  farms were  those of  Theobroma  cacao
.4      (cocoa) and Elaeis-guineensis (oil palm).  Such farmlands  con-
tained a few small trees  such as Albizia adianthifoZia  (Akan:
pampena), A.  zygia (Akan:  okuro)   and tall  ones like  Ceiba
pentandra, Silk Cotton Tree, (Akan: onyina), Milicia excelsa,
Iroko, (Akan: odum), Triplochiton scieroxylon, Obeche, (Akan:
wawaj and  Spathoce&  j.'ar.ulata,  African Tulip  Tree,  (Akan:
kokoanisuo)-
iv) Degraded areas.
The highly degraced portions had hardly any vegetation and
>3      top soil left.  Only a few trees are left standing, and most of

them have  their roots  cut off  during the  excavation.   Such
trees readily fall down in storms. The open pits, trenches and
craters, and the heaps of soil together with scattered fallen
trees dug up or  blown down by storm  give the area a  derelict
appearance.
4. PROCESSES OF EXTRACTION OF THE MINERALS.
i.. Sold Winning.
There are three main gold winning processes, viz:        _
extraction from rock (lode)
river panning and
inland panning.
a) Extraction from lode.
The vegetation and top soil are removed either manually or
mechanically with bull dozers to expose the rock which is then
chipped with hammer and chisel.   The broken pieces are  ground
with mechanical crushers or manually with metal mortar and pes-
tle into a very fine powder.  The powder is washed (sluiced) to
concentrate the ore Ln a small quantity of water. A Few drops
of mercury are added to extract the gold by amalgamation.   The
excess mercury is drained off and the amalgam is heated to
evaporate the component mercury leaving behind the gold.

Sluicing l.done at the site eLther at a nearby stro-a   or
a dug up well. The pieces of rock could also be transported to
working shops s-t up in nearby villages where th- processing is
carri d out.
b) Riv-r panning
Alluvial soil from the  river bad is  sieved in the  river
for the ore. An amalgam is produced as described above.
c) Inland pan)ning
The vegetation is removed and  the top soil is panned  for
the ore using water from a  dug up well or a nearby river.   An
11        amalgam is produced by addition o4 mercury.
2. Diamond Winning.
rhe gem is obtained by  panning the top soil and the  sub-
soil after the vegetation has been removed.

5. THE CONCESSIONS.
The plant species of the concessions and species  frequen-
cies are presented in  Tables 4 to 44.   The families of  these
_         species and the  economic importance  of the  plants appear  in
Table 45, and a summary-of the important features of the conce-
ssions in Table 46. Photographs depicting both the vegetation
and operation sites of the concessions appear in Plates 1 to 58
at pages 87 to 117. Rivers and streams on the various conces-

The concession is situated in a farm regrowth. The plant.
species are recorded in  Tables 4a and b.   The area is a  flat
terrain nd the Sushien river flows through the concession.  The:
river is  used by  the inhabitants  for washing  and  drinking.
About ten acres of the concession are occupied by a cocoa  farm
and a plantain and cassava mix-cropped farm. About five acres
of the concession have been used so far, but there has not been
any activity at the site for the past one year.
Pits were  dug  and the  soil panned  in  the river.    No
attempts have been made to cover the pits (Plate 1).

The vegetation is a secon'dary forest. The plant spEcies
of the vegetation are recorded in  Tables iba and b.  The  areo
]        was previously utilised  by a  large scale  mining company  and
present activities are in a big trench (Plate 16) along an  old
rail track laid by the previous mining group.

Some of the outlying vegetation has been cleared for camp
sites an other,  purposes.   The disturbed  area measured  about
half an acre-  sluicing  is done in a streamn, Amponsah,  (Plate
17) at the outskirts of the town. A traditional belief forbids
inhabitants from drinking water from this stream so it is used
only for was.hng.

The concession  lies  in  a  hilly  area  covered  with. a
secondary forest.  There is  about half an acre of cocoa  farm.
The plant species of the vegetation are recorded in Tables  18a
ri nand b.  There is a small stream at one and of the concession.
Only about a quarterof an acre of the concession has been
worked. An adit (Plate 21) about 30m long has been constructed
along the reef. Eight pits, each 1.5m x 1.5m and 3m deep have
been sunk along  the reef.   Pi.ces  of Teak,  brought in. from
Obuasi, have been used as pit props along the adit. Rail track
have been laid for trucks  with metal wheels which are used  to
carry the  excavated rocks.   Crushing  o4 the  stones is  done
manually but arrangements are being  made to have a  mechanical
crusher installed.   The  vegetation has  suffered very  little
i           disturbance.

at a site measuring lOOm x BOrm. Watr for sluicing comes from
the stream by a specially constructed canal (Plate 47). Masses
of boulders and stones uxtending over more than a hectare,
resulting from activities of a previous large-scale mining

6. CONCLUSIONS
n?.
The environmental audit carried out on a stratifind sample
of 43 concessions of various sizes and levels of activities led
to some general conclusions.
11     -   Vegetation Types of Concessions
Judging from the untouched portions of the concessions,
the initial vegetation types, in order of complexity, consisted
3j          of grassland, farm  regrowth, secondary  thicket, swamp  forest
and mature secondary forest.
Status of Plant species
Non of the plant species encountered in the areas studied
could be considered an endangered species according o  relevant
records.
i4 ,Methods Used
Three main methods of  operations are used, namely,  allu-
vial mining along rivers, alluvial mining on land, and excava-
tion of lode.  Crushing,  where necessary, washing of sand  and
soil and panning generally take place on the concessions.
Where gold is involved,  further treatment of gold  concentrate
with mercury to form  amalgam takes place  in workshops in  the
adjoining villages.
|          Effects of Operations on the Environment
3                a)  Excavations along river  banks have widened the  river
bed in some cases and loosened the soil of the embankment.

'i '..rs.&.t '. Ib t6'i qfq.C'..
b)  Thu vegetation d       j     atly dmaged  epsp-
cially by alluvial  miningi.   The topography  and scenery  have
been badly altered in many places.
c) Deep trenches and pits (some down to 30m) disturb the
soil and rock structure.
d) Plants which arm removed and arm of commercial use,
eg. plants used for fibres, sponges, chewing sticks, drugs,
etc. are not harvested but allowed to go to waste.
a) Large working gangs panning in rivers are likely. to
contaminate the water with pathogens of water-borne diseases,
such as bilharzia, and some  are, on the other hand, liable  to
infection..
Signs of Regeneration of Vegetation
There are various  stages of regeneration  of the  vegeta-
tion.  The rate at which this will occur depends on:
a)  the time since operations ceased
b) the extent of disturbance of the top soil
q                      c}  the speed at which top soil is re-built
d) the amount of accumulated washed soil with no
I            e' ant- nutrients
I                      e)  the   rate   of replenishing  plant nutrients  by
weathering and litter decomposition
A                      f   the extent to which the topography is altered
PI
*1I



g) the efficiency of dispersal of seeds from adjoin-
ing areas.
Any r.g.n.ration obs-rved was  natural, and no  deliberate
attempt at reafforestation by the operators was noticed.  How-
ever, attempt made by some  operators to fill the trenches  and
pits will encourage faster regeneration.
Miscellaneous Observations
3I               ,a) Ponds created for washing sand and soill and for  pann-
1 ting were  at considerable  distances from  the habitations. and
would not be the cause of any increase in mosquito  populations
in towns and villages.
i  _  _  1. . tMe  n:sn cost, mercury is sparringly  used
at the workshops to amalgamate  the gold.  The mercury,  there-
iore, does not normally pose any danger of pollution.
c)  Regrettably, children are employed at the  concessions
_l           with grave consequences to education in these areas.
*i.; Deep pits and trenches, whether being actively operat-
ea or abandoned, bear no signs of warning.
e)  In many cases, operations are manual and rate of  work
is slow.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
Dj           a) Rehibilitation of Areas
Given the  extent  of degradation  that  goes on,  there
should be a deliberate programme of rehabilitation. From our
observations, the operators would not be able to handle this,
because they lack the relevant expertise. Rehabilitation will
|          demand, first, a thorough  knowledge of the flora, and  second-
ly, an idea of the conditions required for growth of seediings
.1         and young  plants of  different tree  species.   Rehabilitation
n           should, foremost, be concerned  with planting of tree  species.
Grmsses and  horbs  usually  invade  e:tposDd  areas  relatively
Ul          quickly aided by natural dispersal.
q                It is necessary that competent organizations be engaged to
carry out the rehabilitation exercise. We recommend that the
services of the Botany Departments of the University of Ghana,
q          Lgon, University of Cape Coast  and the University of  Science
arid Technology, Kumasi, and the Department of Forestry,  should
-u          be used. However, before  abandoning  any site  the  operators
should re-fill the pits  and trenches with  the spent sand  and
soil.
The tree  species  which  have been  identified  for  each
*1          ccncession could be used during the rehabilitation exercise  as
3           a guide.  We, however, recommend the use, as priority, of  some
special tree species which are being used in other areas and

countriua for rehabilitation of degraded lands' becaume of their
unique properties.  They chn be grown in close populations  and
they ary easily propagated.  Apart from restoring the soil  for
II        other species,  they  are,  on their  own,  important  economic
species  which  bring  along  other  benefits.    The  strongly
recommended species are:
Acacz albida: grows well in ary areas. It is especially
useful as it sheds its leaves during the rainy season, allowing
1:,;;- anz .ater to reach seeds and seedlings below.  Again, the
tree goes  into  leaf  as the  rains  fade to  shade  the  sun-
_           threatened sprouts.   The  tree is  fast growing  and is  deep-
rootez and Ooes not compete with crops and shrubs for surface
water.  It is propagated by seeds.
It is a good  source of fence  posts and firewood and  its
I-unh-orotein nocs make excellent fodder for goats and cattle.
ArTJrca&$d:u, occidentale (Cashew): grows under a wide range
ot c.:mat:c  and soil  conditions.   It  is hardy  and  drought
_   .-;.:_n_ .S-1Li adapted to poor soils and dry sandy areas which
are not suited to  other crops.   The phenolic nutshell oil  is
widely used as a medicine, a wood protector, a source of resin
and as a water-proofing  agent.  Locally  it is best known  for
its edible fruit.
*2                 Cassia siaiea (Siamese Cassia): is a good source of  green
manure in drvland environment.   Propagated by seed, the  plant
grows rapidly. Cassia species are adaptable and grow well in a

fl           it is a favourite woodlot tree.
I' |Casuarina   equisetifolia   (Whistling   Pine):   is    an
actinorhizal plant with root nodulms containing the bacterium,
jj           Frankia sp.  Tney live  in mutual association - Frankia   fixes
I         nitrogen.    C.  equisetifolia  thrives  in  nitrogen-poor  and
relativety stressed environments, and is able to grow in arid
and saline environments.  It is used for reclaiming strip mines
and sandy Bea  shores or  for planting in  areas devastated  by
volcanic eruptions, forest fires, or other ecological dislocat-
ions. It provides 4uelwood. It is propagated by seeds.
=-               Ceiba perntantra (Silk Cotton  Tree): crows mostly in  dr-y,
hilly districts, thriving in the hottest and stoaniest  piaces.
It is generally propagated by seeds but is also easilv raised
by means of cuttIngs.   It produces  the well-known kapok  used
_or stu+fang mattress, pillows, cusnions, life jackets, etc.

compete weeds. It is propagated by seed.
Leucasna leucocephara (Horse Tamarind): is also a deep-
I           rooted tree like Gliricidia sepiua and gives the same benefits.
L. leucocephala trees can fix 75-120 kg of nitrogen per hectare

Sesbania arandiflora. Thu plant's outstanding feature is
its extremely fast growth rate, especially during the first
II' ilthree or  four  years  after planting.    It is  very  easy  to
prdpagate by cutting.  or seedlings.   It establishes  readily,
requires little maintenance, grows fast, and can easily be
planted on a  large scale  and dmnsely by  seeds.   It has  the
potential +or reforesting eroded  and grassy wastelands.   This
small tree pri vides forage, firewood, pulp and paper and  green
manure.  Prolific nodulation and extremely large nodules are  a
dramatic feature of S. grandiflora.

ii. protecting water bodies.   It should be ensured
that operations along river banks do not interfere with thu
