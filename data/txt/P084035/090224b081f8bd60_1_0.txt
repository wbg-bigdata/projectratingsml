                         achievement of the action plan requires full mobilization of the PMU resources and strong leadership of the newly appointed PMU director, as well as close interaction with the local
                         authorities and WUAs to achieve the Project Development Objective. The next World Bank mission will be conducted on October 28 - November 9, 2013 and will review results
                         achieved in implementation of agreed recommended actions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the appointment of a new PIU Director, the team is hopeful that some of the previous concerns regarding the pace of project implementation will be addressed. The October
                         mission will revisit the PDO and IP ratings on the basis of (i) progress in the implementation of construction, (ii) status of farm restructuring and (iii) capacities of WUAs, as evidenced
                         among others by the recovery of O&M costs. The mission will also discuss with the PIU arrangements for the evaluation after project closure, foreseen in May 2014.
