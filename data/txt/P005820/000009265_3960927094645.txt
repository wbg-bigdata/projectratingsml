INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEND)TION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
FOR AN EASTERN REW'ON AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to YAR in the amount of SDR 11.0 million (US$15.0 million
equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance the Eastern Region Agricultural
Development Project estimated to cost US$27.9 million. The Government of YAR
and the beneficiaries would contribute the remaining US$12.9 million
equivalent of the project cost.
2.       Baekrond.  Since the early seventies, YAR has been changing from
a subsistence economy, largely closed to the outside world, to a market
economy aided by liberal pricing and trade policies, and reliance on private
sector initiative. Remittances from Yemenis working abroad and foreign aid
have played a majcr role in this transformation. However, these capital
inflows have decreased by 69S from their peak in 1980, primarily due to
falling oil prices in neighboring countries and a reduced volume of aid.
Consequently, and because YAR has virtually no exports, the country's foreign
exchange position has come under pressure. YAR is not self-sufficient in food
crops, and it imports about 0.5 million tons of foodgrains annually. The
scarcity of foreign exchange has severely limited imports of other
agricultural products and inputs and adversely affected the efficiency of the
productive sectors. This situation has begun to improve since the country
started to export oil in 1988; and as a result, more inputs, including
fertilizer, are now available. Agriculture is an important sector in the
economy because it provides a livelihood for 60% of the domestic labor force
and generates about 21% of GDP. Agricultural value added has grown at an
annual average rate of 1.9% over the period 1982-1987 despite three years of
severe drought. There is sufficient land available with good potential for
agriculture, but production is constrained by low rainfall and the scarcity of
water. Despite this, agriculture possesses a considerable potential for
growth and income generation in the medium- to long-term. Yields could
improve considerably, cropping patterns could move towards high-value crops,
and the irrigated area could be expanded.
3.       The performance of the agriculture sector has beer well below its
potential primarily due to: (a) generally poor agricultural practices;
(b) the limited availability of fertilizer and other inputs; and (c) the lack
of adequate technical advice and other services for farmers. Recognizing
these shortcomings, in the late '70s. the Government started to provide
agricultural services as part of area and regional development projects. A
total of 12 IDA-assisted projects have resulted in improved extension and
315 2C



-2-
research, greater availability of credit and inputs in some of the country's
often remote areas, and the establishment of links between research and
extension. This has resulted in substantially increasing the cropped area,
yields and production of the major crops in YAR, particularly fruits and
vegetables.
4.       rioject Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to support the
Government's efforts to provide improved services and technical support for
the agricultural development of the Eastern Region of the country. The main
objectives are to increase agricultural production, reduce food imports,
increase farm incomes, alleviate poverty and improve farmers' living
standards. This phase would focus on the areas benefiting most from the
recently consteucted Marib Dam. The project would support an ongoing
institutional development program for the Eastern Region aiming at:
(a) efficient use of the limited water resources through surface and
groundwater management and improved irrigation practices; (b) upgrading the
managerial, administrative and technical skills of ERADA (the Eastern Region
Agricultural Development Authority) and ARA (the Agricultural Research
Authority); and (c) sustaining the development programs in order to ensure the
region's long-term development needs. ERADA, a semiautonomous agency, was
established in 1987 to carry out agricultural and rural development in the
Governorates of Marib and Al-Jawf. ARA, established in 1983 and supported
under Credit 1259-YAR (Agricultural Research and Development), is responsible
for YAR's national research program.
5.       Project Description. The proposed project aims at strengthening the
agricultural institutions, primarily ERADA and ARA, in order to address the
long-term agricultural development needs of the region and provide for the
early and efficient use of the production potential created by the
construction of the Marib Scheme, which is financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund (the
Marib Dam and the primary canals have already been built, and the secondary
canals are being constructed and will be completed by end 1989). The project
components include: (a) regional institutional development through
(i) strengthening ERADA and its agricultural support services; (ii) augmenting
agricultural research, and (iii) providing technical assistance, studies and
training; (b) Marib Scheme development through (i) strengthening the Marib
Scheme operation and maintenance service, and (ii) developing the tertiary
distribution system; and (c) on-farm development, including investment in
irrigation improvement and orchard establishment. Project assistance to
ERADA, ARA and the Operation and Maintenance service of the Marib Scheme
includes staffing and staff training; construction of offices and houses;
equipment and transport facilities; and expert services to assist local
personnel in project implementation and local training. Agricultural
extension services would be strengthened in line with the Training and Visit
system and would be strongly linked with agricultural research, allowing for
better dissemination of improved technology. Agricultural research would be
adaptive and would aim at further improving technical packages for farmers.
The Marib Scheme O&M service would be strengthened to encourage the efficient
operation and maintenance of the dam and its conveyance and distribution
systems. This would, of course, increase benefits from the dam investment.
The project would be implemented by ERADA and ARA and would be carried out
over six years. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$27.9 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$16.5 million (592). A



-3-
breakdown of the costs and a financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts,
methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedules are
shown in Schedule B. The estimated completion date is December 31, 1995. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in YAR are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
(IBRD No. 20584) of the project area is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7467-YAR dated December 20, 1988 is also attached.
6.       Agreed Actions. All major issues were discussed at appraisal and
post appraisal and agreements and understanding reached. The original purpose
of the dam, flood control, was later modified to include surface water
irrigation. Two concerns were raised during appraisal regarding the dam, its
appurtenant structures and the distribution system. These are as follows:
(a) the safety of the dam and its appurtenant structures; and (b) the damage
to primary canal BN in the northern part of the Marib Scheme. The dam safety
has been reviewed by the appraisal and postappraisal missions (which included
a dam construction specialist) and by technical experts representing IDA, the
Government of YAR, the Abu Dhabi Fund, and the Engineering Consultants. These
experts agree that the stability of the dam for the normal operating range is
generally satisfactory. However, to further enhance the safety of the dam and
its appurtenant structures, it was agreed to install a filter blanket at the
toe of the dam to guard against seepage and potential piping, and to extend
the downstream protection of the irrigation outlet stilling basin to increase
discharge capacity in case of emergency. These works are estimated to cost
about US$350,000, and sufficient funds for implementing these works have been
approved by the Government of YAR. As a condition of credit effectiveness,
Government would enter into a contract, on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA, for the execution of works required to enhance the safety of the Marib
Dam and its appurtenant structures. Government has allocated adequate funds
to finance the repaik of the BN canal and flood control measures to prevent
recurrence of the damage.
7.       The main points discussed and agreements reached during negotiations
are summarized as follows: (a) timely implementation of additional dam safety
measutes and the repair of damage to primary canal BN; (b) timely appointment
of key experts/consultants and local staff; (c) timely availability of local
funds to meet project recurrent costs and incremental credit requirements;
(d) collection, by Government from beneficiaries, of the cost of tertiary
canals built by ERADA and the O&M costs of the Marib Scheme; and (e) a
mid-term review of the project by end 1992. The full cost of the O&M service
would be recovered from surface water beneficiaries of the Marib Scheme on a
semi-annual basis. The water tariff would be assessed in accordance with
methodology acceptable to IDA and adjusted periodically (every three years).
The cost of tertiary canals built by ERADA would be recovered, with interest,
in semiannual installments over an eight-year period.
8.       Rationale for IDA Involvement. Public investment in agriculture has
so far been minimal in the project area, although the region in general, and
the Marib Dam command area in particular, are endowed with good soils, water
resources, and a favorable climate which can support a diversified cropping
pattern and high yields. The project forms an integral part of Government's
and IDA's sector development strategy to: (i) ensure availability of
essential agricultural services to farmers; (ii) raise
31 5 2r



-4-
agricultural productivity; and (iii) exploit limited natural resoarces
efficiently, including the irrigation potential of the Marib Dar. The
strategy for the Eastern Region focusses on strengthening agricultural
institutions, namely ERADA and ARA, which are responsible for agricultural
extension, research, and other support services; developing the tertiary canal
network and the 0&M service of the Marib Scheme; and promoting on-farm
development. This strategy would expand agricultural production and increase
farmers' incomes. IDA's involvement in this process over the past 15 years
has been instrumental in modernizing the agricultural sector. The
continuation of this involvement through financial and technical assistance is
important for consolidating Government strategy for national development and
for expanding and sustaining agricultural production.
9.       Benefits. The project benefits would mainly result from (a)
introductiou of improved on-farm technology (9,000 ha), including on-farm
investments to improve efficiency of irrigation water and establishment of
orchards; (b) construction of tertiary canals for the Marib Scheme; and
(c) technical assistance and training to help establish the agricultural
support services required for the region. The quantifiable benefits would
come from the incremental production of vegetables, fruits, cereals and forage
crops. At full development, the project would increase annual fruit and
vegetable production by about 24,000 tons, forages by about 18,000 tons, and
grain production by about 6,000 tons. The average net farm income is expected
to increase from about YRls 7,700 to YRls 52,000 by year 10 of the project.
This projected growth is attributed to increased area of production due to
higher cropping intensity, increased yields per unit area, and reduced water
costs due to the greater availability of surface water. The incremental
production of the project, assessed within a national context, does not result
in excess supply. Moreover, the region is served by a relatively efficient
marketing network through which surplus production is sold. Current marketing
arrangements in the project area are satisfactory: the bulk of agricultural
marketing is handled by the private sector, wh4ch is expected to maintain its
dominance in the future, while Government's role is confined to the provision
of basic infrastructure. The internal economic rate of return is 17.8X. Risk
analysis shows that the ERR would remain about 122 if costs increased by
23.0S, or benefits decreased by 18.7%. Both of these are satisfactory.
10.      Risks. Possible risks couid include: (a) due to the seminomadic and
tribal nature of beneficiaries in the Eastern Region, including the Marib
Scheme command area, conflicts might arise as a result of regulating the water
distribution system in the Marib Scheme; (b) inadequate operating budgetary
support, resulting in delays in staffing and in the implementation schedule;
(c) delays in credit effectiveness and project mobilization which have led to
slow disbursements in some projects in the past; and (d) potential
contamination of the aquifer with fertilizer and pesticide residues. To
minimize these risks, and to reduce any tribal conflicts, (a) written
agreements would be signed among beneficiaries of tertiary blocks regarding
water distribution rights, similar to existing agreements to share spate flow,
prior to the release of water, and Government has appointed an advisory
council with representation of beneficiaries to help ERADA with anticipating
and resolving problems. (b) The Government also indicated that, because of
the high priority given to the agricultural development of the oil-producing
Eastern Region and the increased revenues from oil exports, adequate budgetary



-5-
allocations would be made to meet the necessary operating costs. This has
already been demonstrated by appropriating an adequate 1989 budget for ERADA.
(c) The risk of delayed mobilization and slow disbursement is being minimized
through the establishment of a PPF Advance (No. P-508-YAR) and by the
Government's assurance to streamline ratification procedures and expedite
credit effectiveness. (d) To address the issue of potential aquifer
contamination, ARA would monitor potential contamination threats and, if they
exist, recommend remedial measures.
11.      Recom mendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the project credit.
