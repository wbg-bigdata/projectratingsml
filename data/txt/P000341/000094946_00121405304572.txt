WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPtENT PROJECT
Farm and Crop Development
A. Introduction
1.        Cameroon's Western Province is a unique region not only because of
the diversity and attraction of the countryside's geomorphology and the high
population density, but even more so because of the unusual agricultural
practices and cultivation methods used by the rural population, and the very
high proportion of cultivated land. It is estimated that on the average
about 95%0 of cultivable land is cropped. Pressure for land has forced
farmers to cultivate even steep slopes. Details of the ecology and clima;e
of the project areas are at Annex 1.
B. Farm Systems
2.        Cropping techniques.  The most striking feature of the present
cultivation methods is a system, probably best described by the name of
"multiple intercropping," which consists of a great diversity of crop
associations.
3.        In the western part of the project area, increasing soil fertility
has the following influence on crop associations:
-  the number of associated crops increases from 7 to 14;
- the following crops tend to appear: coffee, bananas,
legumes, potatoes;
- the following crops tend to disappear from the mixture:
Bambara nuts, cowpeas, sweet potatoes;
- crops whose proportion decreases in the association:
groundnuts, cocoyams, yams;
- crops whose proportion increases: all other species
(Table 1).
4.        Elsewhere, on black deposition soils, with a generally more bal-
anced fertility, the following changes are observed with increasing soil
value:
- number of crops in the association are similar and
vary only from 11 to 13;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
- strong decrease of cowpeas, decrease of beans and a modest
general decrease of groundnuts and tuber crops;
- an increase for maize, and particularly potatoes;
- little change for the other crops (Table 1).
The remarkable feature of these crop associations is in all cases the very
high crop density, resulting in almost total cover of the soil by the crop
canopy. For lack of more precise information, it is difficult to speak
about crop competition, cooperation, or symbiosis, but from all appearances,
a certain harmony seems to exist between the speed of the plants' growth,
their size and form, and their vegetative cycle. This harmony seems to
allow healthy development within time and space, and good yields and pro-
duction.
5.        Farm crop associations and farm models.  Based on research in the
local area, four basic farm crop associations have been identified relating
to the four main soil types of the area which are summarized in Table 1.
It highlights multiple crop mixtures and high cropping intensity, depending
on soil type, of between 112 to 175%. High cropping intensity is the re-
sult of long and substantial rains, overall high soil fertility, need of
soil conservation and erosion control and, finally, the need for high pro-
duction from cultivated land.
6.        Basic features of cultivation.  The rather complex crop associa-
tions established in the project area have been developed as the most natural
means of soil conservation. The system facilitates speedy production of a
dense vegetative soil cover that leaves the soil partly open to erosion only
at the beginning of the growing season (March and part April) when the crops
are still small. It also makes possible speedy and improved growth of the
crops' root systems, a "fortification" of the ridges by the combination of
deep and shallow rooted crops, and particularly by crops developing a dense
grass-type root system in the upper 30 cm of soil (Maize). All cultivation
is on ridges which facilitates the incorporation of substantial crop resi-
dues at the time of split ridging and make it possible to cultivate even
steep slopes. The ridges are between 50 to 100 cm wide and follow the con-
tour line on less steep slopes. On steep slopes, ridges follow the inclina-
tion of the slope.
7.        Land preparation.  Land preparation begins four to six weeks before
the start of the rains in early March. Work is done by hoe and the principal
method used is split-ridging. Old ridges are split in the middle and re-
worked to a new ridge over the previous furrow. Organic materials from crop
residues are buried in the old furrow by the new ridge, thus improving or-
ganic matter and nutrient content, soil structure, and water retention capa-
city.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
8.        Controlled weedin2.  On modest slopes contour ridges and furrows
are clean weeded and the weeds placed in the furrows to act as mulch, to
suppress further weed growth, to protect the soil and to increase moisture
retention. On steeper slopes weeding is done only partially. A part of
the weed population is left growing and the uprooted part is placed in
furrows to perform a similar function as on moderate slopes.
9.        Fertilization.  The incorporation of crop residues has been the
principal contributor to maintenance of soil fertility. Industrial ferti-
lizers, although their value has been proven by research and fully recog-
nized by farmers, have remained in short supply. Fertilizer use among UCCAO
member families is in the region of 100 kg/ha, whereas to meet the minimum
research recommendations, based on response of pure stand maize, at least 400
kg/ha would be required.
10.       "Ecobuage."  "Ecobuage," a process similar to charcoal burning, is
the incomplete burning of the fallow vegetation buried under soil in ridges.
The advantages of this technique are: a considerable increase in the sum
of exchangeable bases, in pH and in available phosphorus, and a following
dramatic increase in yields. The disadvantages are: a loss of more than
50% of the clay content in topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm), a de-
crease in silt content and a corresponding increase in sands. After several
repetitions of this technique, soil fertility declines, yields decrease and
the land has to be left fallow. "Ecobuage" should be done only once and
combined with the application of fertilizer for best long-term results.
11.       Pest control.  Control of the two major coffee plant pests (an-
testia and anthracnose) is the responsibility of a pest control brigade
(Base phytosanitaire) under the supervision of the Provincial Delegation of
Agriculture. Required treatments are generally not performed. The quantity
of pesticides used is about 2 kg/ha of physical coffee plantation, although
for reasonable control, about 5 kg/ha are required. No other chemicals
are used either as seed dressing or for storage pest control.
12.       Grain storage.  Storage and drying of maize, harvested in July-
August, is currently done in the farmer's kitchen on a light ceiling over
the fireplace. Storage capacity is considered insufficient and losses are
estimated at 30%. This situation forces the average farmer to sell a sub-
stantial part of his crop at low prices right after harvest. On a pilot
basis, several cribs designed by the FAO/African Rural Storage Centre
(attached to IITA lbadan in Nigeria) have been demonstrated in the project
area. Results are encouraging, with losses estimated at no higher than
10%. However, there has been little drive from extension services toward
a greater popularization and credit is unavailable for the purchase of
durable wire mesh.
13.       Erosion.  Thanks to the high organic matter content of most of
the soils and to cultivation techniques, erosion has remained remarkably



ANNEX 3
Page 4
low in the project area. Nevertheless, some areas are almost completely
denuded and there is no doubt that it is the most serious threat to the
long-term ecological stability and agricultural development of the area.
For steeper slopes, intensive research into improved ecofarming methods
and a better organized and faster reforestation program are required.
C. Improvements under Project
14.       Introduction.  The project would be faced with a situation of
highly developed, already very productive cropping and farming systems,
well adjusted to the ecology of the area and based on ancient tradition
and empiricism. Suggested improvements would have to respect the exist-
ing facts and conditions, should be easy to integrate into the present
systems, would have to be well proven and be assured of farmers' demand
and interest.
15.       The recommended package would consist of:
- improved crop nutrition,
- improved pest control,
- supply of seed of improved foodcrop varieties,
- improved grain storage and
- better trained and equipped extension services and an
improved system of on-farm demonstrations and training.
16.       Improved crop nutrition.  For reasons of the many crop associa-
tions and their multiple variations and combinations, and of the wide mic-
roecology, past research work has not been in a position to devise formulas
of fertilizer recommendations that could take account of the whole complexity
of the cropping pattern. Research has concentrated on the most important
crops of the area, and although there are some ecological limitations, fer-
tilizer recommendations are available for coffee and maize.
17.       The coffee recommendations, worked out by IRAF Foumbot, are based
on the favorable response of coffee to nitrogen and recommend for coffee
trees older than 3 years on all soil types: 150-160 kg/ha N (about 750-800
kg/ha sulphate of ammonia or compound).
18.       Maize recommendations were concluded by IRAF Dschang after a four-
year period of semi-statistical trials during which responses of pure stand
maize to fertilizer were recorded in two locations with ferralitic soils.
The summary of treatments and results for both sites is given below:

T4                                  3.48                            3.90
Tl is local maize without fertilizer, T2 as TI but with fertilizer, T3 is
improved maize with light fertilizer (60:50:40) and T4 as T3 but with heavy
fertilizer (120:100:80). Details on fertilizer composition in chese .rials
are not available.
19.       Bearing in mind that the crop associations are inseparable and that
necessarily fertilizing one crop means also fertilizing all the other crops,
the project would recommend a fertilizer rate that is expected to provide
sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to have an impact on yield
increase and production of all crops. The total rate would be 400 kg/ha,
split in 300 kg/ha of the compound 20:10:10, and 100 kg/ha of sulphate of
ammonia. In terms of quality, this means a considerable deviation from past
fertilizer practices, when over 80% of all fertilizer used was sulphate of
ammonia. As the project has to address the whole farming system, the supply
of phosphorus and potassium is fully justified. The small amount of sulphate
of ammonia is needed to provide some sulphur, particularly for maize.
20.       The fertilizer would be applied at 200 kg/ha of compound at plant-
ing time, 100 kg/ha of sulphate as top dressing about 4 to 6 weeks later, and
the remaining 100 kg/ha of compound would be applied in September-October.
This late application has been shown to have a positive effect on the condi-
tion of coffee trees over the dry period and provides a certain amount of
readily available nutrients at the start of the next season. The incremental
amount of fertilizer supplied under the project would be in the region of
3,500 t per year (Table 2).
21.       Improved pest control.  Past experience indicates that in the aver-
age year about 50% of coffee trees suffer from an attack of antestia
(Antestiopsis spp.) and about 30% from an attack of anthracnose (Colleto-
trichum coffeanum, also known as coffee berry disease - CBD), severe enough
to justify chemical treatment.  Other pests, mainly the berry borer (Hypo-
thenemus or Stephanoderes hampei), require treatment in some areas in most
of the years.
22.       The antestia comes at the beginning of the year and has to be
treated in two passages, one following the other in about 25 to 30 days.
The pesticide so far used has been Lindane at 4 1/ha (two passages). The
project would encourage the use of safer insecticides, such as synthetic
pyrethrines. Lindane has been applied with gasoline run swingfog sprayers
(41/ha gasoline).  To be most effective the application should be dcne by



ANNEX 3
Page 6
night when adults of the pest are active. The Base Phytosanitaire provided
Scouting Services, supplied sprayers and insectides and, with the help of the
farmers, carried out the application.
23.       Anthracnose attacks between March and June and has to be treated
with 7 kg/ha of the fungicide Orthodifolatan, in 4 passages carried out in
15-day intervals. Application is done by knapsack sprayers. Some farmers
own sprayers but the majority of sprayers and all the fungicide have been
supplied by the PCU. Actual treatment is applied by farmers.
24.       The berry borer occurs mainly in April-May, sprayers and insecti-
cide have been supplied by PCU, with the work done by farmers.
25.       Under the project, the more difficult antestia control would be
left in direct charge of a strengthened Pest Control Unit (PCU) (Annex 2),
whereas the anthracnose and berry borer control would be entirely in the
hands of farmers. Sufficient pesticides would be provided to treat the es-
timated 50% and 30% of coffee area attacked annually by antestia and by
anthracuose respectively. The incremental quantity of pesticides supplied
is expected to be about 50 t per annum (Table 2). The average use of pesti-
cides would increase from 2 kglha to about 5 kg/ha. Knapsack sprayers would
be supplied on credit to interested farmers. The incremental number of
sprayers is expected to be 1,500 per year (Table 2). At full project de-
velopment one sprayer would be available for about 7.5 ha of coffee area, or
for 10 ha of actual anthracnose control. Each sprayer would be utilized by
several farmers and for treatment of other crops that would be planted in
small plots of pure stands, such as vegetables. A timetable for coffee pest
control is given in the table below.
Control of                        Jan.    Feb.   March   April    May    June

26.       Supply of improved seed.  Under the project, an agro-industrial
seed multiplication center would be established (Annex 4), that would pri-
marily produce improved maize seed, for which a high demand among farmers
has been already confirmed. The varieties that would be multiplied in
the early years would be Cola and 290 FL (para 41).
27.       The maize area, calculated on pure crop basis grown by farmers,
members of UCCAO, is estimated at 60,000 ha. It is planned that the project
would supply seed for about 9,000 ha by PY 3, 17,000 ha by PY 4 and 26,000
ha from PY 5 onwards (Annex 4, Table 1). Based on 300 ha maize multiplica-
tion per annum and seed replacement after 3 years, the whole project area
would be supplied and seed would be available for an additional 6,000 ha
outside the project area as from PY 6 onwards.
28.       Apart from maize, some potato seed stock, for which demand exists,
would be produced as well as some groundnut seed on a pilot basis. The
seed multiplication complex would also produce seed of other species, such
as beans and soya.
29.       Improved grain storage.  The project extension services would
demonstrate and popularize the crib developed by the FAO/IITA program. The
frame, floor and roof of the cribs would all be constructed from local
materials. The proje2t would provide credit for wire mesh required for
the walls, about 25 m for a standard crib of 5 x 2 x 0.6 m. Crib size can
easily be adjusted to required capacity.
30.       Wire mesh is better than walls built out of local materials for
four reasons:
- the delivery of the wire mesh would motivate the farmer to
construct the cribs,
- it gives the crib a longer durability,
- wind penetrates better than through locally made bamboo
walls,
- eventual occurrence of pests can be better detected.
A crib of the above dimensions can store about 2,400 kg of cobs, which will
give about 1,800/kg of grain. Malathion powder (Malagrain P 2%) at 50 g per
100 kg is recommended for cob protection. With small adjustments, groundnuts
in shell could be stored too. It is expected that wire mesh for about 3,000
cribs would be supplied annually (Table 2).
31.       Results of experimentation with these cribs indicate that the
most important factor is the ease with which favorable air currents can
pass through the cobs and this depends almost exclusively on crib width
and the orientation of cribs towards prevailing winds. All other design
factors seem to have no significant effects on performance.



A4NEX 3
Page 8
32.       Another important point is the immediate harvest of cobs after
ripening, as shown in the tabulation of experimental results:
Insect damage (%) Fungal damage (%) Weight loss (%)
Crop left in field for 7 weeks           12.3                 10.2                 5.7
Crop dehusked and stored
immediately after harvest               5.6                  5.3                1.3
33.       Better extension services.  The present average ratio of extension
agents to farmers is I to almost 900, extreme ratios reach up to I to 2,700.
The project would attempt to recruit and train more suitable agents to achieve
an average ratio of 1 to 400 (para 81). Extension officers would be trained
in specific subjects of crop production, protection and processing, and would
be educated as well in the training and visit (T + V) system of extension
work, that has proved so efficient elsewhere. Subjects for on-farm demonstra-
tions (new crop varieties, cultivation methods, fertilizers, pest control,
grain storage) would be fed from the Field Trial and Demonstration Unit
(Annex 5) to the extension services, and demonstrations would be established
and utilized more extensively and better than hiterto.
D. Farm Budgets, Nutrition, Labor
34.       Farm bud ets.  On the basis of the soil type and related average
farm crop composition (Table 1) farm models have been constructed and indica-
tive farm budgets calculated (Tables 7 to 10). Average farm size is 1.3 ha
(1.25 ha cultivated) and average family size is 7 persons (3 active). The
farm budgets reveal the following comparison:

35.       Nutrition.  At present an average consumption of 2,300-2,500
calories per adult per day can be assured without difficulties on an average
farm on all soil types. No changes are expected to occur under the project.
Based on an adult ration of 0.5 kg of maize, 0.5 kg of tubers and some
legumes, fruits and vegetables per day, total family consumpcion per year
is around CFAF 50,000.

36.       Labor.  Crop labor requirements in the without and with project
situation for crop mixture of the four farm budgets have been calculated on
the following basis:
-  for the calculation of foodcrop labor demand, working
days (WD) for maize have been included from land prepara-
tion up to weeding and ridging for the total cultivated
farm area of 1.25 ha. For harvesting, threshing and post-
harvest handling the WD have been adjusted to the propor-
tion of maize in the crop mixture;
-  for groundnuts, beans and all tubers, only labor required
for harvesting and post-harvest handling has been in-
cluded, since all previous operations have been already
accounted for in the maize calculation. For these crops
the harvesting operations were again adjusted to their
proportion in the crop mixture;
-  for other crops not specifically mentioned above (plan-
tains, vegetables), an estimate of 30 and 40 WD for the
without and with project situation respectively, has been
added per farm;
-  coffee WD per farm have been calculated separately,
adjusted to yield and proportion in the crop mixture, and
added to the above figures.
The table below gives the average labor requirement assumptions for the main
foodcrops and for coffee on a pure crop basis.

37.       A check on available and required labor at an average farm on red
ferralitic soils, with the highest with project labor demand of 308 WD per
year, has shown that under normal circumstances no labor shortage is to be
expected. The calculations have been based on 3 active people per farm with
a monthly capacity of 20 WD each, giving a total capacity of 60 WD per month.
The peak labor requirements over the year would most likely be in February
and March with 38 and 43 WD per month respectively, and in October, November
and December with 41, 31 and 34 days per month.
38.       Graphical demonstrations of the agricultural timetable and the
above check on labor are presented in Charts 17886 and 17921.
E. Maior Crops
39.       Maize.  Maize is the main staple food of the population in the
Western Highlands. The climatic and pedologic conditions are very favor-
able and the production potential is high. A number of white, yellow and
polymorphic ecotypes are being grown in the project area. White maize,
however, is the most appreciated for human consumption and, therefore,
also most extensively grown.
40.       Local varieties have an average growing period of 145 days and
are tall. Maize is sown immediately after the start of the rains and har-
vested in July and August at the time of highest rains. There are problems
with drying and storage, and losses are high (para 12). A second season



ANNEX 3
Page 11
maize crop does not face the adverse harvest conditions but pest infesta-
tion is usually high and yields are substantially lower. The mean yield
of Western Province over 1973-1975 was estimated by extension services at
1.3 tlha on a pure crop basis.
41.       Improved varieties.  Over the past years research has selected
two varieties which are ready for introduction into rural areas: a com-
posite variety "Cola" and a polyhybrid "290 FL". Those are the varieties
which would be primarily recommended under the proposed project. A third
variety, the Bambui Station "Green Revolution," would be introduced to
advanced farmers on a pilot basis.
42.       Cola is the result of selection work started in 1965 and based on.
local ecotypes. Two suitable imported varieties, namely M5 (Mexican 5) and
CY (Cuban Yellow) were introduced into the selection process at a later
stage. Cola is rust and helminthosporium (para 43) tolerant and through
the additional introduction of two female parents (Z155 and Br2) smut re-
sistent. It has predominantly white grain, but may have a few pale yellow
grains on the cob. Taste and texture of the grain are well appreciated
by the local population. The yield potential under favorable conditions
is estimated at 6 t/ha and research estimates that up to 3.5 t/ha can be
obtained under peasant conditions. The polyhybrid 290 FL can be traced
back to the polyhybrid 266 from Madagascar. The grain is white and well
liked by the people. In the Western Province the yield potential is es-
timated at 6-8 t/ha on research plots and yields of up to 4.5 t/ha were
achieved under peasant conditions. Both Cola and 290 FL can be regrown
up to F5 (fifth filial generation) without substantial yield decreases, if
cultivated more than 500 m from other maize crops.
43.       Main diseases and pests.  The most serious diseases are considered
to be:
- Helminthosporium turcicum, attacking maize leaves;
- Smut (Sphacelotheca reiliana), important mainly in lower
altitudes;
- Rusts (Puccinia polyspora and P. maydis), whose importance
decreases with altitude, and
- Cercospora mayidis, commonly called leaf-spot.
44.       Both Cola and 290 FL are resitant to or at least tolerant of these
diseases. The most important pests are: Stem borers (Sesamia calamistis,
Busseola fusca, Eldana saccharina), and Storage parasites (Sitophilus,
Tribolium). The likelihood of serious attacks in the field is decreased
by the multiple intercropping. Nevertheless, in cases of severe infesta-
tion, borer control is possible through an application of dust insecti-
cide down the funnel of the maize plants at about 3-5 weeks after planting.



ANNEX 3
Page 12
45.       Cultivation techniques.  Most of the maize is grown in associa-
tion, where it participates with 40-65% of pure stand popu'.ations. On pure
stand basis it would be recommended to space maize 80 x 25 cm (the latter
is within the row spacing) to achieve a population of 50,000 plants/ha.
The growing period increases substantially with altitude and this fact has
to be well respected in farm planning work.  The following table indicates
the growing period for the two recommended varieties in different altitudes.
Growing period (in No. of days) of variety
Site and altitude                                  290 FL              Cola

46.       Groundnuts.  Groundnuts are an important crop of highlands, since
they are the main source of vegetable oil. In the crop associations, de-
pending on soil types, they are present at populations representing 10 to
35% of pure stands (Table 1). Two local varieties are predominantly grown
in the project area. The main one is a creeping variety, late, with a
rather small pod containing two pink colored nuts. The other is of an
erect type, earlier, with a larger pod of usually three, red skinned nuts.
47.       As with maize, groundnuts are primarily a first season crop (Chart
17886). Yields on a pure crop basis are estimated at about 400 kg/ha of
unshelled nuts. In the rare cases of pure culture, populations are low,
80,000 to 120,000 plants/ha as compared to the recommended 200,000 plants/
ha achieved with a spacing of 50 x 10 cm.
48.       Improved varieties.  Research has developed two varieties for high
and low altitude. Variety 65-7 (ex Dschang) is suitable for altitudes around
1,400 m and variety 65-13 (ex Ebolowa) for altitudes around 500 m. Another
variety, 124 (=GH 119-20), with a long growing period but excellent taste
properties, is under observation. The table below gives main characteristics
of these three compared to the predominant local variety.

49.       The variety recommended under the project would be 65-7.  The
project's seed production center would initially produce seed for about 500 ha
on pure crop basis and the production would be increased, pending demand from
farmers. The yield potential of 65-7 is around 4 t/ha unshelled nuts (with
leaf-spot control) and 2 t/ha without control. It is estimated that farmers
could, under favorable conditions, produce up to 2 t/ha of dry pods.
50.       Main diseases are cercospora, or leaf-spot (CercosDora personata
and C. arachidicola) and the virus disease rosette. Rosette control is
difficult but cercospora can be controlled quite efficiently with fungicides.
With the application of 0.5-0.7 kg/ha of fungicide significant yield in-
creases have been achieved. In crop associations control is impossible, but
for pure culture cercospora control would be recommended. Extension would
advise on proper harvesting and storage to avoid aflatoxin problems.
51.       Beans.  Beans are an important part of the local diet and are
present in crop associations at populations representing 3 to 18% of pure
stands. No improved beans are available and only local varieties of cow-
peas, Bambara nuts (voandzou) and string beans are being grown. None of
these crops has been the subject of experimentation.
52.       Soya.  Variety screening has produced Sj 153, with a growing period
of 112 days (at Foumbot) and a yield potential of over 2 t/ha. Other vari-
eties with promising results are DR09, E73 and Geduld. Laboratory analysis
of Sj 153 has shown a very satisfactory oil content of 45.5% and a satis-
factory protein content of 18.5%. Results of crop rotation trials have
I



ANNEX 3
Page 14
shown a good compatibility with second season upland rice of the variety
Shinei or similar. The agronomic merits of soya are evident, but no market
for soya has been established. The project would therefore not support soya
production.
53.       Rice.  In the project area upland rice would be grown on a limited
scale mainly in the bottomlands.  On fertile soils with good water retention
capacity, such as the brown soils of Galim, it can be grown as first season
crop from March to July. The safer period, however, is the second season,
from July to December. Short season varieties with a growing period of 115
to 125 days, recommended for the project bottomlands, would be IAC 25, 1562
and Shinei. Ploughing to a depth of 25 cm is recommended, good soil prepara-
tion, sowing in lines 15 to 25 cm apart, seeding rate 70 to 80 kg/ha. With
60 to 30 kg/ha nitrogen the yield potential of the above varieties could be
up to 5 t/ha.
54.       Research on rice in Dschang is proceeding actively and improved
recommendations can be expected during project implementation. Seed of
all three varieties for project needs is in sufficient supply.
55.       Potatoes are becoming increasingly important in the project area
for both family consumption and sale. The CEIPS station in Bafou has ex-
perimented with potatoes for many years and good growing recommendations
are available. The best performing varieties were Alpha, Arka, Desiree,
Ginke, Multa and Radosa.
56.       Two crops per year are possible, the first planted in March and
harvested in July and the second plants in August/September and harvested
about 100 days later. The first season crop gives generally higher yields.
It is not recommended to grow potatoes below the elevatioa of 1,000 m.
Planting rate of 2,000-2,500 kg/ha, and spacing at 60 to 70 cm between lines
and 30 to 33 cm in the line would give a population of about 50,000 plants/ha.
For high yields, fertilizer is important and the application rate should not
be below I t/ha of compound and topdressing. Where compost or other organic
fertilizer is used, industrial fertilizer rates can be decreased. Yield
potential of the above varieties is reported to be up to 22 t/ha.
57.       Diseases and pests are important and regular treatments at 7 to 10
day intervals are required. The most serious diseases are early and late
blight (Pseudomonas solanacearum and Phytophtora infestans) and some virus
diseases.
58.       Improved seed is currently not available in the project area.  To
maintain good yields in the tropics, the seed stock has to be refreshed con-
stantly and seed replacement is usually required after about 3 years. The
project would finance imports of 15 t of breeders' seed annually, which would
produce seed for about 350 ha after two multiplications. Then, according to
the quality of seed, it would be decided whether to multiply once more or to
use the seed f or commercial production. Contrary to the current practice of
growing potatoes in the complex crop association, the project's extension



ANNEX 3
Page 15
services would advise, wherever possible, to grow the crop on a small plot
in pure stand to facilitate application of the high fertilizer rates and
pest control.
59.       Tuber crops.  After maize, tubers are the second most substantial
part of the local diet. Most important are the cocoyams, locally called
macabo (Xanthosoma sagitifolium) and taro (Colocasia esculenta and C.
antiquorum), followed by yam (Dioscorea spp) and cassava (Manihot utilissima).
The first two crops occupy, depending on the soil type, between 6 and 60%
of the crop mixtures, and the second two between 6 and 30%. Present yields
of macabo and taro, estimated on pure crop basis, are in the region of 4.5
t/ha and of yam and cassava of about 4.0 t/ha. The growing cycles and time-
table of main field operations are evident from Chart 17886.
60.       Research of tubers is less advanced than of other main crops.  Tuber
research has been assigned to the IRAF station of Bambui in Northwestern Pro-
vince. Fertilizer observations carried out with macabo and taro in 1973 and
1974 showed some response to N and K. Firm recommendations are, however,
missing.  A growing period observation with Dioscorea caynensis, D. rotundata
and X. sagitifolium showed that these tubers should not be harvested before
at least 8 months of vegetation. Planted at the beginning of March, the
yields taken in I month intervals were as follows (in t/ha):
Harvest time   Growing period   D. caynensis    D. rotundata   X. sagitifolium
End June           4 months             0                 0                0

"   October        8   "              10.0             11.5              12.7
"   November       9   "               8.8             16.0              11.6

The impact of research on this group of crops has remained very modest and,
apart from improved nutrition, nothing else can be recommended under the
project.
61.       Plantains and bananas are gaining in importance for local consump-
tion and market. In the project area they are estimated to be grown roughly
in a ratio of 4:1, and particularly the plantains are reported to be of very
good quality. A serious pest, the banana borer (Cosmopolites sordidus), is
plaguing the plants. HIDEVIV has a plantation of 15,000 plants which are
treated with insecticides (Kepone has been used so far), and the station
hopes to provide, starting in 1978, about 30,000 healthy suckers to inter-
ested farmers.



ANNEX 3

62.       Vegetables are grown on a small scale practically everywhere and
the Western Province has gained a reputation of being able to produce good
and healthy crops. The project would support vegetable crowing, primarily
by extension advice on improved crop production and protection, and also
by imports of small amounts of high quality seed for multiplication at
CEIPS in Bafou. As with potatoes, it would be attempted to separate vege-
tables from the crop asociations into small plots, where they could be sub-
jected to higher class management. Crop recommendations have been worked
out by CEIPS and main data for main crops are summarized in the following

63.       Coffee  (Caffea arabica) is believed to be grown on over 90% of all
cultivated land. Smallholder coffee is heavily intercropped with foodcrops
(Table 1); less than 4% are thought to be grown in pure culture.
64.       Cultivation of foodcrops around the coffee trees has had a negative
effect on the coffee trees' root system and, together with prices unfavorable
for coffee and favorable for food crops, resulted in decreased coffee yields
and production. Coffee yields over the last five years (1973-77) have de-
creased as follows: 243, 167, 215, 152, 114 (estimate) kg/ha of green coffee.



ANNEX 3
Page 17
65.       Under present circumstances recommendations based on drastic up-
rooting of older plantations and/or reestablishing new plantations on
smaller plots in pure culture, as has been recommended in some earlier re-
ports, would not be accepted by farmers. The project would, therefore, merely
attempt to stabilize the arabica coffee industry in the project area and to
stop the declining trend in production through improved fertilization and
pest control (para 16 and 21), and processing (Annex 6).
66.       Coffee regeneration.  Figures quoted in an agricultural survey,
published in 1965, provide an approximate estimate of the age distribution
of coffee plantations as follows:
Age (years)             Proportion of plantations (v)
less than 1                            12
2-3                               13
4-5                               15
6-7                               19
8-9                               14
10-11                              13
12-13                               7
14-25                              14
more than 25                            2
Thus, in 1977 about a quarter (around 24,000 ha) of all plantations was older
than 25 years.
67.       In 1973-74 Government started a coffee regeneration program, con-
sisting of improved seed production of the variety Java by the coffee research
station in Foumbot, and of establishing nurseries by groups of farmers, who
were advised and assisted by extension officers, equipped with the necessary
materials. Initially, participating farmers were to receive a replanting
premium, which was supposed to compensate them for loss of income until the
young trees come to maturity, but this provision has been dropped for lack
of funds. The program called for the replanting of 25,000 ha over 6 years.
About 1,000 small nurseries have been established in Western Province, suffi-
cient for the annual replanting of 2,500 ha of pure stands. However, both
uprooting and replanting have been making very slow progress, and hardly any
proper new plantation can be found.
68.       Since 1977, agricultural extension stations have established nur-
series under their own management. Each department singles out several ex-
tension agents who are responsible for running the nurseries. According to
the mission's estimate, nurseries established in the main arabica coffee pro-
ducing departments would provide the following replanting capacity in 1978:

Total                                 -                           1,200
69.       The coffee research station at Foumbot is supposed to supply the im-
proved JAVA seed for the nurseries. The Provincial Agricultural Officer's
demand stands at 5 t of seed per year, good for replanting about 5,000 ha
annually, but according to the officer in charge of Foumbot, this amount is
likely to be produced only by 1981. The seed production is expected to move
as follows:
1977 - 1.5 t
1978 - 2 t
1979 - 3 t
1980 - 4 t
1981 - 5 t
The seed is delivered as parchment coffee in 1 kg bags of 2,300 seeds, which
give about 1,600 good plants, sufficient to plant 1 ha.
70.       Cultivation techniques and recommendations have been worked out for
coffee grown in pure stands. Coffee experts have been hesitant to handle the
complex coffee-foodcrop association of the project area, because they feel
that whatever recommendation may be given there, coffee can never yield as
high as in pure stands. The project's extension services would, however,
have to approach the multiple cropping system as it is and work towards the
improvement of production of all the crops. Extension advice regarding coffee
would concentrate on fertilization, pest control, pruning and harvesting.
71.       Pruning.  The method recommended under the project would be multiple
stem pruning (multicaule), leaving on the average four main stems per tree.
This shaping would be carried out over the first and second year of tree life.
Later, the main annual maintenance pruning would be carried out in February/
March.  A secondary, light pruning would follow three to four months later to
thin out the flush of young shoots.
72.       Harvesting.  Only uniformly ripe cherries can produce good quality
coffee and at picking time the entire surface of each cherry should be red.
The recommendation advocated by extension would be to pick every 10 - 14
days during the harvesting season, to prevent the berries from becoming over-
z,ge, u&engjrmbeEries are difficult to pulp and berries of mixed ripeness



ANNEX 3
Page 19
73.       Processing is equally important for coffee quality as picking and
proper processing is believed to be the main method of eliminating "stinking
beans". Coffee depulping should start within four hours after picking, should
be followed by a 12 to 24 hour fermentation, and thorough washing and drying
(Annex 9).
F. Phasing, Yields and Production
74.       Phasing.  In the project area there are about 77,600 farmers who are
members of UCCAO and who would eventually participate in project activities.
They occupy an estimated 103,000 ha of farm area and cultivate about 97,000
ha annually. The tables below show number of farms and cultivated area broken
down according to administrative departments and soil types; more details are
in Table 3.

75.       In PY 1, activities would mainly concentrate on recruitment of addi-
tional staff, training, procurement of vehicles and equipment, and construc-
tion of buildings. Starting with PY 2, it is expected that about 10,000 farms
would be phased annually into the project and benefit from improved extension
services. Input on credit would be available to all farmers from PY 1. By
PY 4 about 30,000 and by PY 9 all of the estimated 80,000 members of UCCAO
would be reached. The figure of 10,000 to be reached annually is considered
reasonable in terms of project management and extension service capacity. It
is proposed that project activities commence in the centrally located depart-
ment of Mifi and gradually extend to Menoua, Bamboutos, Nde, Haut Nkam and
Bamoun. Details of phasing of farms and areas into the project according to
administrative departments and main soil types are outlined in Table 4 and
the table below gives a brief summary.

76.       It is assumed that between PY 1 and PY 9 an additional 3,600 new
farms would be established in the sparsely populated Galim area of the de-
partment of Bamboutos and that these farms would also be phased into the
project. Thus, farm families would increase from the present 77,600 to
81,200 and cultivated land would increase by about 4,000 ha.
77.       Yields.  Without the project, some yield improvements would be
expected to occur in maize, beans, grcundnuts, vegetables and coffee. As a
result of project interventions, yields are expected to improve as shown in
Table 5. The table below shows expected yield increases due to project
interventioa. These yields are representative for the red ferralitic and
black deposition soils, representing together close to 80% of the project
area. Yields for brown soils have been estimated somewhat higher and for
reworked ferralitic soils somewhat lower. Without-project yields (PY 0) are
based on the mean yields over the last three years.

G. Field Services and Training
79.       Extension services.  The project's extension services would be
headed by a qualified and experienced Chief Extension Officer (CEO), who
would report to UCCAO's Director of Production Services. Organization
and staffing are detailed at Annex 2.
80.       The existing structure and numbers of extension officers in the
project area are evident from the table below. Officers-in-charge COIC)
of main agricultural stations (poste agricole principal - PAP) are usually
TA (Technicien d'Agriculture) or experienced ATA (Agent Technique Adjoint
d'Agriculture) level. OIC of agricultural stations (poste agricole - PA)
are normally ATA level.  The lowest level are extension agents (EA).

81.       It is proposed that under the project, the extension field service
structure be organized into five sectors, in line with the geographical area



ANNEX 3
Page 22
of administrative departments (Nde and H.Nkam combined into one sector).
Each sector would be headed by an experienced officer (Chef Secteur) at
ITA (Ingenieur des Travaux Agricoles) level, who would report to the CEO.
The ITA would have a field staff of TA, ATA and EA level officers at the
following proposed ratios: one TA to about 5,200 farmers, one ATA to 2,200
farmers and one EA to 400 farmers. Thus, under the project the following
numbers of extension officers would be required (cumulative):
PY2   PY 3   PY 4   PY 5   PY 6   PY 7   PY 8   PY 9
Project farmers (in '000)  10        20      30      40     51      62      73     81
ITA (No.)                     1        2      3       4      5       -       -      -
TA (No.)                      2        4      6       8     10      12      14     15
ATA (No.)                     5        9     14      18     23      28      33     37
EA (No.)                     25      50      75    100    128    155    183    200
A comparison of available and required staff shows a shortage of EAs.  This
would be remedied by annually recruiting and training about 30 primary school
leavers from farm families.  Each year about 14 of these new agents would be
allocated to the project. The sixteen trainees surplus to the needs of the
project would be absorbed by the Provincial Delegation for work outside the
project area.
82.       The training and visit (T and V) system.  Project management would or-
ganize the extension services along the line of the T and V system, with cer-
tain modifications made to respect the local conditions. Most of the prin-
ciples of the T and V system would be introduced:
- general extension services would be unified. Specialist agents
would exist on a limited scale only for selected specialized
activities, such as field trials and demonstrations, refores-
tation, and bottomland development.  The general extension
services would have a single line of command, from the UCCAO
Director of Production Services down to the EA;
- extension personnel would devote all their time exclusively
to agricultural extension work;
- a systematic time-bound program of training and visits would
be introduced, clearly specified and closely supervised at
all levels. Frequent fortnightly one-day training sessions
for field-level extension staff would be an integral part
of the system. In these sessions, EAs would be intensively
instructed in the three or four most important recommenda-
tions for the forthcoming two weeks of the crop season; (such
as rates, methods, times of fertilizer application; rates
and methods of planting improved varieties of foodcrops;
coffee pest control, harvesting, processing; grain storage);



ANNEX 3
Page 23
- efforts would be concentrated to achieve a visible umpact and
continued progress. EAs would concentrate mainly on the most
important crops and on those few practices which bring the best
economic results. In their approach EAs would concentrate
on selected contact farmers;
- selected contact farmers would have to be of good standing in
their community, so that their views on new practices could be
respected by other farmers. These contact farmers should not
be the community's most progressive farmers; these are usually
regarded as exceptional and their neighbors do not tend to
follow them. Contact farmers should be selected in consulta-
tion with village leaders;
- at the initial stage, it would be very important to achieve an
immediate impact through the EA's recommendations. This would
give the farmers confidence in the EAs and the EAs confidence
in themselves. To achieve this, the ideal items in the project
would be higher fertilizer rates, improved pest control, and
improved seed;
- EAs should always concentrate on the kind of advice needed by
the majority. Nevertheless, they should also spend some time
with the most advanced farmers, because these should provide
an example of what a major part of farmers would do a few
seasons later;
- the extension service would cooperate closely with research
and try to close the existing gap between viable research
recommendations and farmers' practices. To remain effective,
extension must be linked to a vigorous research program,
which has to be well tuned to the needs of the farmers (Annex
5);
- a close link would be maintained between extension, and supply
of inputs and credit managed by UCCAO. Activities of exten-
sion services would create a larger demand for inputs among
farmers, would provide farmers with technical information on
the use of inputs, and would provide UCCAO with rough estimates
on next season's demands;
- extension services would undergo continuous improvement and
training, in order to keep up with more advanced research re-
commendations and farmers' demand for higher level advice.
83.       These basic criteria of the T and V system would have to be adjusted
to local conditions. Several conditions come into mind immediately, in which
the Western Highlands differ from other areas, in which the T and V system
has been so successful. Firstly, it is the macroecology and the complex
multiple intercropping system of cultivation, secondly the high standard of



ANNEX 3
Page 24
agriculture and production, which indicates that extension would have to work
with an increased use of inputs and high technology (fertilizer, seed, pest
control, coffee pruning, harvesting, processing, grain storage); and thirdly,
the fortnightly training session of EAs would have to respect the project
areas microecology, difference in crop compositions and crop growing cycles.
84.       To enable a thorough familiarization of the project's leading ex-
tension personnel with the T and V system, the project would finance a visit
of two people for a one-month study trip to one of the countries where this
system is working well (most likely India).
85.       Training.  The project would create a multipurpose agricultural
training center (TC) situated in Bafoussam. The center would consist of train-
ing and communal facilities, including a multipurpose demonstration cum
classroom, library and reading room, boarding and dining facilities for
thirty trainees. The center would be headed by a Senior Training Officer
(STO), aided by two Training Officers. Actual training would be done by
the two assistants with supplementary support given by staff of research
stations and the Agricultural Technical Institute at Dschang.
86.       The TC would fall under UCCAO's Director of Production Services,
and institutionally under the Directorate of Agricultural Education within
the Ministry of Agriculture.
87.       The TC would have a multiple function.  Firstly, it would organize
and provide basic training for thirty newly recruited EAs annually. The
basic training would be presented in a four-month cycle and would include
principles of extension work, including a familiarization with the T and V
system, principles of the area related ecology, crop husbandry, and Government
and UCCAO administration. Further, the training center would provide I to
3 week refresher courses for extension officers up to the TO level and would
also be available for short-term training of credit officers, cooperative
staff and local leaders. The TC would also participate in the fortnightly
T and V training.
88.       It has been assumed that the TC would provide about 150 trainee-
months in PY 2, and about 200 trainee-months as from PY 3 onwards. The
table below gives a breakdown on the utilization of the training facility
(in trainee-months):

ANNEX 4
CAMEROON
WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Seeds Production Center
A. Background
1.        In the Western Highlands there is no institution coordinating seed
production efforts or producing seed on a significant scale. The principles
of seed production are, however, not entirely new to the area, since all the
research stations present have attempted in the past to multiply, on a modest
basis, seed of species and varieties that they considered ready for introduc-
tion into peasant agriculture.
2.        IRAF Dschang used to produce annually a few tons of improved maize
seed, that was handed over to extension services to be distributed among
farmers, IRAF Bambui produced and distributed in the same manner small quan-
tities of yam seed, CEIPS Bafou used to multiply potato seed, and IRAF
Foumbot produced in 1976-77 about 1.5t per year of coffee seed and plans to
increase production further (Annex 3, para 69).
3.        A critical shortage of funds has brought most of these activities
to a halt. CEIPS Bafou, for instance, has virtually ceased operating and
IRAF Dschang has established only 3 ha of polyhybrid maize. The plot is
well kept, but received only less than half the required quantity of ferti-
lizer.
4.        Contract seed multiplication would be very difficult, for the
following reasons:
(a) the area is very densely populated, farms are located
virtually one next to the other and are small. About
80% of farms have less than 2 ha;
(b) to find sufficient suitable area for multiplication would
be difficult and to maintain isolation distances impossible;
and
(c) maize and groundnuts, crops considered suitable for early
multiplication, are grown as first season crops and have
to be harvested in July-August, at the peak of the rainy
season. Few eventual contract growers, if any, could en-
sure proper harvest and post-harvest handling of seed crops
at that time of the year.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        Demand for improved seed, particularly of maize and potatoes, is
strong among farmers. If seed has to be produced in this area, the above
reasoning leaves open only one option, and that is the establishment of a
properly equipped agro-industrial seed production center. Government has
been aware of this situation and has asked a group of consultants to pro-
duce a study for such complex. The study has been reviewed, and proposals
made in this report are based on this study.
B. Seed Production under Prolect
6.        Introduction.  It is proposed that under the project an agro-
industrial seed production center (SPC) be built up, which would produce,
condition, treat, certify, package and distribute seed of the most impor-
tant foodcrop species and varieties to satisfy demand in the project area,
and that would have also a certain surplus production capacity for outside
project area needs.
7.        The location of the SPC would be dictated by several
conditions, such as:
- sufficient free land (at least 500 ha), allowing the crea-
tion of large blocks of fields of the size of about 20-100
ha;
- fertile soils and sufficient rainfall;
- flat or only moderately undulated land, allowing mechanized
cultivation;
- proximity of a research establishment;
- possibility to recruit easily labor;
- all year round access roads; and
- possibility to develop irrigation on part of the area.
8.        The only area conforming to most of these requirements is the gen-
eral area of Foumbot in the department of Bamoun. Specifically, the area of
Djitapon, about 30 km north of Foumbot, has been proposed by the consul-
tants as a possible site for SPC. Other sites that may be considered are
in the area of Fonoya, and even around Foumbot itself several hundred ha
of good, flat land are available.
9.        Roads exist in the area, but for better access an improvement of
about 20 to 25 km of roads would be required and this work would be a priority
action of the feeder road project for Western Highlands.

10.       The energy supply for staff housing, the seed-handling center,
workshop and offices would be provided by a generator unit of appropriate
capacity and this has been included in the cost estimates.
11.       Main components of the SPC would be:
- a mechanized farm operating on 350 ha of cleared land by
PY 4;
- a seed handling center consisting of the following units -
reception of the harvested crop, drying, shelling and
conditioning, storage, seed testing laboratory;
- workshop for maintenance of the agricultural and seed
handling equipment;
- office facilities.
12.       The mechanized farm.  Land clearing would proceed at an average
rate of 100 ha per year (150 ha in PY 2). Seed production projections
(Table 1) are based on the cultivation of 350 ha. Nevertheless it is pro-
posed to clear an additional 100 ha in PY 4, to allow for a possible expan-
sion, crop rotations and maintenance of isolation distances.
13.       At full development the farm would be equipped with three medium-
sized tractors (70 to 100 HP) and one light tractor (30 to 40 HP) and with
sufficient agricultural machinery to cope with all field operations and
field transport (Annex 10). An analysis of tractor utilization has shown that
each tractor would, on the average, work about 1,500 hours per year, two
thirds in actual field work and one third in field transportation.
14.       The SPC would purchase annually about 5 t of foundation seed from
IRAF, would fertilize maize fields with 400 kg/ha of fertilizer to supply
about 80, 40, 30 kg/ha of NPK and would utilize herbicides, to control pre-
vailing weeds, at about 5 1 per ha.
15.       Seed production.  Improved maize seed produced would be around
260 t in PY 2, 520 t in PY 3 and 780 t from PY 4 onwards. It is estimated
that on pure crop basis, some 60,000 ha of maize are grown in the project
area. Based on a seed rate of 30 kg/ha and a replacement cycle after three
years, at full development about 600 t of seed would be required for the
project annually, the remaining 180 t, good for an additional 6,000 ha, would
be used for outside project purposes. Varieties recommended initially would
be Cola and 290 FL (Annex 3, para 41). On a pilot basis small quantities
of high yielding hybrids would be produced for most advanced farmers to dem-
onstrate the very high production potential of these varieties.
16.       Groundnuts seed of the variety 65-7 would be multiplied for general
release for the first time in PY 3 on about 50 ha, to give a production of



ANNEX 4
Page 4
about 50 t good for planting 500 ha of pure crop, or about 3,000 ha in the
prevailing crop mixtures (in PY 4). Groundnut seed production has been
assumed to continue at this level, but could be increased if higher demand
should be established. Modern production techniques would be used in
groundnut multiplication, and particularly cercospora control would be
introduced (Annex 3, para 50).
17.       Potato seed would be muitiplied by CEIPS Bafou.  The station is
well supplied with manpower and buildings, but would be reinforced with
transport, irrigation equipment and storage space. About 15 t of improved
potato seed stock would be imported annually from Europe. The first multi-
plication stage would be carried out on the station itself on about 7 ha, the
second crop would be grown on outstation sites in the areas of Bangang and
Babadjou on about SO ha. It is expected that as from PY 3 about 700 t (from
50 ha) would become available annually. The decision, whether to multiply the
second crop further or grow commercially would have to be taken each year on
an ad hoc basis pending seed quality.
18.       Seed sales would be for cash.  Initially, SPC should charge im-
proved maize seed at a price reflecting the variable costs of production.
Potato and groundnut seed would be initially charged at market prices. De-
tails of proposed seed production projections are given in Table 1.
19.       Maize harvest would be a critical operation in the seed produc-
tion process. Because of damage to seed and because there is no exper-
ience in the area with the performance of such heavy tractor-drawn or
self-propelled specialized machinery under an average monthly rainfall of
over 200 mm no combined harvester is proposed. Therefore, maize would
be hand harvested. The method recommended would be the well proven "bang-
board" method. A canvas wall is placed along the middle of the long side
of a trailer and laborers throw or "bang" the harvested cobs on this wall
until the trailer is full. One gang consisting of fourteen laborers (two
in front of the tractor, five on each side of the trailer and two to glean
behind the main gang), one driver, one tractor and trailer, can harvest
about 6 ha per day. At full production, three gangs would harvest around
90 ha in a five-day working week. With the naturally slightly staggered
planting time of the maize blocks, plant maturity and harvest would be grad-
ual. At full production the 300 ha of maize could thus be harvested in
about three to four weeks with minimum field losses.
20.       The seed handling center would be accommodated in a building
constructed of corrugated iron walls and roof. The building would have a
concrete floor, one artition wall, four metal gates 4 m wide, a cold
storage room of 20 m (10C), four elevator pits 2 x 2 x 1 m, electricity
installations for internal lighting and running the compressor for cold
storage2of basic seed. The total area of 2he building would be about
1,7502m and it would comprise about 800 m of reception and drying space,
250 m of seed handling space (these two spaces would have a height to
roof gupports of 6 m, to pEovide room for the elevators and drying towers),
500 m seed storage, 100 m fertilizer and pesticide storage and 100 m of
workshop and spare part storage (the latter three would be 4 m high).



ANNEX 4
Page 5
21.       The seed reception, drying, shelling, cleaning, grading, weigh-
ing, seed dressing, bagging and storage equipment, as well as laboratory
equipment, generators, auxiliary equipment and control panel are described
in detail in the consultants' study (para 5); costs of equipment for these
units are in Annex 10, Table 9.
22.       Organization, management, staffing.  The SPC would have two senior
personnel in key positions, who would be essential for the successful start
and ongoing of operations and who, for the first three project years, would
be recruited on an international basis. The head of SPC would be a Seeds
Production Agronomist, with wide general agronomy experience and at least
five years experience in commercial seed production.
23.       He would report to UCCAO's Director of Production Services.  The
head would be assisted by a professional Seed Processing Specialist, who
would be responsible for the correct installation, operation and maintenance
of the seed handling complex, and for the quality parameters of processed
seed.
24.       Other important personnel would include the Farm Manager (ITA
level), responsible for the machinery park, its proper exploitation and
regular maintenance, day-to-day organization and supervision of permanent
and casual labor. In the seed handling complex there would be a Seed
Handling Supervisor (ATA level) charged with responsibility for proper
adjustments and regular maintenance of the seed handling equipment, and
day-to-day supervision of labor. For better organization and control of
mechanized and manual field work, SPC would have one Site Supervisor (ATA
level) for 100 ha of seed growing.
25.       Workshop management, repairs and complicated maintenance of
farm equipment, transport facilities and seed handling machinery would
fall under the care of a Senior Mechanic, experienced in mechanical and
electrical work, and with some experience of spare parts store and general
workshop administration.
26.       Costs.  Total investment costs over the four-year project period,
including the CEIPS station in Bafou, are estimated at CFAF 544 million
(US$2.2 million) and operating costs at CFAF 351 million (US$1.5 million),
a total of US$3.7 million, of which about 57% would be foreign exchange.
Details are in Annex 10, Table 9.

CAMEROON
WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A.   The Field Trial and Farm Demonstration Program
1.        Introduction.  The project would start with the introduction and
dissemination of a simple, proven package of farming practices and recom-
mendations which are known to farmers and have been accepted in principle.
There is, however, a number of unresolved problems in the project area,
requiring a combined effort of critical research, adaptive field trials,
and farmer demonstrations in order to assure a long-term ecological balance,
enable further agricultural development, and devise better production pack-
ages.
2.        Current Situation.  There are two research stations in the project
area - Dschang for foodcrop research and Foumbot for coffee research. Both
stations fall under IRAF (Institut de Recherches Agricoles et Forestieres),
the national institute responsible for agricultural and forestry research.
3.        The station Dschang (Department of Menoua) has been involved mainly
in maize, rice, groundnut, soya and some crop rotation research and it is
also equipped to do phytopathology and entomology work. The station has
six professional officers. A substation in Bambui, outside the project area,
in the north-western province, carries the responsibility for tuber crop ex-
perimentation, including potatoes, hybrid maize, wheat and barley. Another
substation, in Foumbot in the Department of Bamoun, was used for outstation
trials on black deposition soils and the field station of Galim (Dept. of
Bamboutos) for work on brown soils. In 1977, in Foumbot work has been almost
discontinued and in Galim entirely abandoned due to lack of funds.
4.        The coffee research station in Foumbot was created in 1972 and has
22 ha under coffee. It is led by an experienced coffee Agronomist seconded
from IFCC. The research program consists mainly of variety screening (in-
cluding Arabusta, the cross between robusta and arabica coffee), crop nut-
rition, crop protection, spacing trials, and research into shading, cover
crops and, recently, various forms and combinations of intercropping coffee
with foodcrops. As with Dschang, the work suffers from a critical insuffi-
ficiency of funds. Apart from that, the ecological conditions of Foumbot
differ considerably in terms of altitude and soils from the rest of the
project area and therefore some of the station's results may have to be
repeated. In addition to these two main stations there is CEIPS (Centre
d'Etudes, d'lnstruction et de Production de Semences pour les Cultures
Legumieres) near Bafou in the Department of Menoua, a small farm falling



ANNEX 5
Page 2
under the Provincial Agricultural Officer. The main objective of this
station is potato and vegetable seed production. In the past, some variety
screening, pest control and fertilizer observations used to be done there.
Recently, however, the station has done only very limited work due to the
lack of means.
5.        Field Trials and Farmer Demonstrations under the Project.  Research,
although it provided some useful results and recommendations, has been mainly
crop and area oriented. Very little work has been done on the multiple
intercropping systems on farms to achieve possible agronomic and economic
simplifications of the systems, and on maintenance of soil fertility with
regard to the various microecological conditions of the area. High population
density and lack of available land has forced the Bamileke farmer to cultivate
even very steep slopes. The complicated problem of farming on slopes, con-
trolling erosion and maintaining the delicate ecological balance of the area
requires close attention.
6.        Existing research institutions are not equipped to deal with this
complex problem and a unit is needed that would devote the major part of its
activities towards a tangible contribution to a long term stabilisation of the
area's ecology. This unit would also close the existing gap between the
activities of research and extension. Under the project it is proposed to
deal with research oriented problems, according to their nature, in two
way s:
(a) special agronomic problems demanding statistical trials
of a long-term nature, would be delegated to IRAF researchers
working under contract for che project; and
(b) improvements of cultivation techniques and farming systems,
particularly on steep slopes, demanding more observation
trials and testing under farming conditions, would be
carried out by a special Field Trial and Farm Demonstration
Unit (FTDU) to be established under the project.
7.        Contract Research.  A list of contract experimentation foreseen
under the project is given in Table 1. The topics would include breeders
and foundation seed production, continued variety development and screening
(including a pilot production of parents of high yielding East African
maize hybrids), bottomland cultivation, coffee cultivation and technology,
fruit tree experimentation, basic and microelement crop nutrition, crop
protection, spacing and plant populations, rotations and crop combinations,
minimum tillage and any other problems that might arise in the project
area and that would contribute to developing appropriate production packages.
8.        Under the project a research contract would be entered into with
IRAF specifying for each experiment the objective, statistical design and
experimental technique, location, duration, reporting, costs, and means and
ways of financing. Altogether, 6 specialist man-months plus corresponding



ANNEX 5
Page 3
technical work and labor in PY 1 and 12 specialist man-months in PY 2-4 plus
the supply of field materials would be financed. The cost of this program is
estimated at CFAF 81 million (US$331,0000).
9.        The Field Trial and Farm Demonstration Unit would mainly concen-
trate on steeper slopes. It would base its work on the realities of the
traditional, in its own way very sophisticated, farming system and would
combine it with modern ecological know-how and experience of other countries
with similar conditions. On-farm demonstrations would concentrate on soil
conservation, erosion control, reforestation (together with the Forestry
Department and the Reforestation Brigade) (para 16), fertility maintenance,
farming systems and crop husbandry improvements. Recommendations for improve-
ment would have to respect the following general conditions:
-    flexibility and compatibility with existing social
and cultural environments;
-    economic advantages;
-    short-term feasibility;
-    long-term stability of the area's ecology.
10.       Work program of the FTDU.  It is suggested that the FTDU program
start with observations and data collection (to be carried out in conjunction
with the Project Ilonitoring and Evaluation Unit) (PMEU, Annex 2), in order
to get fully acquainted with the functioning of the traditional farming
system and its variations under the differing soil and climatic conditions.
Interviews and discussions with farmers and experienced extension staff
should play a major role during this initial phase of 3 to 6 months. During
this period areas and farms would be selected that could serve as demonstra-
tion and trial units.
At the same time the seven "transitional" zones, seriously affected
by erosion, and outlined below, should be investigated to conclude the extent
of necessary change in the farming systems of these areas. These areas are
less densely populated, with steeper slopes and rather extensive agricul-
tural activities. They are concentrated above the borders of the central,
intensively farmed, and agronomically and ecologically well balanced part
of the project area. Further above these "transition" zones are the hilltops,
turned into poor grazing land. The "transition" areas have the following
characteristics:
-    large portions have to be excluded each year from
cultivation as a result of erosion;
-    the areas are the immediate land reserves
for the overpopulated areas of intensive
cultivation;



ANNEX 5
Page 4
some reclassification of land in favour of permanent
forest is possible.
11.       The geographical delimitation of these "transition" areas has been
identified as follows:
(a)  Batoufam - borders the central plateau and declines down
to the Noun; the relevant area extends from east of Bafoussam,
passing Lemgo-Moundjo-Bangam Fokam - down t2 Ndou-ndou, east
of Bangangte. The area covers about 100 km .
(b) Bangou - southern border of the central plateau, between
Bandrefam in the east and BaVwantou, south-west of
Bangou, covering about 75 km .
(c) Balenaou - area between Bangangte and Bana, covering about
75 km of affected surface.
(d)  Bangam - very steep slopes and degraded hill-tops between 2
Company, Bamendjou and Penka Michel, covering almost 50 km
(e) Fokwe - Between Penka 2Michel and Bamendou to Fontsa Toula,
covering about 100 km2.
2
(c)  Mounts Bamboutos - 75 km
12.       Main Problems to be solved would include:
(a) Ecology of forests, mainly a comparison of the practised
monoculture of Eucalyptus saligna, with mixed tree stands
and their effect on soil conservation and erosion control.
Combinations recommended for observation would be:
E. saligna + Acacia mearsnii var. mollis
A. mearsmii var. mollis pure stand
Grevillea robusta + A. maersnii
G. robusta + various Pinus species
Different local trees including fruit trees
Albizia falcta + G. robusta
Leucaena leucocephala



ANNEX 5
Page 5
Seeds for these species are available locally and from Rwanda.
(b) Integration of trees into the farms in order to establish a
multistorey or mosaic type pattern in which annually cultivated
fields open to erosion would be reduced to small strips following
the contour lines and alternated in the vertical direction of
the slope with horizontal lines of shrubs, trees and forest
galleries. Pilot introduction of new species such as Greveillea
robusta, Croton megalocarpus, Calpurnea subdecandra (shade
trees); Annona muricata, Morus alba, guavas (fruit trees); and
passion fruit and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) would be recommended
(the latter outside Stephanoderas areas, since it is the pest's
alternate host).
(c) Intercropping of crops better adjusted to the less fertile,
steep slopes. Identifying a combination of the most compatible
cultural species with the most useful weeds for achieving a
viable balance of economy and erosion control. A pilot intro-
duction of uncommon shrubs, such as Tephrosia; mulch and pasture
producers, such as Setaria, Tripsacum, Pennisetum, Desmodium,
Symphytum aspera, would be included into the program.
(d)  Introduction of cultivated seasonal fallow capable of restoring
soil fertility, such as the nitrogen fixing Mucuna, Crotalaria,
Vicia and Sesbania macarantha.
(e) Surface (relief) conditioning, or natural terrace building,
would be achieved by planting tree and shrub galleries along
the contour and by cultivating the strips between them.
Experience has shown that annual cultivation of these strips
achieves a fast (in two to five years) natural formation of
terraces without the need of expensive, forced soil movements.
(f) Coffee planting would be demonstrated in pure stands with the
introduction of mulch producing plants in between the rows of
coffee trees.
12.       Organization.  FTDU would report to the Production Director of
UCCAO and would be headed by an Agronomist with knowledge and experience
in ecology, who would be recruited internationally and serve for four years.
He would be assisted by a Cameroonian agricultural graduate (Ingenieur
Agronome).
13.       FTDU would have three Technical Officers (TA level), one for
the Mifi and Bamoun, one for Menoua and Bamboutos and the third for the
southern departments of Nde and Haut Nkam. Each of the departments (Nde
and H. Nkam would be combined for this purpose) would have one Agricultural
Assistant (ATA level) to assist the Technical Officers in the site selection,
and in the establishment and evaluation of the trials aad demonstrations.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
They would be also responsible for recruiting, training and organizing of
casual labor for the program.
14.       FTDU would be provided with sufficient housing, transport, field
storage, and field trial materials, such as opticosquares, measuring tapes
and chains, tools. Funds have been provided for FTDU staff to visit IITA,
Ibadan and the project in Rwanda, and for consultation to the project area
on ecofarming and erosion control and agronomy, intercropping and minimum
tillage.
15.       The cost of FTDU over the four project years is estimated around
CFAF 230 million (US$940,000).
B. The Reforestation Program
16.       Introduction.  Reforestation of bare hilltops and of selected
former agricultural areas on steep slopes subjected to acute erosion and
in most cases abandoned by farmers, has to be considered as an integral
part of the overall plan for a long-term stabilization of the project area's
ecology. Although some modest efforts have been made recently to increase the
areas replanted to forest, there was no coordination with the interests of
agricultural development. Funds were limited, and the results achieved were
insignificant. The project's intervention iato this subsector is, therefore,
fully justified.
17.       The current situation.  The Western Highlands have lost nearly
all original forest cover, which was gradually replaced by either cultivated
or grazing land. This is in contrast to the southern and eastern parts of
the country, where the natural forests have not been removed and are still
estimated at about 180,000 km . In the project area it would be of priority
to restore the depleted forest for both ecologic and economic reasons. Wood
is required for building and fueling purposes. Eucalyptus saligna could be
used for this purpose but there is also an increasing demand in Acacia
maersnii, var. mollis (black wattle) for tanning production. The climatic
conditions are favorable for both these species.
18.       The actual area of forest, classified as state forest, is low and
reliable data are not available. Most of the forests are estimated to be
in the departments of Mifi and Bamboutos. An approximate inventory is as
follows:



ANNEX 5

Mifi:                    Baleng              -   310 ha
Bamendjou           -   100 ha
Bamendoum           -    60 ha
Baham               -   100 ha
Bangou              -    50 ha
Bamboutos:              Mount Bamboutos    -   220 ha
Bamenjin            -   150 ha
1,000 ha
The results of reforestation since 1973, the period over which the
Department of Forestry (Departement des Eaux et Forets) received some means
for this purpose, are shown below (area in ha):
Y e a r

Some additional areas were replanted to forest near Bangangte (Ndou ndou and
Balengou) in the Dept. of Nde. The present capacity of the Department of
Forestry for reforestation is estimated at around 100 ha per year. This
capacity could be increased to 150 ha per annum, without any increase in
personnel, by a modest provision of better material facilities.
19.       Total area requiring soil conservation programs has been estimated
at about 50,000 ha. In order to have a significant ecological impact in
this area, forest should occupy about 10-20% of this surface, that is 5,000-
10,000 ha. In order to achieve the multifunctional results required (soil
conservation, erosion control and water retention) the forest should not
be a monoculture but should be more diversified, as indicated in para 12.
20.       State and farmer owned forests.  A number of small Eucalyptus
saligna plantations belonging to farmers exist in the project area, but there
is no provincial or departmental recording and coordination at this level.
The farmer's forestry plantations serve the dual interest of his economy and
microecology, but have rarely been established having in mind the overall
ecology of a larger geographical area.
21.       On the other hand, the provincial Department of Forestry, having
been supplied with some financial means from the Fonds Forestier, has been
in a better position to organize forest management on a larger scale. In



ANNEX 5
Page 8
the long run, there are good reasons for promoting state forest management
because of the need for long term and large scale planning at the department
and provincial level. It is therefore proposed that the newly established
forests should be classified as state forests, wherever possible.
22.       Organization.  Under the project a small Reforestation Brigade (RB)
would be established which would report to the head of FTDU and would have
close links with the Department of Forestry. The RB would be headed by a
Technical Officer, experienced in nursery management and reforestation, who
would have two Extension Agents for site identification, labor organization
and supervision of reforestation field work. RB would be equipped with one
four-wheel drive vehicle, would be aided for heavier transport by the truck
of FTDU, and would have means to hire and train the needed numbers of
casual labor. The two Extension Agents would have motorcycles.
23.       The main reasons for the establishment of RB are to provide a
reliable reforestation back-up in priority areas for the FTDU's important
ecology program and to assure a steady link and coordination with the
activities of the Department of Forestry. RB would have direct managerial
responsibility for the reforestation of about 150 ha annually. In matters
of forestry training, technical assistance and supervision, the RB would
rely fully on the Department of Forestry, which is equipped for this purpose
and has shown interest in cooperating with management of this proposed project.
24.       Activities under the project.  The project would finance the estab-
lishment of nurseries for 150 ha incremental reforestation annually, thus
achieving the production of nursery material for 600 ha and actual reforesta-
tion of 450 ha by PY 4. The project's reforestation unit would also provide
modest material support, in terms of field materials (tools, fertilizer,
fencing), and transport of nursery materials to the planting sites, to the
Department of Forests, in order to increase their reforestation output to
150 ha per year. The increase in forest area over the project life is
expected to be as outlined in the table below:

25.       Given a steady ongoing reforestation of 300 ha per annum, 5,000 ha
of forests would be established by PY 15 and would contribute significantly
to the maintenance of the ecological balance of 50,000 ha identified as most
exposed to erosion.
26.       The cost of this component is expected to be about CFAF 141 million
(US$580,000); details are outlined in Annex 10, Table 6).

WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Cooperative Service Centers
1.        In line with UCCAO's expanded role in the development of the whole
farming system of its members, the project would need to include the con-
struction of a network of cooperative service centers (CSC). These would
provide physical bases for inputs distribution, credit administration, crop
storage and extension work. Wherever possible CSC would be created through
upgrading or expansion of existing cooperative-owned stores. Their siting
would depend on the density of farmers in an area, the expected throughput
of inputs and marketed produce (both coffee and foodcrops) and the local
cooperative structure.
2.        The distribution of farmers and co-op members by each of the six
departments affected by the Project is given in Table 4. This shows that
78 percent of the estimated 100,000 farmers in the project area are co-op
members, the percentages of adherence being between about 60 percent
(Bamboutos) and almost 100 percent (Menoua) in the four principal arabica-
growing departments. There are no restrictions on membership of the UCCAO
cooperatives apart from a single subscription of CFAF 1,000. CSC would mainly
benefit co-op members, notably through limitation of credit sales to members
in good standing; however non-member farmers would also benefit, principally
from availability of fertilizers, seeds and other farm inputs for cash
purchase which are presently difficult to obtain.
3.        During the project development period the demand for new storage
in the project area for fertilizers, coffee, food crops, animal feed and
other inputs is expected to rise to about 27,000 tons by 1982 (PY 4) and to
about 60,000 tons by 1987 at the end of the full development period. Esti-
mated tonnages are given at Table 1. Taking account of existing cooperatives
and private storage capacity, it is estimated that a proposed additional
25,000 t of storage capacity 1/ at CSC would be sufficient to meet project
requirements until about PY 6.
4.        Individual storage capacity of CSC would vary according to local
conditions. Detailed planning of each CSC would be done by UCCAO head-
quarters on behalf of the cooperatives and employing Genie Rural for
design and supervision of construction, which would normally be carried
out by local contracting firms.
1/   measured in terms of bagged grain equivalent (BGE).



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Taking account of farmer distribution and the number of existing
co-op storage sheds (listed at Table 2), it is estimated that construction of
35 CSC would be required under the project, consisting of 10 new Centers and
25 upgraded co-op stores. Total base cost of construction is estimated at
CFAF 512.5 million, or US$2.09 million (Annex 10). Siting for the CSC is
given in Table 3.
6.        A typical CSC would serve 3,000 farmers (including 20 percent non-
members), would have a total storage capacity of 7,000 - 10,000 tons (BGE)
and an annual turnover of some CFAF 20 million in input sales. Besides coffee
storage, CSC would provide storage in separate 200 m2 modules for fertilizers
and pesticides, improved seeds, farm tools and spare parts. Selected CSC
would also become the base for Field Trial and Demonstration Unit staff (see
Annex 2). Each CSC would include offices for the Chef de Section, an employee
who would be responsible for operation of the CSC including the security of
its stores, book-keeping and credit administration, and for the agricultural
extension staff.
7.        The Chef de Section would work closely with the local co-op Section
Committee but would be closely supervised by the respective cooperative, to
which he would report on all transactions, credits and activities. Similarly,
any complaints by the Section Committee about the management of the CSC would
have to be routed through the cooperative.
8.        Additional transport would be provided sufficient to allow for one
7-ton truck and one utility pick-up per CSC; however, to minimize unauthorized
use, vehicles would not be permanently assigned to individual CSC or Sections,
and control would be retained by the manager of each cooperative. An additional
sixteen 7-ton trucks and thirteen pick-ups would be provided, at a total cost
of CFAF 84.3 million, or US$344,000.

WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Bottomlands Development
A.   Background
1.        Population density exceeds 300/km2 in certain parts of the Western
Highlands. The most promising long-term solution to the problems of limited
land availability consists in programs of controlled migration to adjacent
under-populated areas. At present conflicting cultural traditions and the
believed existence of health hazards (e.g. infertility among women in Galim)
in the sparsely-populated parts of the project area make this difficult. For
the short - to medium-term, the problem could be eased by bringing into culti-
vation the several thousand hectares of underutilized bottomlands. In these
bottomlands, without water control wcrks, there is a high risk of crops being
destroyed by floods.
2.        The objectives of the Bottomland Development component of the
proposed project are to: (i) increase available cultivable land by some
400 ha through simple water control works in selected bottomland areas; (ii)
to take advantage of the opportunity to grow two crops per year of high-valued
vegetables for which demand is high; and (iii) strengthen the Provincial
services of the Rural works Department (Direction de Genie Rural) to enable
it to plan, implement and maintain simple infrastructural installations such
as are proposed here.
B.   Physical Features
3.        Relief.  The plateau areas of the Western Highlands consist
essentially of a series of hills intersected by numerous valleys with peren-
nial streams. Most of these valleys, especially near the headwaters, are
steep and incised. Further downstream, the rivers broaden out to form
areas which become marshland or are completely flooded in the rainy season.
In the dry season there are sluggishly meandering water courses in these
areas. The deposition of organic material and top soil from upstream
areas increase the fertility of such bottomlands.
4.        Climate.  The transitional tropical climate is characterized by
a mean annual rainfal varying between 1,800 and 2,000 mm, 90% of which
falls between April and October. The dry season occurs between November
and March. Rainfall is reliable from one year co the next (the driest
year out of any 5-year period still records 92% of the average for those
five years) and, during the rainy season, from month to month. The mean
monthly temperature is ab_uL 200C. Such moderate temperature allows for
longer vegetative cycles.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
5.        Hydrology.  Based on records of ORSTOM, the main hydrological
characteristics of the project area are as follows:
-    specific annual discharges:  20 1/s/km2;
-    annual runoff:  between 600 and 650 mm;
-    runoff coefficient:  37% ;
-    specific minimum flow:  higher than 2 1/s/km2 but
decreasing sometimes to 1 1I/s/km2 for small catchments;
-    specific annual maximum discharge very low: 70 to 400
1/s/km2 for catchments of 850 m2 to 8 km2;
-    maximum discharges:  Floods have very low inter-annual
variations: "The occurrence of catastrophic floods
in Bamileke region is not taken into consideration"
(ORSTOM report). For catchments from 8 to 30 km2 the
10 year flood varies from 585 1/s/km2 to 350 1/s/km2;
-    minimum discharge:  The minimum discharge is defined
as DC 10, i.e. whichmeans that lower flows than the
minimum discharge can only occr during 10 days per year.
The DC 10 for a return period of 5 years varies from
1.5 to 2 1/s/km2 for catchments ranging from 10 to 40 km2.
The dates of minimum discharges from the small catchments
are very irregular (from the end of February to April,
sometimes May). The depletion curve for the small
streams is of the type Q= Qoe -&(t-to) with &'2 10f 
this makes it possible to determine the discharges in the
month preceding the minimum discharge.
6.        Soils.  Bottomland soils have high agricultural production potential.
There are two basic soil types both with high organic matter content (10-30%),
the hydromorphic organic soils are covered (up to 60 cm in depth) with de-
composed vegetable matter, and the moderately organic soils have some 60 cms
of black of grey silty clays as top soil. Both types have high-water reten-
tion capacity owing to the presence below the top layers of plastic clayey
soils.
7.        Land Tenure.  Bottomlands in the project area are generally occupied
by raffia palms which play an important role in the rural economy. These
palms are tapped for wine and used in construction. The lands belong to the
community even though tapping and pole-cutting rights are allocated to



ANNEX 7
Page 3
identifiable craftsmen and their families. Small ridges (1.5 m high in
places) are sometimes constructed to keep out floodwaters. On such reclaimed
land, the rights of cultivation are also firmly recognized as belonging to the
family or families responsible for the structure. Bottomland development
actions would be limited strictly to areas not occupied by raffia palms and
close to large population concentrations (the two are frequently found side-
by-side). The allocation of cultivation rights to particular individuals
after the construction of water control works would not be a problem since
it would follow existing practices, as described above.
8.        Health Aspects.  Even in areas where larger-scale irrigation and
drainage works have been constructed in the project area (notably "Plaine
de Ndop"), there have been no significant increases in the incidence of
water-borne diseases. However, the construction of a hydro-electric d<=
(at Bamendjing) has been accompanied by an increase in the snail vectors
responsible for onchocerciasis. Government health authorities are aware of
chis problem and are closely monitoring the situation.
C.   The Proposed Bottomland Development Program
9.        The proposed program aims to develop 400 ha of bottomlands over
the four year investment period for the cultivation of two crops a year
of rice and vegetables. Construction would be by force account and would
use the labor of project beneficiaries. These 400 ha would be in about
ten locations with each varying in size from 10 to 100 ha. The total area
to be developed is considered a reasonable target based on experience with
similar schemes in Cameroon. A 10 ha plot with complete irrigation works
would be retained for experimental use.
10.       Site Selection.  A number of suitable sites (Appendix L) have been
identified in the project area. This list is not complete, however, since
Genie Rural is still conducting an exhaustive inventory. The priority at
the initial stage would be to define site selection criteria to allow
flexibility in design standards based on local conditions. Criteria to be
used for site selection are as follows:
(a) the site must lend itself to the construction of the
most simple kind of drainage works and bunds;
(b) bottomlands to be developed would not have any current
economic use and would be free of raffia;
(c) there should be a large number of inhabitants in the
immediate vicinity;
(d) the site should be easily accessible to motorized
vehicles.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
Second priority would be given to those bottomlands in populated zones
that are partially cultivated but capable of more intensive use.
11.       Phasing.  The first year would be devoted to recruitment of person-
nel, procurement of equipment, and the carrying out of initial surveys. The
10-ha experimental irrigated plot would also be constructed. The construction
program in any given year would be based on sites selected in the previous
year for which design and survey work have already been completed.
Actual development would proceed as follows:

(ha)                      (ha)              (ha)

4          Follow-up program               200                 400
12.       Bottomland Development Principles.  Each bottomland area has its own
particular features which would condition detailed design work to be carried
out by the unit in charge of bottomland development. However, certain common
principles could be stated at the onset.
13.       Flood Control.  Bottomland development requires control of the annual
floods resulting from river overflow or runoff where no natural drainage exists.
For small catchment areas, clearing and scraping of the main drain, with sub-
sequent corrections of gradient and direction if n2cessary, will allow the
flood waters to Sun off.  A catchment area of 8 km  provides a 10-year flood
discharge of 5 m per sec. The main drain requires regular maintenance to
prevent silting. In the case of rivers draining larger catchment areas,
execution of major recalibration works is necessary. In some cases, flood
control could be effected by a small levee 1-1.5 m high on one side of the
river, the other bank remaining flooded. The side protected by the levee is
then developed. The levee protects the first crop against early flooding, but
does not provide adequate protection for second-cycle rice. Consequently, the
levee is justified only for bottomlands where early flooding is likely, since
the occasional flooding occuring after July poses no problems. The areas most
suited to works of this type are those where the watercourse runs around the
edge of the flood zone (as in the case of Metsui towards Bamendou). The
advantage of the single levee is that it makes it possible to retain a main
bed wide enough to handle the peak flood without excessive flood control
works.
14.       Plot drainage.  The purpose of surface drainage is to drain off
the water resulting from exceptionally heavy rains. For the first cycle,
the crops should not be submerged for longer than 24 hours. A drainage



ANNEX 7
Page 5
network makes it possible to drain the annual peak 24-hour rainfall. Rain-
fall data analyses have shown that this 24-hour rainfall peak is 600 mm.
Taking account of evaporation and seepage, the flow to be drained off is
45 mm per day, or 5 liters per sec. per ha. Groundwater drainage is
necessary in certain irrigation units to keep the water table more than
50 cm below the surface during the first cycle. It is not useful for second-
cycle rice. The flows to be drained are small (0.2 liters per sec. at the
start of the wet season) because the soil in the bottom-lands soils are not
very permeable.
15.       A network of field drains 50-100 meters apart (depending on the
terrain) would bring the drained water into a collection drain discharging
into the river.  The drainage network would consist of shallow (30 and 50 cm
deep) ditches, to avoid excessive sinking of the water table.  The drainage
network would be equipped with small gates for controlling the drainage
process.  Excessive drainage is dangerous in bottomlands whose soils are
rich in organic matter, since this takes a long time to regain moisture.
The bottomlands would be developed in the form of 500 m2 plots surrounded
by bunds 20 cm high that will retain the water for rainfed rice.
16.       Irrigation.  Estimated irrigation water requirements are shown in
Table 4, which shows that, taking account of rainfall and soil water reserves,
irrigation is not necessary for the cropping patterns selected. There is a
shortage of water in January-February, which means that early maize cannot be
sown on reclaimed land during these months. But in the bottomlands, the
constant wetness of the soil and, in some cases, the proximity of the water-
table, make up for this shortage. However, in order to study the constraints
on cropping cycles created by total dependence on rainfall, an experimental
irrigated plot (10 ha) would be established for varietal trials, crop rota-
tion experiments, and to study the possibilities of intensification (3 rota-
tions a year). A simple gravity irrigation system would comprise a transverse
dike across the valley with a spillway, to raise the water level, and a head-
work control structure of reinforced concrete. A main canal and distribution
canals would distribute the water. The network would be designed on the
basis of a peak flow of 3,000 m3 per ha per month (irrigation 12 hours a day,
loss 65%), i.e. 2.5 liters per sec. per ha. This experimental plot would be
operated by the staff of the Bottomlands Cultivation Unit (para 18).
17.       Organization of Development Works.  A Bottomlands Development
Unit (BDU) would be set up within the Provincial Service of the Rural Works
Department (Genie Rural) which comes under the Provincial Delegation of
Agriculture. Under terms of contract to be signed with UCCAO, BDU would be
responsible for site identification, survey and engineering work, and
implementation of development works in selected bottomland areas. To back-
stop BDU capabilities, especially at the survey and design stage, provision
is made for consultancy services. Further details of organization and
staffing of BDU are in Annex 2.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
18.       Using equipment financed by the project, BDU would undertake land
preparation work itself with manual labor provided by farmers who would
eventually own plots in developed bottomlands. This means that plot alloca-
tion within bottomland areas scheduled for development would need to be
completed before the actual work can begin. For this purpose, a team of
irrigated crop extension specialists, the Bottomlands Cultivation Unit (BCU)
would be formed within the extension service of UCCAO. During land prepara-
tion, farmers would be paid an allowance of CFAF 300 (US$1.23) per day
worked since they would have no other source of income. The proposed cost
recovery arrangement discussed below (para 25) is designed to recover this
and other development costs from direct beneficiaries.
19.       Development Costs.  Costs over the 4-year investment period are
detailed in Annex 10, Table 12 and amount to CFAF 156 million (US$0.6 mil-
lion).
D.   Cultivation of Developed Bottomlands
20.       Plot Allocation.  The cooperative section closest to bottomlands
scheduled for development would be informed of the availability of plots
to qualified members. To qualify, the potential farmer should be, of course,
a cooperative member or his spouse. The extension specialist should be
satisfied that the farmer has enough labor in his household, has demonstrated
initiative and is willing to sign the "cahier des charges". This contract
between farmer and UCCAO would spell out their respective rights and obliga-
tions. For farmers, this would include the contribution of labor for land
development at a nominal wage, respecting technical advice given by extension
agents, payment of an annual participation fee and maintenance levy (para 25),
and delivery of a proportion of his paddy production to the extension service,
at the going market price, for milling. Cultivation rights would need to be
sanctioned, formally or otherwise, by the traditional authority at least for
cooperative sections, if not for individual farmers. Allocations would range
between 0.2 and 0.5 ha depending on family size and present land holding.
Landless young farmers would, depending on family circumstance, be allowed
up to 1.0 ha.
21.       Crops and Cropping.  Particular crops and cropping systems would
depend on the rainfall and soil characteristics. In general, there would be
two harvests a year. First cycle crops (January to June) would be market
vegetables (such as tomatoes, leeks, cabbage and soya) and maize. Beans need
to be harvested in dry weather and would therefore not be advised for the
first cycle. The growing cycle of maize depends on altitude (120 days at
1100 m, up to 150 days at 1500 m). Because of the permanent wetness of
bottomland soils, planting in January is possible. Drying after harvest
would need to be carefully watched, but this is not a problem specific to
bottomland maize. The variety recommended is Cola (M5 x CY) which yields
2-3 tons on small farmer plots. Seeds of other first cycle crops (vegetables)
would be mostly imported. There exists already in the project area a small
but rapidly growing private trade in imported vegetable seed (Annex 9). The



ANNEX 7
Page 7
irrigated crop cultivation unit (BCU) in the extension service would also keep
a small stock of vegetable seed which would supplement supply from private
sources.
22.       Second Cycle cultivation would be based almost exclusively on rain-
fed rice cultivation. The varieties most suited to project area conditions
are PD5A - PD5D and IAC 25. These are resistant to the usual crytogamic
diseases. Yields are about 2 t/ha. Irrigated and flood rice could give
higher yields but these would involve more complicated development works and
would require cultivation techniques not familiar to project area farmers.
For example, it would rule out ridging, a basic land preparation technique
in the project area which would be used for first cycle crops. The varieties
recommended are best replanted rather than being sown direct. The introduction
of this technique would require special attention. Seeds would be produced
by the project's Seeds Production Unit.
23.       Extension.  A Bottomlands Cultivation Unit (BCU) would be created
within the general extension service of UCCAO. It would participate in site
selection, and be responsible for plot allocation, farmer recruitment and
training, input supply and credit; collection and milling of paddy and rice
storage; and supervision of maintenance work on developed bottomlands. Staff
would consist of an agronomist, 5 extension agents and 5 monitors. The costs
of staff and related expenses are included in the general extension service
(Annex 10).
24.       Maintenance of Development Bottomlands.  Maintenance works consist
primarily in cleaning out main drainage canals and plot drainage channels
and in rebuilding dykes and bunds as necessary. Materials required are
simple work tools, cement and some earth. The project would provide BCU with
the required tools and an operating budget sufficient to purchase cement and
other building materials. The unit would be responsible for organizing
bottomland farmers to carry out necessary maintenance works under the technical
guidance of BDU staff. Such routine maintenance work is essential to this
project subcomponent. Consequently, bottomland farmers would be assessed
a maintenance fee per hectare, which they can pay either in cash or in the form
of labor contribution (5-7 working days per year) to be costed at the rate
of the going rural labor wage of CFAF 300 per day. Failure to contribute
either cash or labor would result in the loss of cultivation rights for any
farmer. Details of the proposed assessment procedure are provided in para 25
below.
25.       Cost Recovery.  The direct cost of bottomland preparation amounts
to CFAF 96,000/ha (US$392) before physical contingencies. This excludes
amortization of land preparation equipment and supervisory overhead costs,
including the technical assistance to be provided by consultants. Mainten-
ance costs are estimated at 1.5% of initial capital costs. Costs recovery
would be based on the following assessment:

2 earth rammers                                44 days
The time of dyking work would be about 2 months
The other part of perimeter development will be the same as the Drevious
case, without channel remodeling.

Technical Characteristics of lOha Irrigated Perimeter
Due to the deep embanking of the rivers (2,5 to 3 m) a river diversion for
irrigation would require a too long main canal above the perimeter (1,000 m with
gradient of 0,003).  This would not be possible because of the great permeability of soils.
Investment would consist of a transverse dyking with compacted earth with a
gabion spill-way and a stilling basin downstream at the foot of the dam.
This dam only aims to raise the level of water upstream to the perimeter
and does not permit sufficient water reserve. However, the upper area of the dam
would be permanently flooded.  The choice of the site would take it into account.
A. Irrigation
1. Earth dyke

Bottomland Development Program
Preliminary Inventory of Suitable Bottomlands
Departement de la Menoua
1.        Batsinla (Groupement Bafou)
This bottomland is located 6 km from Dschang on the road to Fokoue,
at an altitude of 1,500 m. It covers about 10 ha (maximum) and the upstream
is full of raffia. This plain is flooded in July to about 50 cm. it is
uncultivated, except for the periphery where maize is planted from February
to June. The development requires a drainage network with control in order
to ensure drainage and to allow a first cycle with vegetables or potatoes
and a second cycle with rice. Carrying out a first cycle with maize seems
possible because maize is actually planted early in February. Before develop-
ment, the ability to cultivate maize and rice should be verified as well as
the absence of flood before July. This area is densely populated and arabica
coffee and food crops (maize, vegetables) are grown. The lands would be
allocated to families already living in this area but the area is too small
to accommodate new settlers. Based on current cultivation practices and farm
sizes, the allotments would not exceed 0.2 to 0.5 ha. It is estimated that
30 to 40 families would increase the size of their holdings.
2.   Fokamezo
It is located in the Bafo Groupement 10 km from Dschang, east of
the Fokoue road, at an altitude of 1,400 m.
3.   Balefock
It is located in the Bamendou Groupement 15 km from Dschang of
Fokoue road. It is a wide bottomland but only about 10 ha are cultivable,
the rest being covered by palm trees (not raffia). Its development
requires drainage and flood protection by dykes because of the large size
of the stream. The area is densely populated and the land would be dis-
tributed among the families already living thereabouts.
4.   Fontotongo
Located 20 km north-west of Dschang, it is a wide plain covered
by raffia on the upstream and with dry and uncultivated land downstream.



AXNEX 7
Appendix 1
Page 2
It requires drainage investments and protection against flood (remodelling
or dyking after study). The inhabitants would greatly benefit in using these
lands because they have tried, without success, to dig ditches in order to
reduce the flow of water. Only a complete field reconnaissance would permit
the appraisal of the cultivable land (more than 30 ha).
5.   Plains of Metsui and Tsonnv
These are flooded plains in the valley of Metsui and Tsonny rivers
near Bamendou (between Dschang and Bafoussam). Despite the black soils,
large areas are uncultivated (not even raffia grows there). In some places,
the inhabitants have erected ridges of more than 1.5 m to have new cultivable
lands, and several hundred hectares of land are available. The flooding
conditions would have to be studied by measuring the water height and its
period. The streams would require dyking in order to allow development of
the valley. Development of these bottomlands would have to be carried out in
several stages starting with a 1st perimeter (150 ha) at the level on the
road close to Bamendou village. The study of such catchment would be done
for the whole area even if only a small part is developed. Otherwise develop-
ment of the last perimeters might upset the hydrological features of the first
developed areas.
DEPARTEIENT DE LA MIFI
6.   Badie
Located 15 km north-east of Bafoussam in the Baleng Groupement,
this bottomland is a flooded area aot actually used by farmers, while the
lands around it are planted with almost pure stand maize. Its altitude is
relatively low (1,100 m) and allows carrying out of a short 1st cycle with
maize (as early as February) followed by rice cultivation. The area to be
developed is estimated to be about 150 ha and requires controlled drainage
(groundwater nears 40 cm in dry season) and flooding protection. The hydro-
logical features would be taken into consideration before designing the
sub-project (redirecting the stream in the valley would seem sufficient).
Land distribution would be done among the inhabitants of Baleng but the size
of the perimeter would allow the settlement of presently landless families.
DEPARTEMENT DE BAMBOUTOS
7.   Ferme-Ecole de Bagam
The school-farm of Bagam situated on the road to Mbouda Galim trains
landless young men for one year and afterwards they are given portions of
land by administration.  Bamboutos is the least populated department of the
highlands and constitutes an area for immigrants. In the perimeter of the
school farm held by the Evangelic Mission, there exists 10 ha of bottomlands
that are ill-drained and not actually used, but only for grazing place.



ANNEX 7
Appendix I
Page 3
The development of this bottomland would have the advantage of ensuring a
good training in bottomland cultivation. The conditions of the integration
of this perimeter in the bottomland program would be fixed between the
Project Management and the school farm of Bagam.
8.   Nkieneghang
At 30 km from Mbouda between Galim and Bamendjing there is about
40 to 50 ha of swampy land due to the accumulation of rainfall runoff. The
development of this bottomland requires reshaping of a little brook and
a slight drainage. It is not very populated and the achievement of its
development would require installation of new settlers.
The Western Highlands has many other similar valleys which we
could not visit which would be studied in the first year of the project in
order to choose the areas best to be developed. The large valleys, however
interesting they are, were eliminated in the first stage of the project
but would be considered in the follow-up project after experience has been
gained in the bottomland development.

WESTERN HIGHLANDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Village Water Supply
Background
1.        Village water supply is currently inadequate in the project area.
Existing facilities are at substantial distances and are too few to handle
all requirements. Water from backwaters and natural water points are subject
to health hazards. In addition there is a shortage of good quality water for
coffee processing (Annex 9), which results in coffee of low standard. The
farmers are not fully aware of this problem, so that the development of
water points for coffee treatment would need to be accompanied by a farmer
education program.
2.        Table 1 gives the number and quality of water supply schemes by
arrondissement. The rural population is served by 160 existing water
supply facilities, serving an estimated 185,000 people; however, the popu-
lation served by water supply facilities in satisfactory condition does
not exceed 130,000, or 20% of the rural population. Surveys by the Rural
Works Department show that 30% of the existing schemes are either in poor
condition or out of order.
3.        Existing schemes are of three types:  (a) spring collection,
with a small concrete cistern and an area where the water can be drawn;
(b) concrete wells; and (c) piped supply schemes operating by gravity,
with pipes running from a spring collection point or a river offtake.
Table 2 contains a listing of the schemes by arrondissement. Of the 160
facilities, 64% are of the spring collection type, 19% are wells, and 17% are
piped supply schemes. Causes of the poor condition or complete breakdown of
the existing water supply schemes include:
(a) Clogxing of the Springs - After three or four years, the
draining trenches become blocked by raffia roots. Also,
the laterite block linings gradually decompose into a
powdery red mud which fills the interstices. Within a
few years, the flow trickles down to practically nothing.
Maintenance consists of clearing the trench, removing the
roots, replacing the decomposing blocks with stone rather
than laterite material (granite is found in abundance in
these regions), and changing the faucets and other fittings.
(b) Wells - Instead of a poured concrete lining, the wells
are lined with precast sections that are not rigid



ANNEX 8
Page 2
enough to withstand the passage of time. The twells are
usually dug to a water level of around 1-1.5.  While flow
measurements have been undertaken, .h --at er lavels are
usually inadequate in view of the poor permeability of
the deeper soil (laterite and clay), and the needed
discharge of 0.7-1 liters/sec is not achieved. Furthermore,
because the wells are not scraped or cleaned they gradually
clog up, thus reducing water intake.
(c)  Pumping - Most of the wells were initially equipped with
hand pumps, but nearly all pumps are now out of order.
Inadequate maintenance is attributable to lack of means,
especially spare parts, and to inadequate training of the
users.
(d)  Piped Supply Schemes are in poor condition either because
the catchment area has clogged up (see above) or because
the metal pipes are wearing out.
4.        Agencies.  The Rural Works Department (RWD) is responsible for the
programming, installation, and maintenance of the water supply schemes in
rural areas. In the project area, RWD is represented by the Rural Eagineering
Service in Western Province (Genie Rural), which is based in Bafoussam. The
Provincial Service is part of the Provincial Agricultural Delegation. Each
Department has a Rural Engineering Section.
5.        Genie Rural is headed by a rural engineer and his assistant.  Each
Departmental Section is headed by a technical officer. Present staff in the
province consists of: two rural engineers, six technical officers, two
technical assistants, 42 permanent employees such as surveyor, drivers,
laborers, etc., and 70 temporary workers during construction periods. The
service has three trucks and seven automobiles, of which three are in good
running order, and a small compressor. Worksite equipment, for the wells in
particular, is inadequate. Basic equipment--such as moulds for well-lining,
prefabricated pipes, air pumps and compressors to work in the groundwater--
does not exist. The service has a workshop at Bafoussam, equipped to handle
small repairs.
6.        Genie Rural obtains CFAF 10 million (US$0.04 million) from the
Government and CFAF 6 million (US$0.02 million) from FONADER each year for
water supply projects. In 1976, it installed 35 spring collection schemes,
six wells, and five pipe water supply schemes. In addition to these activi-
ties, Genie Rural is responsible for the construction of about 50 buildings,
and most of its staff are engaged in this program.
7.        All the external agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture have
been under a single unit, the Provincial Delegation, since 1973. This
reform was aimed at correcting operational deficiencies, but an attendant
result has been an excessive centralization of control over personnel,

finance and material resources. The Provincial Service chiefs require
more control over their operations in the interest of greater efficiency.
Types of Water Supply Schemes Proposed for the Proiect
8.        Spring Collection.  Springs are abundant in the undulating Western
Highlands. They are found either at valley bottom or half-way down the
slopes. The presence of raffia palms is a useful indicator of a spring site.
A typical spring collection facility consists of V-shaped trenches, dug 20 to
100 cm long (depending on the site), 30-80 cm deep, and 40 cm wide. These
trenches are filled with large-size filter materials (10-15 cm) and sealed
off with a concrete casting. To obtain the best discharge, the trenches
should be continued for as long as there are channels to be enclosed. A
pipe is run to a concrete cistern large enough to accommodate night-time flow.
The cistern supplies faucets and sometimes laundry troughs, and it becomes
optional when discharge is greater than 1-1.5 liter/sec. Average discharge
from the springs is estimated at around 1 liter/sec, at the time of the
coffee harvest (October-December). Minimum flow occurs in March-April.
9.        Under the project, the same method of construction would be used
with slight modifications. The main innovation concerns the concrete lining
of the filter trenches. At present, the lining is poured on the spot,
in a thick layer which runs through the stone aggregate and leads to wastage
and obstruction. In addition, when the trenches are repaired, the lining
has to be broken with a chisel or miner's bar. It would be preferable to
line the trenches with prefabricated concrete slabs (dallots), 40 x 100 x
5 cm, mortared together on the spot. Each slab weighs 55 kg, and can be
handled without difficulty. Mainteaance and monitoring of the condition
of the trenches would be performed more easily and faster.
10.       Wells.  In the absence of surface water, villages obtain their
supply from wells. These are 1.20 m. in diameter, 15-20 m. deep, and lined
with precast concrete sections. Because they are not sunk far enough into the
water table, the wells tend to dry up. The portion below the water level
(catchment area) tends to become clogged. Since the pumps are usually
out of order, the water is drawn by the traditional rope and bucket method,
which leads to pollution. The water seldom meets health standards. Dis-
charge at present is low (less than 1 m3/hour).
11.       For wells constructed under the project, the design would be
improved through:
(a) construction of a concrete surface around the well,
with a slope and drainage channels to prevent the
well head from becoming muddy and to keep dirty
water out of the well;
(b) down to the water level, construction of a continuous
reinforced concrete lining (diameter 120 cm), anchored
directly into the ground;



A4NEX 8
Page 4
(c)  for the catchment portion, installation of precast concrete
sections below the water level.  These sections would have
an external diameter of 100 cm, and the precast concrete
pipe would continue over the lining for 50 cm, but with
no concrete seal so that the well is not damaged if the
pipe shifts out of place;
(d)  around the pipe, installation of gravel filter of a caliber
to be decided, depending on soil type (about 5 mm);
(e) at the bottom of the well, installation of filter material
about 30 cm thick;
A hand pump would be installed on the well. This would tend to prevent pol-
lution, and the well can also be covered by a movable concrete slab. Selec-
tion of the pump would be based on a measurement of the actual discharge.
For the care of these pumps, it would be essential that a maintenance
structure be set up either as part of the Rural Engineering Department or at
the level of the village community concerned. A well of this type can dis-
charge 3-4 m /hour.
12.       Piped Supply.  Schemes of this type are justified for densely
populated areas, say 3,000-5,000 inhabitants, or when the location of the
spring is too far away from the residential areas and at a higher elevation.
A typical piped facility comprises a collection system from one or more
springs or a river offtake. The water is carried through a network of pipes
to public fountains. Schools, clinics, and public buildings can be hooked up
to the system if the discharge is heavy enough.
13.       Under the project, the type of piped schemes to be constructed would
be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the type of water source,
(spring, river offtake, groundwater), discharge, accessibility, and the
number of people to be supplied. For each location, a brief evaluation
of these aspects would be prepared before construction. Afterwards, regular
flow measurements would be taken.
Estimated Farm Water Requirements
14.       Coffee is harvested between October and mid-December, with 90%
harvested in the first 50 days (the harvesters going around the farm every
2-3 days). The coffee is first sorted by being placed in water to eliminate
floaters, then the wet cherries are pulped, fermented overnight, and
washed. Treatment has to start within 24 hours of harvesting to prevent
parasite fermentation. Stinking beans is also avoided by correct cherry
treatment, which requires an abundant supply of clean water at each stage
(Annex 9). At present, the farmers either treat their coffee in basins,
using water drawn from the springs (this means they use far too little
water, which leads in particular to inefficient sorting), or else they



ANNEX 8
Page 5
immerse the baskets of harvested cherries in the streams or the stagnant
polluted waters of the bottomlands.
15.       For planning purposes, it can be assumed that each farmer reaps
30 kg of dried coffee every three days. On this basis, in view of the
large number of farmers, there would be an average regular daily input of
cherries at the water point af 10 kglfarmer/day. For every kilo of cherries,
10 liters of water is required. Another 100 liters are required for the
family's domestic uses. Thus an average farm consumes 200 liters of water
a day during the coffee treatment season. Although this average figure is
sufficient for planning the region's overall supply requirements, a more
precise survey of the coffee area would be needed to determine how these
requirements are distributed.
Location Criteria
16.       The number and location of water points would be determined on the
basis of the following factors:
(a) Discharge. A properly developed spring will discharge
an average of I liter/sec in November-December, and
the flow does not start to decrease significantly
until February. This flow makes available a volume of
40 m3 of water during the day (11 hours) to 200 families,
or 1,400 inhabitants, assuming seven persons per family.
(b) Distance. A water point cannot supply people living more
than 1.5-2 km away, so that its total service area cannot
exceed 12 km2. People living further away would continue
to use the nearest streams. Consequently, for areas with a
population density lower than 120/km2, provision would be
made for one water point every 12 km2, even if it is under
utilized. For areas with a population density of over
120 km2, there would be one water point for every 1,400
inhabitants.
On these bases, the theoretical requirement for water points is estimated
at 291, distributed as follows (see Table 3): Menoua - 81; Bamboutos -
78; and Mifi 92. Nde (project area) - 13; Haut Nbam (project area) -
12; and Bamoun (project area) - 15. The number of potential sites far
exceeds this theoretical figure. Certain areas which appear to lack
suitable sites (Bangou arrondisement in Mifi, Batcham group in Bamboutos)
would be prospected early in PY 1.
The Proiect Component
17.       The number of schemes proposed would meet 75% of requirements,
allowing for some continued use of streams and rivers. The program of

construction, allowing for the ongoing activities (including rehabilitation
of existing schemes) of Genie Rural would be as follows:

Annex 4 shows the detailed distribution by arrondissement.
18.       The first schemes to be constructed would be those supplying people
who live the furthest away from existing sources of supply, whether natural
or developed. Installation of new schemes would be dovetailed with the
other project activities, in particular with the provision of training and
supervisory structures designed to make the farmers aware of the importance
of water to good-quality coffee treatment. The phasing would be as follows:
Year 1    Year 2    Year 3    Year 4   Total
Spring collection of wells              -         65         80        73       218
Small piped schemes                     -           1         2         4          7
Medium piped schemes                    -           1         1         -          2
Rehabilitation of existing schemes    11           20        20         -        51
Rehabilitation of the existing schemes would be carried out by Genie Rural,
and would be financed out of its annual operating budget which is sufficient
for this purpose. With 50% of its budget assigned to rehabilitation, the
Department could complete this program in three years. The other 50% of the
budget should support regular maintenance of all water supply schemes.
Costs

and Annex 10, Table 11.

/1   Calculation of Taxes:  10% on c.i.f. prices for equipment and vehicles.
10% on works.
Cost of Maintenance
20.       Maintenance of the water supply facilities takes place every three
or four years, at an approximate cost of CFAF 250,000 (i.e. CFAF 70,000 per
year). The construction of 220 schemes would require the inclusion in the
national budget of incremental annual maintenance outlays of CFAF 15 million.
Participation by the beneficiaries, which has been started in a small way,
must be strongly encouraged. The savings from self-help maintenance are
hard to assess, but could easily represent around 25% of the cost of main-
tenance, while such savings are offset by the cost of the necessary extension
service, it is essential to encourage the participation of local human
resources. But this type of human investment should not replace a main-
tenance budget. Without a budgetary provision for maintenance, the new
facilities would, in a few years, be in the same state of disrepair as the
existing ones are today.
Organization
21.       Construction.  The water supply component would be constructed
by Genie Rural which is experienced in this field. A Village Water Supply
Unit would be created within the Department, to be responsible for con-
struction. The necessary personnel and equipment would be assigned to
this unit, which would be headed by a technical officer, who would be
directly responsible to the Chief of the Provincial Service. Project-
financed resources would be assigned to this unit to be used exclusively
in its programmed activities. These resources would be distributed
temporarily among the Departmental sections as needed for construction
purposes, and until construction is completed. Management of construction



ANNEX 8
Page 8
personnel would be the responsibility of the Chief of the Village Water
Supply Unit (hiring, wages, vacations, etc.). Control by project management
over all operating resources is an essential prerequisite for success.
22.       Works Control.  Before the beginning of each year, Genie Rural
would prepare the annual works program and a draft expenditure budget. These
would be submitted to Project. Management for approval. Upon completion
of the works, an acceptance report would be drawn up, and also a technical
brief describing the nature of the schemes, exact location, discharge, etc.
This brief would facilitate follow-up.
23.       Management.  Financial management would be the responsibility of
UCCAO which would sign an agreement with Genie Rural defining their mutual
obligations. UCCAO would have special accounts for the expeaditures of the
Village Water Supply Unit. The Unit would have its own analytical accounting
system to keep track of the cost of the works. The head of the Provincial
Department would be responsible for all technical matters pertaining to
village water supply installations. Supervisory staff is insufficient at
present and Government has agreed to assign two new technical assistants to
the unit.
