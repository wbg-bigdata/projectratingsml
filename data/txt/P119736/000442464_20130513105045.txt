F. Results Framework Analysis1

Project Development Objective. The objective of the project is to assist the Recipient to
increase access to agricultural inputs and technologies among targeted stakeholder
farmers in selected districts. Improved farmer access is expected to contribute to both
higher production levels (via increased acreage) and higher yields per acre, in turn
leading to greater household food self-sufficiency and the generation of surpluses for
sale, as well as reducing the gap between domestic production and consumption in 2010
and 2011. The support will also contribute to improving access to credit and to promotion
of and diversification to food crops other than maize.

  The EU grant was implemented as a fully blended trust fund under the Kenya Agricultural Productivity
and Agribusiness Project, and was supervised and monitored as part of that IDA operation. The Trust Fund
was de-linked from the IDA operation at the time of ICR preparation to allow the ICR to be submitted
through the portal.

    1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Enhancing Agricultural Productivity Project (EAPP) aimed to enhance
domestic food production by supporting smallholder farmers to produce more maize and
other crops in the 2010 and 2011 planting seasons. This was done in a three-pronged
approach aimed at supporting: (i) poor and vulnerable smallholder farmers in maize
production zones; (ii) smallholder farmers in marginal areas where maize does not do
well; and (iii) other smallholder farmers and traders through provision of input credit to
purchase agricultural inputs. The support to poor and vulnerable farmers was in the form
of input vouchers aimed at enhancing their maize production, mainly benefitting farmers
in the medium- to high-potential areas of the country where maize production takes place.
To address the plight of smallholder farmers in the marginal areas, where maize performs
poorly, and to diversify production, the EAPP supported the production and distribution
of planting materials for drought-tolerant crops (orphan crops). For the benefit of other
farmers willing to use fertilizers and other inputs but unable to finance their purchase, the
EAPP supported the scaling up of an existing input credit program by enhancing its scope
and outreach.

2.      In response to the 2008 food and fuel price crisis, the EAPP was prepared and
implemented under expedited procedures using the Bank’s OP 8.00 – Rapid Response to
Crises and Emergencies – and financed by the European Union’s Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP). The EAPP was therefore designed in line with the GFRP’s
overall framework, which provides for rapid Bank support for a comprehensive response
to the food crisis that balances short-run food stabilization with measures to ensure that
countries are able to cope better in the medium term. The design of the EAPP also took
into account the need to ensure that interventions were rapid, included the poor and
disadvantaged, and contributed towards achieving sustainable longer-run food security.

3.     To ensure that these needs were met, a strategic choice was made to support the
scale-up of two ongoing Government of Kenya (GoK) programs, namely: the National
Accelerated Agricultural Inputs Access Program (NAAIAP) and the Orphan Crops
Program (OCP). The choice of these two GoK programs was informed by the valuable
lessons learned from the implementation an earlier IDA-supported project (Kenya Input
Supply Project -KAISP6) and the need to have activities that were quick disbursing and
could immediately address the emergency situation. Despite its emergency nature, efforts
were made to ensure that the EAPP design also strategically complemented the IDA-
supported Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project (KAPAP), whose



6
 Through the support provided under KAISP, 48,000 smallholder farmers (96 percent of the targeted
beneficiaries) received input vouchers during the 2009 long rains planting season.


                                                  1
main objective is to increase agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholder
farmers. While KAPAP supports activities geared towards enhancing medium- to long-
term productivity and agribusiness development, the EAPP supported immediate input
supply interventions that mainly targeted poor smallholder farmers. The two projects
were therefore blended. The EAPP was implemented in 110 districts from across the
country. The districts were selected based on the poverty index and their suitability for
farming.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

4.      The objective of the EAPP was to increase access to agricultural inputs and
technologies among targeted smallholder farmers in selected districts. This improved
farmer access was expected to contribute to both higher levels of production and higher
productivity (yields/acre), which in turn would contribute to enhance household food
self-sufficiency and the generation of surplus for sale, as well as reduce the gap between
domestic production and consumption in 2010 and 2011. The support would also
contribute towards improving access to credit and promoting diversification to food crops
other than maize.

5.      The key outcome indicators to measure achievement of the development
objectives as reflected in the Results Framework of the project paper were:

       (a) Overall impact
          i. Incremental staple production in the target areas (measured in tons)
         ii. Maize yields in the targeted areas (measured as bags/acre)

       (b) PDO outcome indictors
          i. Number of farmers benefitting from the project
         ii. Farmers receiving improved seeds and fertilizer through input vouchers
        iii. Area cultivated with hybrid maize
        iv.  Area cultivated with orphan crops
         v.  Farmers adopting at least one improved food production technology

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.     The PDO and key indictors remained unchanged.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The primary target group for the input voucher scheme was smallholders
operating on one acre or less of land in areas with medium to high potential for increased
production of maize. Although farm size of less than one acre was among the criteria for
targeting, the inputs provided were for one acre. For the OCP, smallholders in areas with
marginal rainfall were targeted using the same criteria. Under both programs,
beneficiaries were selected by community committees composed of various stakeholders
                                             2
(local administration, agriculture and social services officers, church leaders, community
leaders, village development committees, Community Based Organizations (CBOs), and
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) operating in the area). For the agricultural
credit program, smallholder farmers, agro-input dealers, and other value chain players in
the agricultural sector were targeted according to the lending criteria established by the
participating financial institutions. Agro-dealers participating in the program were also
beneficiaries of training programs, as well as of the increased business generated by
voucher redemption.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8.      There were four components under the EAPP:

Component A. Scaling up the existing Agricultural Credit Program (Kilimo Biashara)
(€5.07 million): The project built on the partnerships already established between the
GoK, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Alliance for Green
Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and Equity Bank Limited. The objective was to enhance
targeted access of affordable financial services and capacity to agricultural sector value
chain players. The overall strategy was to provide a 10 percent guarantee fund on the
basis of which Equity Bank would provide credit facilities of up to US$50 million to
smallholder farmers, agro-input dealers, and other value chain players in the agricultural
sector. Sixty percent of the funds under this component (around €3 million) were used to
expand the Equity Bank facility while the remainder was used to establish similar
facilities in three other financial institutions, one of which was geared towards women
farmers. Under EAPP, the original design of the facility was maintained whereby the
participating financial institutions were to lend their own funds, equivalent to ten times
the amount deposited in the guarantee scheme. The financial institutions were to use their
established credit appraisal and repayment procedures. The participating financial
institutions undertook 90 percent of risk while the guarantee scheme absorbed 10 percent
of the risk, in case of any default.

Component B. Scaling up the existing input voucher scheme (Kilimo Plus) (€9.47
million): This seed and fertilizer voucher scheme targeted 150,000 smallholder farmers in
85 districts who could not access inputs for various reasons. Each beneficiary under the
Kilimo Plus program received a voucher with a total face value of KSh 6,1007
(approximately €56) to cover the cost of 10 kg of hybrid maize seed, 50 kg of basal
fertilizer, and 50 kg of top-dressing fertilizer, inputs sufficient for approximately 1 acre
(0.4 ha) of maize. In addition, this component supported the training and accreditation of
agro-dealers, especially in new districts. The agro-dealers and their capacity were
important as they played the critical role of supplying actual inputs to the beneficiaries.
Retroactive financing for eligible expenditures made after April 1, 2009 was included in
the legal agreement to allow for financing of the 2009/10 short rains and 2010 long rains
planting seasons.

 Based on 2009 prices of KSh 3,000 for DAP/basal fertilizer, KSh 2,000 for CAN/top dressing fertilizer,
and KSh 1,100 for 10 kg of hybrid seed.

                                                  3
The scaling up of the program was done in areas with good potential for increased
production to provide the greatest increment to domestic supply. The 85 districts were
identified based on the poverty index (i.e., they had a poverty index of 30 percent or
more) and their potential for maize production. The selected districts were spread across
the country.

Component C. Scaling up the Orphan Crop Program (€3.02 million): This component
focused on supplying planting materials of orphan crops to smallholder farmers in semi-
arid areas. This involved promoting farmer involvement in seed bulking and
multiplication of orphan and other crops, including sorghum, cassava, and millet, which
are drought-tolerant, more suitable for such areas, and could be important substitutes for
maize. The OCP involved production of about 1,500 MT of seeds and other planting
materials for distribution to 100 districts spread across the country.

Component D. Support to project administration costs (€1.57 million): This component
covered GoK operating costs, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and communications
and information sharing.

1.6 Revised Components

9.     There was no revision of the project components during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

10.     The following changes were made during implementation (see Annex 2 for
details):
    a) The EAPP contribution to the voucher scheme was scaled up by €1.45 million
        through cost savings under training activities and currency gains due to
        depreciation of the Kenya shilling.
    b) The modalities for voucher redemption were decentralized to the districts in the
        second year of the program.
    c) The closing date of the grant was extended by two months, to February 29, 2012,
        to allow for completion of the civil works under the OCP component and other
        activities such as soil testing and development of an electronic voucher (e-
        voucher) system for payments to agro-dealers.

    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.     The EAPP was designed to scale up and improve existing government programs,
which allowed it to be prepared quickly under emergency procedures. Kilimo Plus, the
voucher scheme, had been running since 2006 and was an earlier beneficiary of a World
Bank-administered emergency grant of US$5 million from the GFRP in 2009.8 This
allowed for lessons to be incorporated in the EAPP. Similarly, Kilimo Biashara has been
operating since 2009 with a risk-sharing guarantee facility funded by IFAD and AGRA in
partnership with Equity Bank, which was scaled up by IFAD in 2010. The EAPP was
fully blended with an ongoing World Bank sector support program, the KAPAP, which
provided an adequate safeguards and fiduciary framework. Given the experience already
gained, there was a reasonable expectation that the incremental funds provided by the
grant, as designed, would be able to be absorbed in a scale-up of these three programs.
Risks were correctly identified, and included capacity to implement a scaled up voucher
scheme at the national, district, and community levels. Risk of misuse of funds at the
local level was also assessed and was mitigated through increased audit and social
accountability mechanisms. In addition, weather-based risks were correctly identified as
the major risk to achieving the anticipated impact for all three project activities.

2.2 Implementation

12.     The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) had overall responsibility for project
implementation. The implementation of the input voucher scheme went well as its
implementation started on time and it was able to surpass its set targets. However, the
implementation of the ACGS and OCP components was delayed due to institutional
challenges. Implementation was facilitated by the establishment some important
partnerships and collaborations with the GoK, agencies such as the World Food
Programme (WFP), and the private sector. For example, market outlets for Gadam
sorghum were established with the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) and East
African Breweries Limited (EABL). The EAPP supported a number of communication
and visibility activities, such as documentaries and radio and TV programs, believed to
have reached large audiences in rural areas, also instrumental to project success. Some of
the challenges faced in implementation of the main project components are highlighted
next and further detailed in Annex 2.

13.    Agricultural Credit Program (Kilimo Biashara). This Agricultural Credit
Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) was launched in May 2008 in partnership with IFAD,
AGRA, MoA, and Equity Bank and was significantly expanded in 2010 using EAPP
funds. Through the EAPP, the ACGS was expanded in scope and outreach to include


8
  Agricultural Input Supply Program, TF-94287. The project was approved in April 2009 and closed in
June 2010.


                                                  5
three more financial institutions: Cooperative Bank, Family Bank, and Kenya Women
Finance Trust. Equity Bank was also retained as a participating financial institution. The
EAPP made available an additional €5million to the ACGS to complement the existing
scheme funded by IFAD and AGRA. The process of identifying potential participating
financial institutions started in April 2010 and was not completed until June 2011. There
were further delays in obtaining Treasury authority for private financial institutions to
open special accounts and to deposit the guarantee funds as agreed. There were also
changes in the agreed interest rates, which rose by 10 percent over the 18-month delay,
resulting in further delays in signing the agreements with the participating banks. Funds
were finally disbursed in November 2011. This resulted in delays in disbursing loans to
farmers, which finally commenced in February 2012. An Inter-Ministerial Committee
was formed to address the issue of interest rates and overall management of the credit
program. Due to these delays, the Bank and the European Commission (EC) agreed to the
GoK’s proposal to retain the unutilized funds in the post-project period and to use them
to continue and further enhance the ACGS.

14.     Input Voucher Scheme (Kilimo Plus). EAPP funds allowed for expansion of the
ongoing NAAIAP input voucher program from 2009 to 2011. The MoA developed a
comprehensive “Program Design and Guidelines? manual setting the structure of
NAAIAP, including the oversight bodies as well as the eligibility and voucher
redemption processes. Rules and guidelines for beneficiary selection were well known
and already being used by MoA staff and communities. As a result, beneficiary selection
processes went smoothly. However, delays in refunding agro-dealers for the inputs that
they had supplied to beneficiaries greatly impacted the confidence of suppliers and hence
reduced the potential impact of the program. This was despite the decentralization of the
payment system to the district level in the second year. The delay in paying stockists also
delayed supplying inputs because they could not replenish their stocks when their
working capital was tied up. To help address this problem, the EAPP financed the design
and pilot of an e-voucher system, which is pending implementation.

15.     Understaffing in the field offices and lack of appropriate skills among available
staff negatively impacted the monitoring of project activities and capacity building for
farmer beneficiaries, particularly due to inadequate knowledge of post-harvest
management of produce. However, the project progressively addressed this constraint
through training and other capacity-building activities. By the close of the project, over
3,000 national and district level staff had been trained on various aspects related to
project activities.

16.    Orphan Crops Program. Since inception, the OCP was mainly funded by the
GoK, implemented under the MoA’s Department of Crop Management. Its outreach has
been limited. Seed production was contracted to Kenya Agriculture Research Institute
(KARI), whose capacity to produce such seed was to be enhanced. A technical committee
was constituted to oversee the component; its membership included the relevant technical
Departments of MoA, KARI, and representatives of agro-dealers, AGMARK, and other
stakeholders.


                                             6
17.     Seed production did not proceed as planned. The main limiting factor was the
availability of good quality foundation seed for the production and multiplication of
planting materials for the orphan crops. The orphan crops foundation seed were only
available from KARI’s seed unit as no commercial seeds were available. This major
constraint was not anticipated at the design stage. This has mainly arisen due to the fact
that the seeds are grown under rainfed conditions, and the inadequate rainfall in 2010
severely limited the production of seed.

18.     Further complicating matters, procurement of irrigation equipment and civil
works for KARI and Agricultural Training Centers remained incomplete as of the project
closing date. Spreading component activities over too many districts limited its true
reach, allocating resources too thinly. Lastly, overreliance on district agricultural staff
with inadequate means to carry out activities limited the number of beneficiaries reached.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

19.     The grant utilized the existing monitoring structures under NAAIAP in particular
and the MoA as a whole to collect data on project performance. Food production data
were collected by frontline extension workers and compiled at the district level by district
agriculture staff. These data were deemed sufficient to document incremental production
arising from the input voucher scheme and the OCP. Data on the credit guarantee scheme
from the four participating banks were only received in 2012 due to the delays in getting
the component started, but have been adequate to evaluate the component (see section
below).

20.      A comprehensive impact evaluation was carried out by LOG Associates and
international consultants, and was completed in December 2011. The evaluation team
analyzed data collected by the MoA and carried out extensive interviews with key
stakeholders. A beneficiary assessment of 625 beneficiaries was carried out. The results
of this evaluation were used to complete this assessment (see Annexes 5 and 7).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

21.     Safeguards. The project was assigned environmental category B, as it had
minimal if any potential adverse impacts on human populations or environmentally
important areas. The project did trigger the environmental assessment and pest
management safeguard policies. The Environmental and Social Management Assessment
and Pest Management Plan developed in 2009 for the KAPAP program were used to
guide the implementation of the program. This included the use of a checklist for
screening the impact of physical investments and guidelines for safe handling of
agricultural inputs. In this regard, training of farmers and agro-dealers in safe handling
and disposal of any chemical waste was carried out as part of the voucher scheme.

22.    Financial Management and Procurement. The project did not comply with the
agreed arrangement of maintaining a segregated bank account. Despite opening a
separate project account, MoA continued to finance project activities through Ministry

                                             7
development accounts. In addition, expenditures totaling KSh 14,834,056.55 (about
US$174,000) were declared ineligible due to lack of supporting documents and payments
made without following the established guidelines and procedures. The Recipient has
been requested by the Bank to refund this amount. To date GoK has not yet refunded
KSh 2,247,597.40 (€20, 432.40), the undisbursed balance as of the time of the project
closing date. There were initial procurement delays regarding training of agro-dealers
and for irrigation equipment for KARI. However, these procurements were finalized
before the project closing date.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

23.     During implementation, the EAPP worked with several partners to realize specific
objectives. To expand market outlets, the project linked beneficiaries to the WFP, which
purchased maize in Trans Mara and Nandi North districts. In addition, the project worked
with the NCPB and EABL, which purchased Gadam sorghum. These linkages were
established with the help of various organizations, namely: Equity Bank, Cereal Growers
Association (CGA), East African Grain Council (EAGC), and Farm Concern
International (FCI). These organizations also carried out capacity building for project
beneficiaries on post-harvest management and grain quality control. The project
partnered with AGMARK, Agrochemical Association of Kenya (AAK), and International
Fertilizer Development Corporation (IFDC) to facilitate agro-dealer training, which was
supervised by the NAAIAP Secretariat. The partnership with FCI trained MoA staff as
trainers, who then trained the target groups. Finally, Financial Service Providers (FSPs)
and the MoA collaborated in training staff and farmers on financial matters. These
partnership arrangements will continue to strengthen program performance.

24.     The project design did not anticipate the lack of grain storage facilities at the farm
level as a constraint but their absence led to a loss of grain arising from aflatoxin
infestation. The regions most affected were the lower parts of the Eastern Province.
However, the GoK, through the Economic Stimulus Program, provided mobile grain
driers and standard community stores. The drier for Makueni district has already been
delivered to the site identified by the community. Farmers have also been linked to other
service providers who have provided storage facilities.

25.      The processing of vouchers was tedious and time consuming. For instance, at the
district level, the District Agricultural Officers (DAOs) were required to match each
voucher to the beneficiary farmer and each agro-dealer was required to issue an invoice
for all redeemed vouchers. The need for an e-voucher system to enhance effectiveness
was identified early on, and its development was financed under the program. The e-
voucher transaction platform was built upon a technological platform designed to reduce
the paperwork inherent in the payments to large numbers of farmers across the country,
improve accountability, and enhance monitoring of the entire program. The EAPP
program piloted the e-voucher system in five districts and trained field staff on its
operation. It is expected to reduce the time, cost, and human intervention in the
administration of the voucher scheme. The full-blown e-voucher system is planned for
rollout by the next short rains planting season in late 2013.

                                              8
26.      The EAPP program also facilitated soil testing to establish the types and rates of
fertilizers suitable for the different agro-ecological zones where maize production is
carried out. This was necessitated by the declining yields in some regions where di-
ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer was in use and the claim that soil acidity may be
increasing in some areas. It is hoped that in the future, location-specific fertilizer use will
be encouraged to replace the current practice whereby general recommendations are
applied across all regions.

27.     The GoK suspended the input voucher program in November 2012 pending
resolution of the audit queries mentioned above. The program is being evaluated, and the
e-voucher scheme is expected to be rolled out before the scheme re-commences, most
likely during the 2013 short rains planting season. The GoK has committed to maintain
the KSh 250 million annual budget funding for the input voucher scheme. Through
IFAD, the EU has committed €14 million to support a follow-on project that will focus
on the input voucher system, post-harvest loss management, and further expansion of the
OCP.

    3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

28.     The rationale and objectives of the project (i.e., to increase access to agricultural
inputs and technologies among targeted smallholder farmers9) were relevant against the
background of the 2008 food and fuel price crisis, which had major economic and
agricultural impacts in Kenya. The official overall inflation rate in Kenya increased from
12 percent in December 2007 to 31.5 percent in May 2008 before easing off to stand at
18.4 percent in August 2009. Poor rains in 2009 escalated the food emergency, leading to
an estimated 4 million people requiring famine relief. The predicted maize production for
the 2009 long rains season was estimated at 1.84 million metric tons (MT), 28 percent
below normal. There was growing apprehension that the estimated production would be
revised downwards further due to insufficient and erratic rains in some parts of the main
maize producing areas in the North Rift Valley. Continued export bans in neighboring
countries (particularly Tanzania) were likely to reduce cross-border maize inflows by 46
percent. The reduced levels of production and imports were compounded by the
tightening maize supply situation. High food prices persisted throughout the country,
with the average price of maize 100-130 percent above normal. As a result, the terms of
trade of pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, and marginal agriculture farmers and the
purchasing power of urban households deteriorated significantly, as over 65 percent of
Kenyans are net buyers of maize.

29.      High fuel prices in 2008 resulted in increased prices of farm inputs. Kenya has a
well-established fertilizer market, which is fully liberalized with the bulk of fertilizers
imported and distributed by the private sector. The GoK, through various agencies,
intervened in the market by importing around 241,000 MT of fertilizers, some of which
were financed by a credit from the African Development Bank and support from Japan.
This intervention was seen as temporary and was aimed at stabilizing the market. The
GoK also waived the import duty on maize imports until January 2010. It was planned
that a total of 670,000 MT of maize would be imported by the GoK and the private sector
to close the consumption gap. While most of these interventions were geared towards
easing the food shortage, there was also a need to boost production in the coming
seasons, thereby ensuring adequate supply in the coming years.

30.     Although maize is Kenya’s main staple food, there is an overdependence on
maize both at the national food policy level and amongst households. This is despite the
fact that in the recent past, the non-cereal components of agricultural Gross Domestic


9
  The MoA has developed criteria for the selection of farmers as recipients of the Kilimo Plus/ Bora
package, including: low income and limited farm size; ability and intention to produce maize on at least
one acre; membership to farmer groups for ease of training and logistical support; land preparation is
completed before receipt of inputs; and priority to women and child-headed households.




                                                    10
Product (GDP) have performed significantly better than cereals, particularly maize.
Given that the country seems to be headed for a structural maize deficit arising from
population growth, urbanization, and poor and erratic weather conditions, shifting
consumption and production patterns towards other cereals and non-cereals food items
had become a necessity. This would not only help improve food security, but would also
help to diversify farmers’ incomes while assisting them with coping with the effects of
climate change.

31.     The grant helped to demonstrate clearly that poor smallholder farmers can realize
higher staple food production when supported with critical farm inputs such as fertilizers
and seeds and other services such as extension. As Kenya’s commercial sector is better
developed than in many other African countries, the design choice to support a strategy
of building the capacity of and stimulating demand for agro-dealers to serve smallholder
farmers needs was relevant. The use of the agro-dealer model demonstrated that the
objective of offering subsidies to targeted farmers can be achieved while minimizing
distortions in commercial market operations (e.g., inputs were priced at the going market
price and the vouchers were redeemed from commercial traders (the agro-dealers)).
Nevertheless, more can be achieved in this regard when a better structured and more
efficient voucher redemption system is put in place. The strategy of graduating voucher
recipients as potential customers for private sector seasonal credit programs and
providing a modest amount of risk coverage for the financial institutions, which are
already present in Kenya’s rural space, also remains sound.

32.     The objective of encouraging diversification at the farm level through adoption of
traditional high-value crops in marginal agricultural areas also proved to be relevant. This
was particularly the case where market/commercial opportunities existed. A case in point
is the promotion of sorghum for brewing, which the project was able to catalyze in
Kenya’s Eastern lowlands. The grant also convinced the GoK to decentralize
management of the input scheme to the district level, although the success of this
approach in the first season was mixed. Lessons learned from this experience helped the
GoK to: (i) improve the flow of documentation and funds, speeding up the process for the
2011 season; and (ii) pilot an e-voucher system.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

33.      This emergency project was put into place to respond to the 2008 food price
crisis. However, delays in implementation led to few real impacts before the 2012 season.
While the project largely ultimately achieved its objective of increasing farmers’ access
to agricultural inputs and technologies, such that the project met or exceeded most of its
overall impact targets, it is not clear that it was sufficiently timely enough to be deemed
effective. Based on overall impact indictors, the EAPP:
    x Achieved an incremental staple production in targeted areas of 281,677 MT, more
         than three times the projected target.
    x Contributed to increased maize yields in targeted areas to 14 bags per acre,
         exceeding the baseline of 6 bags per acre (a 133 percent increase) but under the
         original target by 1 bag per acre.

                                            11
       x   Directly benefited a total of 542,647 farmers (excluding credit guarantee scheme
           beneficiaries). Some 290,000 farmers benefited from training and capacity-
           building activities while another 260,000 beneficiaries were able to access
           publicity and other materials from the project.10 The number of direct
           beneficiaries did not reach the original target of 1,150,000, however, mainly due
           to constraints encountered in multiplication of the orphan crops planting
           materials. Thus, this indicator was 47 percent under its targeted value, a
           significant shortcoming.
       x   Failed to meet the target of farmers adopting at least one improved food
           production technology; only about 43 percent of farmers did so.

34.    An impact assessment of beneficiary households indicated that household income
and welfare improved as a result of participating in the EAPP. The increased income at
household level enabled some families to invest in other income-generating investments,
such as the motorcycle taxi business (bodaboda). Some beneficiaries acquired assets such
as improved housing, land, cattle, and goats. The increased income also enabled some
farmers to diversify into cattle and goat rearing, horticultural farming, mushroom
growing, and value addition of maize through milling and branding.

35.   The achievements made in each of the project components as per development
outcome indictors are summarized below.

36.      Input Voucher Component: This was the main component of the project, with
an allocation of over 60 percent of the total grant amount. This component had three main
outcome indictors relating to both the number of farmers receiving improved seeds and
fertilizers and the area cultivated with hybrid maize. Through the EAPP’s interventions:
    x A total of 244,364 farmers in 89 districts received improved seeds and fertilizers
         through input vouchers, exceeding the target of 150,000 farmers.
    x Arising from this, a total 31,424 MT of fertilizers and 3,142 MT of seed were
         procured and distributed to farmers during the project implementation period.
         These represented 134 percent of the targeted volume of fertilizer; incremental
         maize seed distributed exceeded its target by 70 percent.
    x The fertilizers and seed were used to cultivate an additional 77,580 hectares with
         hybrid maize, surpassing the target of an additional 61,100 hectares.

37.    To facilitate the redemption of input vouchers, the project supported the training
and accreditation of agro-dealers throughout the country. Through this support:
    x 2,685 agro-dealers were trained against a target of 2,000, which helped decrease
       the distance that farmers traveled to acquire inputs, from 15-35 km to 9-15 km.

38.     The impact assessment indicated that agro-dealers have started to report increased
sales of inputs across the country due to increased demand for fertilizer and certified


10
     A significant number of trainees are also direct project beneficiaries.


                                                         12
seed. This is a clear indication that some of the beneficiary farmers have started to
purchase inputs on their own. Through the EAPP, the concept of cereal banking has also
picked up11; 172 cereal banks were formed to help farmers manage their harvest and
reinvest in farming. Some of these cereal bank groups have started to apply for loans
from the ACGS.

39.    Orphan Crops Program Component: The area cultivated with orphan crops
was the main outcome indictor under this component:
    x An additional 62,008 hectares were cultivated with orphan crops against an
       incremental target of 130,000 hectares, or about 70 percent of the target.
    x By the close of the EAPP, 298,407 farmers (176,885 female and 121,522 male)
       had received and planted orphan crops planting materials.

40.    In addition, there is evidence that orphan crops increased nutritional outcomes, as
some beneficiaries retained grain legumes produced from drought-tolerant seeds for
home consumption, thereby enriching their diets. Lastly, arising from the EAPP support,
about 15,000 farmers were organized into 15 commercial villages where they grow,
package, and sell seeds and other plantings as a business venture.

41.     Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Component: During project design, no
outcome indictor was assigned to this component as it was felt that the activities
supported under it were not directly linked to the PDO. Despite implementation delays,
the participating financial institutions are making progress in implementing the credit
guarantee scheme funded under EAPP as indicated below:
    x Equity Bank, which had previous experience in managing Kilimo Biashara, had
        loaned KSh 637,906,505 (US$74 million) to 7,396 borrowers by the end of
        November 2012.
    x Ninety-six percent of the loans were made to smallholder farmers and 4 percent to
        agro-dealers.
    x Two other banks (Family Bank and Cooperative Bank) that joined the scheme in
        2011 had made loans totaling KSh 20.3 million to 98 farmers and agro-dealers by
        December 2012.
    x Defaults to date remain low, at 3 percent.

42.     These numbers seem to indicate that the design of the ACGS was sound. Farmers
supported through input vouchers are graduating and are able to form cereal banking
groups and to access loans through the ACGS. The results of the beneficiary survey show
that in 2007/08, 73 percent of input voucher beneficiaries graduated to Kilimo Biashara.
In 2008/09, 24 percent graduated; in 2009/10, 23 percent; and in 2010/11, 34 percent.
Amongst those interviewed, 74 percent had taken credit to purchase farm inputs.


11
   Cereal banks are formed by farmers coming together after harvest to store their grain in a common
warehouse/store, thereby enabling them to use the stored grain as collateral or to sell the grain when the
price improves in the market.


                                                     13
3.3 Efficiency

43.     The Emergency Project Paper prepared by the World Bank in March 2010
estimated that the incremental benefit from the input voucher scheme alone would be
valued at €27 million. This was due to an assumption of an incremental production of 9
bags per acre valued at KSh 2,200 per bag, resulting in 121,500 MT of maize. The value
of production expected from other staple crops was estimated at €13.8 million. The ICR
end-of-project estimates exceed those appraisal estimates. Incremental production of
maize from the voucher scheme is now 281,677 tons; valued at KSh 25,000 per ton, this
yields a total value of €60.4 million. The incremental value of production resulting from
the OCP component is estimated at €9.5 million. The total incremental value is estimated
to be €75.53 million (see Annex 3 for further details).

44.     Data limitations precluded the conduct of a full economic analysis. A simple
return on investment (ROI) was calculated using the total project investment of €19.13
million and the estimated €75.53 million in returns from the three components (at current
prices); this yields an overall ROI of 295 percent and a benefit/cost ratio of about 3.
However, these figures are likely to be significant overestimates, as they use only project
costs in their calculation, rather than incorporating the opportunity costs of items not
covered in the direct project costs (e.g., labor).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

45.    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

46.     Despite delays and implementation hitches, the design of the program, which built
on existing, ongoing programs, allowed agreed targets for the main input voucher
component to be exceeded. This ensured that the project met or exceeded most of its
overall impact targets. However, the other components did not meet their targets and the
project implementation encountered several fiduciary and institutional shortcomings. On
balance, a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory is justified based on the partial
achievements of the outcome indictors and the significance of the implementation
challenges encountered.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

47.     Improved household incomes. The increased income at the household level has
enabled some families to invest in other income-generating investments (such as money
transfer services on a mobile telephone platform (M-Pesa) and motorcycle taxi businesses
(bodaboda)), and to venture into other agricultural enterprises (such as horticultural
farming, dairy production, and poultry keeping). Some beneficiaries have improved their
housing and the lighting for their homes and some have purchased assets such as cattle,
goats, sheep, and land.


                                            14
48.    Positive impact on education. Child retention in schools increased from 78
percent to 98 percent in the Eastern Province due to the increased availability of food at
the household level in the 2010 crop season. There has also been a substantial reduction
in secondary school fee debts due to the improved financial capability of beneficiaries.

49.    Gender impact. One-third of the recipients of agricultural loans under the Kilimo
Biashara component were women. Over half of the recipients of planting materials under
the OCP component were women. Information disaggregated by gender of input voucher
scheme recipients was not found as the benefit was linked to household ownership.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

50.      The EAPP carried out a substantial number of capacity-building activities.
Training of public servants included process and technical training at the community,
district, and national levels. Study tours to observe other voucher schemes took place. A
training of trainers course in sorghum production and marketing was especially useful to
link dryland farmers to markets. Over 200,000 farmers were trained under all three
project components. Agro-dealer training was an important activity under the voucher
scheme component. Commercial trainers were trained by AGMARK, and over 2,600
agro-dealers were trained under the project.

51.     The most serious implementation issue, delays in paying input suppliers,
undermined the reputation of the input voucher scheme. As a result, many credible
stockists avoided transacting with the program for fear of delays in payments. The
decentralization of payments to the district level helped to address these delays. However,
the design of the e-voucher system financed by the EAPP should more comprehensively
address this problem in the future.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

52.     Establishment of cereal banking. Beneficiaries of the input voucher program were
encouraged to collect surplus grain in common stores. These cereal banks provide a
source of grain close to the communities and serve to increase the value of the grain
retained by the producers from the sale of surpluses. A total of 172 cereal banks were
established, with over 7,000 bags of maize collected in the banks when the weather was
favorable.

53.      Piloting of an e-voucher system. This was necessitated by the large volume of
paperwork required to redeem the input vouchers and, thereafter, process payments for
the suppliers. This exercise is ongoing, with data from five pilot districts already fed into
the trial system. In addition, a farmers’ hand-card was developed that will serve as a
monitoring tool to track the progress of beneficiaries.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

54.     A beneficiary survey of 625 respondents from nine districts was conducted as part
of the end-of-project impact evaluation exercise. The survey mainly focused on the

                                             15
voucher scheme, and found that 96 percent of voucher scheme recipients considered the
selection process “good or fair?; 91.3 percent had received training; 96 percent reported
increased productivity; and 58 percent reported greatly improved food security. Among
agro-dealers, 70 percent received training; 42 percent indicated that high transaction costs
and transport costs were their biggest constraint. Regarding the Kilimo Biashara program,
74 percent of participants had taken credit to purchase farm inputs. A summary of the
main findings of both the beneficiary survey and a related impact assessment can be
found in Annex 5.




                                            16
      4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
55.     Rating: Moderate

56.     The risk to development outcomes is rated moderate, due to the implementation
risks remaining for the ACGS and the restructuring of the input voucher scheme and the
OCP. Delays in the disbursement of funds for Kilimo Biashara/ACGS mean that
farmer/agro-dealer repayment rates are still unknown. However, indications from the past
loan repayments point to a low default rate, especially given that the financial institutions
involved are using time-tested screening and repayment appraisal procedures.
Furthermore, the GoK has committed itself to the institutionalization of the scheme into
an agricultural credit guarantee fund, and a detailed plan has already been developed. The
e-voucher system has been designed and tested on pilot basis, and is proposed for scale-
up under the EAPP follow-on project to be implemented in 2013 through further support
from the EU. The GoK has started restructuring the voucher scheme in readiness for its
rollout in the October 2013 season. On the positive side, farmer graduation from the
voucher scheme to the credit scheme is robust, and Kenya has the necessary private
sector enabling environment to support a sustainable, private sector-driven input supply
system for small farmers.

      5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

57.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.     Preparation was done efficiently in accordance with the emergency procedures.
The preparation team appraised the operation such that it was most likely to achieve
planned development outcomes given the short implementation period. The experience
and lessons learned in implementation of other sector projects, and in particular the IDA-
supported KAISP, were used to inform the design and implementation arrangements. The
provisioning for retroactive financing also allowed the GoK to initiate the input voucher
scheme and other activities on time. However, in hindsight, the appraisal clearly
underestimated the time required to produce and distribute the orphan crops materials.
This led to overly ambitious outcome indictors for this component.

      (b) Quality of Supervision

59.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.     A Nairobi-based task team leader carried out World Bank supervision of the
grant. This allowed for regular and effective liaison with the government’s NAAIAP
management team at the national level. International technical staff participated as part of
regular supervision as did Nairobi-based EC staff. Implementation problems were
covered comprehensively in supervision reports and time-bound plans for improvement
were agreed. Although regular fiduciary supervision was carried out, including an in-
depth review in 2012, the EAPP ended up with several fiduciary issues that could have
been identified and resolved earlier. The significant delay in the ICR itself is noted as a
shortcoming. A more pro-active follow-up on institutional development issues across the
four components would have been welcome.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

61.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.    Preparation was timely and efficient. The project design was simple and the
Bank’s internal review was comprehensive. Supervision was undertaken regularly but
there were several fiduciary weaknesses that could have been resolved during
implementation. Again, the delay in the ICR is identified as a detractor to a higher rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

      (a) Government Performance

63.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                             18
64.    The GoK made known its interest to use and scale-up existing programs and was
open to suggestions for improvement and requirements for monitoring during
preparation. Coordination between MoA and Treasury on Kilimo Biashara was lacking
and caused significant delays. Slow release of funds from Treasury to MoA further
exacerbated program delays.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

65.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.     Despite recognition of implementation problems in all three components as
outlined above, many of these problems persisted up to the end of the project. Project
benefits, while substantial, could have been greater with quicker action on procurement,
financial management (including comingling of funds), and better coordination between
financial institutions and other private sector entities. Problems in the cash flow system
for reimbursement of agro-dealers persisted and were the cause of audit queries. While
there continues to be commitment, and plans have been developed to improve these
processes, implementation remains a challenge.

         (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

67.      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68.    The Borrower showed strong commitment during preparation, despite the
shortcomings mentioned. However, the fiduciary risks occasioned by poor recordkeeping
and the non-operationalization of a segregated project account could have been avoided
through better oversight and management. On balance, therefore, the Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating is justified.




                                             19
   6. Lessons Learned
69.     In-country systems – input distribution, agricultural credit, diversification support
-- must adequately support emergency operations. Although the Bank has expedited
procedures that allow for quick preparation and disbursements for emergency projects,
the EAPP was constrained by delays in disbursements, procurement, and other
procedures and processes in the country. A case in point is the delays witnessed in the
ACGS due to in-country procurement and disbursement procedures. It will be therefore
be prudent in the future to review and agree during project design on the in-country
procedures that can support and facilitate the implementation of emergency operations.
The strategy to scale up the ongoing GoK program did help, to a certain extent, in
addressing the human and institutional capacity gaps which could have otherwise been a
major constraint to the implementation of an emergency project. However, in the future,
more attention should be focused on appraising and supporting capacity building as an
important success factor.

70.      The fiduciary management capacity of the implementing agency at the national
and lower levels needs to be enhanced. Although the technical support to the project
activities was adequate, the fiduciary management at the national and district levels was
inadequate. The management of financial records including vouchers and of operational
expenses was cumbersome and led to some ineligible expenses. Given the magnitude of
the records to be kept, there is need to adequately provide for capacity building of
national and district level staff and to encourage computerization and simplification of
most of the records.

71.    Inclusion of some critical post-harvest interventions could improve project
outcomes. Although the three main components and activities supported under the EAPP
were considered adequate, a significant proportion of the maize harvested from farms
supported under the project was lost in 2010 due to an aflatoxin infestation in the Eastern
Province. This clearly indicates that whenever production-enhancing technologies are
promoted, it is advisable to also support other off-farm activities such as storage and
marketing.

72.     Cross-sectoral and international experience, especially in the input voucher
scheme, should be incorporated. Social protection programs in Kenya (orphans’ support
and cash transfers, for example) have several years of experience using electronic means
of transfer. The MoA should emulate existing transfer mechanisms proven successful in
Kenya. Additionally, there could be better incorporation of lessons learned from other
countries. For example, under the input voucher program, there is a need to consider
support for more than one season in line with common practice in other countries.
Location-specific input packages and voucher pricing, among other issues, should also be
considered.

73.    Existing programs provide useful platforms on which to build and gradually scale
up service activities such as the ones pursued under this project. However, doing so takes
time and requires more time than the 22 months provided under the EAPP.

                                             20
74.     Overall, the EAPP was justified given the context of Kenya’s import dependence
and rising food and fuel prices. The selected activities were appropriately chosen to
achieve quick results and to reach vulnerable populations. However, the EAPP’s overall
rating of moderately unsatisfactory reflects the serious challenges encountered in
implementation, and the lackluster evidence regarding the project’s outcomes
(themselves hindered by the limited data available for economic analysis). In hindsight, a
better assessment of the GoK’s capacity to implement the activities would have been
helpful and a stronger pre-negotiated agreement on the treatment of special accounts
could have mitigated some of the implementation issues encountered. It seems clear now
that the OCP component was not amenable to an emergency approach, but this was not
apparent at the time the project was prepared, particularly given the circumstances under
which it was developed. Presumably, these lessons learned can help inform future
emergency projects.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project met most of its outcome indicators, namely:
  (i) Overall, a total of 542,771 farmers directly benefited from the project (excluding
       ACGS beneficiaries). Some 290,000 farmers benefited from training and
       capacity-building activities while another 260,000 beneficiaries were able to
       access publicity and other materials from the project.14 However, the number of
       direct beneficiaries did not reach the original target of 1,150,000 mainly due to
       constraints encountered in multiplication of the orphan crops planting materials;
 (ii) An additional 244,363 farmers received improved seeds and fertilizers through
       input vouchers, exceeding the target of 150,000 farmers;
(iii) 77,580 hectares were cultivated with hybrid maize, surpassing the target of 61,101
       hectares;
(iv) The area cultivated for orphan crops increased by 62,008 hectares; and
 (v)   An additional 295,415 farmers adopted at least one technology for food
       production, such as a hybrid maize production system, improved orphan seeds
       varieties, improved production systems, or use of organic fertilizers.


The project achieved an incremental staple production of 281,677.5 tons in targeted areas,
far exceeding the target of 85,050 tons. Maize yields in targeted areas reached an average
of 14 bags per acre. Due to insufficient rainfall, this was lower than the target of 15 bags
per acre but far exceeded the baseline of 6 bags per acre. Participating farmers were able
to produce sufficient grain for household use and generated income from the surplus
grain to buy inputs. In addition, orphan crops increased nutritional outcomes, as some
beneficiaries retained grain legumes produced from drought-tolerant seeds for home
consumption, thereby enriching their diets.

The following activities were carried out for each of the components:

Component 1 - Scaling up the existing Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (Kilimo
Biashara). Agreements for the enhanced scheme under EAPP were signed in June 2011
and guarantee funds of KSh 500 million were disbursed to the four participating banks:
(i) KSh 300 million to Equity Bank; (ii) KSh 70 million to Cooperative Bank of Kenya;
(iii) KSh 69 Million to Family Bank; and (iv) KSh 61 million to Kenya Women Finance
Trust. However, lending under the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) has
been delayed due to the base lending rate rising to 18 percent from about 8 percent when
the loan’s interest rate of 12 percent was negotiated and included in the scheme
agreements. It took almost four months of negotiations for the banks to secure MoA
approval to adjust the lending rates from 12 percent to 15 percent. An Inter-Ministerial
Coordinating Committee (ICC) was formed to oversee the running of the ACGS and to
address the issue of interest rates and utilization of guarantee funds in the post-project


14
     A significant number of trainees are also direct project beneficiaries.


                                                         24
period. In spite of this delay, ancillary activities related to this component are ongoing.
For example, a total of 261 MoA staff were sensitized in six workshops about the scheme
in preparation for rollout. The Equity Bank Foundation trained an additional 258 field
implementers in six workshops on financial literacy. They will, in turn, train farmer
groups.

Many of the farmer groups introduced by the MoA to the banks as being ready for loans
turned out not to be ready, for two reasons. First, those farmers assumed that Kilimo
Biashara loans were regular GoK loans where no collateral was required. They were
therefore shocked when the banks gave them the terms and conditions of the loans.
Second, the groups were not linked to organized market outlets that the banks could use
to recover the loans. Subsequently, many small-scale farmers opted not to acquire the
loans because they could not comply with these conditions. The hands of the banks were
also tied because they had to comply with Central Bank of Kenya requirements to ensure
that all their lending was properly secured. However, the banks have recruited more
clients and enhanced their relationship with farmers. Equity Bank attributes the
development of its agricultural portfolio to Kilimo Biashara, especially in the new areas,
as it enabled the bank to identify new clients.

Component 2 - Scaling up the existing input voucher scheme (Kilimo Plus). The scale-up
of the existing input voucher scheme exceeded program targets. A total of 19,395 MT of
fertilizers and 1,936.5 MT of maize seeds were procured and distributed to farmers in 94
districts. This exceeded the incremental target of 15,000 MT of fertilizers and 1,500 MT
of seeds. The extra input vouchers were a result of changes in the exchange rate between
the Euro and Kenyan shillings, reallocation of unspent funds from other components of
the project, and a decline in input prices. In addition, a total of 2,685 agro-dealers
(exceeding the target of 2,000) and 305 staff were trained and accredited during this
period. The training of agro-dealers has helped to decrease the distance farmers travelled
to acquire inputs, from 15-35 km to 3-9 km.

Component 3 - Scaling up of the Orphan Crops Program. The OCP had an initial target
of 1,500,000 beneficiaries. One-third (500,000 beneficiaries) were to be reached directly
through the distribution of seeds and planting materials, with the rest of the households
benefitting later from the seed multiplied by the original 500,000 households. This target
was revised downwards to 250,000 beneficiaries due to unavailability of planting
material and the inability to complete another round of multiplication. The OCP
ultimately exceeded this revised target by reaching 298,407 beneficiaries, of which 59
percent were women farmers. The involvement of the private sector in the OCP is still
rudimentary. The OCP also faced the challenge of inadequate storage space for retrieved
materials. This was overcome by having seeds retained at group stores at the community
level or having members of the community select a trusted group member to temporarily
store the seeds for other members. Retrieved seed is also stored at DAOs’ stores, as in the
case of Mwala district. Poor weather in 2010 also hindered production. A total of 860 MT
of assorted orphan seeds, 2,624,000 cassava cuttings, and 2,447,000 sweet potato vines
were distributed in 101 districts. An estimated 163,658 MT of food were produced from



                                            25
the planting materials issued and a total of 206 MT of assorted seeds, 320,202 cassava
cuttings, and 170,960 sweet potato vines were retrieved for redistribution.15

Component 4 - Support for project administration. The project supported the
coordination and operating costs associated with the operation, covering: (i) printing of
input vouchers; (ii) purchase of three vehicles for supervision of the projects; (iii) training
costs for farmers and extension staff; (iv) transport, subsistence, office, and seed
distribution costs; (v) M&E and impact assessment costs; (vi) visibility and
communication costs; and (vii) audit costs.

     Crops included green grams, cowpeas, sorghum, beans, sweet potatoes, and millet.

         Appendix to Annex 2: Experiences of Equity Bank in Kilimo Biashara

Equity Bank received KSh 300 million as credit guarantee under the Kilimo Biashara
scheme and by November 30, 2012 had loaned out KSh 637,906,505 to 7,396 borrowers,
making it the largest commercial lender in the Kenyan agricultural sector. Of those
borrowers, 7,295 were smallholder farmers while 101were agro-dealers.

The majority of the small-scale farmers clients were drawn from the Rift Valley; they
comprised 71 percent of the clients but borrowed 85 percent of the funds. These
borrowers were concentrated in Eldoret, Kitale, Nakuru, and Ol Kalou towns. On the
other hand, most of the agro-dealers clients were from the Central and Rift Valley
provinces, comprising 45 percent of the clients in this category but only accounting for
43 percent of the agro-dealer portfolio.

Also by November 30, 2012, the borrowers had already repaid some KSh 90,897,364,
with the remainder (KSh 547,009,141) being loan balances. The default rate has been low
and according to Equity estimates, only about 3 percent of the loanees have delayed
repayments. Weather and market-related risks are an integral part of agriculture
production systems. To hedge against risks, Equity Bank is also working with Syngenta
Foundation to support crop insurance under Kilimo Salama Programme.

Equity Bank attributes its success to a number of factors, namely:
 (i) It built the capacity and structures to support agricultural lending. For instance, at
       the time of the evaluation, the Bank had 290 members of staff specialized in
       agriculture manning the agricultural credit department, spread over 123 branches
       across the country.
(ii) The Bank invested in building the capacity of MoA frontline extension staff by
       training them in financial literacy from the outset. It reinforced the messages
       through field visits organized jointly with the MoA. This reduced information
       distortion to clients regarding the ACGS, which was identified as the greatest
       constraint by the other participating financial institutions.

                                                  27
(iii)   The Bank’s management was very supportive of Kilimo Biashara, underwriting
        the high cost of training Bank and MoA extension staff. In summary, Equity Bank
        invested heavily to make Kilimo Biashara grow, identified new opportunities for
        agricultural credit, and explored innovative ways to engage other stakeholders
        across different production systems and value chains.


In addition to these key factors, Equity Bank attributes this success largely to its ability to
leverage the loan guarantee scheme on new and emerging programs in the agricultural
sector by building partnerships with other players in the sector. Its key partners were:
Kenya Seed Company, which traditionally financed small-scale farmers to undertake
seed multiplication through bank overdrafts; the National Irrigation Board, which
financed infrastructure development in irrigation schemes from exchequer but maintained
the systems through user fees; and the Mount Kenya Smallholder Horticulture Project
and Mitunguu Irrigation Project, financed by IFAD and KfW, respectively. In addition,
Equity Bank established partnerships with organizations financing innovative products in
the Kenyan agricultural sector. These include warehouse receipt systems (WHR)
established in partnership with: (i) Lesiolo Grain Handlers Ltd, which provides post-
harvest management of grain for wheat, maize, barley, and sorghum; (ii) Mama Millers in
Moi’s Bridge, which handles maize and wheat; (iii) Garnets Enterprises in Kasikeu,
which handles pulses and legumes; and (iv) Kasikeu Multipurpose Co-operative in
Mbitini, which handles pulses and legumes.

Equity Bank is working in partnership with the World Food Programme (WFP) to
finance production and aggregation of staple food under the Purchase for Progress (P4P)
initiative with farmers in Eldoret participating in the Academic Model Providing Access
to Healthcare (AMPATH) program. As the world’s largest humanitarian agency, WFP is
a major buyer of staple food. The P4P uses WFP’s purchasing power and its expertise in
logistics and food quality to offer smallholder farmers opportunities to access agricultural
markets, to become competitive players in those markets, and thus to improve their lives.
The five-year pilot initiative links WFP’s demand for staple food with the expertise of a
host of partners who support farmers to produce food surpluses and sell them at a fair
price.

Equity Bank also entered into a partnership with East African Breweries Ltd to finance
commercial production of sorghum through the ACGS, which in turn created new cash
crops suitable for areas that had no other alternatives.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Emergency Project Paper prepared in March 2010 estimated that the incremental
benefit from the input voucher scheme alone would be valued at €27 million. This is the
result of an assumption of an incremental production of 9 bags per acre valued at KSh
2,200 per bag, resulting in 121,500 MT of maize. The value of production expected from
producing other staple crops was estimated at €13.8 million.

Data limitations precluded a detailed economic analysis of the project’s outcomes. Based
on the methodology used in the appraisal document, simple returns on investment (ROI)
were calculated for each of the three components. Even this was complicated by the fact
that there was a wide variety of traditional high-value crops (i.e., the orphan crops),
spread across different agro-ecological systems. It was assumed that the yields achieved
from on-farm production were 50 percent of that obtained in the research stations.
Another simplifying assumption was that the average price for each of the crops applied
countrywide. Given the short duration of the project, no discounting was applied.

In terms of production, the ICR end-of-project outcomes exceeded the appraisal estimates.
Incremental production of maize from the input voucher scheme is 281,677 MT; at KSh
25,000 per ton, this would be valued at €60.4 million (using an exchange rate of KSh 116
to €1). The incremental value of production resulting from the OCP component is
estimated at 9.5 million.

Thus, the total investment was €19.13 million, while the simple returns from the three
components were estimated to be €75.53 million at current prices, yielding an overall
return on investment (ROI) of 295 percent. A benefit/cost ratio of about 3 is obtained.
However, it should be kept in mind that the costs are project costs only, and do not
include the opportunity costs of items not covered by the project (e.g., labor). Thus, the
ROIs calculated (by component and for the total project) are likely to be significantly
overestimated.

The ROI for orphan crops was 226 percent. However, it does not capture the investment
by project beneficiaries in terms of land preparation, weeding, harvesting, and labor. The
ROI for Kilimo Biashara is estimated to be 10.5 percent, while the ROI for Kilimo Plus is
estimated to be 537 percent. The ROI for Kilimo Plus was high due to the high benefits
generated from the good yield response that was realized. A significant number of the
beneficiaries were able to realize yields over three times their baseline. The price of
maize also remained high during the period. As in the case of the OCP, this figure should
be treated with caution, as the ROI for Kilimo Plus did not take into account all of the
incremental costs incurred by the beneficiaries.

Annex 5. Impact Assessment and Beneficiary Survey Results

As part of the NAAIAP/EAPP evaluation, LOG Associates carried out an impact
assessment and beneficiary survey of 625 respondents from a stratified random sample of
nine districts. The evaluation was mainly focused on the voucher scheme. A complete
record can be found in their report (NAAIAP Program Evaluation, December 2011, LOG
Associates). A summary of their findings follows.

Voucher Scheme Recipients
   x 96% of those interviewed considered the beneficiary selection process good or
      fair
   x 91.3% reported they had received training from the program
           o 23% on mobilization of their own resources
           o 31% on farming as a business
           o 25% on storage and post-harvest handling
           o 20% on safe use and handling of agri-inputs
   x 85% reported on being supervised by MoA staff
   x 95% rated the voucher redemption process efficient
   x 69% are now using both certified seed and fertilizer
   x 96% reported increased productivity
   x 58% reported greatly improved food security, 39% reported slightly improved
      food security

Agro-dealers
   x 70% received training
   x 91% would like financial institutions to redeem their vouchers
   x 42% indicated high transaction costs and transport costs their biggest constraint

Kilimo Biashara
    x In 2007/08, 73% of voucher beneficiaries graduated to Kilimo Biashara; in
      2008/09, 24% graduated; in 2009/10, 23%; and in 2010/11, 34%
    x 74% had taken credit to purchase farm inputs

Summary of Impact Assessment

Kilimo Plus

1. Supply and distribution of inputs: Whilst the Program has made considerable efforts to
provide the inputs to the farmers on time, there were delays experienced in their delivery
which led to late planting, impacting negatively on production. The inputs were received
late due to lack of inputs during the onset of the season, lack of adequate capacity of local
agro-dealers, and the lack of reliable transport infrastructure. More timely program
planning and distribution of inputs will ensure that the inputs get to the farmers early
enough in the future.



                                             33
2. Risks: The agro-dealer is expected to bear the biggest risk since he/she is expected to
source the required inputs using his/her own resources. A Risk Management strategy
particularly for agro-dealers should be developed. This can be achieved by instituting a
provision for voucher reimbursement at banks.

3. Voucher processing: The processing of vouchers was tedious and time consuming, thus
there is a need to develop an e-voucher system to enhance effectiveness. The majority (91
percent) of the agro-dealers would also prefer to redeem their vouchers at financial
institutions, as this would ensure that they have regular working capital. In the current
system, they have to wait a long time to receive their payment.

4. Logistical challenges: Agro-dealers raised transportation as a major issue due to the
poor state of the road infrastructure. This led to increased distribution costs to the agro-
dealers and some reportedly did not give farmers inputs in time. It is recommended that
central places convenient to both agro-dealers and farmers be identified where inputs can
be delivered and collected.

Kilimo Biashara
There has been a gradual increase in the adoption of Kilimo Biashara, particularly of
small-scale loans, from KSh 715.8 million in 2009 to KSh 1,046.4 million in 2010. To
date, KSh 412.9 million has already been given to farmers. However, there has been a
slow transition from Kilimo Plus to Kilimo Biashara, with most of the initial beneficiaries
failing to engage in Kilimo Biashara. In FY 2007/08, only 73.6 percent of the
beneficiaries graduated to Kilimo Biashara; in FY 2008/09, 23.8 percent; in FY 2009/10,
23.1 percent; and in FY 2010/11, 34 percent.

1. Formal banking procedures and physical access difficulties: Some farmers did not
comprehend the banking procedures and the need for formal documentation mainly due
to low literacy levels. There is therefore a need to demystify the loan acquisition process.
Equity Bank is already training farmers to increase awareness and to demystify loan
issues among borrowers.

2. Crop insurance: Agricultural insurance is regarded by small-scale farmers as an
instrument that can only be undertaken by large-scale farmers. In addition to Kilimo
Biashara, there is need for the Program to explore the crop insurance options already
being marketed by various insurance companies. As explained in Annex III, various
options are already being implemented on trial basis.

3. Cereal banking: The idea of cereal banking has not fully been accepted among the
farmers due to various reasons, including: group dynamic challenges; lack of marketing
channels; lack of proper storage facilities; and unsustainability of cereal banks.
Establishment of physical cereal banks is a challenge due to logistical/operational issues
such as storage, management, insecurity, individualistic tendencies amongst group
members, and difficulties in balancing farmers’ household and commercial needs. This
can be solved by increased sensitization on cereal banking and development of a model
cereal bank.

                                             34
4. Perception of the warehouse receipt system (WHR): The concept is still new amongst
small-scale farmers, who perceive the WHR as a system practical for large-scale farmers.
Capacity building was well done and will go a long way in sustaining the Program
activities. However, more capacity building is needed to enhance the Program foundation.

Orphan Crops Program

1. Perceptions: The term “orphan crops? was found to sound stigmatizing in some forums,
thus affecting acceptability of these crops in certain instances. This may have contributed
to the low uptake by farmers. To mitigate this, the MoA proposed a change of name for
the program to “traditional high-value crops.? It may also be useful to consider terms
such as “drought-tolerant high-value crops.?

2. Acceptability of inputs: Some of the traditional high-value crops distributed to
beneficiary farmers were not well received (for example, sorghum). In distributing
orphan crops, the program should match the seeds with district crop performance and
local requirements.

3. Industry demand: There already exists huge industrial demand for sorghum for the
production of alcohol products. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the MoA to
enhance the production of sorghum to meet the industrial demand. The increase in
production can only be achieved by targeting both large-scale and small-scale sorghum
farmers. Such projects can be replicated when industry and market demand is developed.
The findings of the evaluation show that implementation of NAAIAP has had a positive
impact on the lives of the farmers and agro-dealers. These impacts arose from: increased
household food security through provision of inputs to farmers who would not have used
such inputs under normal circumstances; and increased capacity of agro-dealers to supply
and distribute farm inputs to farmers. This is in line with the Program goal of improving
farm input access and affordability of smallholder farmers to enhance food
security/availability at the household level and to generate incomes from the sale of
surplus produce.

General comment
The names “Orphan Crops Program? (OCP) and “orphan crops? have since changed to
“Traditional High-Value Crops Program? (THVC) and “high-value traditional crops.?
These changes need to be reflected in the EAPP ICR.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.2 Implementation
Agricultural Credit Program (Kilimo Biashara)
The Project Document (March 8, 2010) refers to the upscaled Agricultural Credit
Program as Kilimo Biashara. However, the original Kilimo Biashara partnership between
AGRA, IFAD (through SHOMAP)/GoK, and Equity Bank operates on a separate
agreement from the Agricultural Credit Program. Therefore, the name Agricultural Credit
Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) for the EU/WB-funded credit guarantee scheme is used to
distinguish between the two guarantee schemes.

6. Lessons Learned
a. Incorporate cross-sectoral learning in the voucher scheme

Pg 14; the social protection programs, orphans’ support, and cash transfers using
electronic means of transfer referred to the use of smart card technology. While we agree
that electronic means of transfer is useful in terms of fast-tracking payments, we also
appreciate that the use of smart cards for “one-touch? inputs grant support is not cost-
effective for beneficiaries who may have to bear the cost of the smart card.

OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS

In addition to the achievements detailed in Annex 2, the following have been achieved:

1. NAAIAP

a. The concept of cereal banking has picked up, with 172 cereal banks formed to help
farmers manage their harvest and reinvest in farming. Productivity at farm level among
beneficiaries has increased from 3-5 bags to 22 bags (90 kg) per acre on average. There
are farmers who have obtained 47, 42, and 41 bags (90 kg) per acre in Transmara West,
Lugari, and Mt. Elgon, respectively.

b. The increased income at household level has enabled some families to invest in other
income generating investments such as motorcycle taxi business (bodaboda).

c. Some beneficiaries have acquired assets such as improved housing, land, cattle, and
goats.




                                           37
d. The increased income has enabled farmers to start diversification into cattle and goat
rearing, horticultural farming, mushroom growing, and value addition of maize through
milling and branding.

e. The program has had a positive effect on education. Children retention in schools at
one time increased from 78 percent to 98 percent in Eastern province due to increased
availability of food at the household level.

f. There has also been a substantial reduction in secondary school fee debts due to the
improved financial capability of beneficiaries.

g. Some beneficiaries are adopting the technologies after a one-off support, with
additional follower farmers procuring farm inputs without support through NAAIAP's
demonstration effect.

h. Agro-dealers have reported increased sales of inputs across the country due to
increased demand for fertilizer and certified seed. For example, an increase in sales from
500 bags to 11,000 bags has been reported in Gucha district.

i. The new demand for inputs has created supply shortages in some areas.

j. The training of 2,688 agro-dealers has helped decrease the distance that farmers travel
to acquire inputs, from 15-35 km to 9-15 km.

Orphan Crops Program

a. Food security - During the year that the project was implemented, a total of 163,658
MT of food was produced from the planting materials issued.

b. Farm incomes - Apart from meeting household needs, surpluses of the food produced
were sold to generate incomes. Other farmers have gone into commercial production of
THVCs.

c. Improved access to farm inputs- The project provided seeds and other planting
materials to 298,407 farmers from both directly purchased and retrieved materials. Other
farmers have also been able to purchase inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides from the
proceeds accruing from the sale of THVCs.

d. Livelihood improvement - Some farmers have used the proceeds from the sale of
THVCs to buy assets (bicycles, cattle, and goats), open non-farm businesses, pay school
fees, access healthcare, improve housing, and buy solar panels to supply power to their
homes.

IMPACT OF PROJECT ON BENEFICIARIES

1. Impact on farmers

a. The capacity building has helped beneficiaries understand the reasons for/benefits of
crop rotation, such as pest and disease control and improving soil fertility (as different
crops have different root systems and feed from different zones in the soil). Through
training on proper maize husbandry, farmers in some regions have adopted the practice of
weeding twice in maize fields, unlike before, when weeding was done once to allow
growth of grass for livestock feed after the crop was harvested.

b. Improved nutrition, as some beneficiaries are retaining some of the grain legumes
produced from the drought-tolerant seeds for home consumption, thereby enriching their
diets. The legumes include beans, pigeon peas, green grams, and cowpeas. The cowpea
and cassava leaves are also used as vegetables.

c. Improved livelihoods, as some beneficiaries have: improved their housing and their
source of lighting for homes; purchased assets such as cattle, goats, sheep, and land;
diversified to other sources of income (such as money transfer services on a mobile
telephone platform (M-Pesa) and motorcycle taxi businesses (bodaboda)), and also
ventured into other agricultural enterprises (such as horticultural farming, dairy
production (cattle and goats) and poultry keeping). In the long run, this also serves to
enrich household diets, as some of the produce from these enterprises is retained for
consumption at the household level.

2. Impact on agro-dealers

a. Improved business management skills from the training provided.

b. Increased business volumes, as some of the beneficiaries return to purchase inputs on
their own.

c. Networking - After the training, some of the agro-dealers formed associations at the
district level to help them address the challenges they face. The aim is to link these
district based associations to the national body, the Kenya National Agro-dealers
Development Association (KENADA).

3. Impact on institutional capacity

a. The training done by NGOs for the implementers has built capacity within the Ministry
of Agriculture to carry out similar trainings on its own in the future. The areas covered
include commercialization of sorghum, agro-dealer business management skills, and
financial literacy. This pool of trainers can be called upon to carry out further capacity
building for farmers and agro-dealers.

SPINOFFS FROM THE PROJECT

1. Establishment of cereal banks - This is a concept introduced in NAAIAP, aiming to
encourage beneficiaries of the grant inputs to collect the surplus grain in common stores
where it can be preserved and await appreciation of the market price. The concept also
seeks to promote food security at the community level. This is informed by past
experiences, where farmers disposed of most of the grain at harvest time at very low
prices, thereby realizing very low returns. Communities are then forced to buy the grains
at a higher price when household stocks run out. The cereal banks provide a source of the
grain close to communities in times of need. They also serve to increase the value of the
grain retained by the producers from the sale of surpluses. A total of 82 cereal banks were
established, with over 7,000 bags of maize collected in the banks when the weather was
favorable. Continuity has been a challenge, however. Most of these cereal banks do not
operate throughout the year as was envisioned in the concept.

2. Adaptation to climate change- the grain legumes developed by KARl for the dry lands
have penetrated to other areas of the country as well due to the erratic nature of rainfall in
the recent past. This has stretched the capacity of the KARl Seed Unit to satisfy the
increased demand. The drought-tolerant seed varieties coupled with conservation
agriculture have seen an increase in the yields of the grain legumes.

3. A wider outreach - Due to the small land sizes in some of the implementing districts,
the Kilimo Plus inputs grants have been split two or more times, thereby serving more
households. The project disbursed 229,240 grants and was able to reach 244,369
households.

COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

1. Market outlets for the produce under both NAAIAP and OCP have been accessed with
the help of partners. The preferred market is the World Food Programme (WFP), which
has purchased some of its requirements from the beneficiaries. Other market outlets are
the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) and East African Breweries Limited
(EABL) for Gadam sorghum. This was the case for maize in Transmara and Nandi North
districts. The linkages were established with the help of various organizations, among
them Equity Bank, Cereal Growers Association (CGA), East African Grain Council
(EAGC), and Farm Concern International (FCI). These organizations also carry out
capacity building for the beneficiaries on post-harvest management of the grains and
quality control. Some also provided storage facilities.

2. AGMARK, AAK, and IFDC facilitated the agro-dealers training. However, these
partners did not carry out the supervision of the agro-dealers training as was expected.
This task was taken up by the NAAIAP Secretariat.

3. The NGOs that were to train sorghum farmers (Africa Harvest and Smart Logistics)
were found to lack the capacity to do so. Instead, FCI trained MoA staff as trainers, who
then carried out training for the target groups.

                                             40
4. Financial Service Providers (FSPs) and the MoA collaborated in training staff and
farmers on financial matters.

LESSONS LEARNED

1. Kilimo Plus grants can help alleviate food shortages as they trigger yield increases.
However, sustaining the yield increases is still a challenge.
2. Proper targeting leads to easier implementation of other components of the program.
3. A transparent process makes it easy to attract other collaborators to the program; e.g.
Constituency Development Fund (CDF) support.
4. Collaboration with other stakeholders is enhancing linkages with other players for
other services (post-harvest management, storage and marketing); e.g. Cereal Growers
Association (CGA) and World Food Programme (WFP) in Transmara; East African
Grain Council (EAGC) in Nandi North; and Farm Concern International (FCI) and
USAID in Imenti South.
5. There is improved linkage between farmers and financial service providers.
6. NAAIAP can be upscaled through other initiatives. For instance, Rarieda district used
the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP) funds to support an additional 200 farmers using
the NAAIAP model.
7. Use of local agro-dealers with capacity to supply improves timeliness and reduces the
distribution hiccups.
8. Where sensitization and training of staff was cascaded to divisions and locations,
implementation was very effective.
9. Where payments for stockists are timely, supplies for subsequent seasons have been
timely.
10.Conservation agriculture reduces the operation costs and drudgery of manual digging
and weeding for beneficiaries.
11.Incorporation of water harvesting technologies improved yields by up to 30 percent in
pulses production.
12. Farmers can improve their food security through good agronomy and capacity
building.
13.Increased incomes can be realized through integrated pest management as a cost
reduction measure.
14. Use of a group approach is effective in implementing a seed bulking program.
15.Growing Gadam sorghum in clusters can reduce bird damage.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
                 Comments provided by EU Delegation, Kenya

The EAPP project fully integrated into the Government of Kenya NAAIAP programme
and globally results were satisfactory. The input component was instrumental to match
shortages of seeds and fertilizers during short and long rainy season preparations. In
additions timely response was adequate in particular during the 2009 and 2011 drought
spell. EAPP increased emphasis on drought resistant crops seeds production and
multiplication contributed to support current efforts of Government of Kenya towards
staple food diversification and climate change adaptation. Some delays in disbursing the
guarantee funds to financial institutions were registered and this had some impact on this
component.

The EU Delegation to Kenya agrees on the important leadership role that has been
provided by the World Bank in the development of the agricultural sector in Kenya. The
EU Delegation believes that this momentum is a very good opportunity to strengthen the
partnership between the Government and the development partners and to improve the
coordination between the development partners. In the light of this, the EU Delegation
will be open to a renewed partnership with the WB on agricultural activities in Kenya.
This renewed cooperation will of course have to take into account the final conclusions of
the audit report currently undertaken by the World Bank.
