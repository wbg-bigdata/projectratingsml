PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KOREA
SECTOR PROGRAM ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (LOAN 1800-KO)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the Sector Progzam on Higher
Technical Education in Korea, for which a loan of US$100 million was
approved on February 19, 1980.    After  an  extension of one year the loan
account was closed on February 10, 1986, with an undisbursed balance of
about US$150,000 being cancelled on that date.
The  audit  report  consists   of   a  Project  Performance  Audit
Memorandum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
and a Project Completion Report (PCR) dated June 27, 1986. The PCR was
prepared by the implementing agency, the Education Facilities Bureau (EFB)
in the Ministry of Education and, following some editorial modifications,
was  issued  together  with  a   commentary   (added  as  Part  II:    Bank
Observations) by the Region. Formulation of Part II followed a mission to
Korea by staff of the responsible projects division (the former East Asia
and Pacific Region Education Project Division).
The PPAM is based on a review of materials in Bank files,
including the Staff Appraisal Report No. 2723a-KO of January 11, 1980, the
Loan Agreement dated February 21, 1980 and records of the Board discussions
of the project.  This in4'.emation was supplemented by data collected during
a mission to Korea by an OED staff which included discussions with project
implementation staff and field visits to project institutions. Bank staff
associated with the project were likewise consulted.
The audit memorandum agrees with the main conclusions of the PCR.
However, because of the novel character of the lending operation (Loan
1800-KO being the first sector loan in education), the PPAM is somewhat
more detailed than would have been the case with a customary investment
project; it tries in particular to discuss features peculiar to this new
type of lending instrument.
As is customary in the preparation of audit reports, copies of the
draft audit report were sent to the representatives of the Borrower for
comment in February 1988. No comments were received.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KOREA
SECTOR PROGRAM ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (LOAN 1800-K )
EVALUATIOI1 SUMMARY
Introduction
This loan of  US$100  million was  the  first sector operation in
education. It was approved in February 1980 and became effective in April
of that year.  The original  closing  date  (June 30, 1984) was extended by
one year. The loan account was closed in February 1986 and a balance of
about US$150,000 cancelled.
Total project cost was estimated at US$700 million, with the
Government meeting US$370 million and the beneficiary private project
institutions US$230 million. Because of a devaluation of the Won, actual
project cost amounted to US$627 million equivalent, with a reduced
Government's share of US$243 million and an increased contribution from the
private sector of US$284 million.
Prolect obiectives and Content
The sector loar. aimed at improving Korea's higher technical
education (HTE) system .o enable it to cope with the increasingly
sophisticated manpower demands of the country's industries. To this end,
some 50 subprojects aiming at equipment upgrading in selected Junior
Technical Colleges and university Colleges of Engineering and Schools of
Management and ten national programs  dealing mostly with staff development
were envisaged.   This  improvement  program  was  to  be complemented by a
number of supporting measures such as the establishmer.t and operation of
accreditation systems for HTE institutions.
Implementation ArranRemen s
The  allocation  of  funds   and   the  selection  of  beneficiary
institutions were made according to guidelines and criteria agreed upon
between the  Borrower  and  the  Bank.    The  applicationis  for individual
subprojects were prepared by the individual HTE institutions (with the
assistance of  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  staff  as  necessary).   The
applications were evaluated by a Deliberation Committee in MOE and,
selectively, by an interministerial Planning and Management Committee. The
Bank played a key role during the initial stages of project implementation,
reviewing closely the application of the criteria and assessing the
processes and thresholds used. Once this framework was in place, the Bank
limited itself to an ex-ante review of sub-projects exceeding US$2.5
million equivalent, and to an ex-post verification of samples of relevant
documents during supervision missions.

Implementation Experience
The project was carried out without any significant problems.
Slight initial delays (PCR, paras. 3.29-3.31) led to an extension of the
closing date by one year. Loan disbursement was virtually complete.
Results to Date
The Sector Loan has brought about significant improvements in
equipping and staffing standards of the project institutions. However,
part of the beneficial effect has been offset by a strong enrollment growth
in the early years of implementation.   This expansion was facilitated by a
shift in higher education admission policies from an entrant to a graduate
quota  system with  built-in   benchmarks  for  attrition  which  exceeded
previously recorded levels. The enrollment increases also negated efforts
to achieve specific student/staff ratios covenanted in the Loan Agreement.
The date for attaining those targets has now been moved from December 31,
1986 to December 31, 1990.
Sustainabilitv
The sustainability of schools, particularly of technical schools,
hinges on the allocation of adequate funds for operation and maintenance.
The project institutions visited described their recurrent budgets as tight
but sufficient.11 However, this is not necessarily the case for non-project
schools, particularly in the private  sector.    To assure the viability of
privata HTE institutions over the longer run will require an inJection of
additional funds, both for catching-up investments and for the maintenance
and operation of schools.
Findings and Lessons
The most important finding is that the Korea Education Sector
Program, the Bank's first sector operation in support of education, has
demonstrated conclusively that the sector loan was superior to the
conventional  project  approach  in   addressing  basic  policy  issues  to
accelerate growth and development.   To  be sure, there were implementation
problems and shortfalls which, in view of the program's novelty and the
relative inexperience of the Borrower and the Bank in education sector
programs, were to be expected, but the overall experience has been
positive. Some of the lessons have already been incorporated into the
design of Korea's Second Sector Loan, Loan 2427-KO, approved in May 1984.
The following lessons are particularly significant in Korea's experience
and ijay be relevant to other countries.
(a) A stable and responsible sector management agency (SMA),
staffed by experienced personnel who remained long enough
with the SMA to ensure continuity, was the R--y to the success
of the Sector Program. As the Sector Program necessarily in-
volved sub-implementing agencies, effective implementation
1/ In addition, the existence of a Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center, an
exemplary institution, assures t longer working life for educational
equipment.



- viii -
depended upon the SMA's skillful coordination of these agen-
cies which themselves were well-staffed to handle the many
tasks required by the sector loan.   In the present case, the
SMA was the MOE's Education Facilities Bureau (EFB), which
included several specialized divisions staffed initially by
125 officials, and it was complemented by participating
management agencies such as the Higher Education Bureau and
the Economic Planning Board (PPAM, paras. 14-16; 23 and 63;
PCR, paras. 3.01-3.02).
(b) The development and/or strengthening of institutional capabi-
lity appeared to be quicker and more sustainable through the
Sector Program because the Program required the SMA to focus
on addressing specific issues in the education sector, to
clrry out overall planning for that sector, and to appraise
and oversee sub-projects selected on the basis of approved
criteria.   The  EFB,  which  had  acquired extensive project
implementation experience through four IDA/Bank education
projects as well as other projects funded by bilateral and
international agencies, reinforced its experience by institu-
tionalizing the planning and evaluation procedures developed
for the First Sector Program such that, before the completion
of the First Sector Program, the EFB was well-prepared to
serve as the SMA for the Second Sector Program in 1984 (PPAM,
paras. 46-51; PCR, paras. 3.04-3.06).
(c) The use of a policy letter prepared by the Borrower was a
more effective instrument for monitoring the addressal of
policy issues than covenants because the former facilitated
periodic review and adjustment as the program approached its
objectives, whereas a covenant is inflexible. In this case,
the covenant on meeting the target for a student-staff ratio,
as part of the objective of improving educational quality,
was found to be inappropriate because quality improvement (as
indicated by a more favorable proportion of students to
staff) was better monitored by a range of qua'lity indicators
than by a single indicator.   This lesson has been applied in
the Second Sector Program (PPAM, paras. 45 and 56; PCR, Part
II, para. 22).
(d) The Sector Program required more time for preparation, but
the additional time and resources invested in upstream,
especially sector, work on policy analysis, testing of
guidelines and criteria for selecting program beneficiary
institutions, and sub-project appraisal were repaid in terms
of more efficient implementation.   Unit costs, based on Bank
staff-weeks per US$ 1 million loan funds, were quite low
(PPAM, para. 60; PCR, Part II, para. 25).
(e) Accreditation of higher education programs, as part of the
process of quality improvement, required time and a regular
budget to develop and maintain (PPAM, paras. 47-48; PCR, Part
II, paras. 10-11).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
KOREA
SECTOR PROGRAM ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (LOAN 1800-KO)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Proiect Formulation
1.       The Korea Sector  Program  on Higher  Technical Education was the
first sector operation by the Bank in support of education and training.
The loan (L1800-KO) of US$100 million assisted three specific subsectors in
higher technical education (HTE).1/ Project identification and preparation
had  benefitted  from  a previous  subsector  survey  (Korea:    Education
Subsector Memorandum on Higher Technical Training, June 26, 1978, Report
No. 1927-KO), which had identified the main shortcomings and requirements
of Korea's higher technical education system. Its tenor was that the ongo-
ing changes in Korea's manufacturing industries towards greater technologi-
cal complexity demanded engineers, managers and technicians who could cope
with increasingly intricate tasks, and that these new demands required in
turn a widening and deepening of the education and training for these
occupations.
2.       The themes of the  subsector  survey were elaborated upon by four
Korean study teams which convened in August 1978 and presented a draft
report for review by and discussions with, a Bank preappraisal mission in
November 1978. Their final reports were incorporated into a loan request
which formed the basis for the Bank's appraisal in April 1979 (Report No.
2723a-KO, Staff Appraisal  Report:    Korea  - Sector  Program  on Higher
Technical Education, January 11, 1980).
3.       The findings of the study  teams  and of the appraisal mission can
be summed up as follows: in terms of coverage and efficiency, Korea's HTE
education system was thought to perform satisfactorily. However, there
were indications of an incipient oversupply of engineering and JTC gradu-
ates (though not of management graduates); this development had occurred
partly iA response to previous shortages and resulting high salary differ-
entials (reaching 8:l for engineering graduates vis-a-vis primary school
leavers in 1978).
1/  The term "higher technical education  (HTE)n is  used for the sake of
brevity; it encompasses the areas of university-le.rel engineering and
management education and of higher technician training in Junior
Technical Colleges (JTCs).



4.       This expansion of HTE had,  however, accentuated a number of basic
weaknesses of the system. The first was lack of flexibility: the system
of enrollment controls which was in effect at appraisal was deemed to
respond too sluggishly to labor market developments, thus protracting
specific shortages or oversupplies of graduates.
5.       More important, however, were  shortfalls  in quality.  These were
apparent in several areas: first, the organization and content of teaching
programs; HTE was characterized by early and rigidly maintained speciali-
zation, emphasis on  theory  and  lagging  graduate  programs.   Early, and
definite, orientation of students towards a specific field was accompanied
by a lack of program uniformity between schools. JTC studies were often a
scaled-down version of the four-year engineering college programs, without
regard to the diffbrent training needs of industrial technicians.
6.       Practical elements, such as laboratory work in engineering or case
studies in management courses, were not sufficiently emphasized: the
former accounted for only about 102 of the entire undergraduate program,
and the latter were virtually  absent.    Teaching was thus focussed on the
theoretical elements and did not reflect the realities of industry.
7.       This trend was reinforced by  critical shortages in teaching staff
and equipment which in turn had been accentuated by rapid enrollment
increases in the recent past.    Student/staff ratios in engineering (44:1)
were almost twice as high as the average for higher education (24:1); in
management courses,  the  difference  was  even  greater.   Moreover, these
averages concealed wide variations, with the less prestigious and less
wealthy schools having still higher student/staff ratios (in 1979 one half
of management students were in classes of 130 or larger). To arrive at
acceptable staffing levels (say, 21:1 in engineering and 40:1 in manage-
ment) would have required a quintupling of the respective teaching staffs
(to 2,500 and 1,000, respectively), between 1979 and 1982.
8.       Not only was teaching staff lacking in numbers, but also in quali-
fications. Over half of JTC staff had been recruited directly from under-
graduate programs and very few HTE teachers had any practical industrial
experience.
9.       Equipment was  similarly  insufficient.    Laboratories  were only
stocked to about one-fifth of the standard MOE requirements of about
US$3,000/student which were characterized by the SAR as "reasonable and
modest."2/
10.      The common explanation  for  all  these  deficiencies  was lack of
funds.   Public  pay  scales  were  not  sufficiently  attractive to induce
2/   SAR (Report No. 2723a-KO) p.12, para. 3.13 and Footnote 1.

engineers, technicians and managers to leave the private sector for a
career in teachine,3/ and private institutions which had to depend mainly
(to 85%) on--Government regulated--student fees to finance their opera-
tions, had to resort to understaffing and underequippirng to finance the
inherently expensive HTE programs.    Underfinancing wes  seen as the main
obstacle to the necessary development of HTE in support of ongoing and
future industrial transformation.    Investment  needs  in HTE institutions
were estimated at US$830 million for the period 1979-83, with about 60%, or
US$500 million, being required by private institutions.
Strategy for Developing HTE
11.      It was clear that needs  of  this magnitude could not be addressed
through a one-time investment effort, but only through a long-term improve-
ment program supported by appropriate regulatory actions. The approach
followed was both selective, in that it concentrated on a group of HTE
institutions which offered the best prospects for quality growth, thus
aiming at the development and strengthening of a core of good schools, and
comprehensive, in th&t  it  dealt  not  only with  the two most noticeable
weaknesses--staffing and equipment--but supported the investments by a wide
array of complementary actions.
12.      The vehicle chosen  for  this  improvement  program  was that of a
sector loan.  At the time of appraisal, this was still a rather new lending
instrument, having not yet  been  used  in  the education sector.  However,
Korea was a very suitable  test  case:    the  Ministry of Education had an
experienced and competent implementation group in place (the Educational
Facilities Bureau (EFB)4/ which had been in charge of implementing the
First, Second and about half of the Third Education Project),5/ there were
large ntmbers of qualified personnel in the future project institutions,
and the character of the project lent itself to decentralized preparation
and implementation within a framework of centrally developed, uniform
criteria and guidelines.
31   In 1979 average salaries for university teachers ranged from about 50%
to 75% of comparable salaries in industry, and from 40% to 50% in
management (SAR, para. 3.10).
4/   See OED, Impact of World  Bank  Lending for Educational Development in
Korea: A Review, Report No. 5950, December 5, 1985 (paras. 8.02-8.07)
which judged the "growth and development of the Educational Facilities
Bureau in the  Ministry  of  Education....one  of the most significant
outcomes of Bank lending for education projects in Korea' (para.
8.01).
5/   The other half of the  Third  and  the entire Fourth Education Project
were under the responsibility of the Office of Labor Affairs in the
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.

Prosram Elements
13.      The Sector Loan Program encompassed  two different types of inter-
ventions: 55 (later 59) sub-projects benefitting individual institutions
and ten national programs (dealing mostly with staff training and upgrad-
ing) addressing the requirements of the entire HTE sector. Of the total
amount of US$100 million, 60Z was to go towards engineering education, 36Z
to technician training, and 42 to management courses; 752 was to be devoted
to equipment purchases, 15Z to 'non-facilities' investment (mainly train-
ing), and 102 remained unallocated (which was later almost exclusively used
for further equipment procurement).
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Responsibilities
14.      Because of the size and complexity  of the Sector Loan Program, an
implementation structure with several layers was created. The Education
Facilities Bureau which had acquired considerable experience in three
previous Bank-supported projects (para. 12 above), served both as general
coordinator/contact agency with the Bank and as intermediary for the physi-
cal investment elements of the program.   For the software elements such as
technical assistance and staff training, the Higher Education Bureau and
the Industrial Education Bureau6/ assumed the functions of intermediaries
for the university-level (engineering and management) and JTC subprojects,
respectively.
15.      The beneficiary private and  national institutions were to prepare
their subproject applications in accordance with guidelines and criteria
(see para. 17 below) issued by the MOE after extensive consultation with
the Bank. In the case of beneficiary institutions with limited experience
in preparing investment/staff development programs, the three Bureaux
mentioned in para. 14 were to act as resource and supervision units.
16.      The individual subproject and national program proposals underwent
a twofold screening, first by the Deliberation Committee in MOE for all
subproject applications and second by an interministerial Planning and
Management Committee under the overview of the Economic Planning Board
whenever substantive issues were raised.   Applications in excess of US$2.5
million equivalent were subject to previous Bank review whereas all others
were reviewed ex-post during supervision missions.
6/   Transformed into  the  Nonformal  and  Vocational  Education Bureau in
1981.



Guidelines and Criteria
17.      To ensure a distribution of loan  funds in line with the main pro-
gram objectives and to avoid  geographic or subsector biases, the selection
of subprojects was governed by several sets of guidelines/criteria (see
PCR, paras. 3.05-3.09 for details). These were related to:
(i) the broad allocation of loan funds with regard to field of
study (engineering, management, technician training), program
element (equipment, software), level (graduate/undergraduate),
ownership (nationallprivate) and geographic area (Seoul/rest of
country),  with   lower   and   upper   limits  for  individual
subprojects;
(ii)  the  eligibility  of  institutiona  for  participation  in  the
program  with  a  focus  on  viability  (in  terms  of  school,
department and faculty size) and on commitment to better
quality (to be expounded in a five-year development program);
and
(iii)  the detailed allocation of  loan  funds (approval of individual
subprojects); here the emphasis was on relevance, feasibility
and efficiency of applications which were to be assessed in the
light of an institution's initiatives in program/curriculum
development, its financial situation, availability of physical
facilities,   possibilities   of   inter-departmental   use  of
equipment, etc.
Support int Measures
18.      This two-pronged (equipment  upgrading/staff development) approach
to HTE improvement was to be supported by activities in three related
areas; the first was a strengthening of manpower planning capacities in the
Economic Planning Bureau (EPB), in collaboration with the Ministries of
Education and of  Science  and  Technology.    This would encompass further
development of graduate tracer studies, specific technological manpower
needs and refinements in customary manpower projections.
19.      The second element  was  a  reshaping  of  HTE curricula and study
programs, with the aim of introducing greater flexibility while strengthen-
ing the practical components of HTE, developing new programs and encourag-
ing multi-disciplinary activities, particularly at post-graduate levels.
20.      The third, and potentially most  momentous measure was the setting
up of an accreditation system  for  HTE  institutions.   In 1979 there were
over 1,000 engineering departments in more than 300 universities, graduate
schools and JTCs. This degree of fragmentation called for the introduction
of nationwide academic standards through an accreditation process. 'This
work was to be undertaken by three entities created under the sector pro-
gram, the Korea Engineering Education Board, the Korea Management Education
Board and the Technician Education Evaluation Committee.



-6-
Implementation Experience
21.      Despite the novelty of the  lending approach and procedures, proj-
ect implementation advanced smoothly with only one twelve-month extension
of the closing date being necessary. The subproject evaluation procedures
had been tested prior  to  Board  presentation:   two subprojects were pro-
cessed during appraisal, and another six subprojects/national programs
prior to negotiations.   This  pilot  stage  paid  off in terms of improved
evaluation methods and of early familiarity of the MOE review staff with
the new lending instrument.   Bank supervision missions found the appraisal
work for the individual components and the related documentation to be of
good quality. One ex-post review of seven bid invitations and related
awards by the Bank found minor presentational problems in only two out of
543 items with a total value of US$22 million equivalent (Supervision
Report of June 16, 1982); a previous review of eight sub-loan applications
and bid evaluations/contracts comprising 30 equipment packages valued at
US$2.5 million equivalent had come upon two insignificant e-aluation errors
(Supervision Report of December 15,  1981).   Bank supervision missions had
repeatedly high praise for the competence of the PIU.
Bank Supervision
22.      Bank supervision focussed,  correctly,  on  verification of proce-
dures during the early stages of implementation and on monitoring of
program benchmarks and system indicators later on. It can be summarized as
both effective and efficient. In the few instances where appraisal expec-
tations have not (yet) been fully realized, (paras. 39-45 and 47-48) the
explanations have to be sought in the high ambitions of the program, the
ascendancy  of   political   and   social   considerations  over  technical
(efficiency or educational) regurds and the intrinsic slowness of major
educational change, and not in any shortcomings in the work of PIU or Bank
staff.
23.      Borrower-Bank cooperation benefitted from  a  high degree of staff
stability on both sides and close working relationships pre-dating the
sector program. On the Bank side in particular staff continuity throughout
the implementation period7/ no doubt facilitated the task of monitoring
this novel type of lending.
24.      One of the arguments advanced  in  favor of sector and ather forms
of non-project lending is its more economical use of Bank staff resources.
The experience of this sector loan appears to support this claim: the
Korea HTE Sector Program absorbed a total of 1.8 staff-weeks per US$1
million loan funds prior to Board presentation and 0.7 staff-weeks during
implementation. A comparison with the figures in Table II-1 shows that in
terms of unit costs (weeks of staff inputs per US dollar one million
loaned) this operation does indeed fare well.
7/   Most of the supervision work was carried out by two staff; one of whom
was associated with the sector loan from its preparation stage to
about the halfway point in implementation, the other from the second
year after effectiveness through completion.

25.      While  the  coefficients  for  the  Korea  Sector  Program compare
favorably with those in Table II-1, one should be careful not to attribute
the difference solely or even largely, to the use of the new lending
instrument since there are obviously economies of scale present as well.
This becomes evident if one looks at the coefficients for the two largest
projects in the first sub-group  in  isolation:   the largest, in Mexico,81
had upstream (downstream) staff inputs of 0.7 (0.9) weeks per US$ million
and the second, in Indonesia,9/ of 2.6 (1.2) weeks, respectively. The
experience of just one sector loan is clearly not sufficient to come to a
firm conclusion as to the cost efficiency of this new lending instrument
relative to customary investment projects.    This point will be reexamined
in Chapter IV of the PPAM.
Cost and Finance
26.      The loan of US$100 million was  to  cover 14% of the total cost of
US$700 million equivalent. The Government was to contribute US$370 million
equivalent (53%) and private project institutions US$230 million equivalent
(33Z). Actual total costs amounted to US$627 million (the explanation for
the lower figure being the devaluation of the Won),10/ with the loan share

being 162, the Government's 392 and that of the private sector 452. Apart
from  direct  financial  assistance   to   private  HTE  institutions,  the
Government also arranged for commercial lending under an MOE guarantee
(PCR, paras. 3.26-3.28).
III. PROJECT OUTCOMES
Quality of Education
27.      Most available indicators suggest  that  the  project has led to a
substantial strengthening of the  project  institutions.   Between 1980 and
1984, facilities and equipment and staffing (both in numbers and quality)
have Improved substantially.
Facilities
28.      The number of laboratory and practice rooms grew by 102 in nation-
al and by 28Z in private Colleges of Engineering; for national and private
JTCs the figures were  772  and  92,  respectiiely.    However, in terms of
available area, national  institutions  could  not  hold  their 1980 levels
because of enrollment increases in the 1980-84 period.

29.      At the same  time,  equipping  standards  improved greatly.  Table

30.      The marked differences in  attainment of equipping targets between
the various subgroups (which are still more pronounced at the level of the
individual project institution) reflect differences in enrollment growth
and departmental composition rather than diverging equipping standards.
All project institutions together increased their equipment availability to
712 of MOE standards, surpassing slightly the appraisal target of 70Z (SAR,
para. 4.22).
31.      Not only did equipment increase  in  numbers, but also in quality.
Table III-3 gives the unit value for required and available equipment in
1980 and 1984. Since equipment prices appeared to have remained largely
stable  during  this   period,ll/   the   observed  increases  reflect  the
introduction of more sophisticated equipment (and possibly also the
establishment of new capital-intensive teaching programs) in the project
institutions.
111  The so-called G-5 MUV Index  for Korea (price index for manufacturing
imports from France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United
States) increased by only 1.72 during this period, and the general
Manufacturing Unit Value (MUV) Index decreased by 5.12.

32.      Taken in  conjuncti-n,  the  figures  in  Tables  111-2  and III-3
suggest that while both HTE segments (national and private institutions)
have expanded and improved their equipment since 1980, the national insti-
tutions have done much better, both in the extent of Improvements since
1980 and in the unit value of their equipment, than the private schools.
The sector program appears to have resulted in a widening of the gap in
capital intensity between  the  two  groups:    the installed equipment per
student (on the basis of 1985 enrollments, to cancel out the effect of
different enrollment growth rates, on balance somewhat higher in the
private segment) was US$1,020 (235) equivalent in national (private)
Colleges of Engineering. Since the achievement rates for equipping targets
(Table III-2) show the private institutions ahead in almost every respect,
the only possible explanation is that private institutions, because of
their narrower financial base, are forced to concentrate on less expensive
teaching programs with modest capital inputs.
33.      Lest there be  no  misunderstanding,  it  should  be stressed that
without the Sector Program, the equipment standards of the private project
schools would probably have deteriorat4d both relatively and absolutely.
Nor should it be overlooked that there are a few private institutions that
need not fear a comparison with the best national schools.12/ However, on
12/  The fact that only five institutions (three of them private) accounted
for more than two thirds of the 293 PhD degrees in engineering
conferred in 1985/86 attests to the qualitative dominance of a few top
schools. (Source: MOE, Statistical Yearbook of Education, 1986).



- 11 -
balance there can be little doubt  that  the financial base of most private
Institutions is too weak to permit the establishment and maintenance of
increasingly costly high-tech  programs.    The  heavy  reliance of private
schools on fee revenues, which are subject to Government regulation, limits
their choice to three  basic  optionss    they  can focus on less expensive
teaching programs, use less costly inputs (including teachir.g staff) and/or
increase class sizes.
34.      Under these circumstances an increased level of Government support
is crucial. During the sixth five-year plan (1987-91) Government contribu-
tions, commercial loans and donations totalling W 150 billion (about US$170
million equivalent at completion time) are contemplated (PCR, Part II:
Bank Observations, para. 16).   While  this  should help ease the financial
situation of private institutions over the near future, in the longer run a
gradual liberalization of fee policies, possibly combined with increased
budget allocations for scholarships and provisions for student loans to
counter the negative effect on educational equality, would appear to be an
alternative worth while considering.
Faculty Development
35.      Notable improvements  took  also  place  with  regard  to teaching
staff: between 1980 and 1985, total teaching staff in Junior Technical
Colleges increased by 171 to about 6,400 and in Colleges of Engineering, by
,54  to 3,600.  Because  of  simultaneous enrollment increaser, however, the
expected positive impact on the student/staff ratios failed to materialize:
in Junior Technical Colleges the ratio moved from 43 to 46.5 and in
Colleges of Engineering, from 45 to 55.13/
36.      in the project  institutions,  however,  student/staff ratios were
much more favorable, standing at 24 for JTCs and at 36 for Colleges of
Engineering, although the target ratios 18 and 21 given in the SAR and made
the subject of a covenant (Section 3.09 of the Loan Agreement) were elusive
goals even here.
37.      Improvements in faculty qualifications were even more notable:  in
the beneficiary institutions the percentages of professors with minimum
desirable qualifications (Master's degree in JTCs/PhD in Colleges of
Engineering) rose from 40/54 in 1980 to 89/54 in 1985; the relevant 1985
percentages in relation to total teaching staff were 54Z and 402, respec-
tively. While this fell somewhat short of the appraisal expectations of
702 and 432, respectively (SAR, para. 4.18), the achievements are neverthe-
less impressive.
13/  Calculated from data in:   Korea Council for University Education, The
Condition of Higher Education 1986, Seoul, 1986.



- 12 -
38.      The Sector Loan made key  contributions to this upgrading processt
the various national programs financed 472 study-years abroad for pro-
fessors in Colleges of Engineering, 13" for professors in Management
Colleges and 448 for  professors  in  JTCs.    In addition, more than 3,000
study-years in-country for JTC faculty were provided under the Sector Loan.
The Impact of Enrollment Growth
39.      It became clsa- early on in  the  project that due to the unprece-
dented enrollment increases in HTE the 1986 targets for the student/teacher
ratiosl4/ could not possibly be reached during the implementation period.
The Government and the Bank therefore agreed to extend the adjustment
period to December 31, 1990.    It  remains  in doubt, however, whether the
necessary reductions in student/teacher ratios can be achieved within this
time frame: even if enrollments were to stay at the 1985 levels,15/ the
additional numbers of teaching staff necessary to achieve the ratios of
18:1 in JTCs and 21:1 in Colleges of Engineering would be more than 7,000
and 5,900 respectively (compared to actual increases of about 900 and 1,250
during the period 1980-85).    Short  of  large-scale (and not very likely)
reductions in enrollments the above targets would appear out of reach in
the short run.
Student Quota Systems
40.      As is discussed in detail in Part II of the PCR (paras. 5-8), much
of the surge in enrollments during the period 1980-85 was attributable to
the switch in 1981 from an entrance to a graduate quota system. Coupled
with fixed dropout rates of 302 for universities and 152 for Junior
Technical Colleges (about twice the 'natural' rates observed before), this
meant an immediate boost in enrollments as institutions now were to admit
302 (15%) more students into the first year.
41.      While the m.in objectives of  this  change  appear to have been to
enhance educational equality and to lessen the overriding preoccupation
with the higher education entrance examination throughout the secondary
school system, the introduction of more severe screening was also meant to
inject a greater dose of competition into the higher education system. In
recent years individual institutions have been given a greater measure of
discretion in determining  their  intakes.    As  a  result,  the number of
entrants into higher education appears to have stabilized at about 200,000
per year.
14/ 21:1 for engineering education, 40:1 for management education and 18:1
for  technician  education   (undergraduate   level);   and  15:1  for
engineering education and 20:1 for management education (graduate
level).
15/ From 1985 to 1986 student numberu in Colleges of Engineering still
increased, albeit by only 1.5X.



- 13 -
Relevant Covenants
42.      It may be worthwhile to examine in somewhat grw ter detail the two
loan covenants which were linked, directly or indirectly, to the size of
the HTE system. The first (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement) obliged the
Borrower to submit to the Bank  and  later on implement, " ........ a flexible
allocation system for higher technical education which will facilitate
adjustment of supply of higher technical manpower in accordance with
changes in labor market demand."
43.      This wording suggests  a  concern with  the large oversupplies of
technicians and engineers projected at appraisal time for the period after
1982 (SAR, para. 4.08). If this was the case, the covenant was too general
to  be  operationally  meaningful.    When  the  Government  submitted  its
proposals for a graduate quota system, they were accepted as meeting the
requirements of Section 3.07 (although the introduction of high fixed
failure rates could hardly be expected to introduce greater flexibility
into HTE enrollment practices.)
44.      The second relevant provision (Section 3.09 of the Loan Agreement)
suffered from a similar  lack  of  specificity.    It  held the Borrower to
taking ...... all necessary steps to introduce incentives for recruitment
and retention of teaching staff  ....... as may be required to achieve by
December 31, 1986 (specified] student/teacher ratios" (see, para. 39,
footnote 14). Since the wording did not state whether the target ratios
were to include, e.g., teaching assistants or part-time teaching staff,
target achievement was open to a large margin of inte.pretation.16/
45.      Another, and more fundamental  objection  against this covenant is
provided by the PCR itself (Part II, para. 22) and fully endorsed by the
audit mission: the exclusive use of student/teacher ratios as a yardstick
by which to measure  educational  quality.   The qualifications of teaching
staff, the level of research activities and the development of new curri-
cula are but a few areas of educational quality in which the Sector Program
has performed well, so that the dependence on just one indicator (and an
undifferentiated one at that) is likely to conceal the extent of improve-
ments brought about  through  this  program.    The  Science and Technology
Education Loan, a direct follow-up on this Program, has incorporated the
lessons of the First Sector Loan by using a much broader range of quality
indicators against which to check program performance (for details, see
PCR, Part II, para. 22).
16/ In university departments of mechanical/chemical engineering, for
example, part-time  teaching  staff  accounted  for  one-third  of all
teaching staff in 1986, and the numbers of assistants reached 60%/90%
of  all  full-time  teaching  staff   (Source:    Korean  Council  for
University Education -   Evaluation  Report on Science and Engineering
Education at Undergraduate and Graduate Levels in Korea; Summary.
Seoul, September 1986).



- 14 -
InstituLional Development
46.      The Sector Program  initiated  and/or  furthered  a wide array of
institutional changes. In the area of curriculum development, three basic
curriculum models for engineering educatior. (each with a different central
objective and a different mix of subject matters) were developed (PCR,
paras. 31-33). In technician education, the creation of the Technician
Education  Research  Institute  (TERI)   attached   to  the  Gyeonggi  Open
University has pro-vided a focal point for all research, development, plan-
ning, staff training and evaluation activities. In the field of technician
education curricula for more than 20 disciplines were developed, and educa-
tional materials for a total of over 70 fields.
47.      The concept of academic accreditation has been firmly established:
during the project implementation period, three accreditation committees
were created to evaluate schools of engineering and management and Junior
Technical Colleges. While the first round of evaluations was undertaken on
a very tight time schedule (for instance, the 144 JTCs included in the
accreditation process were examined by a team of 12 in a period of less
than 150 days), future accreditation is seen as a continuous process, to be
repeated in cycles of about five years. Responsibility for ongoing accre-
ditation is now vested with the Korean Council for University Education and
the Nonformal and Vocational Education Bureau (for JTCs)
48.      The PCR  (Part  II,  paras.  10-11)  notes  that the accreditatior.
process is not yet the monitoring and control instrument envisaged by the
appraisal mission but rather an information tool. However, the beginnings
of a more active use of the system can already be seen: annual budgets for
JTCs and research funds for university colleges are allocated in accordance
with the results of the accreditation process.
49.      In the field of  manpower  planning  the  capacity of the Economic
Planning Board for manpower analysis and planning has been strengthened. A
Manpower Development Committee has a  coordinating  and guiding role in all
aspects of manpower planning including the determination of student quotas
in higher education.
50.      A significant aahievement (supported by a modest equipment alloca-
tion of about US$0.1 million not foreseen in the original program) was the
establishment and operation of a Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center
attached to Gyeonggi Open University. The Center provides repair and main-
tenance services to technical high schools and JTCs in three alternative
ways: advice on maintenance/repair which the school can undertake; repairs
by roving teams of specialist; and repairs at the Center. During the years
1983-1986, the Center has received repair requests for a total of about
11,800 equipment items; nearly 6,800 items were repaired at the Center or
by the mobile teams and more than 1,900 items by the schools themselves
following technical advice by the Center.   In about a quarter of the cases



- 15 -
the equipment was either too far  damaged  or too outdated to make a repair
economical.171
51.      At the time of  the  audit  mission,  the  Center had eight repair
specialists (up from five at  the  time  of completion).  However, this was
viewed as quite insufficient.   To cover adequately six different equipment
areas, six repair divisions with eight staff each were deemed necessary.
The Role of Women
52.      The main objective of the  Sector  Loan  was to enable Korea's HTE
system to meet the future technical manpower requirements of the economy.
It was thus not explicitly  geared  to  the educational needs of women, the
less so since HTE is  generally  perceived  (not  only in Korea but also in
many other countries)  as  holding  less  attraction  for women than other
fields of study.
53.      Unfortunately, the relevant project data are not differentiated by
gender. However, there is indirect evidence that the Government and the
project institutions have made  a  conscious effort to increase educational
opportunities for women in the context of this program: the JTCs benefit-
ting from the loan established 92 new departments with 9,280 places during
the implementation period. More than half of these places were in fields
which were known to hold relatively greater interest for female students
than the traditional branches of engineering; examples are computers (2,000
places), pediatrics (720), electronics (600), commercial and industrial
design (600), textiles (360), nutrition and food science (280).181
54.      Improved access for women to HTE is also evident from the relevant
nationwide statistics: between 1979 and 1986 the numbers of female stu-
dents in engineering increased more than six-fold to about 7,000 (although
this was still an insignificant 3.4% of total engineering enrollments).19/
In JTCs the rise in female enrollments was more than five-fold (from under
18,000 to over 90,000), and the female share stood at 37% in the latter
year, up from less than 25% in 1979. Statistics on female entrants (5.6%
of all 1985 engineering school entrants in 1985 were women) suggest that
the tendency towards increased female participation is likely to continue.
Similar upward trends can be observed in the number of female graduate
students and faculty.
17/ It was a very pleasing experience for the audit mission to see in one
project school instruments that had been provided under the First
Education Project of 1969 (i.e., more than 15 years ago) and which
were still in good working order. Other equipment items from the same
project were being repaired at the Center.

IV. FINDINGS
Prolect Content and Objectives
55.      The central objective of the  project was the qualitative improve-
ment of HTE to enable the system to cope with the more complex manpower
demands of Korea's industry. This objective was to be achieved by a two-
pronged approach of equipment purchases and staff training/upgrading,
complemented by several supporting measures such as accreditation of HTE
institutions, curriculum development and a reshaping of the student quota
system.
56.      While the only numerical indicator for monitoring changes foreseen
in the Loan Agreement (the student/teacher ratio) was too narrow to convey
an adequate picture of quality improvements achieved under the program,
there is not doubt that the equipment and staff development elements con-
stituted quality improvements on a significant scale.
57.      However, these improvements were  to  a large extent countermanded
by unprecedented enrollment increases during the early years of implementa-
tion. The new graduate quota system, rather than serving as a mechanism
for adjusting the size and composition of the HTE system to the require-
menits of the labor  market  (as  had  been  hoped  at appraisal) acted as a
vehicle for this expansion.
Implementation Arrangements
58.      The generally problem-free  implementation  of  the Sector Program
must be credited to the experience of the implementing agency (the EFB) and
to the availability of qualified personnel in the participating project
institutions to whom most of the project preparation work (e.g., prepara-
tion of equipment lists and related specifications, formulation of staff
development programs) could be delegated.
59.      The guidelines  and  criteria  for  the  selection  of beneficiary
institutions and for the broad allocation of loan funds were extensively
tested prior to negotiations and proved both appropriate and adequate. Ex-
post reviews during supervision missions confirmed the correct application
of these rules and of the relevant procurement procedures.
General Implications of Sector Loan Experience
60.      While total  staff  inputs,  particularly  during the preparation/
appraisal stage may have been rather large in absolute terms, the unit
costs (staff-weeks per US dollar one million loan funds) were quite low.
However, economies of scale would account for much of this economy of
resource use. The experience of the Second Sector Loan (which started in
1984) should provide a better idea of staff requirements of this lending
instrument in full development.



- 17 -
61.      However, it must be  emphasized  that  the savings in manpower are
not absolute but relate only to Bank staff inputs. Due to initial unfamil-
iarity of Borrower staff with the new procedures and the large degree of
decentralization of project preparation and implementation, it is likely
that the total staff inputs (which could not be determined) may well have
been higher than for a customary investment project of similar size and
with a similarly experienced PIU.
62.      A second comment concerns  documentation:  compared to traditional
projects of similar scope, the files for this sector loan were not very
voluminous. To some extent this would be the mark of a problem-free proj-
ect implementation. However, in this case it probably goes beyond that and
indicates a generic difference.   Much of the information usually contained
in project files remains with the Borrower and is only perused ad-hoc by
supervision missions.
63.      This points to the importance of  staff stability for this type of
lending activity. Thorough knowledge of a particular sector and country
(which is a precondition for an effective supervision of such lending
operations) is acqaired only gradually  and demands continuous efforts.  To
keep in contact with the educational realities of a given country, it is
not sufficient to analyze statistical data (even in the few cases where
they are both plentiful and reliable); factual knowledge derived from field
visits and discussions with officials outside the central administration
remain crucial inputs into an effective policy dialogue. In short, to make
the new lending instruments work, part of the savings in staff inputs asso-
ciated with its use will have to be invested in more and better sector
analysis.
Sustainability
64.      The outlook  for  continued  improvements  of  Korea's  HTE system
appears good, once enrollments have stabilized. The Sector Loan has laid a
solid institutional base for a course of continuous improvement, with the
accreditation system as the potentially most powerful instrument for quali-
ty monitoring and guidance.
65.      The adequate funding of  private  HTE institutions remains a chal-
lenge for Korea's educational policy makers.   However, the Sector Loan and
the related financial assistance measures provided by the Government are a
large step in the right direction.   Continued government commitment to the
improvement of private institutions (para. 34 above) should permit the
private  HTE  segment  to maintain  a  satisfactory  level  of educational
quality.  In the  longer  run,  a more  flexible handling of fee policies,
accompanied by  appropriate  modifications  of  scholarship  practices, may
become a complementary option.



- 18 -
Forward Linkates
66.      The  second  sector  operation was  the  Science  and  Technology
Education Loan (Ln. 2427-K0  of  June  15,  1984).   This loan pursues, for
another segment of higher education, slmilar objectives as its predecessor.
It is benefitting from the experience of the First Sector Loan in more than
one way: both Borrower and Bank staff are more familiar with the new
procedures, key institutions (such as the Korean Council for University
Education) are in place and monitoring instruments have been refined (para.
45). These factors have so far assured a smooth Implementation; completion
is expected by 1990.

PART I - COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY THE GOVERNMENT
KOREA
SECTOR PROGRAM ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (LOAN 1800-KO)
1. FOREWORD
1.01      The Sector Program on Higher Technical Education (Ln. 1800-KO) was
implemented from February 1980 to June 30, 1985. It was the first education
sector loan financed by the Bank. It was estimated to cost a total of
W 340,000 million with loan financing of W 77,000 million equivalent to
US$100 million. The objective was to upgrade the quality of higher education
in Korea. The components included: upgrading the quality of teaching staff;
development of curricula; purchase of laboratory and workshop equipment; and
support to private and public institutions in the areas of engineering,
technician education, and business administration.
1.02      The Borrower was expected to prepare and furnish to the Bank a
project completion report, soon after completion of the Project, on implemen-
tation, expenses, revenue, compliance with covenants, and achievement of goals
of the Iroject pursuant to Section 3.04, (3) of the Loan Agreement. The
Ministry of Education, therefore, assigned a review team of five members for
the above purpose in June 1985 and requested them to prepare an interim report
by Auguet 28, 1985, and the final report by October 28, 1985; these reports
have been completed.
1.03      The Review Team studied documents and papers related to the sector
program including the Loan Agreement, government documents on implementation
of the Program, feasibility studies, and reports prepared by the Korea
Engineering Education Board (KEEB), Korea Management Education Board (KMEB),
and Technician Education Research Institute (TERI). Information wss also
collected through questionnaires sent to project schools. The review team
selectively visited Project institutions, and surveyed the status of teaching
staff, development of curricula, availability of laboratory and workshop
equipment, its operation and maintenance, and evaluated the achievement of
project goals. Persons related to the project were interviewed.
1.04      The Review Team was organized as follows:

2. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socioeconomic Background
2.01      The Government's Strategy for Economic Development.  The basic goal
of the first five-year Economic Development Plan (1962-1966) was to increase
national income. The Government pursued economic development in priority
areas such as raising agricultural income, correcting imbalances in the
national economy, securing power sources (electric and coal power), expanding
key industries, increasing employment, developing land, increasing export
volume, improving the position of international payments, and developing
science and technology.
2.02      The main goals of the second five-year Economic Development Plan
(1967-1971) were to modernize the industrial structure and further facilitate
economic growth. The Government promoted economic development in such areas
as supply of food, increase of exports, import substitution, improvement in
the balance of payments, increase of employment, birth control, and increase
in national products and agricultural income.
2.03      The third five-year Economic Development Plan (1972-1976) was aimed
at developing heavy and chemical industries to achieve industrial moderniza-
tion, and creating a new agricultural society under the Saemaul Movement based
on progress achieved under the 1st and the 2nd Plans. The priority areas
promoted were heavy and chemical industries, self-sufficiency in food,
increase in the income of farmers and fishery workers, improvement in the
standard of living, increase of exports, improvement in the structure of
exports, and advancement in science and technology.
2.04      The fourth five-year Economic Development Plan (1977-1981) had as
its aim to establish a self-developing structure under the ideal of security
of the Republic, growth, equity, and efficiency.
2.05      The fifth five-year Economic Development Plan (1982-1986) aims at
economic stability through efficiency and balance, continuing economic devel-
opment, balanced growth among the different income levels, and promotion of
national welfare.
Industrial Advancement and Manpower Requirements
2.06      Korea's early economic development was based on agriculture.  During
the first through the third Economic Development Plans, increased export
volume was promoted mainly in labor-intensive industries. Since the fourth
Plan, this was changed to technology-intensive industries to develop products
which provided much added value.
2.07      Training of high technology engineers needed for an advanced
industrial society requires various measures, such as developing curriculum at
the college level, upgrading the quality of teaching staff in colleges,
laboratory and workshop equipment, and recruiting qualified high school
students to college science and technology programs.

2.08      A long period of adaptation was requiret for higher technical
manpower to acquire full production capability. The adaptation period for
technologists in Korea was tyg to three years compared with six months for
those in advanced countries.-   To shorten this period, measures were adopte/
to increase laboratory and workshop equipment in colleges.
Problems in Higher Technical Education in Korea
2.09      Several problems were identified at the time of appraisal:
(a)  Student Quotas.  A rapid growth in enrollment in colleges/
universities began in the early 1960s. The ni mber of students
increased about 2.5 times from 1975 to 1982.2   Enrollment in
colleges of engineering increased rapidly from 1978. This phenome-
non was caused by the increased demand for higher technical manpower
along with the growth of the economy and the industry in Korea. It
was also the result of the Government's policy for college educa-
tion. The rapid growth in the number of college students, however,
was not accompanied by an increased quantity of teaching staff and
facilities, resulting in an unsatisfactory level of achievement in
education;
(b) Teaching Staff. There was an acute shortage of qualified teaching
staff in higher technical programs. In junior technical colleges,
more than half the teaching staff were high school teachers or were
assigned to their current jobs directly after graduation from
university and had no experience in industry. They did not have the
capability to develop and teach related curri3yla and there were no
systematic programs to improve their quality.
(c) Shortage of Laboratory and Workshop Equipment. Laboratory and
workshop equipment is a prerequisite for technical education.
However, in 1977. the availability of equipment at colleges of
engineeriag in proportion to the Ministry of Education's (MOE)
standard requirements was 33%. For junior technical colleges, the
ratios were 25% for national colleges and 19% for private
colleges. At these ratios, no normal laboratory and practical
training could be conducted.

Project Formulation
2.10      The MOE had already imported and distributed laboratory and workshop
equipment totaling US$69.2 million to 131 schools of various levels under the
first through third Education Loans from IBRD before implementation of the
sector loan. The Ministry has made a concentrated investment in training
skilled workers for economic development in Korea through assisting 64 agri-
cultural, technical, and fisheries high schools. The first three projects
have trained skilled manpower for local industries, and the impact of these
projects has spread beyond the institutes financed through demonstration
effects on other qchools. In addition, the Bank also finat.zed a US$23 million
loan to vocational training institutes under the Ministry of Labor. The
Ministry of Education has also received loans from the US Eximbank and the
Japanese OECF for development of facilities in colleges of natural sciences
and medicine.
2.11      In preparation of the first IBRD sector loan, the Ministry appointed
three research groups to carry out feasibility studies on these areas:
engineering, technician, and business administration education. The groups
conducted their research activities for one year until March 31, 19719.  They
found problems in the education system, teaching staff, laboratory and
workshop equipment, and education-industry cooperation, and proposed future
improvements. At their recommendation, the Ministry proposed the Higher
Technical Education Sector Program to IBRD The project was appraised in two
stages in October 1978 and March 1979, and the Loan Agreement was signed in
February 1980.
Objectives of the Sector Program
2.12      Upgrading the Quality of Teaching Staff.  The appraisal targets for
upgrading staff qualifications are shown in Table 2.1.

In addition to degree fellowships, teaching staff were to be upgraded through
short-term overseas training and local seminars. The sector program included
overseas non-degree training for 1,370 professors.

2.13      Developvent of Curricula.  A major objective of the program was to
strengthen the analytical and practical skills of higher technical manpower
through teaching programs.  The curricula was revised in 1980.  Curricula for
engineering courses were to be improved by:
(a)  Increasing credit requirements tor basic science and engineering
subjects from 24Z to 401 of available time;
(b)  Increasing credit requirements for experimental and practical work
from an average of 10 to 25.
(c) Adding new engineering programs, particularly in industrial
engineering, operations research and instrumentation;
(d) Developing multi-disciplinary programs.
2.14      Purchase of Laboratory and Workshop Equipment.  The goal was to
increase the availability of equipment to 70Z of MOE requirements.  The
invested value in equipment per student was to be increased from US$500 to
US$2,000. The goal of 100Z availability of equipment required by MOE was
postponed to the late 1980s. Th.e priority in equipment acquisition was as
follows: equipment for
(a) electronics, and mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering;
(b) basic science laboratories; and
(c) teacher training at the graduate level.
When the equipment was acquired as planned, the class hours for laboratory and
practical work were expected to increase from 10Z to 30% in colleges of
engineering, and from 20Z to 401 at junior technical colleges.
2.15      Supporting Private Institutions.  The sources of financing for
private institutions in the school year 1979 were school foundation funds,
7.2Z, student tuition, 84.61, and miscellaneous, 8,1;. The financial
conditions of private institutions were very poor.!' The Korea Education
Development Institute proposed a gradual model for developing private
institutions as shown in Table 2.2.

2.16      According to the sector program Staff Appraisal Report, the
investment amount per student in the private colleges of engineering was on
the average US$400, which was only 70  of that in the national (public)
colleges of engineering. Also, in national colleges/universities there were
27 students per professor and private colleges, 35 students per professor.
Private colleges were short of teaching staff due to the'!; poor financial
conditions and inability to recruit more teaching staff._
Program Content
2.17      The sector program consisted of 10 national programs and about
55 subprojects to be carried out by eligible institutions, in the following
areas:
(a) Adjusting manpower supply and demand by:
(i)   establishing a permanent capacity for manpower analysis and
continuous monitoring;
(ii)   implementing a flexible student allocation system which
permits transfer of students between departments and across
fields while maintaining entry standards; and
(iii)   introducing in-service and retraining programs.

(b) Improving quality by:
(i) establishing accreditation agencies to set and enforce
appropriate training standards;
(ii) adapting new content to existing teaching programs to
direct industrial requirements, and introducing new
programs to strengthen analytical and practical skills;
(iii)   increasing the supply, and improving the qualifications, of
teaching staff; and
(iv)   providing laboratory equipment for teaching purposes.
(c)  reducing the investment gap between private and public higher
technical education by:
(i)   channelling funds to private institutions;
(ii)   assisting private institutions to obtain required
resources; and
(iii)   studying the feasibility of increasing private institution
revenue through increased student fees.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Organization and Staffing
3.01      The organization for carrying out education loan projects relies on
existing line agencies in MOE. The Education Facilities Bureau (EFB) of MOE
was established in 1969 for implementation of the 1st IDA Credit, No. 151-KO
and has carried out in succession the 2nd and 3rd IDA/IBRD Loan Projects, the
US Eximbank Loan Project, the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund Loan
Projects, and the Asian Development Bank Loan Projects. The Bureau has had
extensive previous experience in executing education loan projects, and is
responsible for planning and supervising the physical aspects of project
implementatron and for general coordination of loan programs and liaison with
the World Bank. The Higher Education Bureau in MOE managed the software
components of university engineering and management education, and the
Industrial Education Bureau that of technician training. The above two
bureaus oversaw the establishment of che accreditation systems for engineering
education, technical education, and managemer.t education.
3.02      In 1981, the Industrial Education Bureau was reorganized into the
Nonformal & Vocational Education Bureau. .ne Junior College Academic Affairs
Division under the Bureau was responsible for implementing the software
components, hereafter referred to as nonfacilities programs for junior
technical colleges. Two committees, the Deliberation Committee in MOE and the
Planning and Management Committee in the Economic Planning Board (EPB) were
responsible for evaluating loan-financed subprojects.



- 28 -
3.03      At the time of signing of the sector program Loan Agreement in 1980,
the EFB consisted of: Planning Divisions I and II, the Equipment Division,
Maintenance Division, Foreign Capital Projects Office and School Building
Construction Office, staffed with 125 officials. These divisions were reduced
in 1983 to the Facilities Planning Divisions, Equipment Procurement Division,
Equipment Maintenance Management Division, School Building Construction
Division, and Foreign Capital Project Division, with some 57 staff.
Detailed Procedures of the Sector Program
3.04      The 5th education loan was provided in the form of a sector program
which is a different type of loan from those of the first three IDA/IBRD
projects. The main point of a sector loan is the focus on addressing issues
in a specific sector and overall planning of that sector. The borrower
organizes a management agency, which decides and oversees subprojects, and
takes charge of them. Loan allocations for subprojects over US$2,500,000 were
to be approved by the Bank in advance. Therefore, two overseas training
programs for professors of engineering and management education under the non-
facility category and five subprojects under the equipment category for Seoul
National, National University Hanyang, and Busan Junior Technical college were
approved by the Bank in advance and implemented. Procedures for processing
subprojects are shown in Table 3.1.

3.09      Allocation Guidelines.  MOE adopted allocation guidelines
recommended by the IBRD appraisal team including:
(a) 201 to 50X of the loan would be allocated for graduate courses;
(b) One third or more of the subprojects of the loan allocation would be
allocated to private institutions;
(c) The size of the subprojects would range from a minimum of US$500,000
to a maximum 10X of the total allocation to the same field;
(d) No more than half the loan funds would be for institutions in the
Seoul area.

3.10      Allocation to Colleges of Engineering.  The KEEB at first selected
27 colleges of engineering as project institutions; in addition, 5 colleges of
engineering, 1 national and 4 private, applied for participation and 32
colleges of engineering in all were selected as project institutions
(Table 3.3). In allocation of the loan, US$46,930,000 were allocated in
October 1980 but this was increised to US$57,075,000, covering some 8,374
items of laboratory and workshop equipment.

Training of Teaching Staff
3.13      The plan for upgrading the quality of teaching staff was as follows:
(a) Engineering education. The KEEB proposed ways to upgrade the
quality of teaching staff through:
(i)   Assistance to increase the proportion of professors holding
doctorates from 38Z in 1979 to 43% by 1986;
vii)   Expansion of overseas training of professors and support
for them to participate in foreign international meetings;
(iii)   Expansion of research activities by and support to
professors in industrial fields;
(iv)   Support for retraining of professors; and
(v)   Assistance to professors to participate in training
programs for technical manpower in industry.
(b)  Management Education.  The current problems in management education
include lack of qualified professors and curricula. The increased
demand for managerial rsanpower in industry has caused the loss of
good professors to industry. Proposed ways to upgrade quality of
teaching staff included retraining of teaching staff, short-term
overseas training, and raising the ratio of professors holding
doctorates.
(c) Technician Education. The Korea Technician Education Evaluation
Committee proposed ways to train teaching staff as follows:
(i)   Local training of 3,400 professors of junior technical
colleges for 66 hours;
(ii)   Overseas training of 250 professors of junior technical
colleges for one year;
(iii)   Overseas training of 50 research assistants or research
technicians; and
(iv)   Invitation of 30 foreign consultants.
3.14      Selection of Trainees.  The sector program supported overseas
training of professors for engineering, management, and technician educa-
tion. In colleges of engineering, overseas training of professors were in the
fields of mechanical, electrical, electronics, chemical, architectural, civil,
metallurgical and industrial engineering. The criteria for sclection of
trainees were: should hold a doctorate, be aged less than 50, possess foreign
language proficiency, and be willing to work for more than three years after
return from training. The distribution of selected candidates was one among
11 professors for national colleges of engineering, one among 18 professors in

the case of private colleges of engineering, and one among 15 professors for
all colleges of engineering. The planned versus actual achievement in train-
ing is shown in Table 3.6.

3.15      In management education, the purpose of overseas training of
professors was to introduce management theory from advanced countries,
stimulate development of management education, and contribute to improvement
of management through education-industry cooperation. The countries selected
for training were the USA and European countries and training places were
major universities or research institutes. The major fields of the trainees
included accounting, international economics, staffing of industries, market-
ing, quantitative management, and financing. The criteria for selection of
trainees were: should be under the age of 50, have linguistic ability, have
research experience of not less than five years, and be full-time teaching
staff with three or more years of teaching experience. The of overseas
training of management professors is shown in Table 3.7.

implemented. Seven subprojects in this category were approved by the Bank
during July 23 to October 10, 1980. They are shown in Table 3.9.

3.18      Improvement of the Committee of Manpower Development and
Promotion. The Agreement provides in Section 3.06 that the Borrower is to
evaluate, not later than January 30, 1980, the Committee for Manpower Develop-
ment and Promoti.'n within the Economic Planning Board and ensure that it
performs, not later tLan December 31, 1981, the functions of a manpower moni-
toring system. The Economic Planning Board organized a manpower coordination
monitoring system and a task force in compliance with Section 3.06 of the
Agreement on March 5, 1981. The Manpower Monitoring Committee was to hold
meetings once a year or more, and the Task Force was to meet two times or more
a year.
3.19      The Manpower Monitoring Committee was organized with the Vice-
minister of EPB as chairman, Vice-ministers from the Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of
Science and Technology, Director Geaeral of Labor Administration, Assistant
Minister of EPB for planning, and the 2nd Administration Coordinator, Office
of Administration Coordination, and Office of the Premier, seven persons in
all.
3.20      The Task Force fr manpower monitoring was composed of the Assistant
Minister of EPB for planning, as leader, and as members, the Director General
of Bureau Planning of EPB, Director General of Higher Education Bureau, and
Director General of Nonformal and International Education Bureau, MOE,
Guidance Officer of 2nterprises, Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI),
Director General, Management Bureau, MOCI, Planning Officer of Manpower, MOST,
Director General of Vocational Stabilization Bureau, Office of Labor Adminis-
tration, and related officer of the 2nd Administrative Coordination, Office of
Administration Coordination, Office of the Premier, nine persons in all. In
1984, EPB formalized this arrangement by establishing a Manpower Coordination
Division.
3.21      Flexibility of the Student Quota System.  Section 3.07 of the
Agreement provides that the Borrower is to submit, not later than December 31,
1980, to the Bank, for its review and comments, proposals for a flexible
allocation system for higher technical education which will facilitate
adjustment of supply of higher technical manpower in accordance with changes
in labor market demand. MOE arranged on March 11, 1981 to establish short-
term and long-term plans for this purpose in the field of technician educa-
tion, and also prepared recommendations for improvement for the fields of
engineering and management education by May 31, 1981. The contents of the
above short-term and long-term measures for technician education were to
control increase of student quotas and allow junior technical colleges to
decide student admission quotas by themselves, by department and by course,
and thereby allow colleges flexibility in taking new transferring students and
permitting changes of departments for students. The plans were reviewed by
the Bank and were satisfactory.
3.22      Establishment and Operation of Education Research Centers.  Section
3.08 of the Agreement provides that the Borrower should establish, not later
than January 1, 1981, and thereafter maintain three accreditation agencies, in
the fields of engineering, technician and management training to assess the



- 42 -
quality and relevance of higher technical education and training standards.
Terms of references for the three accreditation agencies were approved by IBRD
on September 13, 1980, and th_ three agencies were established on January 1,
1981. Their purpose, function, and performance are described in detail in
paragraph 5.1.
3.23      Relaxing of Student:Teacher Ratio.  Section 3.09 of the Agreement
stipulates thet the Borrower should take all necessary steps for recruitment
and retention of teaching staff at graduate and undergraduate levels as might
be required to achieve by December 31, 1986 student:teacher ratios of 21:1 for
engineering education, 40:1 for management education and 18:1 for technician
education at the undergraduate level; and 15:1 and 20:1, respectively, for
engineering education and management education at the graduate level.
3.24      As of March 1985, the student:teacher ratios of the project institu-
tions were 38.1:1 for engineering education at private institutions, 52:1 for
that at national ones, 17.3:1 for national junior technical colleges, and
41.6:1 for private ones. Only that for national junior technical colleges was
achieved. The failure to achieve the targets was a result of decisions to in-
crease enrollments sharply in 1981 and 1982 and slower than expected progress
is recruiting new faculty. The agreement was amended to postpone the deadline
for achieving these targets to December 31, 1990.
3.25      Audit Reporting.  Section 4.03 of the Agreement stipulates that tne
Borrower's Ministries and Agencies responsible for carrying out the Project
should report to the Bank on audits conducted for the project every year
within six months of the end of the government fiscal year. The MOE furnished
Audit Reports three times to the Bank on September 26, 1983, August 21, 1984,
and August 1985.
3.26      Support to Private Institutions.  One of the main purposes of the
sector loan was to upgrade private and local institutions. Pursuant to
section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement, MOE organized a study team during May to
October 1980 for research on financial aspects of private institutions to
upgrade their quality. The team recommended in its report to provide finan-
cial assistance of W 122,500 million for private colleges of engineering and
W 92,100 million for private junior technical colleges.
3.27      The Government established a financial assistance plan for private
colleges of engineering and private junior technical colleges in June 1981 in
addition to the sector loan. The assistance fund was W 41,200 million for the
5-year period from 1982 to 1986, W 19,500 million for private colleges of
engineering and W 21,700 million for private junior technical colleges. The
assistance method was to secure the required funds every year in the govern-
ment budget and apportion them as grant-in-aid.
3.28      The Government also plannec to assist private institutions for three
years from 1981 to 1983 with an amount of W 60,000 million for expansion of
education facilities along with the introduction of the new graduate quota
system. The approach for assistance was as follows:



- 43 -
(a) Arranging commercial lending of about W 20,000 million every year
for three years
(b) Support facilities such as athletic halls and student union
buildings might be built from the institution's own resources, but
loan assistance will be arranged by the Government for construction
of basic facilities such as laboratories and lecture rooms
(b) The loan assistance from private sources will be guaranteed by MOE,
and the repayment period will be for 10 years after the 5-year grasc7
period. One half of the interest will be borne by the Government.-
Problems in Project Implementation
3.29      Problems in Implementation Procedures  About two months elapse from
receipt of shipping documents to delivery owing to complicated procedures in
project institutions, the Ministry, and the procurement agency, OSROK. In
addition, a period of about two years is required for equipment imported under
foreign loans from allocation of the loan to installation of the equipment.
Sometimes equipment which was the most modern at the time of request for
purchase had become outdated by the time of delivery. Another phenomenon was
that owing to price escalation during the project period, the quantity of
equipment planned to be imported had to be reduced.
3.30      Too many papers were also required for customs clearance of
equipment imported under the loan, namely import declaration, supply notice of
import goods, shipping documents, recommendation for tax reduction, confirma-
tion on use of goods to be imported, confirmation on use of goods imported,
registration card of tax-reduced imported goods, copy of business license and
others. A large-scale reduction in the amount of papers is recommended.
3.31      Problems in Selection and Usage of Equipment.  Professors of project
junior technical colleges have indicated that about 1   of the equipment
imported under the project had low utilizatioi rates.- Such equipment falls
into the following categories:
(a) Equipment rarely used in the curricula
(b) Equipment without proper accessories
(c) Equipment overly sophisticated and not used much
(d) Low quality equipment

Engineering, p.85.

Evaluation Report on Education Loan Projects, p. 241.



- 44 -
(e) Inadequate technician support and ability to operate equipment.
One cause of poor selection of equipment is that the Standard Lists of
Equipment for education contained items that were obsolete.  MOE revised the
lists on July 1, 1983. However, by that time, some equipment selected from
the old list had already been purchased. Other causes were problems involved
in purchase through OSROK, limited experience with equipment, and insufficient
information on the latest equipment.
3.32      Only 4Z of equipment was found to be i7appropriate in the case oi
colleges of engineering, accord.ng to a survey.-   The problems were:
(a) Inadequate accessories or attachments
(b) Redundancy in some items
(c) Equipment too costly to operate.
Causes of these problems were the same as those for junior technical colleges.
3.33      Regarding utilization of equipment in colleges of engineering, 83.61
was evaluated to be good or very good. Causes of poor utilization were mostly
equipment without accessories, equipment requiring more techniciAgs than were
available, and insufficient funds for operation and maintenance._' The most
serious problem in usage of equipment in colleges of engineering and junior
technical colleges is lack of accessories and operation technicians,
especially in the case of high priced and sophisticated equipment. Generally,
graduate students or research assistants act as technicians, but they are
incapable of providing adequate maintenance.
3.34      As the amount of technical equipment increased, owing to long use
and obsolescence of equipment imported under education loan projects since
1969, MOE established a mobile equipment maintenance center attached to the
Gyeonggi Open University in June 1983. For purposes, detailed operations, and
effectiveness of the center, see para. 5.21.
Implementation of a Sector Program
3.35      Comparison of a Sector Loan to a Project Loan.  In this sector
program, the options and flexibility of the borrower in processing subprojects
were expanded, but at the same time its responsibility was increased.
Differences between a sector loan and a project loan are shown as follows:

Evaluation Report on Education Loan Projects, p. 264.

3.36      The process of a sector loan is:  first, the borrower focusses on a
certain sector such as engineering education, establishes a comprehensive
development plan for solving problems in the sector, and assists and imple-
ments the plan. Second, MOE agrees with IBRD on basic principles required for
implementation of the program, such as criteria for selection of subproject
institutions, general guidelines for allocation of loan proceeds and other
major subjects for implementing the program, and special functions are handed
over to the borrower such as evaluation and control exe:uted by IBRD in
traditional project loans. Detailed matters are decided and implemented
directly by the MOE for a speedy execution of the program. Local professional
experts are utilized by the borrower.  Project planning, related evaluation,
and implementation are conducted in the way most suitable to local conditions
through participation by local experts in all project implementation steps.
3.37      Managerial Capability of Borrower.  According to experience with
implementation of the sector program, the borrower should have the ability to
manage this kind of program, including:



- 46 -
(a) Decision making and policy making ability through committees or
other forums;
(b) Administrative ability for financing, staffing, auditing, and
technical matters;
(c) Professional skills in preparing for project implementation, review
of subprojects, giving guidance to project institutions, and
processing subprojects.
3.38      Bank Role.  The role of IBRD in the sector program may be sunmmarized
as follows:
(a) Act as catalyst in the creation of the institution administering the
sector loan;
(b) Analyze and discuss with the country problems and strategies for the
sector;
(c) Suggest and discuss criteria for selecting subprojects;
(d) Approve subprojects;
(e) Review progress periodically with borrower;
(f) Train borrower's staff.
3.39      An advantage of a sector loan is that the project implementation can
progress speedily without most of the approval and procedures needed for a
traditional project. The program is effectively processed by participation of
local professional experts and committee members whose cooperation and
consultation could be easily obtained when required through their visits to
project institutions and discussions. On the other hand, there is a heavy
workload on the side of the borrower, which may be called a shortcoming.
4. PROJECT COSTS
Estimated and Actual Project Costs
4.01      The Government projected the total cost of the sector program for
1978 to 1983 at US$700 million. The investment components were US$270 million
for national colleges of engineering, US$270 million for private colleges of
engineering, and US$160 million for the non-facility programs. Of the total
project cost, IBRD financed US$100 million, or 14X of the total cost, the
Government provided US$370 million of the investment at 53%, and private
institutions US$230 million at 33%. Actual project costs in US dollars
amounted to US$627 million as shown in Table 4.1. This represents a 10%
underrun due to devaluation of the won. Actual costs in won amounted to W 483
billion, 42% more than appraisal estimates.

(c) Studies on ways to improve technician education, drawing experience
from the countries;
(d) Planning development of curricula for junior technical colleges; and
(e)  Accreditation of junior technical colleges.
5.06      Accreditation of junior technical colleges was in accordance with
Clause 7 of the Regulation for the Policy Consulting Committee in the Ministry
and Article 3.08 of the Loan Agreement, and was based on the colleges' ability
to plan and achieve educational objectives, the curricula, number of
professors, status of educational facilities, amount of laboratory and
practical, and field training, counseling on placement, management capacity,
and financial management. The evaluation reports of the accreditation team
contained suggestions for improvement to each junior technical college and
provided relevant materials and information. Accreditation was conducted on
144 institutions from 1980 to 1983 (Table 5.2.).

Development of Curricula
5.07      The KEEB has categorized functions of colleges of engineering into
the following three models of technical education:
(a)  Model A:  emphasis on earlier adaptation to the industrial field
(b)  Model B:  emphasis on better management
(c)  Model C:  emphasis on engineering theories.
An engineer in the industrial field should: first, have the ability to meet
production requirements in fields such as design, management, operation,
tests, construction, and sales; second, be able to take charge of research
and development activities; and, third, have the ability to manage and operate
large-scale industries. The Board proposed the above-cited models as there
was no way to produce engineers under a uniform educational method. The
curriculum components in the three models are shown in Table 5.3 and 5.4.

Establishment of Technician Education Research Institute
5.08      TERI was established on July 1, 1980 as an organization attached to
the Geonggi Open University. The Institute comprised four departments:
planning and management, training, education and research, and evaluation and
management. The Department of Planning and Management was in charge of
invitation to consultants and professional experts, promotion of policy
studies, operation of TERI, and promotion of research for technical educa-
tion. The Department of Training was responsible for domestic training of
professors, and planning and implementatiun of overseas training. The
Department of Education and Research was in charge of the development of
technician edu ation curricula. The Department of Evaluation and Management
conducted regular evaluation of technician education facilities and contents
of education, made recommendations subsequent to evaluation results, and
evaluated project planning under the Loan Agreement.
5.09      The main activities of the four departments were as follows:
(a) The Department of Planning and Management hired 16 consultants and
technical experts: four for consultation on the sector program,
eight for improvement of education, and four for electricity,
electronics and computer systems. Four were Koreans, nine from the
US, and six from England. Studies on policy issues conducted during
the project period included ways to upgrade junior technical
colleges in Korea in comparison with community colleges in the US
and polytechnics in the UK, revision of the Standard Equipment Lists
for laboratory and practical training at junior technical colleges;
and education-industry cooperation. It also conducted accreditatior
on junior technical colleges.
(b) The Department of Education and Training organized in-country and
overseas training for some 3,456 professors of junior technical
colleges and open universities. The purpose of their training
included studying the most advanced techniques in their fields,
acquiring ability to develop educational materials, management and
operation of an effective instruction and learning process, and
learning about technical education in advanced countries. The
number of trainees is giv-n in Table 5.5

(c) The Department of Education and Research was responsible for the
development of curricula, and the second for development of
curricula, textbooks, and modules. It organized a symposium for the
development of curricula.
Through 107 case studies from 1981 to 1983, it developed the curricula for
welding, automobile, refrigerator, communication equipment, computer courses,
industrial chemistry, architecture, civil engineering, mechanical drawing,
solar energy, food industry, environment, liquidity, metallurgy, electrical
installation, ceramics, industrial design, communication, airport operation,
industrial installations, ship-building, metallic artworks, and railroad
equipment.  Text materials suitable for education at junior technical colleges
were also developed for 76 fields.
Recruitment of New Teaching Staff
5.11      The teaching staff for engineering, management, and technician
education were projected to triple from 3,900 in 1979 to 12,000 in 1986,
according to the IBRD Staff Appraisal Report. The criteria for recruitment of
new teaching staff at that time were that the increase of teaching staff to
12,000 was required for achieving student:teacher ratios of 21:1 for
engineering, 40:1 management, and 18:1 for technician courses.  As shown in
Table 5.6, these targets were not reached.  The deadline for achieving them
were revised to December 3', 1990 by an amendment letter tc the Loan Agreement
dated June 14, 1984. The reasons for the failure to achieve these ratios were
that the increase in teaching staff was only about 40Z of appraisal target
while enrollment increase exceeded original projections.

Expansion of Graduate Courses
5.12      One of the ways to produce new teaching staff was to expand graduate
courses and upgrade their quality. The numbers of new students and graduates
of master's and doctor's degree courses for engineering in 1980 compared with
those in 1984 are shown in Table 5.7.

5.13      Scholarships were awarded to graduate students of engineering as
part of quality upgrading of graduate education.  The number and amount of
scholarships awarded in 1980 and 1984 are shown in Table 5.8. The number of
scholarships was increased from 2,597 in 1980 to 3,548 in 1984 and the amount
of scholarship per student was increased from W 291,000 in 1980 to W 390,000
in 1984.

Improvement of Staff Qualifications
5.14      To upgrade the quality of teaching, staff of engineering,
management, and technician courses were encouraged to acquire higher
degrees. The academic qualifications of professors at project institutions in
1980 and 1985 are shown in Table 5.9. The goal was to increase the proportion
of professors of engineering education with doctor's degrees to 43Z of total
teaching staff by 1986, but as of March 1985, the ratio achieved was 53.9%.
The goal for teaching staff with masters' degrees at junior technical colleges
was 702, but as of March 1985 the proportion was 862.

In-service Training for Professors
5.15      One indication of the quality improvement of teaching staff is that
research publications in the engineering field conbpicuously increased during
the p1gpect period, and some have been published in international periodi-
cals.    Research projects conducted by professors in project institutions
increased from about 1,900 in 1980 to 13,000 in 1984.
Placement of Graduates
5.16      Graduates from colleges of engineering may be placed in industry,
public organizations, military service, or graduate education programs. The
employment of graduates in 1980 compared with that in 1984 is shown in Table
5.10. The employment ratio of graduates, including those who were recruited
to the military service or advanced to higher institutions, was 84.4Z in 1980
and 78.3Z in 1984 in the case of engineering education. The reason for the
lower employment ratio was that the number of engineering graduates increased
by 72X during the period. At the same time, the economy was depressed. The
employment of graduates from junior technical colleges increased from 81.9Z in
198L to 84.8Z in 1984. These results are obtained at the time of graduation.
Undoubtedly employment could be higher following a period of job search.

5.18      Availability of Laboratory and Workshop Equipment (Table 5.12).  The
ratio of availability of laboratory and workshop equipment in national
colleges of engineering to requirements by MOE increased from 20.81 in 1980 to
64.71 in 1984. In private colleges of engineering, the ratio increased from
31.41 in 1980 to 67.51 in 1984.  In all the colleges of engineering, national
and private, the ratio increased from 271 in 1980 Lo 66.51 in 1984.
5.19      The ratio of availability of laboratory and practice equipment at
national and public junior technical colleges, improved from 181 in 1980 to
981 in 1984, and of private junior technical colleges from 34.41 in 1980 to
73.51 in 1984. For all the junior technical colleges, national, public and
private, the ratio was raised from 29.4% in 1980 to 81.7% in 1984.



- 60 -
5.20      In 1980, the goal to be achieved by the project institutions in
acquiring laboratory and workshop equipment under the project was set at 70X.
The ratio at junior technical colleges reached 81.71, but that at colleges of
engineering reached 66.5%. The cause of the shortage at engineering colleges
was that the admission of engineering students suddenly increased by 301 in
1981 from 1980 and demand for education facilities subsequently increased.
The higher enrollment was due to the chang /from the student admission quota
system to a graduate quota system in 1981, l   The sector program was prepared
on the basis of the student admission quota system established in 1978.

Operation of a Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center
5.21      The number of unusable items of laboratory equipment imported under
the 1st to the 5th IBRD education loans has increased. In January 1983, the
Ministry established the Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center attached to the
Gyeonggi Open University to:
(a) Provide technical services and information on equipment repairs;
(b) Ensure regular inspection and maintenance of laboratory and workshop
equipment; and
(c) Develop parts which cannot be produced in the country.
The Ministry purchased 209 units of 48 kinds of equipment with $130,000 from
the loan proceeds for the establishment of this center. The number of
institutions which benefited from this repair center reached 148 industrial
high schools, and 86 institutions of technical and college education, totaling
up to 234 institutions as shown in Table 5.13.

5.23      The Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center faces the following diffi-
culties:
(a)  shortage of repair specialists;
(b)  insufficient knowledge of operation;
(c)  no job security for repair specialists; and
(d)  shortage of funds for repair.
To solve these problems, the Center has proposed to increase the number of
repair specialists from the current 5 to 44 persons, and to upgrade their
quality through training. The fields requiring additional recruitment of
professional repair experts are measuring equipment, material tests, shaping
and cutting, heat handling equipment, repair of fitting apparatus, computing
machinery, communication equipment, electronics and electrical equipment,
chemical analysis equipment, optical equipment and surveying equipment. About
one to six repair specialists are needed for each field.
Training System of Higher Technical Manpower
5.24      For development and adaptation of new technology, a new dimension of
engineering is required in the research, design, and production procedures.
The ratio of technologists in the industrial workforce is expected to increase
from 2.9Z in 1978 to about 5Z in 1991. The sector program has laid the
foundation for a new system to train higher technical manpower. National
universities now have quality programs in the fields of electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineerirg, and architectural
and civil engineering. The junior technical colleges curricula and syllabi
have been changed to produce better intermediate technicians.



- 63 -
Improvement of Graduate Education and Research
5.25      Laboratory equipment imported under the loan has contributed much to
graduate education and professors' research activities.  A number of research
publications have been issued in the engineering field since the start of the
sector program, and papers have been discussed at international academic meet-
ings. This phenomenon is evidence of the improved research among professors.
Strengthening Education-Industry Cooperation
5.26      Engineering students are to receive practical training in industries
for certain periods of time according to the Law of Industrial Education
Promotion passed recently. The purpose is to facilitate students' adaptation
to emiploy-sent. Cooperation in research anld development between colleges and
industry has also increased through the improved research capability of
universities.
6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Conclusion
6.01      One of the main purposes of the program was to upgrade the quality
of the teaching staff. Some 472 professors of engineering education underwent
overseas training, and 106 overseas Korean scholars were repatriated. In man-
agement education, 139 professors were trained overseas and 82 students were
sent overseas for future professorships. At junior technical colleges,
448 professors were sent overseas for training. This volume of overseas
training reached the original plan of the sector program.
6.02      The ratio of professors with postgraduate degrees increased on a
large scale. In colleges of engineering in 1980, the ratios were 39.4% and
50.6% for doctor's and master's degrees respectively. These ratios improved
in 1985 to 53.9% and 42.7% for doctor's and master's degrees respectively. In
the case of junior technical colleges, the ratios of 0.3% and 54.2% for
doctor's and master's in 1980 improved to 2.6% and 86% in 1985 respectively.
6.03      Regarding recruitment of teaching staff, the student:teacher ratios
in 1985 compared with those in 1980 did'not advance as originally projected.
The main cause was the change in the student quota system, which was changed
to the graduate quota system from the admission quota system during the proj-
ect period, resulting in a 30% increase in new admissions.
6.04      The availability ratio of laboratory and workshop equipment
increased greatly through the sector program. For engineering education, it
increased from 27.0% of requirements in 1980 to 66.5% in 1985, and for techni-
cian education, it increased from 29.4% in 1980 to 81.7% in 1985.
6.05      The covenants under the Agreement were accomplished.  They included
processing of subprojects, improving the Committee for Manpower Development
and Promotion, preparing proposals for a flexible student allocation system
for higher technical education, establishing a technician education research
center, reducing student:teacher ratios, reporting audits on accounting of
project costs, and support to private institutions.



- 64 -
Recommendations
6.06      About 85% of the loan proceeds was disbursed for the purchase of
laboratory equipment and 15% was for training of teaching staff and develop-
ment of curricula. While good quality equipment has been imported, little
effect is expected without training of teaching staff. Prior to procuring
equipment, teaching staff should be recruited and trained.
6.07      To achieve maximum use of high-priced items of equipment imported
under education loans, they should be pooled by institutions for common use
among departments. Operation and repair experts should be allocated and the
budget for operation should be increased.
6.08      Measures should be taken to maintain equipment to avoid breakdowns
and shortage of spare parts. Since the Mobile Equipment Repair Center exists
already, these problems may be resolved through a large-scale improvement of
the Center.
6.09      Korea has increased its higher education enrollment to the same
level as advanced countries. There have been, however, constraints to the
growth of education, in quality as well as in quantity, due to shortages of
teaching staff, rapid enrollment increase, and poor conditions of education
facilities. The sudden quantitative growth of higher education may have been
in response to the growing social demand for higher education, but it failed
to meet the demand for quality manpower and might lead to social and
individual waste of resources. The long-term purpose of higher education
should be, therefore, aimed at improving the quality of education in order to
supply the required high quality manpower.
6.10      Korea has entered into the world society of industrial advancement
in the 2000s. Demand for research manpower in the fields of science and
technology will increase from 32,000 in 1983 (8 to 10,000 population) to
150,000 in 2001 (30 to 10,000 population), the level of the advanced
countries. For development of science and technology manpower, the following
points should be stressed:
(a) To widen the base of science and technology, substantial
improvements in basic science and technology curricula should be
made beginning with elementary and secondary education.
(b) The quality of engineering education at the undergraduate level
should be upgraded through training of teaching staff and expansion
of support for modern laboratory equipment.
(c) The production of higher technology manpower should increase to
support the development of advanced technology such as electronics,
computer systems and genetic engineering.
(d) Graduate education should be promoted. Research professorships
should be expanded for strengthening R and D capability at graduate
schools, and investments to support research institutes attached to
universities should increase.



- 65 -
6.11      MOE has been implementing the 2nd Bank-financed sector loan project
(Loan No. 2427-KO) since 1984 as part of its effort to upgrade the quality of
science and technology education. The Project is expected to contribute to
the improvement of science and technology education through carrying out the
experimental secondary education programs, upgrading the quality of teaching
staff at colleges of natural sciences and colleges of engineering, and
providing laboratory equipment.
6.12      For a leading role in research and development, and education in the
fields of science and technology: (a) high caliber manpower must be trained
to generate innovations in science and techrnology; (b) the supply of labora-
tory equipment for higher education institutions should be expanded through
continued investments; and (c) efforts should be directed toward upgrading the
quality of teaching staff and their recruitment.
6.13      Investments should be increased for promotion of education at
graduate schools and research programs ir the advanced science areas which
have so far been comparatively neglected.

PART II - BANK OBSERVATIONS
KOREA
SECTOR PROGRAM ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION (LOAN 1800-KO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.        The Bank's first education sector loan can be distinguished from
traditional project loans by the impact it has achieved on the entire
sector. While previous Bank financed projects in Korea show benefits to
individual project institutions, the sector loan show wider-sweeping
effects. The accreditation system established has extended beyond the tech-
nical fields supported by this sector program. The Korean Council of
University Education (KCUE) established in 1984 has now taken over the
accreditation function and will conduct evaluation on all university depart-
ments. Another evidence of sector-wide impact is the junior technical college
system. The colleges were founded around 1979 to train technicians for
industry. At the time, industry was only beginning to recognize the role of
the technician as an important link between the engineer and worker. The
colleges had teaching programs adapted from universities with no clear defini-
tion of the skill requirements of technicians. The project has given clearer
definition to the content and role of this subsector.
2.        The sector loan is able to achieve broad results because it
addresses policy issues that affect the entire sector. This section would
give the Bank's view of the extent to which policy objectives were attained,
the implementation of subprojects and the institutional framework, and draw
from them the lessons learned.
Policy Objectives and Outcome
3.        Flexibility.  A central aim of the program is to introduce more
flexibility into the planning and management of higher technical education in
order to allow the system to respond more quickly to changes in labor market
demand. Means to achieve this included; establishing a permanent capacity
for manpower analysis, replacing the centrally controlled quota system with
one that enhances transfers between departments, deferring early specializa-
tion in favor of broad general training, and introducing in-service and
retraining programs.
4.        A major achievement under this objective was the creation of a per-
manent manpower planning agency under the Economic Planning Board. The Man-
power Development Committee is a coordinating body for monitoring manpower
supply and demand information. It consists of the relevant agencies such as
the Ministries of Labor, Science and Technology and Education and several re-
search institutes such as the Korean Development Institute. The committee is
responsible for overall coordination of manpower development plans and projec-
tion of manpower demand and supply and employment policies. The Ministry of
Education determines college admission quotas in consultation with this man-
power planning body. The EPB has also established since 1984 a Manpower
Coordinating Division as staff for manpower development planning and analysis.



- 68 -
5.        With respect to the introduction of greater flexibility to higher
education management, the results were mixed. In July 1980, the Government
established a set of education reforms in reaction to the political crisis and
economic downturn of that period. To absorb some of the unemployed high
school graduates, the Government expanded admission by introducing the
graduate quota system in the 1981/82 scbool year. Instead of determining the
number of admissions for a certain year, the graduiLte quota system dictates
the number of output. To allow for dropout, universities had to admit more
than the quota. MOE set the dropout rate at 30% for universities and 15% for
junior technical colleges. The result was that universities had to admit 130%
of the quota and the junior technical colleges, 115%. The sudden increase in
enrollment had several adverse effects including: (a) an aggravation of
shortages of facilities and other resources; (b) a forced dropout rate of 30%
in universities and 15% in junior technical colleges which are about double
Lhe natural dropout rate; (c) increased barriers to transfers between depart-
ments. However, central control of student admissions has since been relaxed
and universities now have more autonomy in allocating admissions by college
and department.
6.        Besides satisfying social demand for higher education, the graduate
quota system also served the purposes of normalizing secondary education and
spurring university students to work harder. In the late 1970s, the mode of
teaching and learning in secondary schools was influenced by acute competition
for univer -ty admission. In order to attain a high score at the national
entrance examination, students concentrated on a few subjects and learning by
rote was common. The Government regarded this as unhealthy and was concerned
with the inequality of opportunity for higher education. Employment of
private tutors was rampant but such practice benefitted only those who could
afford it. Therefore, the Government expanded admission through the graduate
quota system. The high failure rate dictated by the system was also part of
the Government's strategy to make university students work harder.
7.        The side effects of this policy, however, have forced the Government
to modify it. Universities are now allowed to reduce admission between 110-
130% of the quota. Enrollment in colleges of engineering peaked at about
136,000 in 1982 and declined bJ 6% to about 127,000 in 1983 and further to
126,000 in 1985. The Government has declared a freeze on university enroll-
ment in the future. The balance between science and engineering and the
humanities and social sciences, however, will change. Currently, the ratio of
science and engineering students to those in the humanities and social
sciences is 40% to 60%. The goal is to reverse this ratio by 1991, which
means science and engineering enrollment would increase while that in other
fields would decline.
8.        A remedy fo, the adverse results of the graduate quota system was
the conversion of six junior technical colleges into open universities. These
universities provided opportunities of continuing education for students
forced to drop out because of the graduate quota system and for graduates of
junior colleges. They also became a place for retraining of industrial
workers. Admission to these universities is based on the applicant's school
and work records and not on the national entrance examination score. The
universities also have greater flexibility in determining admissions and
transfers between departments. Their establishment was a step in the direc-
tion of the policy objective of the loan.



- 69 -
9.        Quality Improvement.  The emphasis of the program was to improve the
quality of higher technical training by establishing accreditation agencies,
adapting teaching programs to industrial requirements, increasing the supply
and improving qualifications of teachers and providing more laboratory equip-
ment.
10.       The accreditation system that evolved out of the sector program
succeeded in evaluating programs against established training standards, but
the enforcement of these standards was not as successful. Firstly, institu-
tions have few incentives to accept accreditation. After evaluating a
college, an accreditation agency sends the report to the institution, pointing
out strengths and weaknesses and giving recommendations for improvements.  The
results cannot be publicly announced because of social and political sensi-
tivities. In the case of junior technical colleges, the evaluation results
are used to determine annual budget allocations.  Thus these colleges have
more incentive to comply with recommendations of the accreditation agency. In
the case of universities, however, evaluation results are reflected only in
allocation of research funds for professors. Universities had no strong
incentive to comply. Compliance has been based more on desire on the part of
the management to maintain the prestige of an institution.  A second obstacle
was the lack of funds and manpower to carry out a thorough study of the char-
acteristics of an institution.
11.       Despite the above problems, the evaluation carried out by the
j         accreditation boards provided a stimulus for improvement among the colleges.
Following completion of the sector program, the accreditation functions of the
boards have taken over by the KCUE for universities and the Nonformal and
Vocational Education Bureau for junior technical colleges. The KCUE is an
association of 111 colleges and universities to promote autonomy and public
accountability in university management and to develop higher education. Its
functions include conducting evaluation of universities, workshops and
seminars on curriculum and teacher education, and studies on university
management, and providing advice and recommendations to the Government on
higher education issues.
12.       Overall. the program's qualitative impact is most apparent in the
development of ju..ior technical colleges, particularly in curricula. The
Technical Education Research Institute has developed a number of teaching
modules and provided seminars for more than 3,000 teachers on new teaching
materials and methodology on how to develop modules. Cooperative programs
with industries have been established and Co le.aep are required by law to
provide one to three months of on-the-job training for students.
13.       Quality improvement in colleges of engineering was achieved mainly
by the increased availability of laboratory equipment, enabling students to
conduct experiments which were not possible before. However, the amount of
time spent on laboratory work varies among colleges and the MOE does not
impose a minimum. The only MOE guideline on teaching programs is that 30% of
the credits should be in general courses outside the engineering fields.  In
the colleges visited by the Bank's completion mission, the credit requirements
for basic science and engineering have increased to about 40% in accordance
with appraisal targets. The curriculum models developed by Korean Engineering
Education Board have been disseminated to the colleges, but there is no follow
up on their adoption. The supply of staff increased by 115% and improvements



- 70 -
in staff qualifications exceeded appraisal target. However, the rapid
increase in student enrollment has reduced the impact of these achievements
and the student-teacher ratio remains high (Part I, para. 5.2). The ratio in
colleges of engineering for instance is currently 36:1, compared with the
appraisal target of 21:1. The date for achieving the target ratio has been
adjusted to December 1990. The second Education Sector Loan (Ln. 2427-KO)
contains an action program for achieving this ratio, with interim targets for
mid-term review in 1987.
14.       In business management, the overseas training of new teachers and
local in-service training are the major accomplishments. About 15 PhD
graduates out of 90 fellows have returned and have been instrumental in intro-
ducing new courses and revising curricula. The full impact of this component
would not be apparent until the return of all the other participants within
t'd next few years. However, as with engineering, efforts to improve the
quality of education in this field were impeded by a doubling of enrollment in
1981.
15.       Investment in Private Education.  A third objective of the sector
program was to lessen the investment gap in private higher technical education
by channelling sector loan as well as additional government funds into private
institutions and studying the feasibility of raising student fees.
16.       This objective has been met:  about 58Z of the loan for subprojects
were channelled into private institutions, in addition to other government
financial assistance in the form of subsidies, commercial loans arranged by
the MOE and assistance in interest payment (Part I, para. 3.26). The Govern-
ment regulates student fees by imposing a ceiling on the annual increase in
order to maintain the increase no higher than the overall rise in the cost of
living. Government policy in the sixth five-year plan (1987-91) is to con-
tinue this practice. To assist private institutions in raising revenues dur-
ing the next five years, it plans to establish a foundation for private insti-
tutions consisting of government contributions, commercial loans and donations
amounting to Won 150,000 million. The Government passed a law recently,
granting tax exemption on contributions to private education.
Implementation of Sector Program
17.       Institution-Building.  One of the purposes of a sector loan is to
build up the borrower's capacity to develop and appraise projects. Although
disbursements had a slow start because of the novelty of the procedures, the
pace of implementation picked up rapidly during the second year of the
project. The procedures for the processing of subprojects -- from preparation
by the institutions to appraisal by the MOE and final approval -- have been
successful. The same mechanism is being used under the second sector loan and
has been a reference for sector loans in other countries.
18.       Criteria and Guidelines for Loan Allocation.  MOE selected the sub-
projects according to the criteria and guidelines agreed with the Bank. They
were found to be useful and valid.
19.       Equipment Procurement.  Following approval of a subproject by MOE,
each university contacted OSROK directly for procurement. According to EFB,
equipment items could not be grouped for bulk procurement because the timing



- 71 -
of the subprojects was different and each institution wrote its own specifica-
tions. As a result, many small contracts were signed, giving rise to a
formidable amount of paperwork. The Bank's loan department had to process
more than 3,000 payments, some of which were less than US$100. In the second
sector loan, the establishment of the special account has resolved this
problem for the Bank. However, the burden of disbursement against numerous
contracts now falls on the implementing agencies.
20.       Fellowship Program.  Administration of the fellowship program was
separate from that of the subprojects which focussed on hardware. The engi-
neering board, for example, was responsible for implementing the fellowships
program for engineering colleges. It took into consideration the plan for
faculty development included in each sibproject application and allocated 100
fellowship slots a year in proportion to the number of professors in each
institution. Two problems arose from such allocation. Firstly, the distribu-
tion was not based on the needs of the college but on the status quo. This
gave rise to the criticism that the national universities received more slots
because most of them had larger teaching staff. Secondly, the provision of
equipment and staff training were not carried out as parts of a coordinated
program. For instance, staff requirements for operating and maintaining
equipment were neglected, causing problems described in Part I, para. 3.29.
Bank Performance
21.       The approach to project supervision adopted by the Bank differed
from that for a standard project loan. According to procedures specified in
the staff appraisal report, subproject processing only required Bank prior
approval for subprojects in excess of US$2.5 million. Other subprojects as
well as procurement procedures were reviewed by Bank staff on the basis of
random ex post review. Supervision focussed to a greater extent on policy and
institutional changes as measured by project indicators that were agreed with
the implementation unit on the occasion of the first supervision mission.
Morover, formal discussion of policy and institutional changes was held once a
year as part of a joint annual review. Covernment prepared detailed reports
in advance of their annual review that served as the basis for discussions. A
major point of difference with Government from the outset of project implemen-
tation was the rapid increase in enrollments that occured with ther shift to a
graduate quota system. Views of both sides only converged when enrollment
growth was reined in during the final three years of project implementation
and when it was agreed that the targets for student teacher ratios should be
adjusted to coincide with the framework and time horizon of the Second Sector
Loan approved on May 1984. For the Bank this broader focus of project super-
vision provided opportunity for dialogue on a sector-wide basis even if points
of view of Government and Bank staff did not always coincide.
Lessons Learned
22.       Student-teacher Ratio.  The loan agreement contained a covenant on
the target student-teacher ratios. When the Government failed to meet these
ratios by the stipulated dates, the agreement was amended to reflect the new
deadlines for meeting those targets that corresponded with the agreed frame-
work for the Second Sector Loan. This ratio, however, should not have been
singled out as the sole indicator on project outcome.  The role of part-time
teachers employed from industries, class size or contact hours between teach-



- 72 -
ers and students, qualifications of teaching starf, research budgets are other
dimensions of quality that are not captured in a single ratio. Placing it in
the loan agreement has also given it too much prominence and not enough atten-
tion to other indicators of equal importance. The second sector loan has
taken this lesson into account. The target student-tescher ratio was men-
tioned in the SAR and the Government's policy letter but was not made a loan
covenant. The second loan also contains a number of other project outcome
indicators which would provide a multi-faceted evaluation of the program's
impact. They include the number of full-time staff, recruitment and attri-
tion, the number of part-time staff and their full-time equivalent, average
number of experiments performed, and whether advice of accreditation agencies
has been provided to and taken into account by colleges.
23.       Project Processing Time.  The elapsed time between appraisal and
board presentation was 485 days compared with a regional average of 319
days. This was necessary because a sector program required a thorough review
of the issues and policy alternatixes that would affect the entire sector.
The nature of sector work, preparation and appraisal is also different from a
traditional project. For preparation of the sector program, the Government
organized four study teams to identify the (evernment's policy directions and
to make comprehensive analyses and proposals in the fields of manpower supply
and demand, engineering education, management education and technician train-
ing. Appraisal was carried out in two stages, about six months apart, focuss-
ing oa broad policy issues and the overall project framework. Appraisal was
complicated because the sector review and subsequent work had not provided
sufficient analysis on a number of vital aspects such as the Government's
policies on enrollment expansion. Although a sector program inherently
requires more time to prepare, the process could have been shortened if the
kind of policy analysis needed was foreseen from the start of sector work.
24.       Accreditation.  The accreditation system has succeeded in setting
atandards but it does not have the mechanism to enforce them or provide incen-
tives to institutions to reach those standards. MOE should explore m-'ns to
improve the system under the second sector loan which finances accreditation
for science and technical fields. The evaluation results, for instance, can
be used in the allocation of budget or subsidies to institutions.
25.       Implementation Procedures.  Although MOE took precautions to prevent
delays, such as testir.g out implementation procedures on five subprojects
before negotiations, the program still experienced delays during the first
year. In the second loan, the procedured were improved to accelerate imple-
mentation, including appointment of technical teview committees and processing
of subprojects well in advance of the effective date of the loan. Some delays
have still occurred. lhis highlights the importance of bringing the Govern-
ment's subproject appraisal further upstream in the project cycle, particu-
larly the preparation for equipment procurement.
26.       Equipment Maintenance.  The Government has organized a unique system
for laboratory equipment maintenance which would be useful experience for
other countries. This system contains three elements: (a) minor repairs
would be carried out by the colleges themselves; (b) repairs on precision
equipment would be done by a research laboratory under the Ministry of Science
and Technology; and (c) major repairs on other equipment would be done by the
Mobile Equipment Maintenance Center attached to Gyeonggi University (see



- 73 -
Part I, para. 5.21). The center is funded by MOE, which plans to establish it
as a permanent organization and expand its capacity within the next few years.
