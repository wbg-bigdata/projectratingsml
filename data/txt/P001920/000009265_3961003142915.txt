MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEMATION OF TIM PRESIDENr
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MAURITIUS
F'OR AN EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Mauritius for the equivalent to US$20.0 million to help finance an education sector
development project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    Countr Economic Backgmnd,    Mauritius owes its economic success of the 1980s to
the tenacity with which it pursued structural re'orms to eliminate severe domestic and external
imbalan=es and create a favorable macroecoLlomic environment. Strong fiscal incentives for
investments in non-traditional exports enabled the private sector to take advantage of the economic
upturn in the industrial countries in the mid-1980s and reap full benefits from the preferential trade
arrangements Mauritius, as an ACP country, has with the European Community (EC) for its sugar
and garment exports Iin the fartework of the Lome Convention. The impetus for growth came
primarily from the rapid expansion of employment in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) industries
(garments and textiles) using labor-intensive technologies. Growth in employment grew rapidly,
outpacing the number of new entrants, including women, to the labor market. lhus, within the 1980
decade, the economy was able to completely absorb the surplus labor and was transformed into a fill-
employment economy, with frictional unemployment of only about 2 percent. The rate of growth
of the EPZ industries' output averaged 10 percent per annum in the 1980s, and GDP grew at an
average rate of 7 percent per annum.
3.    However, the economic environment at home and abroad is changing rapidly. 'Te EC is
under considerable pressure to reduce agricultural subsidies and market protection. This in tur would
reduce the favorable prices Mauritius obtains for its sugar exports to the EC and the trade preferences
enjoyed under the Lome Convention. Mauritius' textile and garment exports to the EC could lose
a considerable advantage over Far Eastern competitors such as Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan.
Mauritius' heavy dependence on the preferential trade arrangements with the EC underscores the
fragility of its success. IS exports are overly concentrated in garment products and in the EC
markets, and a high proportion of its exports is in the low end of the market in which Mauritius'
competitiveness has been eroding due to wage hikes that have outpaced increases in productivity.
The foremost challenge for Mauritius is to achieve productivity increases through technology and
skills enhancement, for which sound basic education is a prerequisite. Upgraded technology and
skills will enable Mauritius to shift to high-valued, quality exports, and break into the upper-end of
the international market. A determining factor in this regard is the quality of the labor force, its
education level, and the level of technology.
4.    Sector ftacgrod.  Over the past decade, Mauritius has made impressive progress in
developing its education system, both quantitatively and qualitatively, but much remains to be done
to reach the level of performance achieved by East Asian competitors. Today, for example, universal
primary education has for all practical purposes been achieved, with 97% of the 6-11 year age group
enrolled; education is free at all levels, including university; teaching and learning materials are
available to an teachers and students; and curricula are reguiarly updated o take the needs of a
changing economy into account. Parents actively contribute to the educational process, through
parent-teacher associations (PTAs) and community involveme-A, and by financing private tuition.
However, Maritius' education system is far from what is required to propel the country into a new



2
phase of economic development. The workforce has a mean educational attainment of only 6.9 years
of schooling, compared with about 9.0 years in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong. The six-year
primary education cycle, enrolling about 97 percent of the 6-12 year age group, is the terminal point
for about one-third of children. Secondary enrollment, at 48 percent of the age group, again low
compared with Korea (83 percent) or Singapore (80 percent), has remained stagnant because of high
repeater and dropout rates and inadequate capacity. Higher education enrolls only 1.5 percent of the
age group in a small undergraduate program, compared with 12 percent and 6 percent in Korea and
Singapore respectively; poor instructional quality and inadequate facilities encourage flight to
offshore education.
5.    About 80 percent of secondary school students attend private schools. However, the qLality
of education provided by these private secondary schools is considerably lower than that provided by
state schools, due to lower levels of funding, poor physical conditions, lower-qualified teachers, and
lack of specialized facilities such as laboratories and libraries. Many of these schools operate in
rented quarters, where owners are unwillling or unable to upgrade the physical conditions or expand
enrollment capacity.
6.    A number of factors adversely affect the quality of education. Three-fourths of primary and
secondary teachers have inadequate teaching skills. The curriculum is not enough geared to the
acquisition of skills in science and mathematics.  A rigid examination system  encourages
memorization of facts rather than the ability to analyze and solve problems. At the post-secondary
level, the poor quality of science, engineering and technology programs encourages students to opt
for liberal education programs. The current situation is partally the result of relatively low financing
levels for education: public expenditure on education declined from S.1 percent to 2.8 percent of
GNP between 1980 and 1990. But this situation has been corrected since. Allocation between 1990-92
was about 3.3 percent. Between 1993-98, it is expected to be in the range of 3.5 to 3.7 percent of
the GNP. Private sector expenditures on education have also been deciining because of inadequate
ftnancial incentives for owners of private schools, while the highly centralized system of education
management has led to poor communication and weakened accountability of school principals for
delivering quality education. In an effort to address these problems, in 1991, the Government has
completed an Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP) and an accompanying Education Sector
Investment Program (ESIP), with assistance and advice from the World Bank and UN agencies.
7.    Pjflect Objectives and Descriptlon. The project will assist the Government of Mauritius
in implementing its education development program for the period 1993-1998, as described in its
Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP). The main objective of the ESMP is to improve access to and
the quality of secondary education, with the specific target of increasing secondary enrollments by
15,000 students (17.5%) over the five-year period 1993-98. Secondary objectives include improving
the quality and efficiency of education at all levels, expanding tertiary education, and strengthening
education sector planning and management. To achieve these objectives, the project supports ESMP
policy measures to: (a) extend basic education from six to nine years by the year 2000; (b) increase
instructional time for science and mathematics in primary and secondary schools; (c) upgrade under-
qualified primary and secondary teachers; (d) reform student assessment, examination and testing
procedures; (e) decentralize educational administration and supervision to the regional levels; (t)
rationalize the development of tertiary education; and (g) develop the capacity of the Ministry of
Education and Science (MOES) for policy formulation, planning and programming.
8.    To support the above ESMP policy objectives, the project will finance a portion of the
Government's five-year (1993-98) core investment program (CIP) for the education sector. Financing
is in the form of a Sector Investment Loan, based on prior agreement on four key conditions: (a) a



3
comprehensive policy framework for the entire education sector; (b) an appropriate education sector
investment program (ESIP); (c) an expenditure program which supports both the policy framework
and the sector investment program; and (d) an intermediary institution which will manage and
coordinate program implementation.
9.    The project will support investments designed to:
Increase Access to and Promote Equity of Education through: (a) the rehabilitation of 25
dilapidated primary schools and construction of 13 new primary schools in underserved
regions; (b) the renovation of 21 state secondary schools and constructing 5 new secondary
schools, providing for 8,000 additionat student places; (c) the provision of financial support
to upgrade up to 55 private secondary schools and expand enrollment capacity by 7,000
student places; and (d) the expansion of enrollment capacity at the University of Mauritius
by about 2,000 student places.
Improve the Ouality of Education by: (a) funding the design and implementation of a national
system to assess student achievement; (b) supporting pre-service and in-service teacher
training; and (c) providing library materials and teaching aids.
Strengthen Education Sector Management by: (a) assisting the tertiary education commission
to prepare institutional development plans for higher education institutions; (u) establishing
an education management information system (EMIS); (c) support research to explore
alternative approaches for more effective, efficient and flexible dalivery of education; (d)
develop a viable institutional framework for a national schools inspectorate; and (e) establish
a network of regional education centers to provide educational support to schools at the
regional level.
10.  TEect Fhnancn,   'Me project will finance a five-year (1993-98) Core Investment
Program, comprising 14 projects with a total value of about US$78.7 million, all selected from the
Government's approved education sector investment program. The CIP projects are critical to the
successful implementation of the Education Sector Master Plan and the achievement of its objectives.
Proposed Bank financing, in the form of a sector investment loan of US$20 million, wiUl provide
about 25 percent of the estimated project costs, and finance about 55 percent of the foreign exchange
costs of selected civil works, instructional equipment and furniture, and training and technical
assistance. The Government of Mauritius will finance the remaining project costs, in particular civil
works, in a total amount of US$ 52.7 million. Other donors, including UNDP, UNESCO and
USAID, are expected to contribute about US$6.0 million for technical assistance and fellowships.
11.   Prjeet Implementation. Day-to-day management and implementation of each project
component will be carried out by designated units in the Ministry of Education and Science, the
Private Sector Schools Authority and the Tertary Education Commission. The Master Plan
Coordinating Unit (MPCU), within the MOES, will be responsible for coordination of project
acdvities, administrative and financial matters, monitoring project inputs and outcomes, inter-agency
coordination, and relations with the Bank. The project's policy measures are integrated in the various
components and will be implemented by the respective responsible units, with the MPCU providing
a monitoring and advisory function. The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period;
the loan would be disbursed over 6 years.
12.   Poeet Susinablitv. Takdng account of the projected decrease in primary enrollmens
and the expansion of secondary and higher education, and assuming the application of efficiency



4
measures such as improved student: teacher ratios, the annual increase in sector expenditures is
estimated at 5 percent per year in real terms. Assuming that the economy will grow at 5 percent
annually, and that the Goverment's recurrent budget will grow at the same rate, the share of the
education in the budget during the comint, decade should remain at the same level (about 11 to 12
percent)as during the past five years. In relation to the GNP, the total education expenditures are
projected to be in the range of 3.5 to 3.7 percent. The project is sustainable.
13.   Lessons from Previcos Bank Involvement. The first two education projects (Cr. 501-
MAS/Loan 1033-MAS, US$7 million, 1974; and Lr.1543-MAS, US$15 million, 1978), completed
in 1980 and 1986 respectively, provided support for primary, secondary, and post secondary
education, and rural and industrial trades training. The completion reports on both projects observe
that, in order to accommodate evolving Government's education policies and satisfy parental choices,
extensive changes ware made during implementation. For example, three year-junior secondary
schools were upgraded to five-year secondary schools, anu financing earmarked for rural education
centers was diverted to upgrade primary schools. Ihe key lesson is that a clear vision of a policy
framework in which institutional changes would be developed and investments defined, should be a
prerequisite for preject processing. The second lesson is that project design should be sufficiendy
flexible to accommodate the needs of a developing and changing economic environment. The third
lesson is that the project should refrain from supporting ewperimental and innovative activities for
which there it little commitment from parents. The proposed project takes these lessons into account
by obtaining at the outset a consensus on policies and programs, and by providing a flexible financing
mechanism.
14.   Rationale for 'lank Involvement.   The project is consistent with the Bank's country
assistance strategy. This strategy emphasizes economic diversity, productivity increase, and
continuing human resource development. The strategy gives high priority to the development of a
skilled labor force capable of meeting the needs of a growing and diversifying ma rig  and
service-based economy. To support this strategy, the Bank has maintained an active dialogue on
human resource development with the Government and has been closely associated with the
preparation of the ES1U by providing professional support and advice. The focus of the project
supports these objectives by expanding basic education to nine years, improving the quality of
education at all levels, and strengthening sector management and institutonal development. The
principal role will be to assist the Government in achieving constructive sector-wide policy dialogue,
sharpening the focus of investment programs, and fostering institutional development - the three
elements that constitute the principal thrust of this project.
15.   Agmmena, There are no pending issues. During meotiWiM, the Government provided
a draft program of assistance to private secondary schools; a draft operational plan of teriary
education; a final Education Sector Policy Letter; the composition and costs of a three-year
expenditure program; summary terms of reference for studies and major technical assistance
programs; dates and procedures for anmnal joint Government-Bank implementation reviews and the
midterm review; and a draft reorganization plan for the Ministry of Education and Science. A
QoniiQn.Qf disbursement for the tertiary-level education components will be the submission of a
Tertiary Education Development Plan, acceptable to the Bank.
16.   EnvIronmental Aspects.  This is a Category-C project, without any direct impact on the
environment. Schools and classrooms would be sited and constructed following design standards and
procedures that ensure environmental soundness, in conformity with strict environmental guidelines
set by the Government.



5
17.   Progm Objectives Caategorls  The project responds to the human resource development
objectives of the Government. Increasing access to basic education, primarily for children from rural
and underprivileged families, and promoting the teaching of sciences, mathematics and technology
improve opportunities for employment and income generation and higher living standards of the
population in general.
18.  lBenefits    Project benefits will be widespread. By establishing nine years of basic
education, the project will provide a larger and better-educated pool of secondary school graduates,
improve the quality and sophistication of the future labor force, and facilitate the transition of the
Mauritian economy to a higher level of productivlty. Policy measures supported by the project will
strengthen Government's capacity for policy formulation, planning, and program management,
enhance the development of rrivate sector education, and provide better opportunities for training in
science and technology.
19.   RL4&  There are two main risks. EiM, owners and managers of private secondary schools
may not borrow Government funds to improve and expand their facilities. This would not only
jeopardize Government's policy objectives of improved quality and enlarged capacity, it would also
force the Government to consider alternative ways of expanding enrollment capacity at the secondary
level. This risk is being addressed by providing owners of secondary schools with instructional
equipment and supplies free of charge under the project, provided that their facilities are expanded
and improved in a satisfactory way, based on mutually accepted criteria. $nd, while the four
tertiary education institutions may have reached consensus on a comprehensive development plan for
higher education, there is still a risk of continued duplication of certain programs and Inefficiencies
in resource use. In recognition of this risk, it has been agreed that a major outcome of the
rationalization of tertary education should be the integration of the Mauritius Institute of Education
into an enlarged university, either by transforming MIE into a full-fledgeJ Faculty of Education or
into a Department of Education within the University of Mauritius. The two minor institutions
(Mauritius College of the Air and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute) which have very limited
undergraduate programs, could remain as independent entities.
20.   &CmnMdatio             I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of
Agreement, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

PROJECTS IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT STATUS
Mauritius implementation performance of investment operations has traditionally matched the
high quality of its economic management. However, there has been some deterioration in
performance over the last two years. The focus of new operations became directed towards
more difficult institutional goals, often requiring for their achievement the cooperation of
various interest groups. For example, the preparation of the Industrial and Vocational
Training project was slow as it required close cooperation between the Government and the
private sector. In addition, the recently approved Sugar Energy Development project requires
the innovative collaboration of the public and the private sectors in the cogeneration of power
based on the use of bagasse. Here also, the risks of slow initial implementation are high.
Although the current level of performance is still high in the African context, the incipient
problem of a slowdown in implementation is one that will be watched in supervision work in
order that early solutions can be worked out to these delays arising from insufficient
collaboration among responsible agencies.
