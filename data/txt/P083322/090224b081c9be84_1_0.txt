                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making good progress towards removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks and improving environmental conditions in four medium-sized cities, Mianyang, Suining,
                         Yibin, Panzhihua, in Sichuan Province.

                         In Suining, all project related investments have been completed and provide improved access to the new development and urban expansion zone in Xining District.

                         In Yibin, both roads (Route A and B) and two bridges have been opened to traffic. Route A greatly improved connectivity between the old city, the Tianyuan District and the proposed
                         new Lingang Economic Development Zone. River embankments along Route B have been improved and include a widely used walkway, the road has also been westward from the
                         Cultural Square in the center of Nan An District and eventually connect to a new development zone planned towards the west of the city.

                         In Panzhihua, all roads were completed and opened to traffic, including bridges and tunnels, which have greatly reduced travel times and improved accessibility to new areas of the
                         city, thereby reducing congestion in the downtown area. The sewerage works have been completed and wastewater treatment collection and treatment volumes have increased.

                         All road investments in the Southern Economic Development Zone in Mianyang have been substantially completed and opened to traffic. The improved access and overall
                         infrastructure conditions have helped increase land sales and revenues. In Pioneer Park, most roads have been opened to traffic and have improved access, benefiting land sales.
                         The only ongoing construction is in the Xinglong Area, which were included as part of the restructuring of the project. These works are moving forward reasonably well, but
                         experienced some delays due to slow resettlement and land acquisition progress.
