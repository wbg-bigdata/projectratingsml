                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks and improving environmental conditions in the four second-tier cities (Mianyang, Suining, Yibin, Panzhihua) is well
                         underway, with construction of most investments completed in 2012.

                         In Suining, all contracts for the construction of various roads, bridges and drainage works have been completed or substantially completed. All these works are supporting improved
                         access and development of Xining District, as well as a related link road to a rail station.

                         In Yibin, both roads (Route A and B) and two bridges have been opened to traffic and have improved the transportation and promoted the development zone of Linggang Industrial
                         District.

                         In Panzhihua, all roads were completed and opened to traffic, including bridges and tunnels, which have greatly reduced travel times and improved accessibility to expansion areas of
                         the city, thereby reducing congestion in the downtown area, which was a major bottleneck. The works under the sewerage component experienced some technically challenging
                         construction but are all completed and treatment capacity has been increased, improving environmental conditions in the city.

                         Mianyang’s progress is somewhat lagging as a result of the impacts of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and resulting project restructuring in August 2011. All contracts in the
                         Southern Economic Development Zone have been substantially completed and opened to traffic. The improved access and overall infrastructure conditions have helped increase
                         land sales and revenues. In Pioneer Park, most roads have been opened to traffic and have improved access, benefiting land sales. The only ongoing construction is in the Xinglong
                         Area where works are moving forward, but are experiencing some delays due to slow resettlement and land acquisition progress.
