                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has been experiencing difficulties since the very beginning due to factors external to the project and outside the control of the implementing agency, such as
                         floods and a legal dispute both resulting in a total of 20 month delay in the project implementation. Earlier the Project implementation faced a legal dispute during recruitment of
                         supervision/implementation support consultants (ISC), who supervise, monitor and verify civil works to be completed under community-based contracts by Watercourse Associations
                         (WCAs). This has been since resolved and implementation started only in April, 2011 gaining momentum quickly. This component constitutes 97% of the total project costs.

                         Implementation was impeded once more by the unprecedented heavy rains and flooding in August - October, 2011 all over Sindh and in particular the project area under review. The
                         long duration and the lingering inundation of the project area only subsided in January/February 2012, and since then project implementation has picked up. As project closing is
                         nearing and due to these natural, external impediments to the implementation an extension of 15 months is envisaged to complete the ongoing work, with a reduced scope, under the
                         project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This ISR was prepared based on the Implementation Review Mission from April 16 - 25, 2012. The key decisions include:

                         Given the exceptional progress over the last 2.5-3 months including improved disbursements under the project, the implementation rating for the project was upgraded to
                         “Satisfactory? . The mission in January assessed and confirmed the time required to complete on-going works under the project is on target, therefore it is proposed that the project
                         closing date is extended for 15 months. In addition, the mission in discussion with Government of Sindh, given the proven benefits of improved watercourses for enhancement of
                         agriculture productivity and water use efficiency coupled with and the tremendous need and demand for the activity by the farmers, agreed on a long-term program in On-Farm Water
                         and Agriculture Productivity Enhancement Program. It was discussed that preparation of the first phase of this program would be carried out during the extended period of this
                         project using the project resources.
