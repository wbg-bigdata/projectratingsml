REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED IDAN TO THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A
LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of US$ 11.6 mil-
lion to help finance a livestock project. The loan would have a term of
21 years, including six years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.  Of the proceeds of the loan US$ 0.9 million would be relent to
Fonds National de D6veloppement Rural for 13 years, including 6 years of
grace, with interest at 5 percent per annum; and US$ 5.2 milliorn would be
relent to Soci6te de Developpement et d'Exploitation des Productions Animales
for 21 years, including 6 years of grace on principal repayments, with inter-
est at 7-1/14 percent per annum to be capitalized for 3 years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The renort "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon" (No. R 72-247)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27, 1972. An updating
mission visited the country in May/June 1973; its major findings are reflected
in the following paragraphs and Annex I contains country data. A basic economic
mission is planned for early FY 1975 to coincide with the preparation of
Cameroon's Fourth Development Plan (FY77-81).
Economic Potential
3.         Cameroon's natural resources are varied, although not abundant.
Its range of soils and climatic conditions permits cultivation of a large
number of crops and provides substantial agricultural potential. These
crops include oil palm and rubber in-the south, cocoa and coffee in the
central region, and rice, groundnuts, cotton and other sahelian crops in
the north. The forestry region of the southeast contains large untapped
timber resources,and the north, good potential far livestock.
L.         While the main opportunities for development lie in expansion
and diversification of agricultural production, Cameroon also possesses
valuable industrial potential. It consists not only of the production of
import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, but also of the
processing of local raw materials, particularly agricultural and forestry
products,for export.
5.         Commerce, transport, and transit services are important economic
activities. Cameroon is a big country with three main economic centers
(West, South,and North) separated by vast underpopulated areas. In
addition, the country serves as one of the main export routes for landlocked
Chad and CAR. An active transport sector is therefore vital to the development
of Cameroon, and considerable investments are needed to build or maintain
adequate port, road, and railroad infrastructure -- prerecquisites to



prcmoting agricultural and industrial developnment and to strengthening
the role of Cameroon as a regional trade center.
Past Performance
6.         During the first decade of independence (1960-70) the Government
has made serious efforts to lay the groundwork for accelerated economic
development and to step up the mobilization of financial resources for
this purpose. In spite of internal political difficulties during the early
1960's and of administrative constraints arising from Cameroon's top-heavy
federal structure, these efforts have been quite successful. During the
l196's GDP grew at an average rate of six percent a year and owing to
prudent financial policies the Government was able to finance a rising
proportion of public investment from domestic savings.
7.         The sectoral distribution of public investment corresponded
:airly well 'o the country's development requirements.   By far the largest
part of piblic investment was devoted to lifting the most immediate developmen'
constraint, nanely the shortcomings of the transport network. Conscious of
the lack of trained manpower at all levels, the Government also e-tphasized
the expansion and improvement of education. Numerous new schools were
opened, school enrollment soared and a beginning was made with the reform
of education. In agriculture, the Government promnoted crop diversification
through projects for rubber, oil palm, cotton   and rice and made a beginning
with the rehabilitation of existing coffee and cocoa acreage. In industry,
the Government's efforts were limited to providing financial support for
key projects and maintaining a liberal investment climate which led to an
increase in Frivate f reign investment and quick expansion of manufacturing
capacity, particularly in the field of import substitution.
8.         In the early 1970's economic growth slowed down because of declining
world prices for cocoa and coffee and a decline in foreign private investment.
In spite of the recession, Government managed to increase budgetary savings
through a boost in tax rates, improved tax collection and better expendi-ture
control. Public investment however rose even faster and the result was
drawdown of treasury reserves and an increase in external debt. With
an eatimated debt service ratio in 1973 of 8 percent, Cameroon's debt
problemns are still manageable, however. The increase in cocoa, coffee
and timber prices in 1973 has been leading to improvenents in government
finance and in the balance of payments, and a slight recovery of the reserve
position.
Prospects and Development Strategy
9.         Prospects f x further economic growth remain favorable, provided
the Government can come to grips with several structural problems which
have come to the fore in recent years and of which the Governmnent and foreign
development partners are increasingly aware. (i) In agriculture, which
will remain the rnainstay of the economy, more determined action should be
taken to bring financial and technical assistance within the reach of the



-3-
small farmers. The advantages of diversified climate and soil should make
it possible to achieve large output increases in almost all crops as well
as in livestock. The small farmers, who account for most of the country's
agricultural production, are however still largely unaware of improved
cultivation techniques and mostly use traditional, low-yielding production
methods. An agricultural survey by the Bank earlier this year therefore
recommended to the Government various specific measures concerning applied
research, extension services, supplies of inputs and agricultural credit.
On income distribution grounds, the survey recommends increased attention
to development possibilities in the backward northern plains and western
highlands which have a large, destitute population but reasonably good
agricultural and livestock potential. (ii) Even if rural development
efforts become more successful, rapid migration from the countryside to the
cities is bound to ccntinue. Cameroon's urban population is expected to
rise from 20 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in 1985. The main problem in
the cities will be to provide productive errployment, and to plan land
use for housing, infrastructure, and social services. The Government
intends to devote increased attention to migration and urban problems and
has asked the Bank for advice. In the industrial sector, a revision of
policies is necessary in order to restore foreign investors' confidence
which in recent years had suffered from slow and cumbersome procedures.
(iii) In spite of massive investments in recent years, the basic transport
infrastructure is still insufficient to meet the country's requirements.
The congestion of the Douala port is slowing down economic expansion,
particularly of forestry production. The Douala-Ya unde section of the
railroad requires major improvements and the road system needs to be adapted
to traffic growth and the development of new agricultural and forestry areas.
10.        To resclve these problems, action on two fronts is essential.
First, a strengthening of project preparation and implementation machinery,
and second, a mobilization of adequate domestic and external resources
for a fairly large public investment program.
11.        Considerable progress is being made on the first objective.   In 1972,
President Ahidjo's policy of national integration culminated in a successful
referendum which abolished the former federated states and replaced the
cumbersome federal structure by a unitary government. Within the new
structure, stronger economic ministries are being established to replace
the weak technical departments in each federated state; and within the new
ministries, the Government is trying to establish planning units for project
and policy formulation.
12.        Current efforts to achieve improvements in project preparation
and implementation are likely to have a very favorable impact on the organization
of rural development work and of the new Ministry of Agriculture; a special
fund for rural development (FONADER) has been created to promote agricultural
projects and rural development infrastructure. The changes taking place
in the government structure are likely to require a substantial increase
in foreign technical assistance. Although the Government will continue
to ensure for itself full control of final decisions, there is no reluctance
on its part to receive expatriate advice whenever appropriate.



13.        With respect to investment financing, the recent economic mission
concluded that an average yearly public investment spending of US' 130 million
would represent the minimum required to catch up with the backlog of
infrastructural investment and to support the 5 percent anmual GDP growth
rate deemed feasible by the mission. With continued prudent fl scal policies,
public savings should cover about 80 percent of the public investment.
However, external financing of about US' 100 million a year will be required
to allow for debt service and some rebuilding of reserves. Bilateral and
other sources outside the Bank Group are expected to contribute about three-
quarters of Cameroon's external aid requirements. The Bank Group's share
of Cameroon's external debt would rise to 32 percent as against 13 percent
at present. Service on Bank Group debt by 1979 would however amount to only
11   percent of Cameroon's total public debt service (as against the present
8 percent), which in turn is not expected to exceed 13 percent of projected
export earnings.
14.        Cameroon's ability to make effective use of external resources
and the Government's dedication to development are reasons far increased
external support. Although debt service is still low, it is rising rapidly
and will absorb an increasing share of gross public savings. Therefore,
Cameroon can make only a modest contribution to the financing of future
public investment. To avoid further rapid buildup of debt service, lenders,
including the B nk Group, should provide a large part of their assistance
on concessionary terms and also be prepared to finance a high proportion
of project costs including, as in the present project, a part of local costs.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS TN CAMEROON
15.        The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to US$ 130
million and cover ten projects: three in agriculture, four in transportation,
twjo in education and one in public utilities. Following recent approval of
a large loan/credit for the Second Highway project, transportation now repre-
sents the largest share (57 percent) of our past commitments followed by
agriculture (24 percent). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of January 31, 1974 and includes notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. Although delays and setbacks have been
occasionally encountered in the execution of the projects, the Government
has consistently showni willingness to collaborate with the Bank for the
determination and application of satisfactory solutions.
16.        For the future, the Bank Group's strategy is to support the
Governmnent in its efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to
accelerate rural development, and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's
institutions.
17.        Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investments to this sector. The Bank Group,
together with bilateral institutions, has substantially helped Government
develop adequate transport facilities. The recently approved Second High-
way project will help complete the establishment of the basic trunk road sys-
tem. Given sharp traffic increases and the backlog of required investments,
massive injections of capital will still be necessary in the years ahead,
particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala and the possible realign-
ment of the Douala-Yaounde line. An interim railroad project is likely to be
distributed for Board consideration shortly. Future road investments would
mainly be for road maintenance and feeder roads to provide links to local mar-
kets and facilitate exploitation of Cameroon's forests, a major area for
future development.
16.        In the past, we have been able to help the Government further diversify
agricultural production by financing its oil palm and rubber plantations in the
east and west, and rice irrigation in the north. Increased Bank Group
lending to agriculture will support the Government's increased efforts to
organize itself and focus on rural development in order to correct geographical
and economic imbalances in Cameroon's development (see Part III). In other
sectors, we are actively considering a first power generation and distribution
project, a first small-scale industries project, and a third education project
with special emphasis on rural education and training.
19.        In all our projects, we will as in the past include training, technical
assistance and other provisions to strengthen government institutions and
improve sector policies. Besides, through our economic work we will continue
to advise the authorities, at their request, on development questions in general,
and subjects such as economic management, problems of urban migration , and
manpower development in particular.

PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CAMEROON
20.        As in many other West African countries, the agricultural sector
dominates the Cameroonian economy. It provides a livelihood for 80 percent
of the population, accounts for about 40 percent of GDP and produces over
65% of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
21.        While two crops, cocoa and coffee, account for almost 80 percent
of the value of agricultural extoorts, Cameroon is making good progress in
diversifying its economy; past Bank Group loans and credits for agriculture have
supported Government efforts in this respect. In addition to cocoa and
coffee, bananas, palm products and some rubber are produced in the south, and
cotton in the north. Among food crops, rice production is expected to increase,
partly with Bank Group assistance. Forest exploitation also provides a large
source of income and foreign exchange. Agricultural production stems mainly
from many traditional smallholdings most of which are between one and three
hectares. The 30,000-ha CAMDEV estate (mainly oil palm and rubber) in the
west, and the 9,000-ha SOCAPAIM oil palm plantation in the east, are the two
largest industrial plantations. Both are state-owned and receiving Bank Group
assistance.
22.        Livestock consists mainly of beef cattle (2.5 - 3 million heads)
and accounts for about 9 percent of Cameroon's agricultural production. Cattle
are raised in northern Cameroon and the north-central Adamaoua plateau (see map)
mainly by nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen.   Annual meat production is
estimated at 75,000 tons 1/, equivalent to an average per capita consumption
of 12 kg. While most of the production is for the domestic market, two
foreign-owned ranching companies have managed to export 1,000 - 1,500 tons of
carcass meat annually to Gabon and Congo. Except for these foreign ranching
companies, cattle-raising in Cameroon has remained unchanged for centuries.
Nutritional deficiencies and poor animal health, especially as a result of
trypanosomiasis, largely account for the low productivity of the national herd.
Since graziers do not have secure land rights, they make no attempt to improve
pastures. Additionally, slaughtering and meat distribution facilities are
unhygienic.
23.        Investments in agriculture have so far been hampered by the
fragmented and weak government services responsible for project preparation
and implementation. Although the creation in 1972 of central Ministries of
Agriculture and Livestock, instead of the previously separated administrations,
is an improvement, these Ministries are not yet adequately staffed; furthermore,
a greater effort needs to be made to coordinate the responsibilities for
research and training, now the responsibility of several Ministries. Never-
theless, the Government has stepped up its efforts to centralize and coordinate
rural development, and has recently created a Fonds National de Developpe-
ment Rural (FONADER), to which it has appointed one of its top civil servants,
for this purpose.
24.        The Government's low interest rate policy has discouraged private
banks from financing agricultural development and agricultural credit has been
mainly the responsibility of Banque Camerounaise de D6veloppement (BCD) that
has lacked the staff and projects to make loans to private crop and livestock
producers.  However, with the creation of FONADER, the Government is expected
to devote more of its financial and personnel resources to the establishment
of a strong and viable credit and development institution for the rural sector.
j Including about 5,000 tons from animals i-mported from Chad.



-7-
25.        The Government's increased concern with rural development coincides
with our own efforts, supported by the conclusions of an agriculture sector
survey mission that visited Cameroon in May 1973, to improve income distri-
bution within the economy and within the sector, and especially to focus on
projects benefitting large numbers of poor rural people, preferably in the
more backward areas. Most of our future projects would meet several or all of
these criteria. Thus, the present project would benefit pastoralists and
farmers so far untouched by modern development; a cocoa rehabilitation and
planting project, recently appraised, is designed to help raise the
productivity of many cocoa smallholders; and an integrated rural development
project in the very populated but backward north is under consideration for
FY75. Furthermore, whereas the output of export crops has increased rapidly,
food crop production has increased less so, and meat production has at best
only kept pace with population growth. Yet rapid urbanization and changing
consumption patterns have created an increased demand for agricultural and
livestock products. Without increased domestic production, this growing
demand would have to be met from increased imocrts. The Government is
conscious of this and anxious to increase the production of domestic food as
well as to promote export crops. The proposed livestock project as well as
the cocoa and integrated rural development projects, will give support to
this policy.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Purpose
26.       Like many countries in Western Africa, Cameroon suffers a meat
deficit. Fortunrktely, however, it has good potential grazing lands for
livestock development and an already sizeable cattle herd. But production
even at present levels is threatened by tsetse fly infestations and cons-
trained by the unproductive traditional nomadic and seminomadic methods
employed by most cattle owners. Hence meat production is not keeping pace
with demand, and to maintain per capita beef consumption at presenlt low
levels would require production increases of about 5G percent by 1985.
27.       Government's main livestock development objective is to satisfy
Cameroon's beef requirements through increased domestic production. As a
subsidiary objective, Government plans to raise meat hygiene and minimize
waste by improving slaughter and retail butcher shop facilities in Yaound6
and Douala.  Government plans to assist livestock producers in two important
ways: first by helping them to intensify their grazing methods; and secondly
by safeguarding grazing lands for livestock through tsetse fly eradication.
While eradication campaigns have been successfully carried out in Nigeria
for over twenty years, means for intensifying production by traditional
pastoralists though proven elsewhere in Africa are largely untried under
West African conditions. Recognizing that changes in production systems
will involve risks and that innovations need to be tested to determine their
technical and financial feasibility as well as their social acceptability,
Government has prepared investment proposals for this purpose involving both
state and private sector ranch development.



28.       The proposed project, to be carried out over 197L-79, would support
Government's plans and would enable it to implement the first phase of its
livestock development program. It would comprise establishing and operating
three 20,000-ha state ranches and two slaughter plants, modernizing 12 butcher
shops, develooing livestock production on 150 private ranches and farms, and
eradicating tsetse flies from 800,000 ha of good pasture land. Societ6 de
D6veloppenent et d'Exploitation des Productions Animales (SODEPA) has recently
been established under the M'1inistry of Livestock to develop and operate the
state-owned ranches and slaughter plants; its general rnanager, technical
director, and financial controller would be appointed before the
loan becomes effective    (Section 8.01 (e) of the Loan Agreement), and a
number of key appointments would be made in agreement with the Bank (Section
3.05 of the Project Agreement). Fonds National de Developpement Rural
(FONADER) would provide credit for private ranch, farm and butcher shop
develooment, with assistance from SODEPA; for this it would emnloy agricul-
tural credit staff satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.03 (b) of the Loan
Agreement). The Ministry of Livestock would nlan and implement the tsetse
fly extermination camnaign. The Ministry would also administer funds for
training Cameroonians in livestock production and the nrenaratinn of further
investment DrrDosals for the livestock subsector.
29.       Except for limited veterinary coverage, support services for
livestock production have been neglected. To overcome this constraint,
the project would help to develop SODEPA as an institution to provide
technical services for livestock production, and would provide FONADER
with an early opportunity to take up its responsibilities through a
well-defined project. It would also introduce policy changes and technical
irnovations, and it must be considered a large scale pilot operation. The
risk involved in such a project is well justified, however, as without
these innovations, cattle production will stagnate. Moreover, the pro-
ject components have been designed to permit their early replication as
experience is gained in determining the most efficient means of adapting
modern tecnniques to local conditions.



-9-
30.      The project was identified by a PMWA mission *n September 1971,
prepared by consultants, and appraised in May/June 1973. The appraisal
report, Appraisal of a Livestock Development Project (No. 295-CM, dated
March 6,1974)is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Loan and Project Summary is in Annex III of this report. Negotiations
for a loan were held in Washington in February 1974 with a Cameroonian
delegation headed by Mr. Tchoungui, Cameroon's Ambassador to the United
States.
Detailed Features
State ranches and slaughter plants
31.      In addition to producing slaughter stock, the ranches to be
established and operated by SODEPA would provide breeding andi fattening
stock for private ranch development. They would be located, respectively,
in the northwest, center and east of Cameroon (see map), and would be
readily accessible to pastoralists in the leading cattle producing
areas of the country. They would test and demonstrate modern techniques
of animal production for later adoption by the private sector. The
three ranches would be stocked with zebu cattle to be purchased on the
local market and would carry 8,000 animal units each. They would be
developed in years 1, 2 and 4 of the project respectively. However,
no disbursements would be made for expenditures incurred (a) for the
establishment of the Faro ranch until the Bank has aDproved a plan for
the tsetse fly extermination campaign and the effective use of the
cleared areas, and (b) for the establishment of the Ndokayo ranch until
the Government and the Bank have agreed on the conditions under which
the ranch would be profitable (Schedule 1, para 3 (b) and (c) of the
Loan Agreement).  The slaughter plants to be established in Yaounde
and Douala would have a peak hourly capacity of 25 cattle andt 2?5 small
stock, ana would meet international standards for hygiene; the two
existing facilities are unhygienic and unsuitable for modernization
or for expansion and they would be closed.
Tsetse fly extermination
32-       Elimination of tsetse flies is necessarv to reclaim grazing eteas
now abandoned by cattle owners because of heavy infestation, and to contain
the spread of the fly to the remaining fly-free areas of the Adamaoua plateavii
A small extermination campaign has already been carried ot   successfully in
northern Cameroon with help from the Nigerian Government. The proposed campaign
would be carried out by the Ministry of Livestock in good potential savarnah
grazing areas where tsetse fly extermination would be the only feasible means
of overcoming trypanosomiasis. A survey of the 800,000-ha extermination area
would be made to determine the optimal aerial spraying program in terms of
efficiency and cost.  .X3 a condition of disblurserment for this prorrrra, a



- 10 -
detailed plan for its implementation and for the use of the cleared
areas would have to be approved by the Bank (Schedule 1, para 3(b) of the
Loan Agreement). Protectioil of the cleared areas frorn reinfestation
would be facilitated by the existence of mountainous barriers and by
the extermination already completed by Nigeria to the west. After
clearance from tsetse flies, the area would provide suitable grazing
for the herds of about 1,000 traditional Dastoral families, relieving
the pressure on other presently overgrazed areas.
Private sector development
33.      The project would finance the modeniization of 12 retail shops
in Douala and Yaound6 that are suitable for this. These outlets would
pernit the hygienic handling through retail of about 10 percent of the
meat processed at the new plants. Credit facilities would be arovided
by FONIADER and technical assistance by SODEPA to about 3 mixed
farmers to fatten cattle on their farms; and to about 11 settled
graziers to develop larger breeding/fattening operations. Private
sector participants would include families varying in size from about
6 members on small mixed farms to about 50 for the family groups of
traditional pastoralists on larger ranches.   This credit program would
be the first for cattle production in Cameroon and would involve, in
association writh on-farm and ranch inivestments, the introduction of
improved grazing systems and changes in land tenure arrangemernts.
Training and studies
3a.      In-service training would be directed towards replacing expatriate
staff employed on the project's tsetse fly extermination, private sector
credit, and state ranching and slaughter operations.   It was agreed that,
after Cameroonians have acquired sufficient experience in project
implementation, the Government would discuss with the Bank their
promotloni to uositions initially held by expatriates (Section 3.07
of the Loarn Agreement). Funds would also be provided for overseas
training in livestock production and credit for which local institutions
are inadequate. Furthermore, a follow-up project would be orepared,
including provisions for the development of areas reclaimed from tsetse
flies anc for expansion of credit facilities to the traditional sector
in other areas of the country.
Policy changes
35.      The project would involve changes in land tenure arrangements
as for the first time in Cameroon pastoralists would be given 20-year
leases as a security and incentive to improve their production methods
(Section 3.06 of the Project Agreement). It may also involve changes in
price regulations for meat.   Current meat prices are substantially above
the official retail prices, and price controls are not being effectively
enforced.  The Government knows this, and that the controls, if rigorously
imposed, would depress production.   Nevertheless, it is politically



- 11 -
difficult to phase out all controls when prices in general are rising
rapidly. It was agreed (Section 3.09 of the Loan Agreement) that the
Government would make a study of its meat price regulations, including
the possibility of removing price controls, on the basis of which
measures satisfactory to the Bank would be taken. Besides, reimburse-
ment of payments made by FONADER for loans to butchers would be con-
ditional upon the Bank having approved the lending conditions and
profitability criteria (Schedule 1, para 3 (d) of the Loan Agreement).
Finally, the project would involve a departure from the Government's
low interest rate policy in respect of sub-loans to private farmers,
ranchers and butchers. The sub-loans would bear interest at 10 per-
cent, which is the minimum necessary to cover credit administration
costs and to attract finance to the livestock sector.
Project costs and financing
36.      Total project cost net of taxes is estimated at about US$ 14.6
million equivalent (see Annex III), of which US$ 7.4 million foreign.
Cost estimates include appropriate physical contingencies; in particular
a 15 percent physical contingency has been applied to the tsetse fly
extermination component, which can be estimated accurately only after
completion of the survey of the area to be sprayed. An additional 15 per-
cent contingency has been included for spraying materials to cover the
special risk of erratic deliveries of aviation fuel and insecticide.
Adequate price contingencies have been applied to the various items
of cost, taking account of the large price increases expected to occur
in 1974 and 1975 in particular (see Annex III).
37.      The Bank would make a loan of US$ 11.6 million (79 percent of total
project cost net of taxes), to cover the foreign exchange component and make
a contribution to the financing of local currency costs. The rest of the local
costs would be met by the Government (US' 2.8 million) and private sub-borrowers
(US$ 0.2 million).  The loan would be made to the Government for a term of 21
years, including six years of grace, and the proceeds of the loan would be used
as follows (see Annex III): US$ 0.9 million would be onlent to FONADER to finance
credits to sub-borrowers, and US$ 0.3 million would be granted to FONADER for the
administration of this credit program; US% 5.2 million would be onlent to SODEPA
to finance its ranch and slaughter plants development ; US$ 2.4 million and US$ 0.4
million, respectively, would be passed on as budgetary allocations to the Ministry
of Livestock for tsetse fly extermination, and for training and stuldies; and
US' 2.4 million would be retained as contingencies.
38.      The Government's contribution would complement the proceeds of the loan
as described in Annex III. In particular, the Government would provide US$ 0.5
million as equity in SODEPA. Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be,inter
alia, that a first installment of the equity participation, ccnsisting of CFAF 50
million, had been made available to SODEPA, and that financing agreements acceptable
to the Bank between Government and FONADER, and Government and SODEPA, had been
signed (Section 8.01 of the Loan Agreement).

39.      The funds onlent to FONADER would be repayable in 13 years, including
6 years of grace on principal repayments, at 5 percent interest. Those onlent
and lent by Government to SODEPA would be repayable in 21 years, including 6
years of grace on principal repayments,and bearing the same interest as the
Bank loan. Sub-borrower pastoralists, farmers and butchers could receive credit
with terms varying from one year for short-term credit up to 9 years for medium-
term credit. All loans to private sub-borrowers would bear interest at 10 percent.
The spread between interest rates received and paid by FONADER would cover the cost
of loan administration and the risk inherent in this first livestock credit program.
Sub-borrowers would make contributions amounting to 20 percent of the cost of
their investments.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.      It is expected that, except for livestock purchases, contracts
for all items in excess of US$ 50,000 would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines
for procurement, with the additional provision that slaughter plants, which require
the careful integration of specialized buildings and equipment, would be procured
by a turnkey contract. A 7.5 percent preference for domestic contractors would be
applied. Only domestic cattle would be required for thUe project and the only
practical means of purchasing these would be through negotiated contracts with
local traders. As SODEPA's ranches would be developed over four years, some ranch
infrastructure would be constructed by force account. Private sub-borrowers
would procure their goods and services through ordinary commercial channels.
Internationally recruited staff and consultants would be employed in accordance
with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
41.      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed to cover (a) 100 percent
of payments by FONADER under sub-loans to butchers, farmers and cattle owners
(representing 80 percent of the investment cost of shop, farm and ranch development);
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for SODEPA's expatriate salaries; consultants
for the tsetse fly extermination component and for project preparation; and
overseas graduate and post-graduate training; (c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
or 90 percent of total expenditures for spraying, insecticides, fuels, vehicles
and equipment for the tsetse fly extermination component; and ccnsultants, vehicles
and equipment for loan administration for FONADER; and (d) 90 percent of total
expenditures for buildings, vehicles and equipment, livestock and ranch infra-
structure development for SODEPA; and land clearing and fencing for the tsetse
fly component. US$ 2.4 million of the loan would be unallocated to cover contin-
gencies. Up to US$ 100,000 would be used to cover retroactively the cost of
consultants emploved for the Droject since March 1, 1974.

Economic and Financial Justifications
L2.       The principal direct benefits from project developed farms and
ranches would be the incremental annual production of about 1,300 tons of
meat, 2,000 breeding heifers, 1,500 improved breeding bulls, and 1,500 feeder
steers at full development in PY12.An additional 3,000 tons of meat would be
produced annually by graziers in areas reclaimed from tsetse flies. The
total incremental meat production would represent an increase of about 10
percent over Cameroon's present output, all of which would be required for
domestic consumption. The project would also have important but unquantifiable
benefits that, it is anticipated, will lay the foundation for a modern livestock
industry. These would include (a) the demonstration of improved techniques
of cattle and land management that would be suitable for adoption by many
private graziers and farmers in the area; (b) training of Cameroonians
in livestock production; (c) development of credit, extension and tsetse fly
extermination services; (d) reduction of overgrazing; and (e) improvement of
meat quality in the country's two largest cities. The economic rate of return
for the project is estimated at 13 percent. The financial rates of return for
investments made by private farmers and graziers are estimated at between
14 and 23 percent; for the large-scale SODEPA ranches, 12 percent; and for
slaughter plants, 15 percent. The per capita net cash incomes for families of
ranchers and farmers would be between US$ 100 and US$ 250 at full development
compared to predevelopment incomes of between US% 50 and US$ 75.
PART V - LEAL INSTRUIMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Cameroon
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and SODEPA, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.      The major features ac these agreements have already been referred to
in Part IV of this Report. Features of special interest include (i) the under-
takings of the Government or SODEPA described in paragraphs 28, 34 and 35,
(ii) the additional conditions of effectiveness described in paragraphs 28 and
38 and (iii) the conditions of withdrawal described in paragraphs 31, 32 and 3S.



45.    Besides, the followirg additional events of suspension and default are
of particular interest:
(i) a default by the Governnent, SODEPA or FONADER under the SODEPA or
FONADER Financing Agreements (Section 7.02 (b) and (c) and Section
7.03 (a) of the Loan Agreement);
(ii) the amendment, suspension, abrogation, repeal or waiver of the
instruments establishing SODEPA and FUNADER, in such a way as to
materially and adversely affect SODEPA's or FONADER's ability to
perform their respective obligations (Section 7.02 (d) and (f)
and Section 7.03 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
46.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
L7.    In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full account
of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However, available
information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
48.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490   CAMDEV Project:  US$ 11 million Credit of March 28,
1967; Closing Date: June 30, 1972 and US$ 7 mil-
lion Loan to CAMDEV of same date; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974.
The origfinal planting program of 11,500 ha has been reduced by
elimina-ting 1,000 ha of tea.  Project implementation is satisfactory but cash
funds have been seriously depleted by cost increases due to general infla-
tion, lo.aer than expected yields from non-project plantings and excessive
overheads. However, Government agreed to imrplement economy measures which,
coupled with better management and higher commodity prices, have already
imoroved the CAI4DEV cash position.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp Ln. No. 886   Oil Palm Project:  US$ 7.9 million Loan to
Sopame of April 15, 1969;_ Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1976 and US$ 1.7 million Suple-
mental Loan of April 9, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
After successful initial implementation significant cost overruns
occurred and it was found that one of the two oil palm estate sites was un-
satisfactory.  A substantial part of the cost overrum was due to the under-
estimation of price in-flation when the project was first appraised. Follow-
ing reappraisal in 197? the project was modified from 9,000 ha to 8,500 ha
but estimated production will remain unTchanged as higher yields are now anti-
cina>ed.  The project is now on schedule and proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 604 Water Supply Project; US$ 5 million Loan to SNEC of June 2, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974 (intermediate Closing Dates: May
31, 1972; September 30, 1972; December 31, 1972)
This project T^Tas completed ahead of schedule. However, due to its
strong working capital position, the Borrower delayed submission of disburse-
ment applications. Substantial savings realized under the project have been
approved for investment in further water distribution works. Therefore the
closing date has been postponed thrice to allow fumnds to be disbursed: the
reiTuiiniag balance of US$ 210,o0o is expected to be disbursed by June 1971:.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purDort to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Page 3 of 4 pages
Cr. Nio. 161 First Education Project; US$ 10.5 million Credit of September
23, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
The Project is 12 months behind schedule, due to delays in (i)
selecting the consultants and the specialists for the technical assistance
programs, (ii) reaching agreement on the schedule of accommodation, (iii)
revising the bidding documents, (iv) starting construction works for which
over-priced initial bids had to be cancelled for 16 project items, (v) award-
ing contracts, and (vi) completing the lists of equipment. 'rhe project is
nDw progressing satisfactorily, but the closing dRt.e iill have to be extended
to December 31, 1975. It is forecast that the Project cost will increase by
about US$ 1.0 million, due to the devaluation of the US dollar and the
impact of the oil crisis.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. No. 663 Highway Project; US$ 7 million Credit of March 27,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974 and TIS$ 12
million Loan of same date; Closing Date: December
31, 1974; (original Closing Date: Decenber 31,
1973).
This project had a slow start due primarily to administrative delays
on the part of the implementing ministries. By December 1971, all construc-
tion and consultants contracts were signed and work was proceeding satisfac-
torily. However, during the past rainy season, some completed sections,
totalling 60 km, of the Ngaoundere-Garoua road failed.    Work was resunled
in November after the contractor had agreed to repair all failures at his
own expense and the Government had agreed to improve the design.
Ln. No. 687 Railway Project; US$ 5.2 million Loan to RECIFERCAM of June 9,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
Project execution has been satisfactorv for track renewal work and
delivery of motive power and rolling stock. Unforeseen technical difficul-
ties, such as extremely bad subsoil conditions, made a further study neces-
sary before selecting the optimum design of the railway bridge at Japoma, near
Douala. The Bank has agreed with the Government that a new hridge be built
at Japoma. Bids are expected in mid-March. As the remaining funds of Loan
No. obl will be insufficient to cover the full construction costs of the new
bridge, supplementary financing has been foreseen under the proposed Second
Railway Project which is scheduled for Board presentation in May 1974.
Cr. No. 229 Douala Port Project: US$ 1.5 million Credit of January la, 19(l;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974 (intermediate Closing Dates: June
30, 1973; December 31, 1973).
After considerable delay in starting the project, largely becaase
of time consuming Government procedures involved, the project is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily. The closing date has been extended twice to allow for
full credit disbursement which is now imminent.

Cr. No. 302 SEi4RY Rice Project; US$ 3.7 m2llion Credit of April 26, 1972;
Closing Date:   June 30, 1976.
Started in mid-19'72, the project is progressing satisfactorily
and the appraisal construction schedule is expected to be maintained.
Disbursements are slightly ahead of appraisal estimates. Following the 1973
US dollar devaluation, and provision for some additional works and in-
creased technical assistance, estimated total project costs have increased
by 20 percent. Government and French aid are providing additional funds.
A further review of project costs will be made in April 1974 when firm costs
will be available.
Cr. No. 320   Second Education Project; US$ 9 million Credit of June 28, 1912
Closing Date:    June 30, 1979.
Due to delays in selecting the consulting architects, the date of
effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement, October 2, 1972, has had to
be postponed to Febnrary 27, 1973. Due to delays in selecting two sites for
the construction of three Project items, the design period has been ex-
tended by six months; however, no extension of the closing date of June 30,
1979 is expected.
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935   Second Highway Project:_ US$ 24 million Credit of
September 26, 1973, Closing Date: December 31,
1978 and US$ 24 million Loan of same date; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan and credit became effective on December 20, 1973. Appli-
cations for prequalification have been received by the Government and tender
documents approved by the Bank.

Procurement
Arrargements:         International competitive bidding wou'ld be used for con-
tracts over US$50,00o, totalling US$It.b million, for:
land clearing and fencing, buildings,aerial spraying,
insecticides, fuels, equipment and vehicles. Within the
above, slaughter plants valued at US% 1.8 million would
be procured by a turnkey contract. Cattle valued at
US$ 2. 6 million would be purchased through negotiated
contracts with local traders. Goods and services for
private ranch, farm and butcher shop development valued
at U4 1.1 million would be procured through normal
commercial channels. Infrastructure development on
state ranches would be carried out partly through local
competitive bidding (USS 0.3 million)aand partly by force account
(US$ 0.3 million). US$o100,000 would finance retro-
actively expenditures for the salaries of expatriates
expected to be employed on project implementation after
March 1, 1974.
Technical
Assistance:          Expatriates would be employed to manage the state ranches
and slaughter plants, and to assist private sector de-
velopment and tsetse fly extermination operations. Con-
sultants would be employed to prepare a follow-up project.
Rate of Return:     The project economic rate of return is estimated at 13
percent. Financial rates for investments by private
farmers and graziers are estimated at between 14 and 23
percent; for state-owned ranches at 12 percent, and for
slaughter plants at 15 percent.
Appraisal Report:    Report No. 295-CM of March 6, 19T7.
