MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
CE THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$190.0 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SECOND JABOTABEK URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (JUDP II)
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$190 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan will have a term of 20 years including five years' grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and will help finance a Second
Jabotabek Urban Development Project. TheOverseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF) of Japan will cofinance the project with a US$45.0 million loan and the
Government of Netherlands (GON) will provide about US$3.4 million in grant
financing.
2.        Jabotabek is GOI's mnemonic for the urban region consisting of the
Province of DKI Jakarta, and the surrounding Kabupatens of Bogor, Tangerang
and Bekasi, together with Kotamadya Bogor (see Map IBRD No. 21674). Jakarta
is the national capital and seat of government, and commercial and administra-
tive hub of the country. A disproportionate amount of the burden of popula-
tion growth has fallen on metropolitan Jakarta. Between 1960 and 1980, the
population of Jakarta doubled and by 1986 fully 20 percent (8 million) of the
urban population, 5 percent of the total national population, lived and worked
in the city. However, urbanization has outgrown the administrative boundaries
of DKI Jakarta and, with the spread of industrial and informal sector
residential development (much of which lacks infrastructure and utility
services), the surrounding 'fringe' areas now contain a further 2.3 million
people. The metropolitan area now ranks among the 23 largest conurbations in
the world. Jabotabek's size and rapid growth have helped to provide
employment opportunities for surplus rural labor and has expanded the
production base for Indonesia's industrial sector where 17 percent of GDP is
now generated. By the year 2005, metropolitan Jakarta is projected to have a
total population approaching 20 million compared to 13 million in 1990. For
Jabotabek as a whole, the current population of about 15 million is expected
to exceed 26 million by the year 2005.
3.        Infrastructure Development Issues for Jabotabek.  Investments in
Jakarta's infrastructure has not kept pace with needs and considerable defici-
encies remain both in coverage and quality, particularly in transport, water
supply and sanitation. In addition, institutional and environmental problems
include: (a) poor cost recovery, organization and management resulting in
restrictive practices for distributing water and excessive prices to the poor;
(b) severe pollution of surface e'ater and increasingly of groundwater, from
human and municipal wastes and from a rapidly rising volume of industrial and
toxic wastes; (c) inadequate micro-infrastructures and basic environmental
sanitation services in the urban kampungs, where most low-income people live,
resulting in unhealthy environment which limits the social and economic poten-
tial of the human capital resources of the capital region; (d) inadequate
policies and operational programs for O&M of infrastructure and utility
services; revenue generation and the use of municipal borrowing and private
sector participation in delivery of municipal services; and (e) unclear
relationships between municipal and central government authorities with



- 2 -
respect to assignmen-. of responsibilities for preparation, appraisal,
financing and implementation and O&M of infrastructure services.
Nevertheless, Jabotabek local governments have significant manpower rescurces
and growing experience to address many of these challenges.
4.        Government Strategy.  To address these priorities, the Government
issued, in 1987, a Statement of Policies for Urban Development which repre-
sents a consolidated view of the principal constraints arising and the objec-
tives prescribed for the development effort in the sector. This Policy State-
ment includes: (a) strengthening local governments to assume the leading role
in developing, operating and maintaining local services; (b) carrying out
planning, programming and identification of investments on the basis of a
decentralized and integrated (Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development Pro-
gram--IUIDP) concept; (c) mobilizing additional local revenues and optimizing
their use; (d) implementing a coordinated financing system for the development
and administration of local services; and (e) strengthening the consultative
process at various levels of government. The current five year plan (Repelita
V) also promised greater attention to operation and maintenance of local
infrastructure and services and the welfare of the urban poor. To this end,
integration of urban kampungs more fully into their respective urban systems
through a community-oriented Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) has been
adopted as the principal GOI policy for alleviating urban poverty.
5.        Past Bank Experience.  Having contributed to the formulation of
GOI's sector strategy through the 1984 Urban Services Sector Report (4800-IND,
1984) and subsequent studies financed particularly under Urban IV (Loan
1702-IND) Urban V (Loan 2408-IND) and the Urban Sector Loan (Loan 2816-IND),
the Bank fully supports the IUIDP approach adopted by GOI as the best way to
address urban sector issues in Indonesia in a coordinated and well-planned
manner.   Experience with implementation in DKI Jakarta has been mixed, but
generally good where the local government has had strong commitment and close
control over project management. Loan 2236-IND (JSSP) has encountered severe
delays due in part to DKI Jakarta's inadequate involvement. The First
Jabotabek Urban Development Project (Loan 2932-IND--JUDP I) is proceeding well
and on schedule. Particular attention was given to improving project coor-
dination and a Jabotabek Urban Project Coordination Office (JUPCO) was
established in May 1988. From its inception, JUPCO has been particularly
effective in managing a relatively new and complex project execution process.
JUPCO's experience has been taken into account in the design of the proposed
project for which the role of JUPCO will be expanded to ensure monitoring and
coordination.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in
conjunctton with that of the co-financing partners (OECF and GON) has been
instrumental in focusing and coordinating the different Government agencies
involved in the Jabotabek area on essential elements of urban policy and
investment needs and in addressing critical sector issues.
7.        Project Objectives.  Project objectives are to develop and implement
a coordinated program of physical investments, technical assistance and poli-
cies for urban water supply, waste water disposal and water resource/quality
management which: (a) balances the existing treatment capacity with required
transmission and distribution networks; (b) nearly doubles the piped water
supply from about 28 percent of population; (c) results in improved service



-3
for poor through construction of standpipes and increasing competition among
vendors; (d) improves waste water disposal and drainage; (e) strengthens the
management, staffing and financial viability of water supply and sewerage
institutions; and (f) strengthens water resources planning capabilities.
8.        Project DescriDtion.  The project consists of:  (a) the PDAM Jaya
System Improvement Project (PJSIP) including primary distribution mains and
facilities, rehabilitation, extension of service mains and service
connections, and institutional improvements; (b) the raw water pipeline to
Pejompongan and related measures to protect the quality of water; (c) the
treated water transmission main from the Cisadane I Water Treatment Plan (WTP)
to the PDAM Jaya distribution network; (d) the extension of JSSP Stage I
Sewerage covering about 170,000 people and including demonstration projects of
lower-cost technologies; (e) priority drainage and flood control components in
Jakarta; and (f) TA for water resources management studies; project
implementation; institutional development for the enterprises; planning and
pricing studies; and future project preparation. JUPCO will be expanded to be
responsible for overall coordination. Total project cost is about US$349.0
million of which US$170.0 million is expected to be in foreign exchange. The
proposed Bank loan would finance about 70 percent of project cost net of
taxes. Part of the loan proceeds (US$124.0 million equivalent) will be onlent
to DKI Jakarta, PDAM Jaya and PDAM Tangerang for a term of 20 years including
five years' grace at 9.25 percent interest, including 0.25 percent bank fee,
and 0.75 percent commitment charge on the undisbursed amount. The interest
and commitment charges will be accumulated and capitalized during the grace
period. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. Retroactive
financing of up to US$2.0 million would cover eligible expenditures incurred
after February 20, 1990.
9.        The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8339-IND dated May 1, 1990 is being distributed separately.
10.       Environmental Impact.  The project will reduce water-related
environmental pollution in Jakarta and will have a positive overall impact on
the environment.  Preliminary environmental assessments have been prepared for
all components in accordance with GOI procedures (which are satisfactory to
the Bank) and only minor negative impacts have been identified, such as
localized drainage problems resulting from increased waste water volume as a
consequence of improved water supply.   Procedures for identifying
environmental problems and mitigating them through plarning, design and
construction of microdrainage works have been proposed in the environmental
management and monitoring plan to deal with the drainage problems. A budget
provision for financing special drainage works has been included. In general,
environmental management and monitoring plans which have been prepared for all
components will prescribe adequate strategies and measures to minimize
environmental impacts during implementation.
11.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached with GOI on the following
points: (a) PDAM Jaya, POJ, and PDAM Tangerang will implement technical,
institutional and financial development action programs; (b) GOI will make
funds available for cofinanced components, if required; (c) GOI will provide



-4-
all financing for Buaran II and Cisadane plants; (d) DKI Jakarta will review
and adjust PDAM Jaya and groundwater tariffs, if necessary at three-yearly
intervals to a-hieve agreed financial objectives; (e) tariffs for raw water
will become effective on completion of the first pipeline in 1991 and will be
adjusted every three years until full cost recovery is achieved; (f) Tangerang
local government will allow PDAM Tangerang to adjust its tariffs at three
yearly intervals based on agreed financial objectives; (g) funds will be
provided by GOI to Interim Sewerage Unit (BPAL); (h) PDAL (sewerage
enterprise) will be established by Auril 1, 1991; and (i) sewerage tariffs
will be adjusted effective April 1991. Satisfactory subsidiary loan
agreements between GOI and (i) DKI Jakarta, (ii) PDAM Jaya, and (iii) PDAH
Tangerang will be executed; and the JUPCO key staff appointed as conditions of
Loan effectiveness.
12.       Benefits and Risks.  The proposed project will improve the quality
and reliability of water supply and increase quantity particularly in poor
areas; increase use of piped water and partly replace groundwater use to
reduce the deterioration of the groundwater resource; decrease flooding;
decrease the pollution of groundwater by extending the sewerage network; and
initiate discussion on institutional framewo   and strategy for integrated
water resource management, including pollutivn control and conjunctive use of
ground and surface water. The installation of more than 3,000 new public
hydrants should lead to greater accessibility and lower end user price of
water for low-income people.  Implementation risks are:  (i) cost overruns,
larger unaccounted-for water. insurlicient equity contribution, and delayed
tariff increases; (ii) lower than expected demand for piped water (especially
in the nonresidential sector, which might keep on using the incr asingly
scarce groundwater resource if DRI Jakarta is not able to enfor i the
increased groundwater fee); and (iii) institutional bottleneck   hich slow
down implementation (for PDAM Jaya it might take longer than e   cted to build
up necessary implementation capacity).  Action programs have bet,  agreed and
technical assistance will be provided in order to reduce the impact of these
factors. Furthermore, project design has been based on a concept which
maximizes the flexibility during implementation and monitors d-^elopments by
regularly collecting and evaluating cost and consumer infornmation.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
