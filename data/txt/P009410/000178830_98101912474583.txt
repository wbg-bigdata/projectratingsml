BANGLADESH
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Overall Situation
1.01      Bangladesh has a population of about 85 million (1978 estimate).
Dacca has 2.3 million and Chittagong, the second city, about 600,000. These
two cities plus the other 76 areas classified as urban bring the total urban
population to about 7 million. The location of the country on the Ganges/
Brahmaputra delta and the monsoon rains, generally more than 1,500 mm annually,
result in abundant surface water, which, however, is heavily polluted. The
high incidence of cholera and other water borne diseases reflects the exten-
sive use of untreated water from streams, tanks and dugwells. Fortunately,
groundwater is also abundant; it usually requires little treatment and is
relatively inexpensive, so public water undertakings use it as a principal
source of supply. At present, about 48 million of the population have access
to reasonably safe water but about 37 million still depend on easily conta-
minated traditional sources. Water borne sewerage has been introduced in
parts of Dacca but elsewhere there is general use of night soil conservancy,
direct disposal to fields and, to a very limited extent, pit privies and
septic tanks.
1.02      The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has used its limited resources
to concentrate on developing safe water supply facilities rather than dis-
posal of waste. Overall, about 56% of the population has access to whole-
some water while only about 8% benefit from waste disposal services. This
compares with an average level of 38% access to water and 33% to waste dis-
posal in all developing countries. 1/
Sector Development
1.03      GOB has been trying to satisfy the increasing demand for water
arising from rapid population expansion, particularly in the urban areas
where the effects of natural growth have been aggravated by rural migration.
Sector development, interrupted in 1971 by the war of independence and its
aftermath, started slowly, but has gradually improved. The rural areas,
district towns and the larger urban centers have received attention to a
varying degree.

1.04      In rural areas, a program sponsored by the United Nation's Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health organization (WHO), has sunk about 200,000
hand pump tubewells bringing the number in service to about 380,000 making
safe water available to a total of about 40 million people. UNICEF plans to
continue this program through 1985. Its contribution, about 50% of the total
cost, takes the form of materials. GOB obtains contributions amounting to
about 10% of the cost from local consumers and provides the remaining 40% in
the form of grants. Despite this significant increase in the supply of safe
water in rural areas, water borne diseases have not receded as much as was
anticipated because personal hygiene and sanitation practices have not
imprDved sufficiently. GOB has developed a health education program in
recognition of this problem (para 6.09).
1.05      The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has indicated its intention to
assist in financing projects for water supply in district towns. An ADB tech-
nicaL assistance grant has been approved for the preparation of feasibility
studies for projects designed to satisfy the needs through 1990 of the towns
of Comilla, Bogra, Barisal, Mymensingh and Jessore which would benefit some
500,000 people. Additional district towns may be included in subsequent
projects.
1.06      In the past, the Association (IDA) has financed water supply and
sewerage development in the larger urban centers of Dacca (Credit 368-BD)
and Chittagong (Credit 367-BD) where high population densities have created
serious sanitation problems. An IDA credit (941-BD) has recently been made
for further improvement of Dacca's water supply and sewerage services. The
proposed project will expand water supply services in Chittagong. With the
assistance of the Government of the Netherlands (GON) a feasibility study is
being; carried out for a water supply project in Khulna for which GOB has
requested IDA's financial support. In addition, GOB has asked GON to assist
in the execution of a feasibility study for a similar project in Rajshahi.
1.07      The main constraints upon sector development are shortage of funds
and insufficient numbers of qualified and experienced personnel. Capital works
financing as well as operating subsidies, particularly for the water supply
operations of the financially ailing municipalities, are being provided from
Government budget funds. Over the past five years, investment in the water
supply and sewerage sector has been about 7% of GOB's development expenditures,
comparing well with other countries in the sub-continent and which is unlikely
to increase in the future due to the competing demands of other sectors of
the economy. Trained manpower at the operating level is generally available
in major urban centers but is in short supply in rural areas, where, as a
result, maintenance of hand pump tubewells is less than satisfactory.
Sector Organization
1.08      GOB exercises control over the sector through the Ministry of Local
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRD). The agencies operat-
ing under M1GRD are the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), the
municipalities and, in the cases of Dacca and Chittagong, Water and Sewerage
Authorities (WASAs). DPHE develops water supply projects countrywide and



operates and maintains water works throughout the rural areas. In urban
areas, DPHE generally hands over operational and maintenance responsibilities
to the municipalities except in the case of Dacca and Chittagong where the
WASAs have responsibility for all aspects of water supply and sewerage.
II. POPULATION, WATER CONSUMPTION AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREA
2.01      Chittagong lies on the right bank of the River Karnaphuli where its
easy access to the sea is the main factor influencing its development into the
principal port and second city of Bangladesh.  Until 1974, it was a fairly
compact, crowded city made up of 15 political unions 1/ but in that year and
again in 1979, the municipal boundary was extended. These extensions increased
the area of the old city from 1,300 hectares to 4,980 hectares (280% increase)
and finally to 7,740 hectares (55% increase). Recent development has extended
up and down the river as well as northwards along the axes of principal roads
(Map IBRD No. 14585 and Table 6.1).
Population
2.02      Chittagong's population has grown from 27,000 in 1901 to its present
level of about 600,000; the annual growth rate over this period has varied
between 2.3% and 6.9%. Projections made in 1962 estimated that the popula-
tion would increase at a compound rate of 2.0% from 365,000 to 500,000 by 1978;
the actual rate was 3.7%. Although in the long run the rate of population
growth may decelerate as a result of GOB's population program, migration from
rural areas, the more significant factor of Chittagong's growth, may increase.
Under conservative assumptions, Chittagong's population is expected to reach
about 750,000 by 1990, at an average growth rate of 3.2% (Annex 1).
Level of Water Service
2.03      The existing water supply service in Chittagong is illustrated on
Map IBRD 14656. The total urban population is about 600,000 and WASA supplies
about 407,000, 107,000 through domestic connections and 300,000 through public
standpipes. A further 70,000 people are supplied by their employers from
private sources. The remainder live beyond WASA's service area and depend on
wells and tanks for their supplies. Many, however, work in the serviced area
and make use of the water supply system while there. WASA's production capa-
city is about 57 million liters per day (mld) (12.5 million Imperial gallons
per day (mgd)); the entire supply comes from tubewells, some located within
the city but most on the north-eastern fringe at Kalurghat. The groundwater
from the tubewells contains iron in varying degrees and an iron removal plant,
built under the first project, has improved the quality of distributed water
since 1977. There are essentially two distribution systems. The older
system, serving the older central parts of Chittagong, is made up of 14 sub-
systems each having a tubewell(s) and an elevated tank(s). The new system
extends through much of the urban area including the old city and is supplied

-4-
from the Kalurghat well-field; it has been designed to parallel the old system
and to supersede it whenever practicable. There is a marked difference in
the availability of water in the two systems; the new one is constantly under
pressure but the old system is under pressure only for part of the day;
pressurization varies between 4 and 20 hours daily, depending on the supply
zone.
2.04      Of the present production capacity of about 57 mld (12.5 mgd),
about 45 mld comes from the Kalurghat well-field and about 12 mld from the
city wells. Production is affected by power outages and by down time of tube-
wells for repair and has been as low as 47 mld (10.5 mgd) over periods of two
to three months at a time. Of the total production it is estimated that 37
mld (65%) is used by the consumers; domestic consumers (including standpipe
users) take 27 mld (46%), industrial 4 mld (7%) and commercial 6.5 mld (12%).
Losses, leakage, illegal connections and waste account for the remaining 20
mld (35%) (Annex 2). WASA has begun to establish working groups to reduce
losses and detect illegal connections and agreed at negotiations to prepare
and follow a suitable program of work.
2.05      About 4% of production (2.2 mld) is used by about 300,000 people
and collected by them from about 750 standpipes located throughout the area
of supply. A further 8% (4.5 mld) is estimated to be lost from the stand-
pipes as a result of waste, damage and lack of care by the users. In all,
standpipes account for about 6.7 mld (Annex 2).
2.06      At present, there are about 9,000 connections of all categories
serving about 407,000 of Chittagong's 600,000 people (Annex 2). The project
will provide about 14,000 new domestic connections, about 550 commercial and
industrial connections and about 1,850 public standpipes as well as two
experimental public water concessions to be run by concessionaires. 1/
LejL of Sanitation Service
/2.07      WASA's responsibility for sewerage is nominal, as the city does not
have any sewers. At present, solid and liquid wastes are disposed of by
septic tanks or by means of a night soil collection system run by Chittagong
Municipal Corporation (CMC). It is estimated that about 30% of the population
live in properties served by septic tanks discharging into surface water
drains, open and closed, and watercourses; as a result the streams about the
city are heavily polluted. The remaining 70% of the population deposit their
wastes on fields and open spaces or depend upon the municipal night soil
collection service. Night soil is collected and carted to holding tanks at
Namunabajag, Khatungang, Jhowtala, and Dewan Bazar. The first two named are
located near the Karnafuli River which receives discharges from the tanks at
nighl: on the ebb tide just after high water. The other tanks are periodically
cleaned out and the contents dumped outside the city.
1/   A public water concession will comprise 6/8 standpipes in an enclosure
where water may be purchased from a concessionaire.



-5-
Water Demand and Consumption
2.08      The population increase due to migration from rural areas is expected
to have greatest impact on those unions closest to the old city but substantial
growth is expected in almost all the unions within the municipality and even
those unions within the old city are expected to grow by about 10% by 1990.
There is an unsatisfied demand for water because of the inadequacy of the
old water supply system which affects the central area of Chittagong. Demand
is, therefore, fairly widespread but is at its greatest in those unions adjacent
to the old city (Map IBRD No. 14585).
2.09      Industrial and commercial consumption represent about 19% of WASA's
production. Chittagong's role in the nation's development, its location and
past history give weight to the estimate that industry and commerce will take
27% of WASA's production by 1990.
2.10      A number of industries use their own water resources but take water
from WASA to augment their own supplies; their dependence on WASA is expected
to increase quite rapidly as their requirements grow. A few industries supply
water to their own employees, in total about 70,000 people, but WASA considers
that in the interests of public health a multiplicity of suppliers is undesir-
able and intends to meet its responsibility by providing for all domestic
needs by June 1982. The project makes provision for WASA to take over all
domestic supplies; an undertaking to this effect was obtained at negotiations.
2.11      WASA aims to meet all industrial and commercial needs and increased
production under the project will enable it to move towards this goal.
Industries using their own resources but using WASA supplies as required
obtain benefits from WASA's investment but avoid making their full contri-
bution. Overdrawing of groundwater results in saline intrusion of the aquifer
and it is necessary for WASA to protect this valuable source of good quality
water by controlling abstractions. GOB confirmed during negotiations that
WASA has the authority to compel licensing of private abstractions and a
satisfactory program to carry out such licensing will be prepared by GOB
not later than December 31, 1980.
2.12      WASA's water production capacity has increased from under 10 mld
(2 mgd) in the early 1960s to about 57 mld (12.5 mgd) today (Annex 2). Gross
per capita supplies have increased from 48 lcd (10.5 gcd) to about 118 lcd
(26 gcd). These figures include all domestic, industrial and commercial
consumption and losses and waste.
2.13      Metering is WASA's standard procedure for all domestic, industrial
and commercial connections but about 30% of all meters are defective and only
a few standpipes are metered. WASA's meter installation, repair and replace-
ment programs, which were agreed in detail during negotiations, form an impor-
tant part of the project and will provide adequate metering information of
improved reliability; it will also provide WASA with the means to establish
a sound waste detection and prevention program which will be required under
the project.

III. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
3.01      GOB will be the recipient of the proposed Credit (US$20.0 million
equivalent), and will onlend the proceeds (para 5.16) to Chittagong WASA, the
implementing agency for the project. A similar arrangement was made under
the first project (Credit 367-BD).
Organization
3.02      Chittagong WASA was established under the East Pakistan Water Supply
and Sewerage Authority Ordinance 1963 (as amended) and is responsible for the
construction, operation and maintenance of water and sewerage works and other
facilities relating to environmental sanitation in the Chittagong metropolitan
area.
3.03      WASA is a corporate body governed by a Board consisting of a full-
time Chairman, appointed by GOB for five years, and up to 13 part-time members
appointed by GOB or nominated by the local authorities for a three-year term.
WASA was created from an essentially municipal engineering organization and
was intended to operate in accordance with sound public utility practices and
with a large measure of commercial autonomy; while some progress has been made
in this respect, the transformation is far from complete. A further improve-
ment in WASA's commercial performance is a major objective of this project.
3.04      WASA has a centralized headquarters organized on a functional basis
and controlled by its senior management (Annex 3). Stores arrangements are
decentralized. WASA will have to review the extent of decentralization as the
serviice area is extended and care will be needed in modifying the organization
to meet its expanding responsibilities. At negotiations an assurance was ob-
tained that IDA will be given the opportunity to comment on any changes pro-
posecd to WASA's organizational structure.
Management and Staffing
3.05      WASA's Chairman is also its Chief Executive with responsibility
for overall management. The present Chairman is a qualified engineer and
was previously Chief Engineer of Dacca WASA; he was appointed to his present
post in September 1977 but was slow to demonstrate the managerial qualities
needed to direct and control WASA's affairs. His performance was reviewed
during a post-appraisal mission in November 1979 and clearly he has made
considerable efforts to reduce arrears, improve billings and collections
and increase water production. He is assisted by a competent and experienced
Chief Engineer, a Commercial Manager and a Secretary. The post of Commercial
Manager was unfilled for more than three years and the present incumbent, who
was recruited from academic life in August 1977, is a young man with no pre-
vious commercial experience.



3.06      In an effort to improve WASA's managerial skills it is proposed
to appoint an expatriate with experience in financial management and informa-
tion systems in the water supply sector for a period of up to two years.
This appointment is urgently required and will be financed from technical
assistance Credit 872-BD. This person will act as a counterpart to WASA's
commercial maia-ger, will advise the Chairman on the introduction of satis-
factory management information systems and will arrange a training program
(para 3.11). The appointment is a condition of effectiveness.
3.07      WASA's financial staffing structure was reviewed by the appraisal
mission and it was agreed that WASA establish a separate management account-
ing section and strengthen the control of billing and collection activities;
WASA has now appointed a second Deputy Chief Accountant, a Budget Officer and
a Chief Revenues Officer for this purpose. While it is unrealistic to expect
a high standard of financial management until such time as WASA is able to
attract qualified accountants to fill its senior posts some improvement will
follow from these appointments and from staff training courses.
3.08      Although WASA has a number of qualified engineers, nine additional
professional engineering staff and some support staff will be required to
enable WASA to undertake a part of the design and contract supervision for
the project. As a condition of effectiveness, WASA is required to make
these appointments. On completion of the project, additional staff will
be needed to operate the new facilities.
3.09      WASA's total manpower was stable between 1970 and 1974 and has
increased from about 420 in 1974 to about 650 in June 1979. In part, the
recent increase is attributable to the commissioning of works under the first
project but the present level appears excessive and staff numbers should not
increase during the project construction period other than for the purpose
stated above (para 3.07 and 3.08). WASA agreed at negotiations to prepare
a staffing plan acceptable to the Association by September 1, 1980 for imple-
mentation during the period of project execution.
Training
3.10      Training, both in Bangladesh and abroad, was provided to WASA's
staff under the first project. Supplementary assistance for training was
received during that same period from multilateral and bilateral sources.
Although some of this training was received at the operational level, the
thrust of the formal programs was directed at the upper levels of the organ-
ization. The nucleus of suitably trained mid-level managerial and technical
staff now available will provide a foundation for further institutional
development.
3.11      The training element in the proposed project is directed princi-
pally at the operational staff but also includes a limited overseas fellowship
program. A training program is recommended (Annex 4) which involves develop-
ing an in-house training capability in Chittagong and establishing a joint



-8-
program with Dacca WASA. Training facilities will be provided in Dacca under
the Second Dacca Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 941-BD) which may
develop as the national center for vocational training for the sector. Dacca's
arrangements are scheduled to be completed by December 1979 and Chittagong is
expezted to participate immediately. The program will utilize staff expertise
gained under the first project. Training in commercial and financial manage-
ment will also be provided (para 3.06). At negotiations an undertaking was
obtained from WASA to prepare a training program, taking the joint program
into account, by September 1, 1980.
Management Systems
3.12      Management systems were reviewed at appraisal.  Reporting on opera-
tional and commercial activities is unsatisfactory and a series of monthly
reporting statements were designed to assist WASA in managing its activities.
Management and IDA reporting requirements will be strengthened under the
proposed project (para 5.20). WASA lacks an effective system of financial
planning or budgetary control; the annual budget comprises only a list of
income and expenditure prepared for GOB authorization. An accrual system of
accounting was developed in the late 1960s with assistance from consultants
and is appropriate for WASA's use but requires updating. Stores management
and billing and collection procedures will be improved under the project
(para,s 5.05(b) and 5.14).
3.13      A UNDP team, comprising an engineer and an accountant, is presently
engaged in a two-year review of WASA's management systems as a result of which
considerable improvements are expected. The appointment of an expatriate
financial adviser (para 3.06) should hasten an all-round improvement in WASA's
management performance. Internal audit arrangements will be strengthened and
improved financial planning of WASA's capital and operating expenditures will
be introduced.
Audit and Insurance
3.14      WASA's accounts are audited by an independent firm of accountants
appointed in consultation with MLGRD. In the past, delays in making the
appointment have combined with delays by WASA in preparing the accounts for
audit to prevent the submission of audited accounts to IDA within the
required six months of WASA's financial year-end. WASA's FY1979 audited
accounts were received by end-February 1980 (i.e., eight months after the
financial year-end). Auditors for FY1980 have already been appointed and
recent improvements should ensure a more timely preparation of future accounts
by WASA's staff. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that hereafter:
(i) Auditors, satisfactory to the Association, will be
appointed prior to the start of each financial year; and
(ii) WASA's audited accounts, together with the auditor's report,
will be submitted to the Association within six months of
the end of WASA's financial year.

3.15      Until recently WASA had made no arrangements for insurance against
public utility risks. A satisfactory self-insurance fund has now been
established.
IV.  THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      In the early 1960s, GOB with the assistance of consultants, estab-
lished a water supply and sewerage development plan for Chittagong. The plan
envisaged the development of a surface water treatment plant on the river
Halda, together with provision of trunk and distribution mains and service
reservoirs throughout the city; a water borne sewerage system leading to a
sewage treatment plant with a sea outfall was also included in the plan.
The First Chittagong Water Supply Project
4.02      In 1963 the plan became the subject of a IDA Credit (42-PAK) to the
Government of Pakistan but the scope of the proposal was beyond the financial
and institutional means of the newly established Chittagong Water and Sewerage
Authority. In 1969 the credit was reduced from US$24.0 million to US$7.0
million mainly by deferring the river abstraction scheme and the sewerage
proposals. Political disturbance and war interrupted progress and disburse-
ments were suspended. The project, which was revived in 1973 under a credit
to GOB (Credit 367-BD), included the development of a well-field of 14 tube-
wells at Kalurghat north-east of the city and an associated treatment plant
(45 mld) to remove the iron present in solution in the water from the tube-
wells. In addition the project added about 33 miles to the water mains begun
under the earlier credit and a 14 ml (3 mg) service reservoir. The project
also included a training element (para 3.10). The project cost was US$25.0
million equivalent 1/ and the credit of US$7.0 million has been fully dis-
bursed; contract payments have been completed except for a small amount of
retention monies.
4.03      The objectives of the project were to (a) complete the physical
works and (b) establish WASA as an efficient and viable commercial undertaking.
Local contractors were slow but improved as they gained experience; the inex-
perience of local agents caused procurement delays but WASA now proposes to
pre-qualify these agents.  Slow customs clearance was also a delaying factor
but newly introduced procedures providing for book transfers of customs and
duties payments are expected to bring improvements.  Physical elements of the
project were completed in 1978 and, although attended by teething troubles
(which are being eradicated), and some weakness at operators level, (which
is being treated by improved training), the whole apparatus is now working
1/   Based on an exchange rate for the Taka averaged over the duration of
the project.

reasonably well. Water production is affected by iron deposits on pumps and
pipes and by power outages; WASA has now introduced a program for cleaning
iron deposits and under the proposed project power outages will be countered,
to a reasonable degree, by standby generators. As a result of the project
wat:er supplies increased from about 9 mld in 1963 to about 60 mld in 1978
bringing for the first time a 24 hour supply of good quality water to the
city (Annex 1). Institutional objectives have not been fully realized but
improvements have been made in a number of areas despite persistent problems.
Overstaffing has been difficult to deal with because of labor resistance
but this is a general problem in Bangladesh and is not restricted to WASA.
Management quality has varied according to the ability of the incumbent
chairman; financial staffing, which was very weak in WASA's early days, has
gradually improved and the proposed project includes provision for further
strengthening (para. 3.06). Particular emphasis will continue to be placed on
billings and collections (paras. 5.13 and 5.14) both of which have presented
problems over the duration of the first project.
4.04      Considering the reduction in scope of the first project, together
with the rapid population growth (as described in Chapter 2), the current
inadequacies of the water supply system are easily understood.
(a)  About 20% of Chittagong's population does not have conven-
ient access to safe water. The project will provide suffi-
cient additional quantities of water and extend the dis-
tribution system over the densely populated municipal area.
(b)  Certain areas of the city, which are dependent on the old
distribution system, receive inadequate and intermittent
supplies. This project will provide sufficient additional
water and distribution mains to meet the demand in these
areas.
4.05      Sewerage was deleted from the earlier project.  The additional
supplies of water being made available under the project will be distributed
over a much wider area than is presently served and only a marginal effect on
existing drainage problems is expected. Although sewerage is not included in
this project, studies will be undertaken to arrive at a scheme to provide a
reasonable balance of sewerage (in areas where a reasonable alternative is
not available) and conversion of bucket latrines to pit latrines in other
part's of the city. The studies will be financed under Technical Assistance
Credit 872-BD.
Pro3ect Description
4.06      The proposed project consists of the following main components
(for details see Annex 5 and Map IBRD No. 14656A):
(a)  Six tubewells of which four will be located at the Kalurghat
well-field and two in the city area. All wells will be
metered.
(b)  Modifications to the existing Kalurghat iron removal plant
and pumping station to increase its capacity from 45 to 70
mld (10 to 15 mgd).



- 11 -
(c) An intake oni the Halda river at Mohara and a surface water
treatment plant with a capacity of 90 mld (20 mgd).
(d) Trunk water mains, including fittings and valves, in sizes
ranging from 600 mm (24 in) to 1,050 mm (42 in) totalling
43 km (26-1/2 miles).
(e) Distribution water mains, including fittings and valves, in
sizes ranging from 150 mm (6 in) to 450 mm (18 in) total-
ling 41 km (25-1/2 miles).
(f) Two booster pumping stations to produce adequate pressure
in areas remote from the main pumping stations.
(g) A service reservoir of 4.5 ml (1 mg) capacity on A.D.C's
Hill.
(h) 14,000 service connections with meters.
(i) 1,850 standpipes and two public water concessions.
(j)  Equipment for district or zone metering and leak
detection equipment.
(k) Staff quarters at the treatment plants at Mohara
and Kalurghat.
(1) Engineering services for the preparation of contract
drawings and documents and for the supervision of
project implementation.
(m) Staff training.
(n) Utility vehicles.
4.07      The proposed project will improve the quality of water put into
supply as the introduction of river water will reduce the iron concentration
in the mixed waters from the river and tubewells. Quantitative changes to be
brought about by the project are shown in brief in Table 4.1 and more fully
in Annex 2.

Cost Estimate
4.08      The estimated cost of the project is Taka 615 million (US$39.7
million) including contingencies, customs duties and taxes. The estimated
costs are summarized in Table 4.1 and shown in greater detail in Annex 6.

4.09      WASA's estimates for civil works and equipment are based on the
costs of comparable work undertaken during 1978 and on bids for similar
equipment recently obtained in connection with the previous project (Credit
367-BD). Civil works and equipment costs are based on end-FY79 prices. A
physical contingency of 10% has been included. Price contingencies have been
calculated using an annual escalation of 10% for local costs and 12% (1979),
10 1/2% (1980), 9% (1981), 8% (1982) and 7% thereafter for foreign equipment.
Customs duties and taxes have been added in accordance with local regulations.
The cost estimates are adequate.

Project Financing
4.10      An IDA Credit of US$20 million is proposed; this is about 50%
of the project cost, (or 72% excluding customs duties and taxes which amount
to about US$11.5 million). The Credit would cover 100% of foreign costs
(US$11.8 million equivalent) and about 50% of local costs. To cov7er payments
to consultants and for advance payments for equipment and materials required
for prompt initiation of project work, it is recommended that retroactive
financing, not exceeding US$250,000 be authorized for expenditures incurred
after January 1, 1980. Table 4.2 summarizes the project financing plan.

/a   Excludes interest during construction and

Project Implementation
4.11      WASA will be responsible for project engineering with assistance
from consultants in design, drafting of bid documents, bid evaluation and
construction supervision except in respect of tubewells and distribution
mains where WASA will carry out these activities without assistance. WASA
has initiated the process of selecting consultants for detailed design and
supervision of construction. The appointment of consultants is a condition
of credit effectiveness. Detailed engineering costs are estimated at US$1.6
million. The joint venture contract will provide for about 2,760 man-months
of consultants' service and local office and transportation costs. The esti-
mated average man-month cost (including salary, costs, fees, international
travel and subsistence ) is US$510; the estimated average local man-month cost
is US$220 (2,600 man-months) and the average expatriate man-month cost is
US$6,560 (160 man-months). The expatriate personnel will provide expertise
for the design of intake and treatment works and overall supervision. Project
construction will be carried out by contract using either foreign or local
contractors (para 4.14). Tubewell construction and laying of water mains
will proceed throughout the year although some delays must be expected during
the monsoon season. Major construction is expected to be completed by mid-
1984 and project completion in all respects is scheduled by December 1984
(Annex 7).
Procurement
4.12      All contracts for equipment, materials and meters will be awarded
under international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the



- 14 -
Association's guidelines. The expenditure would be largely for water mains
which may include steel, ductile iron, asbestos cement and PVC pipes.
Exceptions will be made for items costing less than US$15,000 equivalent
having an aggregate value not exceeding US$350,000 which can be procured
through local shopping on the basis of at least three priced quotations.
4.13      In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manufac-
turers would be given a preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs
of the competing imports or of the existing rate of customs duty, whichever
is lower.
4.14      Civil works include pipe laying, tubewell construction, deep exca-
vations, construction of reinforced concrete tanks and buildings; the cost
of these works would amount to US$13.9 million equivalent. The construction
contracts for the new surface water treatment plant and trunk mains are of
sufficient size to warrant international competitive bidding; prequalifica-
tion will be required and a 7-1/2% margin of preference will be given to
domestic contractors. The remainder would be made up generally of contracts
of US$0.5 million or less which would be scattered about the city. While the
tubewell work requires special equipment, local contractors have it available
and they are experienced in this class of work. The scope of individual
contracts, the familiarity of the work to the local contracting industry and
its labor intensive character are such that international competitive bidding
would not be appropriate and local competitive bidding procedures acceptable
to IDA would be applied.
Disbursement
4.15      The proposed Credit would be disbursed against the following items:
(a)  Civil works.  57% of total expenditures for civil works
contracts procured under international competitive
bidding in connection with the Mohara treatment plant
and construction of trunk mains and appurtenant works;
(b)  equipment, materials and vehicles.  100% of foreign
expenditures for directly imported goods, or 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured
goods, or 50% for goods procured locally;
(c)  training.  100% of total expenditures excluding any tax
reimbursement; and
(d)  consultant's services.  100% of total expenditures.
A schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 8.
Land Acquisition
4.11,     The site for the surface water treatment plant at Mohara has already
been acquired by WASA. The remaining land requirements are for about six



- 15 -
acres in total to provide sites for six tubewells, two booster pumping sta-
tions, staff quarters at Mohara and Kalurghat and a service reservoir on ADC's
Hill. In addition, easements would be required for an effluent pipe from the
Mohara plant to the river and a number of minor rights of way for water mains.
WASA confirmed during negotiation, that all sites other than tubewell sites
and all easemerts have been acquired or will be acquired without difficulty.
4.17      The site for the Mohara surface water treatment plant is sufficiently
large to permit some future extension but to ensure that later extensions are
not obstructed the land around the site will be preserved for water supply
purposes either by purchase or by legislation. An assurance to this effect
was obtained at negotiations.
Project Approval
4.18      As in the case of other projects in Bangladesh, GOB approval of the
Project Proforma is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Environmental and Health Impact
4.19      The project will have a favorable environmental and health impact.
It will, in general, enable WASA to raise the levels of water supply on a
per capita basis in those areas already served and will introduce supplies
into peripheral areas of the city. In the old city, the project will re-
inforce existing supplies, improve water main pressure and permit WASA to
maintain system pressure throughout the 24 hours. Disposal of additional
water supplies will form part of the sewerage study (para 4.03).
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.20      WASA agreed at negotiations to maintain such records as are required
by IDA for monitoring and evaluating progress during execution of the project
and after completion.
Pollution Prevention
4.21      The waters from which Chittagong will take its supplies require
protection and GOB has confirmed that it has powers to prevent or control
all discharges to the rivers Karnaphuli and Halda (-and tributaries). GOB
confirmed that all measures will be taken to protect the water supply.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      WASA's financial performance has been unsatisfactory in each of the
six years since Credit 367-BD was approved for the first Chittagong water
supply project. WASA was required, by that agreement, 1/ to maintain tariffs
at levels sufficient to finance normal annual system extensions and a reason-
able proportion of future major system expansion. Despite three tariff
increases 2/ between FY74 and FY79 WASA has consistently failed to meet this
covenant and has incurred an operating deficit in each year since 1974: the
details of its financial operations from FY74 through FY79 are summarized in
Table 5.1 below and are shown in greater detail in Annex 9.

5.02      WASA's practice of capitalizing and financing from GOB project funds
an increasing proportion (from 50% in FY75 to 90% in FY78) of its administra-
tive costs was not justified as most staff were not directly engaged in
1/   Section 4.03(a) requires GOB to cause WASA to set and maintain rates for
water supply (and sewerage services) which will provide sufficient revenues
to (i) cover operating expenses, including adequate maintenance, interest
and depreciation; (ii) meet loan repayments in excess of depreciation;
(iii) finance normal annual system extensions and a reasonable portion of
future major system expansion.
2/   Water charges (Taka/1,000 gallons) were increased to the undernoted amounts:

project work. The practice merely served to reduce WASA's published operating
deficit. WASA agreed during appraisal to; discontinue this practice and to
write off all such capitalized expenses in the FY79 accounts.
5.03      The reasons for WASA's unsatisfactory financial performance are
as follows:
(a) Water sales account for only about 50% of water produced
each year; there are no satisfactory arrangements for
recovering the cost of water supplied through standpipes
and there are no satisfactory programs for the detection
of leakage or illegal connections or for waste prevention
(para 2.13).
(b) Cash collected, has generally not exceeded 70% of annual
billings (although an improvement to 83% 1/ was recorded
in FY79); and
(c) Expenses, staffing costs in particular, have increased
significantly (para 3.09).
Present Financial Position
5.04      WASA's estimated position at June 30, 1979, based on unaudited
accounts is as follows:

5.05      Despite the favorable appearance of WASA's balance sheet, the present
financial position is unsatisfactory for the following reasons:
(a) Fixed Asset Valuation
WASA has not maintained proper records of fixed assets whose
values are based on historic cost at the date of transfer
(1964) or subsequent acquisition. WASA has recently completed
a physical verification of its fixed assets and is proceeding
with a revaluation based on current replacement costs. The
satisfactory completion of this task a condition of effective-
ness for the proposed credit. WASA will be required to revalue
its fixed assets thereafter from time to time (para 5.12). 1/
(b)  Inventory Levels (Spare Parts)
Storekeeping arrangements are unsatisfactory and stores
records are not reconciled with the financial records. The
estimated value of inventories at end-FY79 greatly exceed
requirements -- excessive procurement has occurred from past
difficulties in obtaining foreign exchange. Many items in
the inventories are obsolete. WASA is carrying out a full
assessment and a physical check of all inventories. An
assurance was obtained that WASA will value its inventories
no later than end FY1980 and thereafter progressively reduce
its holdings to no more than three months' requirements by
end FY1982. GOB also gave an assurance that foreign exchange
will be made available to WASA to maintain this level of
inventories and import necessary spare parts expeditiously.
(c) Borrowing (GOB Loans)
WASA's only long-term debt comprises the proceeds of Credit
367-BD onlent by GOB for 30 years at 3% interest. 2/ The
extent of WASA's liability for the foreign exchange risk was
never satisfactorily defined by GOB. The loan is recorded
in WASA's accounts at its historic value. In view of WASA's
financial position GOB agreed at negotiations to bear the
foreign exchange risk on the loan.
1/   At negotiations it was agreed that WASA's fixed assets value would be
linked to a combined index of international and local prices to reflect
changes in the cost of equipment, materials and civil works; WASA's
fixed assets will be revalued when the index has increased by more than
10% since the previous valuation.
2/   In 1976, the original onlending terms (a 20-year loan at 8% interest)
were 'softened' in view of WASA's financial difficulties; GOB loans
were converted to equity at that time.



- 19 -
Revenues and Tariffs
5.06      The details of WASA's tariffs from its formation in 1964 are set
out in Annex 10. Since FY74, domestic charges have increased by 200%, indus-
trial by 330% and commercial by 350%. Most connected properties are metered
and are charge( according to consumption: the few remaining (180) unmetered
properties, presently charged on the basis of 7-1/2% of the assessed property
values, will be metered within the next 6 months. Connection charges have
remained unchanged since FY64 when WASA was formed. In order to encourage
domestic connections, such charges will not be increased and the costs of
connecting and metering will be recovered through WASA's tariffs. Future
non-domestic connections will be charged at full cost.
5.07      WASA presently receives no payment for the supply of water to public
standpipes and, in earlier years, the payment made by CMC was insufficient to
cover the cost of supplying water. In FY80, the cost of supplying such water,
calculated at the domestic tariff, is about Taka 3.3 million. At negotiations,
the following assurances were obtained from GOB:
(a) from FY80, CMC will pay for water consumed through public
standpipes at the prevailing domestic tariff: to this
end WASA has metered a representative number of standpipes;
and
(b) GOB will ensure that in future WASA receives prompt payment.
5.08      WASA presently supplies water to several GOB housing colonies in
Chittagong at a rate of Taka 1.5 per dwelling unit per quarter. At negotia-
tions, an assurance was obtained that GOB will from FY80 ensure payment for
such water at the prevailing domestic tariff.
5.09      In order to improve WASA's finances and produce a positive rate
of return on net fixed assets, GOB and WASA were requested, at appraisal,
to increase the domestic tariff to Taka 7/1,000 gallons and to introduce
a single non-domestic tariff of Taka 20/1,000 gallons for industrial and
commercial consumers (the latter would simplify administration). These
increases would have been sufficient to produce a 3% rate of return on
historically valued assets in FYs 1980 and 1981.
5.10      GOB authorized WASA to increase the domestic tariff from Taka 4.5
to 6/1,000 gallons and the industrial tariff from Taka 9 to 13/1,000 gallons
from September 1, 1979 but the commercial tariff was not increased. After
allowing for increased revenue from standpipe charges (para 5.07) and housing
colonies (para 5.08), the revised tariffs are unlikely to produce a positive
rate of return in FY80. WASA may, however, avoid a deficit if it can in-
crease water sales.
5.11      The announcement of a further increase in tariffs, with effect from
no later than September 1, 1980 and to the levels indicated in para 5.09, is
a condition of credit effectiveness. Such an increase will have little impact



- 20 -
on WASA's finances in FY80, but should provide a small positive rate of return
in FY81 on revalued assets (equivalent to about 3% on unrevalued assets).
5.12      Thereafter, further tariff increases will be required to provide
for WASA's contribution to the project (about 15% of total project costs) and,
subsequently, for future expansion of the supply system. At negotiations,
therefore, an assurance was obtained that WASA will review and set tariffs for
each fiscal year to ensure that:
(a) for the three years from July 1, 1981 (i.e., FYs 1982-84)
revenues are sufficient to cover operating and adminis-
trative expenses, depreciation and to provide a rate of
return of 2-1/2% on currently valued net fixed assets
(see para 5.05(a));
During this period, tariffs are unlikely to increase except to meet
inflation in view of the extra water available from new tubewells
after July 1, 1981.
(b) from July 1, 1984 (i.e., FY85), the rate of return on
currently valued net fixed assets will be increased to
3% in FY85, 4% in FY86, 5% in FY87 and 6% annually
thereafter.
On completion of the project in FY85, the average tariff,
expressed at FY80 prices, will be Taka 10/1,000 gallons
against the present Taka 9.2/1,000 gallons. These rates
are reasonable in relation to consumer's ability to pay
(para 6.15). Tariff increases may be needed in later
years to cover inflation.
Billing and Collection
5.13      Although WASA's billing and collection effort shows a slight improve-
ment in FY79, the record is generally unsatisfactory. Accounts receivable,
estimated at Taka 15.7 million at June 30, 1979 were equivalent to about 13
montlts' FY79 billings; less than 50% of the Taka 14.6 million billed in FY79
were collected during the year. The arrears included Taka 8.9 million in
respect of the Government sector. The current 5% late payment surcharge and
Taka 100 reconnection fee provide little incentive for prompt payment and
generally WASA has been slow to resort to disconnection. Government receiv-
ables were reduced to Taka 2.7 million prior to negotiations; a further
Taka 1.0 million will be paid before March 25, 1980 and all remaining arrears
will be cleared prior to disbursement.
5.14      Management must, therefore, give much greater priority to billing
and collection henceforth. Several disconnection squads have been formed
and a publicity campaign has been mounted. GOB has ensured that payment
of its departments bills no later than 30 days after receipt will be made;



- 21 -
and WASA will initiate a program of improvements to its billing and collec-
tion arrangements satisfactory to the Association to ensure that the level
of accounts receivable are progressively reduced to no more than four months'
billings by end FY81 and two months billing by end-FY82; the program will include
disconnection of delinquent consumers within 45 days of the overdue date and
more effective financial penalties for late payment and for reconr.ection of
supply.
Financing Plan
5.15      WASA's estimated financial requirements for the project period
FY80 through FY84 and the sources of funds are summarized in Table 5.3;
WASA has no firm plans for expenditure other than the project during this
period.

5.16      The proceeds of the IDA Credit of US$20 million will be made avail-
able to WASA by GOB at 7% interest over a period of 25 years, with five years
grace. 1/ GOB will bear any foreign exchange risk. An onlending agreement
satisfactory to IDA is a condition of effectiveness.
1/   The proposed terms are identical to those for the Second Dacca Water
Supply Project (Credit 941-BD), approved by the Board on June 26, 1979
and are appropriate to WASA's financial circumstances. A local deben-
ture issue over 25 years would have a 9% interest rate. Inflation in
recent years has been: FY76, 21%; FY77, 1%; FY78, 12%; and is estimated
at 10% annually for the next three years.



- 22 -
5.17      GOB's contribution to the project cost will be in the form of
equity and at negotiations an assurance was obtained from GOB that it will
ensure the availability of sufficient funds to complete the project.
5.18      To protect its future financial stability WASA is required not to
incur any long-term debt without IDA's prior agreement unless its maximum
future debt service is covered at least 1.25 times by its most recent 12
months' operating surplus before depreciation.
Future Finances
5.19      Financial projections for the period FY79 through FY88 are set out
in Annexes 11-13. Assumptions used to prepare the projections are set out
in Annex 14. Salient features of WASA's future finances, which are satis-
factory, are summarized in Table 5.4.

5.20      Key indicators which will be used in monitoring WASA's performance
are set out in Annex 15 and IDA's reporting requirements under the project
are set out in Annex 16.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
6.01      Until now, groundwater has provided all of Chittagong's needs.
The sweet water which could be pumped directly into supply without treatment
was fully exploited some time ago and any overdrawal now results in saline
water intruding into the aquifer.  The first project, which also used ground-
water exclusively, had to include means of removing the iron present in
solution. For the second project, a number of new sources available to
WASA were carefully considered. The choice lay between continued dependence
on groundwater abstraction alone; surface water abstraction alone and the
mixed use of groundwater and surface water.  The recommended choice is for a
mix of groundwater and surface water because it:
(a)  offers the least cost solution for capital investment
and annual operating costs;
(b)  provides the highest quality water with minimum iron
content;
(c)  utilizes the existing groundwater abstraction and treat-
ment works; and
(d)  provides an almost unlimited supply as a primary source.
6.02      The cost comparisons examined various groundwater abstraction
possibilities and two surface water choices, namely Kaptai Lake and the
rivers Karnaphuli/Halda. The least cost solution is the river abstraction
scheme allied with modified existing groundwater arrangements.
General Impact
6.03      The project will satisfy Chittagong's water supply needs until 1990
by which time, if population projections are realized, the first extension to
the Mohara plant should be operational. Under the project per capita supplies
for connected domestic properties will improve slightly, but the number of
people benefiting will multiply nearly threefold. Per capita consumption from
standpipes will nearly double even though the number of people dependent on
standpipes will increase by 50%. Industrial and commercial needs will be
adequately served, an important factor affecting WASA's viability and in the
end, its capacity to provide supplies to the poor.
Impact on the Urban Poor
6.04      Detailed information about the number of urban poor in Chittagong
is not available. However, about 45% of children and 27% of the whole



- 24 -
population suffer from malnutrition and, if adequacy of nutritional intake
is used as an indicator, about 30% of Chittagong's residents live below the
pove!rty line.
6.05      The location of the poor is indicated fairly well by population
density associated with local demand for standpipes. The number of political
unions in Chittagong increased from 15 to 25 in 1974 and to 41 in 1979; the
greatest number of standpipes and the most dense population is found in those
unions which formed the old city. Table 6.1 shows the population in the three
elements of the municipality and also the estimated numbers of urban poor.
Table 6.1

Total              7,740         477,000  147,500   750,000   238,700
6.06      In 1980 terms, improved supplies will be made available to 135,000
urban poor representing 28% of the total population and first time supplies
brought to a further 12,000 (3%). In 1990 terms, due to the expanding pop-
ulat ion in the outer unions the comparable figures will be 160,000 (22%)
and 75,000 (10%) respectively.
Impact on Health
6.07      Waterborne diseases are endemic in Bangladesh; all diarrheal
diseases taken together have mortality and prevalence rates of 3.5 and 16.5
per 1,000 respectively (1976 figures). The relationship between mortality
and prevalence is probably accurate, but the figures are based on reported
cases which may understate the actual problem by a factor as large as ten. 1/
Annual figures do not reveal seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of water
borne diseases.
6.08      There is a high incidence of scabies and other skin diseases largely
due to the lack of the readily accessible quantities of water needed to main-
tain a reasonable standard of personal hygiene.
1/   Cholera Research Laboratory Report for 1977.



- 25 -
6.09      The health impact of inadequate water and sewerage services most
greatly affect the poor who cannot afford privately owned facilities such as
storage tanks, pumps and septic tanks. Because their resistance is lowered
by malnutrition, they are easy victims of disease. Health authorities are
convinced that the first priority in combating disease among the poor is
improved sanitation and hygiene, for which improved water supply and sani-
tation are essential prerequisites. GOB, through their Health Education
Department, have made arrangements for a program for training voluntary health
workers and for public education by means of posters, hand drills and leaflets;
radio and television. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that GOB will
introduce the program not later than September 1, 1980.
6.10      The project will also provide for studies to evolve a project which
may mix sewerage and pit latrines tailored to Chittagong's economic status.
Economic Rate of Return
6.11      The incremental revenues, based on the present tariffs, accruing to
WASA are assumed as a proxy for the minimum level of benefits arising under
the project. The incremental revenues include public standpipe consumption
charged at the domestic rate (para 5.07) which accounts for about 20% of total
water consumption. Using the cost and revenue streams set out in Annex 17 the
rate of return is 8.3% or, if labor is valued at 70% of market value, 8.9%.
This is a satisfactory return on investment in the water supply sector.
Marginal Cost and Tariffs
6.12      The average incremental cost (AIC) of water has been calculated
from the data set out in Annex 1. At a 10% discount rate, the AIC is
Taka 9.2/1,000 gallons which compares with the present tariff of Taka 8.85/
1,000 1/ gallons (and a domestic tariff of Taka 6/1,000 gallons). The
average tariff will be revised in the future to satisfy financial goals
and will by FY85 exceed AIC (para 5.12).
6.13      Cross-subsidization of the domestic consumer in the present tariff
structure (Annex 10) is justified for social reasons and should continue
particularly as the number of house connections is to be greatly expanded
to provide benefits to many families who presently obtain water from public
standpipes.
Ability to Pay
6.14      On completion of the project, two-thirds of Chittagong's popula-
tion will obtain an adequate, safe and free water supply from public stand-
pipes. The cost of this supply, calculated at the domestic tariff, will be
borne by the municipality from its general revenues, and will amount to
about Taka 10 per family of five per month (at FY80 prices). The cost will
be subsidized by non-domestic consumers.
1/   The average tariff will rise to Taka 9.2/1,000 gallons without a
further increase in tariff rates as a result of the increased avail-
ability of water to industry under the project.



- 26 -
6.15      The remaining one-third of the population is expected to have
water connections for which a monthly charge will be made based on metered
consumption. The monthly charge will increase from a present Taka 33 per
family of five to about Taka 36 per family in FY85 (at FY80 prices). A
monthly charge of Taka 36 per family for a connected water supply probably
represents at most about 2-1/2% of monthly incomes. This increase is reason-
able with regard to the present income levels of most of those families.
Statistics on recent personal income for Chittagong are not available but the
1974 family expenditure survey indicated that the monthly household expendi-
ture of the upper one-third of urban households in Bangladesh exceeded Taka
700 at that time. A monthly charge of Taka 36 for water supply is about 5%
of this minimum level of expenditure. Family incomes and expenditures have,
however, risen substantially since 1974; the cost of living index for middle
income families in Dacca, Chittagong and Khulna, has risen from 100 in 1973/74
to 210 in December 1978.
Risks
6.16      The range of risks is no greater than is usual in Bangladesh.  The
physical risks which may affect the project are, if anything, rather less than
those normally expected where operations of this type are concerned; the work
is no more difficult than that carried out under the first project and is in
the same general area with substantially the same soil conditions. Close
support by GOB will be needed to effect the intended improvements to WASA's
financial and general administrational performance.
VII. PROPOSED AGREEMENTS
7.01      During negotiations the following agreements and understandings
were reached. (Annex 18)
(a)  Key appointments will be made to strengthen management
accounting and billing and collection (para 3.07).
(b)  All sites, other than tube-well sites, and easements
have been obtained or may be obtained without difficulty
(para 4.16);
(c)  GOB accepted the responsibility for foreign exchange risk
for Credit 367-BD (para 5.05(c);
(d)  GOB arrears will be cleared (para 5.14(a));
(e)  WASA will take over responsibility for all domestic supplies
within their service area (para 2.10);
(f)  WASA will prepare   a program to license abstractions
(para 2.11);



- 27 -
(g) No changes to WASA's organizational structure without

BANGLADESH
SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Recommendation on Training (Dacca and Chittagong)
1.        The training components to be financed under the Second Dacca Water
and Sewerage Project should include provisions for setting up and developing
the local training resources and expertise required to design and implement
systematic training programs both on and off-the-job. Priority attention
should be given to meeting basic and refresher training needs at the sub-
professional employment levels, particularly those of about 100 sub-assistant
engineers collectively employed by WASA. Training programs should also be
introduced for commercial and administrative support staff in addition to the
more manpower intensive area of operation and maintenance of pumping, water
treatment and water distribution plant and systems. The initial portfolio
of training programs should be developed in the form of a series of self-
contained training modules, complete with simple training aids, models and
manuals, relating to the following work activities:
(a) mains and service pipe laying and jointing;
(b) sewer inspection and maintenance;
(c) treatment plant operations;
(d) tubewell and pumping operations;
(e) pressure and flow recording;
(f) waste detection and prevention;
(g) water meter installation, calibration and repair;
(h) water meter reading;
(i) maintenance of standby equipment;
(j) billing and revenue accounting;
(k) store keeping; and
(1) occupational safety and hygiene.
2.        The detailed design and implementation of the training program
would require the assistance of a training consultant retained for this pur-
pose on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
3.        The existing site of the Dacca meter repair/laboratory premises
would provide a most suitable location for the development of a training unit
which should initially comprise the following:
(a) one open sided training bay with a hard standing gradient
floor and charged but replaceable water pipes with pressure
gauges for basic and refresher training in mains and service
laying, maintenance, repair and modification of pipework
systems;



- 33 -                         ANNEX 4
Page 2
(b) one small training workshop for stripping, assembly,
adjustment and maintenance of electrical, mechanical and
pumping equipment, valves and hydrants, and
(c) a training store.
During the development phase the training unit should be administered as an
extension of the services currently provided by the WASA's Secretariat. A
full time training staff should be established which, in order to cover
training both on and off-the-job, should comprise three instructors drawn
from existing sub-assistant engineers (possibly on rotation), and headed
up by a training officer at assistant engineer level. At least one instructor
should be nominated by Chittagong WASA.
4.        Overall supervision of the training scheme should be vested in a
Joint Training Committee with appropriate representation from each Dacca
and Chittagong WASA. The Chairman of each WASA could possibly alternate as
Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Training Committee which, inter alia, would
screen and approve the annual training budget. The Joint Training Committee
would be required to draw up a policy statement on training which would
give effect to the operation, direction, priorities and financing of the
overall manpower development program.
5.        In addition to the management and operation of the training unit,
the training staff, assisted by the training consultant and guided by the
Joint Training Committee, would formulate and implement, within the project
period, an overall training plan for specialized, semi-specialized and non-
specialized staff, incorporating, where appropriate, the local and/or national
vocational training and technical education facilities which exist in the
public sector. A complementary objective would be the creation of a stronger
link between the water sector and the formal education sector.
6.        The selection of candidates, if any, for overseas fellowships and
training attachments/secondments should be made and arranged in conjunction
with the fellowship programs being provided under the current UNDP project.
7.        The proposed training program should include provision for establish-
hing, from within WASA's existing manpower resources, a service laying/house
connection capability. Failing this, or until this is achieved, all licensed
private plumbers should be obliged to undergo, and successfully complete,
relevant training provided through the joint training scheme, in order to
remain under license to WASA.

SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
Hist:ory
1.        Chittagong's first public water supply dates back to 1916 with three
tubewells as the source. The system was not extended in any significant way
unti.l the 1940s when a few additional tubewells were installed. IDA first
took an interest in Chittagong Water Supply in 1963 and at that time water
production was about 13 mid (3 mgd) and the system extended to about 22 miles
of mains.
2.        The 1963, IDA supported, project included a river intake and treat-
ment plant on the river Halda rated at 30 mgd, about 4 miles of trunk mains
and 72 miles of secondary mains. The project also included a sewerage ele-
ment (see para 7).
3.        The project proved to be too ambitious and was revised; the river
abstraction scheme was dropped and tubewells took its place. The length of
mains was reduced and the sewerage element was removed from the project.
Under the modified first IDA project, the following were the principal works
which were included and completed in 1978:
(i) Completion of 13 tubewells (making a total of 14
tubewells at Kalurghat.
(ii) Iron removal plant and pumping installation.
(iii) 33 miles of water mains.
(iv) 3 mg service reservoir (Battali Hill).
Water Supply Under the Proposed.Project
4.        The project will provide additional supplies to Chittagong through
the development of a 90 mld (20 mgd) river abstraction at Mohara near the
junction of the rivers Karnaphuli and Halda together with a rapid gravity
water filtration plant and pumping station. To cater for growing demand
during the construction period six new tubewells will be sunk. As four of
the tubewells will be in the Kalurghat well field the water produced will be
processed at the iron removal plant which will be increased in capacity from
45 to 68 mld. The increased throughput will be obtained by increasing the
capacity of channels and pumping arrangements and by using anthracite instead

of sand as a filtering medium. Physical changes will be minimized and
throughput will be allowed to revert to 45-50 mld after the Mohara plant
becomes operational. Water production will be increased from 57 mld
(12.5 mgd) to 135 mld (30 mgd) in 1990.
5.        The water main reticulation will be increased by about 26-1/2
miles of trunk mains and about 25-1/2 miles of distribution mains. Pressure
will be provided by the main pumping installations at Mohara and Kalurghat;
two booster pumping stations will be constructed at Dacca Trunk Road and
Patenga to ensure adequate pressure at the system's extremities. The addi-
tional supplies of water will allow benefit to be obtained from the 14 ml
reservoir on Battali Hill and a new 5 ml reservoir will be constructed on
ADC's Hill. These major reservoirs will adequately reinforce a number of
minor service reservoirs already in use.
6.        The project includes 14,000 service connections with meters.
Provision will also be made for district metering and all places of water
production will be metered; metering of standpipe consumption will also be
introduced. The comprehensive metering program, when completed, will
enable WASA to account for water produced and distributed.
7.        The 1963 project included a sewerage element but this was
dropped in the revised 1973 project. Chittagong has no sewers; disposal
of excreta is either by septic tanks or by night soil conservancy methods.
CMC runs the night soil collection system and employs between 350 and 400
sweepers to do so. Night soil is collected at four holding tanks
(Namunabajag, Jhowtala, Khatungang and Bawan Bazar). Two of the tanks are
discharged to the river and the contents of the others dumped outside the
city. The project provides for employment of consultants to study the
situation and make recommendation for sewers (where these are essential)
and water seal pit latrines and similar inexpensive means of disposal
suitably mixed to meet Chittagong's economic circumstances.

BANGLADESH
SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        Financial projections for WASA have been prepared for the period
through FY88 using FY79 actual and FY80 budget figures as a base. Some
changes were made to WASA's balance sheet at June 30, 1979 to reflect
correct accounting treatment (Chapter V, para 5.04); the modified balance
sheet has been used as the basis for future projections.
INCOME STATEMENT (Annex 11)
Revenues
2.   The present (September 1979) average tariff of Taka 8.85/1,000 gallons
has been projected taking into account:
(a) assumed increases in water consumption by different user
categories between FY80 and FY88 (Annex 2);
(b) WASA's. financial targets -- the need to cover increases
in operating costs and depreciation arising from newly
commissioned plant and an estimated 10% annual rate of
inflation and to produce the rates of return on net
fixed assets specified in Chapter V, para 5.12;
(c) the agreement by GOB that Chittagong municipality will
pay for all water consumed at standpipes at the posted
domestic tariff;
(d) an allowance has been made for bad debts: 5% of billings
in FY80 declining to 2-1/2% of billings in FY88.
Operating Costs
3.        Forecast direct operating costs (labor, power, chemicals and
materials) are based upon present budgeted levels adjusted annually for
increases in the level of water production. Collection costs have been
increased by 2-1/2% annually from FY82 to reflect increased water sales.
All costs have been escalated by 10% annually to FY85 and 8% thereafter
for local inflation.
4.        Depreciation has been calculated at an overall rate of 3-1/2%
annually on the value of gross fixed assets in operation.



- 45 -                         ANNEX 14
Page 2
5.        Administrative costs have not been increased after FY80 in accord-
ance with the objective of limiting the growth of staff numbers (para 3.09);
10% has been added annually to cover wage increases and inflation.
FLOW OF FUNDS STATEMENT (Annex 12)
Source of Funds
6.        Forecasts show WASA generating a 17% contribution towards the
project costs from FY80 through FY84 after meeting debt service. External
sources, comprising an IDA credit of US$20 million and GOB funds in the
form of equity, will complete the financing of the project. 1/ WASA is
assumed to finance the whole program of extensions to the distribution
system after FY84 and will contribute substantially to further work to
increase post-1990 water production capacity.
Application of Funds
7.        It is assumed that WASA will execute the project between FY80
and FY84; interest during the construction period will be added to the
project cost. A program of extensions to the distribution system will
be required through 1990 to utilize the full capacity of the supply system.
WASA has no firm investment plans beyond FY84 but some works to expand
water production capacity have been assumed from FY86.
Debt Service
8.        WASA's debt service obligations will be as follows:
(a) Credit 367-BD for the first project -- repayment, by
way of a 3%, 20-year annuity from FY83 when the grace
period for principal and interest terminates; until
FY83 interest will continue to be added to the exist-
ing Taka value of the loan.
(b) The proceeds of the US$20 million IDA Credit for the
second project will be onlent by GOB at 7% interest
for 25 years, including a five-year grace period for
the principal amount; debt service based on a 7%,
20-year annuity will commence in FY85.
1/   Consumer contribution have not been assessed (para 5.06) but their
impact will be to reduce GOB's equity contribution to WASA.

BALANCE SHEET (Annex 13)
Fixed Assets
9.        Pending a revaluation of fixed assets by WASA, a 50% revaluation
of gross fixed assets has been assumed during FY80; and thereafter an 8%
annual revaluation has been assumed to maintain values on a current basis.
SimiLarly, accumulated depreciation has been adjusted in WASA's balance
sheet. A rate of return has been calculated on revalued net fixed assets.
10.       Work in progress comprises the project expenditure to FY84 and
some future works to expand capacity after FY84. Commissioned works have
been transferred to fixed assets in operation in FY82 and FY84 on completion
of the project.
Current Assets
11.       It is assumed that inventories will be reduced from the present
excessive level to the equivalent of three months requirements by end FY82
(para 5.05(b)).
12.       It is assumed that accounts receivable from consumers will be
progressively reduced as a percentage of billings from 35% in FY80, to 32%
in FY81 and to 16% in FY82 (i.e., two months billings).
Current Liabilities
13.       Accounts payable have been estimated at 12-1/2% of total operating
costs before depreciation (i.e., about six weeks' costs).
14.       Current maturities represent the amortization element of debt
serviice due in the following fiscal year.
Equity
15.       Equity comprises:
(a) WASA's initial capital;
(b) GOB's contributions towards the first and second project;
(c) the accumulated surplus arising from the revaluation of
WASA's fixed assets..
(d) the accumulated deficit through FY85 and surplus there-
after arising from WASA's operations.

Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
1.        The economic rate of return for the project is calculated as
follows:
(a)  all costs and benefits are expressed in constant July
1979 prices.
(b)  the major part of the investment will be made between
FY80-84 but a program of extentions to the distribution
system until FY89 will be needed to utilize the full
20 mgd extra supply capacity under the project; an
average 40 year life is assumed with no residual value.
(c)  investment costs are net of duties and taxes; interest
during construction is excluded from the ERR calculation.
(d)  foreign equipment and material costs are expressed in CIF
terms; local construction costs and the incremental operat-
ing and maintenance costs are converted to border prices
using a standard conversion factor of 0.75.
(e)  the labor component, which comprises about 30% of local
costs, is valued at full market price and 70% of market
price.
(f)  revenues based on the present average tariff of Taka 8.85/
1,000 gallons and converted to border prices using a
standard 0.75 factor, are taken as a proxy to establish
a minimum benefit stream.
