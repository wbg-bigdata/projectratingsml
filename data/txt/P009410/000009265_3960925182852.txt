SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1001-BD)
PREFACE
This Report presents the results of a performance review of the
Second Chittagong Water Supply Project for which Credit No. 1001-BD of US$20
million was made to the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
(GOB) in April, 1980. The credit became effective in April 1981 and was
closed in December 31, 1987. The implementing agency was the Chittagong Water
Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA).
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Infrastructure
Operations Division of Asia Country Department 1, assisted by a consultant who
visited Chittagong briefly for this purpose in June 1987. It is based on
information obtained from a review of the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 2701b-BD), the President's Report (No.P2732-BD), the credit and project
agreements, and other reports related to project implementation.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the cofinancing agencies
for comments but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1001-BD)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The  Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) was
established in 1963 in conjunction with the first IDA credit for a Water
Supply and Sewerage Project in Chittagong. The first project (Cr. 367-BD,
substantially reduced in scope) was completed in 1978.
2.        As conceived, the first project included a river intake and
treatment plant on the river Halda and the trunk mains needed to transport
treated water to the city; the project also included a sewerage element.
These project components were all dropped and tubewells were substituted for
the river scheme. The tubewells were developed at Kalurghat as an integrated
well-field and, because of the high iron content of the ground water, included
an iron-removal plant.
3.        The second project as developed by CWASA and its consultants
revived the river intake idea; the project also provided for improvements to
the iron removal plant at Kalurghat.
4.        The project was appraised in July 1979 and was expected to be
completed by the end of 1984. Actual completion of the major facility, the
Mohara Water Treatm.ent plant, was not achieved until the end of 1987 and the
remaining major works by September 1988. This was due initially to delay, on
the part of the Government (GOB) for nearly a year, in appointing consultants,
shortage of local currency and a long delay (again nearly a year) in selecting
the main contractor for the intake works and water treatment plant at Mohara.
5.        Actual project costs totalled Taka 1,113.69 million (US$40.9
million) compared to the appraised estimate of Taka 615 million (US$39.7
million). A total of US$20.0 million of the IDA credit was disbursed.
6.        Although some new tubewells have been added to Chittagong's assets,
these have been to some extent offset by the aging and retirement of existing
wells. Water production during the project period has therefore increased
only slightly from about 14.8 mgd in 1982 to about 15.69 mgd in 1986, or about
62.  However, commissioning of the Mohara plant has made available an
additional 20 mgd, more than doubling the available supply.
7.        Revenues based on water sales have increased steadily during the
project period from Taka 26.73 million in 1982 to Taka 63.09 million itl IR8
(13.6%). This is not due to any significant increase in quantity of water
sold but to increases in tariff rates. Domestic rate in Taka/1000 gallons has
increased from 4.5 in FY 1979 to 15.99 in FY 1986 (by stages through 6.7 and
10 Takaf1000 gallons).



-vi-
8.        The delays experienced in appointing consultants and awarding major
contracts resulted in increased project costs and deferral of project
benefits. However, with the commissioning of the major water treatment and
transmission facilities, CWASA found itself in the unusuaal position of being
able to supply water in quantities exceeding demand. CWASA also found that
with increased system pressures, it had to carry out an urgent program to
repair major leaks throughout the distribution system. While that program
dealt effectively with major, easily determined leaks, a further comprehensive
program to reduce total unaccounted for water remains to be taken up under the
next project. Meantime, in recognition of the urgent need to improve
operating performance, CWASA has initiated a pilot program of unaccounted for
water reduction. CWASA's financial performance has not improved as quickly as
anticipated. This is a reflection of the Government's unwillingness to agree
to implement the significant tariff increases needed if CWASA is to improve
its financial position and achieve compliance with credit covenants.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
SECOND CHITTAGONG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1001-BD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     IDA first became involved in the water supply and sewerage sector
in 1963, when credits were originally made to Pakistan to help finance
projects to improve sector services in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong.
Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities were established in both cities in
1963 to implement these projects. In 1985, some 5.3 million of the
estimated Bangladesh population of 98.1 million lived in Dhaka and
Chittagong.
1.02     The provision of water supply and sanitation services throughout
the rest of Bangladesh is basically the responsibility of the Ministry of
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives. The chairmen of
the Water Supply and Sewerage Authorities in Dhaka (DWASA) and Chittagong
(CWASA) report to this Ministry.
1.03     The first project started when Chittagong was still a city of East
Pakistan. Initially the project was intended to include an intake on the
River Halda at Mohara and a water treatment plant with some four miles of
trunk mains and 72 miles of secondary mains. The project also included a
sewerage element. The war of independence stopped project activity but it
was revived in 1973 although on a reduced scale; the river abstraction
scheme was dropped and tubewells took Its place. The length of mains was
reduced and the sewerage element eliminated. Under the modified project
the following principal works were completed in 1978:
(a) 13 tubewells;
(b) Iron removal plant and pumping installation;
(c) 33 miles of mains; and
(d) Battali Hill service reservoir (3 million gallons capacity).
1.04     The second project was intended to meet the growing demand for
water exerted by domestic and industriallcommercial consumers by developing
at Mohara the river intake and treatment plant excised from the first
project. In addition, by modifying the Kalurghat iron removal plant- and
through mixing with treated water from Mohara, water of improved quality
would be produced.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     The second project evolved directly from the first which had been
based on a comprehensive master plan prepared by CWASA's consultants
in 1960. The first project had provided additional supplies of water, but
demand was such that the 24 hour supply which some zones enjoyed was
quickly eroded. Chittagong needed much more water than could conveniently
be provided from the groundwater aquifers, and so the river abstraction
scheme deleted from the first project was revived. CWASA and its
consultants prepared an outline scheme and this was appraised in December
1980.
Project Objectives
2.02     The project was designed to satisfy Chittagong's water
requirements until 1990. The number of people benefitting from the
increased supplies multiplied nearly threefold, but in consequence, per
capita supplies only improved slightly.
2.03     At appraisal some 290,000 people depended on standpipes and this
number was expected to increase to about 320,000 by completion; however
the project aimed at doubling the per capita supplies available to this
poorer section of the community.
2.04     The project also was to double the number of people benefitting
from house connections from about 100,000 to 200,000.
2.05     Although the project did not include a sewerage element, it
provided for studies to evolve a project offering a mix of latrines in the
outer parts of the city and sewers in the heavily built up areas where
latrines would be inappropriate.
Pro3ect Description
2.06     The project was designed to provide an additional 20 mgd from a
new source on the River Halda and 5 mgd from groundwater. Works included
an intake and a surface water treatment plant at Mohara, six tubewells,
modifications to the existing iron removal plant at Kalurghat, trunk and
distribution mains, two booster pumping stations, a service reservoir
(1 mg) and staff quarters (Annex 1). Institutional development included
training, establishment of leak detection and waste prevention units and
setting of targets for financial performance and operating efficiency. The
original and revised components are as follows:

2.07     The project also included workshops, offices, stores, vehicles
and miscellaneous equipment to assist CWASA in operating the water supply
system. Consulting services were included to assist in the implementation
of the project. The final item in the project was staff training,
primarily for operational staff.
Negotiations and Special Conditions
2.08     Credit negotiations took place in Washington during the second
week of January 1980. The Government of Bangladesh and CWASA were
represented by a delegation headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRDC).
2.09     Based on experience of the first project, the following sperial
conditions were specified in the legal agreements:
(a) CWASA shall by June 30, 1984, take over from private and other
suppliers the responsibility for supplying all domestic water in
Chittagong (para 3.02 Project Agreement).



-4-
(b)  CWASA shall prepare a program designed to enhance water  waste
detection and prevention; and meter repair in accordance with
sound water engineering methods and practices, and thereafter
carry out the said program (para 3.03 Project Agreement).
(c)  CWASA shall prepare and establish, by September 1, 198(, a  staff
training program, acceptable to the Association in conjunction
with the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (para 3.04
Project Agreement).
(d)  CWASA shall meter a representative number of public standpipes in
order to determine the approximate amount of water consumed
through all public standpipes in Chittagong (para 3.05 Project
Agreement).
(e)  CWASA shall employ a counterpart of its commercial manager  with
such qualifications and upon such terms and conditions as are
satisfactory to the Association (para 3.06 Project Agreement).
(f)  CWASA shall afford the Association a reasonable opportunity  to
comment on any proposed reorganisation of CWASA unich may affect
adversely the operations or finan .ial condition of CWASA or the
carrying out of the project (para 3.07 (b) Project Agreement).
(g)  CWASA shall establish and carry out a program satisfactory to the
Association, to improve its billing and collection practices and
procedures and to reduce progressively its accounts receivable to
a level of not more than two months billings by June 30, 1982
(para 4.06 Project Agreement).
(h)  CWASA shall introduce an interim water tariff increase to Taka 7
(domestic uses) and Taka 20 (non-domestic uses) per 1000 gallons,
such interim tariff increase to be effective not later than
September 1, 1980 (para 4.08 Project Agreement).
(i)  CWASA shall annually review, set and maintain water tariffs at a
rate which is sufficient to cover operating and administrative
expenses and straight-line depreciation and to produce at least
the following annual rates of return on the current value of net
fixed assets in operation:
(i) 22 for the period of three years commencing July 1, 1981;
(ii)  32 for the year commencing July 1, 1984;
(iii) 41 for the year commencing July 1, 1985:
(iv)  5% in the year commencing July 1, 1986; and
(v)  6% annually thereafter (para 4.09 (a) Project Agreement).
2.10     CWASA's successes and failures in complying witk these conditions
are discussed in subsequent sections of this report.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Procurement
3.01     International competitive bidding procedures were followed for
materials and equipment including water meters and for the major civil
works at Mohara and for trunk mains. The margin of preference for local
manufacturers of materials and equipment was 15% and for domestic
contractors for civil works 72.
3.02     CWASA was familiar with international competitive bidding
procedures and Association requirements from the first project.
Nevertheless although procedures were satisfactory in most cases,
difficulties which caused delays arose on major contracts.
3.03     It was intended that the project would be completed in four years
(by the end of 1985) whereas it took until the end of 1987 before
substantial completion was reached. There are a number of reasons for the
wide difference between expectation and reality.
3.04     Under the first project, CWASA engaged an international
consultant. The outline proposals on which the second project was
appraised were also prepared by that consultant in support of CWASA.
However the Government and CWASA decided to open the consultancy to
competition for the detailed design and supervision of construction of the
second project works. This was not a reflection on the first consultant,
who had given CWASA good service for many years (since 1963) but arose from
a desire to introduce an element of competition. Appointment of
consultants was a condition of effectiveness, but the process of selection
took so long that, although the credit had been signed in April 1980,
effectiveness was delayed until April 1981.
3.05     There was a lack of adequate counterpart funding during the first
two years of the project. The effect of this shortage was countrywide and
not limited to this project, but it was one of the factors which brought
about delay.
3.06     Delays also arose over difficulties with contractors on the key
project component--Mohara Water Treatment Plant and the associated raw
water intake and pumping station. These two items were not collected into
a single contract but became separate contracts C7 and C6A respectively.
3.07     The award of the main contract (C7), normally a task requiring
about two months, took nearly nine months. The consultants recnmmendp(e the
lowest responsive tenderer (although second lowest of all bids rvr.'iv'd.
and 52 higher than the engineer's estimate). CWASA wanted to retender on
the basis it was higher than the engineer's estimate. IDA objected on the
basis that the lowest evaluated bid was only 5% above the estimate: fresh
tenders would likely result in higher bids; additional consultant cost
would be incurred during retendering and the benefit of additional supply
from the new facility would be delayed for up to a year.



-6-
3.08     Contract C6A was awarded in August 1984 to a local contractor (for
completion in 15 months) to a local contractor. On the basis of
unsatisfactory performance, the contractor was requested to leave the site
about a year later. The consultant recommended adding the work to the C7
contract. CWASA added the raw water pumping station to C7 but the
remainder of C6A was compiled into contract C6C and offers taken from the
original bidders. The C7 contractor's tender was lowest and it was sent to
the Government for approval. Unfortunately the Government only agreed
after the validity period had expired. The contractor requested an
increase, but the request was rejected. New bids were taken and again the
C7 contractor was lowest. This time it was accepted, but the contract was
not awarded until October 1986.
3.09     The destruction of electrical switchgear in transit was another
(and rather unusual) cause of delay to contract 07.
3.10     Kalurghat operations were also hit by delays in procurement.  The
works included new filters which, on commissioning, could permit
modification to be made to the existing filters. Tardy payments to the
contractor constructing the new filters and the delay in receiving foreign
parts led to serious delays in completing the work.
Project Costs
3.11     The final cost of the project was Taka 1,113.00 million or Taka
498 million (81X) more than the appraisal estimate of Taka 615 million.
Table 3.1 summarizes and compares the actual costs with the appraisal
estimate. The increase in project scope, the four and a half year delay in
completion and the devaluation of the Taka all contributed to the cost
increase.
3.12     The actual project costs expressed in US dollars totalled US$42.4
million or only 72 higher than the appraisal estimate of US$39.7 million
because the value of the Taka fell from 15 to over 30 to the dollar. Table
3.2 summarizes the actual project expenditures and the average exchange
rates in each year.
Disbursements
3.13     By December 1984, when the project was originally expected to be
completed, only about 40? of the credit had been disbursed and indeed
disbursement took seven and a half years instead of four and a half years
originally envisaged. Disbursement delays merely reflected the delays in
implementations already discussed. Annex 4 compares actual disbursements
with the appraisal estimate.

3.14     Disbursements under the credit are summarized in Table 3.3.  Some
fourteen major contracts accounted for about 451 of the disbursements.
Local firms executed all of the civil works contracts except for two major
exceptions which were won by foreign firms; these two contacts were for the
intake and treatment plant at Mohara.

Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.15     A change in the consultants acting for CWASA (after the previous
consultant had done so for 20 years) invites comparison. The original firm
tended to help CWASA in areas which were properly the province of CWASA
itself, e.g., on maintenance. The new consultants directed their attention
fully towards the task for which they were engaged, and this probably
resulted in a more formal relationship between themselves and CWASA than
had previously been the case.  However, that firm and its local associate
provided the requisite professionally skilled staff to prepare the detailed
designs and contract documents to a high standard and to supervise
execution of works quite adequately. Additionally, the consultants
provided a considerable degree of training, particularly in respect of
operational training in running the new treatment plant. Courses were
provided and expatriate staff ensured that an adequate number of operatives
gained experience in working with the various treatment units, including
experimenting with these units in determining operational norms.
3.16     The main contractors on civil works, (i.e. contract C7) performed
well and completed the river intake, the raw water pumping station and the
water treatment plant to a satisfactory standard of quality. The original
contractor for the river intake, a local firm, proved to be unequal to the
task and had to be expelled. This was one of the more serious causes of
delay in completion of the project.
3.17     There were also contracts where progress was disappointfing dti:r  i.
difficulties arising between the contractor and CWASA over matters
concerning payments, opening of letters of credit and debates about extent
of contract.
3.18     Contract C8B was for the provision and installation of generators
and was awarded to an international supplier. The equipment was duly
delivered but some parts were missing and, as drawings were not provided,



-9-
installation presented great difficulty. The contractor finally was
expelled from the site in 1987 and the installation contract retendered.
The new contract was signed in July 1988 and work is expected to be
completed by the end of 1988.
3.19     Generally, however CWASA expressed satisfaction with the
performance of civil works contractors both foreign and local and also
with the equipment suppliers with the above noted exceptions.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     Under the project, six new tubewells were to be provided.  The
final number was ten. Nevertheless during the project period, old wells
were closed off and the number of wells in operation did not change
much, as is shown in the following table.

*    Some old wells have been replaced.
*    Due to full operation of treatment plant some wells were not required
to be fully utilized.
For many yeats IDA has advocated the practice of metering of all means of
production. In many cases production figures (and this includes CWASA)
were based oll flow calculations using hours of operation, electrical
consumption and rated pump efficiency. As a result of introducing a
metering program and the accurate recording of pump operations at all
tubewells, CWASA determined that actual water production was about 157
lower than previously reported. This means only that the water put into
supply was over-represented and consequently unaccounted for water was also
over-represented (since consumers were being metered). Basic operating
data is shown in Table 4.1.

4.02       Unaccounted for water amounted to about 452 of production, and
CWASA set up a unit to improve on this figure. The unit was led by a
Superintending Engineer reporting directly to the Chairman. The unit
had six teams each led by an Assistant Engineer. The area of supply was
divided into sixteen zones and the six teams canvassed the entire service
area to.
(a) review the arrears status of each account;
(b) inspect premises, verify existence of connections and register
them;
(c) record illegal connections and by-passes;
(d) record obvious leakages;
(e) record defective meters or absence of meters; and
(f) verify that billing was done according to actual readings, was
underbilled or was done on average consumption.
The unit reviewed team results and informed the Commercial Manager of
priority arrears accounts and of improperly billed accounts; and informed
the Chief Engineer of defective meters, apparent leakages and accounts to
be disconnected. Results were impressive with potential billings increased
by over 302 and the problem of defective meters clearly identified.
4.03     The meter repair shop improved its effectiveness over the course
of the project despite an increased work-load. However it had started
from a very low base line and was still unable to make a real impression on
the numbers of inoperative meters on consumers connections. Meters procured
under the project had to be examined and corrected on site by the
manufacturer's representatives. All spare mechanisms were adjusted in the
meter repair shop before use. The meters procured under the first project
continued to give good service. In retrospect, standardization of the
meters would have helped as the supply from two different manufacturers add
to difficulty in repair.
4.04     The project included 14,000 new connections.  CWASA completed
5,000 by June 1987 and stepped up its activity now that additional water
production is available from Mohara. Targets were 5,000 and 4,000 for 1988
and 1989 respectively.
4.05     Although the project did not include a sewerage element, it
provided for a sewerage/sanitation study. This was completed and a report
submitted in 1984 by a local firm in association with an internaticnit
firm.
4.06     Chittagong Municipality, aided by UNICEF, engaged in a program of
developing water-sealed pit latrines. The program started late in 1985
about 2,500 have been completed. The Chittagong Municipality proposes to
eliminate all bucket latrines (about 20,000) by 1991.

V. FINANCIAL PERPORMANCE
Operating Results
5.01     Appraisal estimates and actual results for CWASA's Income
Statement for the FY 1983-1988 Sources and Application of Funds and Balance
Sheets for financial years 1979-1988 are provided in Annexes 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Financial highlights are shown in table 5.1. During implementation, it
became apparent that the 62 ROR covenant was inappropriate. A tacit
understanding was reached with IDA missions that CWASA's medium term target
should be 31 and to realize a positive rate of return (ROR) immediately -
since ROR have been largely negative.
5.02     The draft Appraisal Report stated that "...the reasons for WASA's
unsatisfactory financi&l performance are as follows:
(a) Water sales account for only about 50% of water produced each
year; there are no satisfactory arrangements for recovering the
cost of water supplied through standpipes and there are no
satisfactory programs for the detection of leakage or illegal
connections or for waste prevention.
(b) Cash collected, has generally not exceeded 702 of annual
billings (although an improvement to 83% 1/ was recorded in
FY79); and
(c) Expenses, staffing costs in particular, have increased
significantly.'
Although progress has been made, CWASA's financial position remained
unsatisfactory.
5.03     As a condition of effectiveness, CWASA undertook to increase
tariffs to Taka 7 (domestic) and Taka 20 (non-domestic) per 1,000 gallons
not later than September 1, 1980. The 'ncrease was made but not until
October 15, 1980. Thereafter tariffs were raised as follows:
Date       10/15188        07101/88    06(10/88   02/88
Domestic       7            10           12.5        10X
Non-Domestic  20            28           35.0
Details of CWASA's tariff structure since 1964 are at Annpx a.
These increases were more than offset by the effects of inflation.
1/ Cash collected in FY79 in respect of billings in FY79 is about 50%.
The balance of collections was for billings in prior years.

5.04     Financially, while the Government's unpaid billings present
continuing problems (which needs to be solved at Mini3terial level),
significant progress has been made in several ways. Standpipe water is
being paid for on a quarterly basis (even if the Chittagong Municipal
Corporation (CMC) is not involved in the payment); the housing colonies are
being sold off with arrears payments due to CWASA included as part of the
selling price; Government departments have been instructed that they may
not use the budgeting allocated for water, power etc., for any other
purpose; and the Government has extended to CWASA the right to
automatically to adjust water tariffs to recover cost increases in the
power rate.
5.05     The problem of poor performance i., billing and collection
jeopardized CWASA's finances throughout the project period. The principal
problems included:
(a) large numbers of illegal and unauthorized connections;
(b) inability to issue bills promptly and regularly;
(c)  unwillingness of the Government and its employees to pay CWASA's
bills;
(d) unwillingness of Chittagong Municipality to pay for water
through standpipes;
(e) unwillingness of CWASA to disconnect delinquent customers; and
(f) underbilling of accounts.
5.06     Low revenues plagued CWASA's financial performance throughout the
project. Unaccounted for and unbilled water, leakage and illegal usage
were identified as the areas needing attention. CWASA attempted to address
the problem as described in para 4.02.
5.07     Under the Development Credit Agreement (para 3.07(a)), the
Government undertook to ensure that CMC would pay CWASA promptly for water
consumed through all public standpipes in Chittagong at the prevailing
domestic rate. In practice, CMC simply ignores bills, and the Government
pays directly to CWASA. The principle that CMC should assume
responsibility for the cost of water dispersed through standpipes has not
been accepted.
5.08     Under the Development Credit Agreement (para 3.07(b)), the
Government undertook to pay all charges of its departments to CWASA
promptly, but in any case not later than 30 days after billing. This is in
default and at mid-1987 the Government was nine months in arrears. Tthis
compares with defaulting among private consumers at six months.
5.09     Under the Development Credit Agreement (para 3.09), the Government
was to ensure that its Chittagong housing colonies would pay CWASA promptly
at the prevailing domestic rate for water consumed. In mid-1987 this
account was 50 months in arrears and the Government was reportedly trying
to.have CWASA collect from individual consumers in the housing colonies.



-15-
Audit
5.10     CWASA agreed to appoint an auditor and furnish the Association
with a copy of the auditors report within six months of the end of each
fiscal year. Presentation of these reports was generally two or three
months late. CWASA was in compliance as of September 1988.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01     CWASA's organization is designed so that three departments
(Engineering, Commercial and Administration) operate under the Chairman who
is also the Chief Executive Officer. In addition to these departmental
heads, the internal auditor, training officer and liaison officer all
report to the Chairman directly (Annex 10).
6.02     At appraisal CWASA's total manpower was about 650.  This was
regarded as excessive and it was expected that numbers would not increase
during the project period except for some additional engineering staff.
However, although there was an effort to limit staff members in the early
years of the project period, by 1985 the number had risen to 760, and in
1988 to 744.
6.03     In order to improve CWASA's managerial skills, an expatriate with
experience in financial management and information systems in the water
supply sector was appointed. The appointment was financed from Technical
Assistance Credit No. 872-BD. The position was known as "Counterpart to
the Commercial Manager" and was filled from May 5, 1981 to January 4, 1983.
CWASA obtained considerable benefit from the appointment. Financial and
other reporting was improved, but the appointee proved to be helpful to
CWASA over a broad spectrum of its activities.
6.04     CWASA's tendency for overdependence of its previous consultant was
corrected and indeed CWASA's engineers played a much larger role in the
tubewell and distribution main-laying elements of the project.
6.05     While CWASA's interest in and attention to new works was
commendable this is not mirrored by a comparable attention to maintenance.
Standards of maintenance at the Kalurghat installation was unsatisfactory
and reflected badly on CWASA. The explanation given is 'shortage of
funds,' but this does not appear to a reasonable view when seen against the
staffing increases mentioned in para 6.02.
6.06     DWASA set up a Training Institute in 1982 which included four
instructors with engineering backgrounds and four with finance and
administration backgrounds -- six of whom have been trained abroad  Ct'JASi.
staff participated in the courses provided by the Institute. as wel' e
provided local irrprovement courses arranged by its own training off iz :-
VII. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
7.01     The Association was instrumental in the creation of CWASA and has
continued to help in its development.



-16-
7.22     During preparation of the project, the consultants recommended
that the proposed service reservoir should be located on ADC hill. CWASA
agreed with this location as indeed there was no other site so suitable in
the central city area. There was considerable official resistance which
might have been more influential than CWASA, but with the Association's
support the site was eventually secured by CWASA and the service reservoir
has been completed on that site.
7.03     Thirteen project supervision missions visited Chittagong,
commencing in May 1981, following closely on the credit becoming effective,
and thereafter about twice a year. There was reasonable continuity by
Association staff, with the financial analyst and engineer who appraised
the project being replaced in 1982 and 1983 respectively. Through staff
continuity--not only in IDA missions but also in the implementing agency--
the Association developed a very good working telationship with CWASA.
7.04     The award of the main water treatment plant contract and
subsequent difficulties with the raw water intake contract caused
considerable delay to project completion. However the Association dealt
firmly with the issues involved and by its actions demonstrated to the
Government and CWASA the importance of adhering to established contract
award procedures in a most practical demonstration (paras 3.06, 3.07 and
3.08).
VIII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
8.01     The objectives of the project, to increase water production; to
deliver it throughout Chittagong, and to strengthen CWASA as an
institution. both financially and operationally have been realized, but
with varying degrees of success. Physically the works have been completed
and the amount of water available has increased from about 13 to 33 mgd.
8.02     The new river intake, raw water pumping station and treatment
plant are first class assets which will be of permanent benefit to CWASA
and Chittagong's inhabitants.
8.03     Considerable progress has been made in developing CWASA's
capabilities; however, there remains scope for further improvement. This
is especially important developing CWASA's financial position and in
inculcating into the engineering staff the importance of maintaining in
first class working order those assets which have cost so much to provide.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
9.01     The economic rate of return for this project was prjeertecd at
appraisal to be 8.92. The economic analysis from which this estitnat.e was
derived was conducted using border prices and a shadow wage rate tor
unskilled labor equal to .70 of the market wage.
9.02     The economic rate of return for the project has been re-estimated
at project completion. This analysis relies on actual expenditures and
sales for the period FY80-FY88, and projections of expenditures and



-17-
revenues for the remainder of the project's life which were based upon
these actual figures. This reanalysis yields an estimated economic rate of
return for the project of 5.0%. The factor responsible for the largest
difference between the appraisal estimate and the estimate at project
completion has been a sharp increase in operating costs. At the time of
appraisal, direct operating costs were estimated to be Taka 1.6 per
thousand gallons of water sold; the accounts of the utility indicate that
costs expressed in 1980 prices were instead Taka 4.0 per thousand gallons.
This value is the average for all operations and not the cost per unit of
sales attributable to the new investment. Thus, the reported costs may
overstate incremental unit costs. Actual unit costs may also include
expenditures attributable to other activities including provision of
sanitation services. If the unit operating costs were Taka 1.6 per
thousand gallons as estimated at appraisal, the economic rate of return
would be 8.1.
9.03     The return on the project has also been affected by the value of
water, the rate at which the project has been completed, and cost overruns.
The economic value of water was assumed at appraisal to be Taka 8.80 per
thousand gallons. Sales have been made subsequently at a tariff of Taka
9.60 per thousand gallons (measured in 1980 prices). The greater value of
water increased the value of water produced and sold by about 10%, this
increased the rate of return on the project by 0.8%. (The gross revenue
streams for the project (estimated at appraisal and at project completion)
are shown in Table 9.1 below:
9.04     The completion of the major civil works financed under credit was
delayed. Total capital costs were 512 (in constant prices) greater than
estimated at appraisal. Table 9.2 below compares the estimated and actual
investment streams. The delay in implementation reduced the economic rate
of return by 0.7%. This problem was initiated in part by delays in start
up of investment activities followed by more rapid construction than
envisaged at appraisal. Increases in project costs reduced the economic
rate of return by about 0.8%.
9.05     The sources of differences between estimates of the economic rate
of return for the project calculated at appraisal and at project completion
are summarized below in Table 9.3.

X. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
10.0        Pr' ect Objective.  The first objective of the project, to secure
for Chittagong additional supplies of water, was achieved. Various
supervision missions have commented on the length of distribution mains being
laid without a corresponding increase irn the total amount of water going into
supply. During the project, the length of distribution main laid far exceeded
the planned length, and was in the ground before any supplies became available
from Mohara. This is an inefficient way of operating, but CWASA appears to
work on the basis that it is better to deliver a little water than none at
all, and it must recognized that the people of Chittagong are accustomed to a
less than 24 hour supply (often much less).
10.2        Delays.  The work, though completed, was some four years behind
schedule due to delays in appointing consultants, awarding contracts and also
to shortage of local funds. Acquisition of land for the service reservoir was
another delaying factor. So far as appointing consultants and awarding
contracts was concerned, the root of the problem appeared to be that both
CWASA and then a department of the Government go through similar processes
plus a good deal of correspondence and discussion. As a result, CWASA tends
to consult its superior department instead of using its own powers, making a
decision and then referring to the Government (and only when obliged to do so)
for any necessary endorsement. Responsibility for shortage of local funds
must lie with the Government; but the difficulties facing the Government in
managing a widespread capital expenditure program where there is so much to be
done and so little with which to do it demands sympathy.
10.3        Staffint.  Despite an understanding at appraisal that CWASA was
overstaffed and that during the project, staff would not be increased (with
the exception of a few important slots) the staff members have increased from
about 650 to 744 (14%) (see para. 6.02). Clearly this had an adverse effect
on CWASA's financial position. However in the Bangladesh situation, jobs are
.scarce and there is pressure on Government departments, local authorities and
the WASA's to provide as much employment as they can. If it is intended that
CWASA should operate on a commercial basi3, then it would seem reasonable
where CWASA employs unrequired additional staff as a result of the Government
pressure that the cost should be met directly by the Government and not from
CWASA's strained resources.



-20-
10.4     Responsibility for Supplies.  CWASA did not comply with the
condition specified in the legal agreements for taking over the
responsibility for supplying all domestic water in Chittagong. However
CWASA proposed to do so as soon as resources permit.
10.5     Overall Performance.  While the completion of the project is
satisfactory, inspection of the older plant at Kalurghat showed that
CWASA's standards of maintenance have not improved (para 6.05). Much
greater effort is required at every level of the engineering staff to
bring about improvements. Leak detection, waste prevention, metering
billing and collections, and increased productivity require a long-term
effort.
10.6     Metering.  Universal metering was introduced under the first
project, but experienced a number of difficulties which continued
throughout the second project. Too high a proportion of meters are
inoperative; the removal and replacement of defective meters is subject to
long delays; meter reading is inefficient and the meter repair shop staff
cannot cope with the workload. There is no evidence that any actions are
being taken to correct those faults, but the CWASA senior staff are still
of the view that universal metering is the correct policy in Chittagong.
They hold the view that without meters, people will waste water--this
despite the fact that a third of the meters are inoperative and any
household with an inoperative meter can waste water just as much as if
there were no meter. The system is not working and there is no sign that
it will be made to work. The conclusion is that the policy should be
abandoned; only non-domestic consumers should be metered (under close
supervision) and domestic consumers should pay according to the size of
connection or number of taps in the household. With a relatively small
number of meters in operation CWASA should be able to make the system work.
Once it is working satisfactorily the system may be gradually expanded.
10.7     Sanitation.  The project did not include works for sewerage or
sanitation. However studies have been made to determine where water borne
sewerage is essential and where low cost sanitation would be more
appropriate. The Chittagong Municipality, aided by UNICEF, have already
completed some 2,500 pit latrines. CWASA have completed a feasibility
study for sewerage and have submitted a report to the Government.
10.8     Finances.  CWASA has been unable to meet agreed targets, although
tariffs were increased three times during the project, once as a condition
of effectiveness. The payment of the Government bills is a continuing
problem and needs to be solved at a Ministerial level. However the
Government has granted CWASA the power to automatically to adjust water
tariffs to recover cost increases in the power rate: this is of real
assistance to CWASA. It was recognized by IDA that the originallv
covenanted 62 ROR was unattainable and tacitly agreed that a I   ' RO'     a
reasonable medium term objective--with a positive ROR the immediate goal as
ROR's were mostly negative.
