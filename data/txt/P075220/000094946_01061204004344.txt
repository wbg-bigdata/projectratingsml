A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1. Proiram purpose and prouram Phasing
The Problem. As reported in newspaper articles and other publications, a deadly scourge lies beneath the
"tropical tranquility" of the Caribbean-HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS has spread in the last two decades from
high-risk groups (e.g., commercial sex workers (CSW) and their clients, men who engage in sexual
intercourse with other men (MSM), and newborns of HIV-infected women) to the general population
causing massive human death and suffering, particularly in the developing world. There is a growing
recognition that HIV/AIDS is not just a serious health issue in developing countries, but a major
developmental catastrophe that threatens to dismantle the social and economic achievements of the past
half-century.
In the Caribbean region', many national governments have initiated a response to HIV/AIDS. Few,
however, have brought their response to the scale necessary to turn the epidemic around. Official
estimates indicate that 360,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS i the Caribbean, but given widespread
underreporting in the region, more than half a million people could be infected with HIV. The percentage
of adult ages 15 to 49 living with HIV/AIDS is about 2%. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean is
second only to that of sub-Saharan Africa in terms of the percentage of adult population affected and the
rate of acceleration. In the Caribbean, more than half of all the AIDS cases that have occurred to date
were the result of unprotected sexual intercourse between men and women. In the English-speaking
Caribbean, heterosexual contact accounts about 60% of reported AIDS cases, while in the Latin
Caribbean it represents about 50% of the reported AIDS cases. In some Caribbean countries (the
Bahamas, Barbados, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti) HIV/AIDS has already spread to the general
population. By far the most serious situation is in Haiti, which has the poorest socio-economic and health
indicators in the Western Hemisphere, and is least able to control the epidemic. Haiti and the Dominican
Republic together account for 85% of the total number of cases in the Caribbean. In other Caribbean
countries, while the WV/AIDS epidemic is largely concentrated among high-risk groups, it is
accelerating rapidly and is poised to spread to the rest of the population.
The Challenge. Learning from the experience in Africa, the Caribbean countries need to act now
decisively to prevent the further spread of the epidemic. There is a narrow window of opportunity in the
region to confront the HIV/AIDS problem that should be taken advantage to address vulnerability in a
broader environment where situations of risk occur. Without strong and immediate action, it will prove
much more difficult and costly to overcome the results of inaction later on. The proposed program
attempts to respond to the urgent challenges posed by following realities, particularly in Haiti, the most
affected country in the world outside sub-Saharan Africa (the reported prevalence rate among adults ages
15-49 is 5.17%):
a) Impact on economic priorities and investment programs. HIV/AIDS is and will continue to
undermine economic and social development because it erodes some of the main determinants of
economic growth such as social capital, domestic savings and human capital.
* Social capital erosion. Because HIV affects the social structure of local communities, it erodes
existing social networks and tradition support mechanisms. One of the most devastating impacts
of deaths from adults who are often raising children and are at the prime of their working lives.
In the English-speaking Caribbean, AIDS is now the largest cause of death among young men
For purposes of this program, the terms "Caribbean region" or "Caribbean" includes: Antigua and Barbuda,
Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia,
St. Vincent, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.

between the ages of 15 and 44 years. Mortality from AIDS also disproportionately affects young
women: data from the Dominican Republic indicate that 56% of all deaths due to AIDS occur in
women between 20 and 34 years of age (Caceres Urana, 1998). By the end of 1999, the
cumulative number of Caribbean children estimated to have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS at age
14 or younger stood at 83,000 (UNAIDS, 1999). Experience in other regions of the world has
demonstrated those deaths and illness due to AIDS among adults has a profoundly negative
impact on the welfare of children in the affected households. Frequently, poor health and
premature death of adults lead to income and expenditures changes that can have adverse effects
on child nutrition and schooling (Confronting AIDS, 1998; Dasgupta et al. 1999). Some families
can no longer afford school costs or the children are needed to help out at home. Children's
education may also suffer as a result, reducing literacy rates in communities. This would be
particularly onerous for poor families given the high attrition of poor students at all grade levels
and in a skewed distribution of resources to the detriment of schools in poorer communities
(Caribbean Education Sector Strategy 2020, World Bank (WB), 2000).
*  Economic decline. Eventually, if the prevalence of HIV continues to increase in the Caribbean
as it has, per capita economic growth may begin to decline. Increased expenditures for treatment
of AIDS and AIDS-related diseases from government budgets and household savings will reduce
the capital for more productive investments.  As a subregion comprised of small islands
developing states and mainland nations with relatively- small populations, HIV/AIDS presents
unique challenges and the response to it must consider consequences specific to small country
circumstances. First, while trends in African countries have suggested that the economic impact
of the HIV epidemic becomes evident after experiencing a national HIV seroprevalence of around
7%. such might not be the case with countries with total populations ranging from 100,000 to the
low millions. In these smaller countries, there is not the population size that might somehow
absorb a certain level of the burden before it is significantly evidenced by economic impacts.
Preliminary assessments by the University of West Indies (UWI) on the expected macroeconomic
impact of HIV/AIDS in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago revealed contractions in major
variables over a 5-year period, such as GDP (declines of 6.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively). The
level of investment is estimated to be severely affected as well as incomes had to be redirected
from the production of goods and services to finance HIV- related expenditures. These HIV-
related illness expenditures rose by 25.3% in Trinidad and Tobago and 35.4% in Jamaica.
-  Human capital losses. The shock of AIDS to the labor markets is one mechanism through which
AIDS might adversely affect economic growth in the Caribbean. At present, the affected age
group are those forming the labor force: 70% of AIDS cases in the Caribbean are diagnosed in the
15-44 age group, half in the 25 to 34 age group (which, given the time it takes to progress from
HIV infection to a fully diagnosed AIDS case, actually means that most of these infections took
place in their teens and early 20s). Because it prevents an increasing share of the population from
participating in economic growth, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will increase poverty.
b) Urgency. As differing from a slow-onset disaster such as a drought, where a more thorough
preparation of a regular investment project may be preferable, in some countries of the Caribbean,
HIV/AIDS is already reversing the gains in life expectancy achieved in previous decades as the result
of progress in the fight against communicable diseases and improved social welfare. In Haiti and
Guyana, life expectancy is estimated to be 5.7 and 5.2 years less, respectively, than it would have
been without AIDS (UNAIDS, 2000). What is ominous for the Caribbean region, however, is that
even if all HIV transmission could be halted today, the impact of the illness and deaths of the people
already infected will be felt-over the next two decades. In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, located
in the same island, HIV/AIDS would need to be confronted with close, well-coordinated joint efforts,
and with the highest priority. Otherwise, no matter how successful one country can be in stopping



5
this disease, in the short run it will be afflicted with new cases.
A Regional Framework for Action. Given the historical, social and economic factors that link the
Caribbean region, as well its population movements, HIV/AIDS constitutes a regional issue. A purely
"'national" approach could be ineffective owing to external factors. The propbsed program, therefore,
would offer support to individual countries within the context of The Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan
of Action 2000-2004 prepared by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)-led Caribbean Task Force on
HIV/AIDS and endorsed by the heads of Government. Additionally, by supporting a program conceived
as part of a regional initiative, donors can more easily exercise their preferences and comparative
advantages and complement each other. This was evident at the regional HIV/AIDS Conference in
September 2000, sponsored by the Government of Barbados, PAHO/WHO, UNAIDS and the WB.
Several bilateral donors offered support to regional aspects of the Plan, while the World Bank committed
resources at the country level.
The Program. Following the strategy proposed in the study HIIV/AIDS in the Caribbean: Issues and
Options, published in June 2000, the purpose of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Caribbean
is to assist the governments of the region to scale up efforts for intervening quickly to prevent the
contracting and spreading of the HIV infection among high-risk groups, limit its spread among the
general population without stigmatizing high-risk groups, and establish an institutional platform at the
country level for long-term sustainability.
In the face of the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the proposed program will support the
Caribbean Governments in building political consensus, public awareness, and experience both
domestically and region-wide. It will help them devote additional resources to the prevention and control
of HIV/AIDS, care for persons already affected by it, and experiment with institutional arrangements to
curb its spread and modify them on the basis of lessons learned over time.
WB assistance would be structured as a horizontal Adaptable Program Lending (APL). Under the APL,
individual countries would obtain separate loans and/or credits to finance their own national HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control projects. The respective freestanding national projects would be appraised and
readied for approval following provisions for investment lending. The program will treat specific country
projects developed within the regional framework as "phases" of a horizontal APL as in the case of the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management
Program APL and the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region. Countries would be
grouped according to their readiness to undertake the initial set of activities aimed at establishing
sustainable domestic structures for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Based on the number of countries
likely to participate and their status of readiness, there will be about four "phases" under this APL. The
pre-conditions for the countries to participate in the program will serve like the "triggers" in an APL for
start of a next phase (see Section B.4 below). The APL will provide the flexibility both for the WB and
the borrowers to renew our commitment to the program periodically. The WB would decide not to follow
with the subsequent phases (new loans/credits to individual countries) until countries meet the eligibility
criteria.
The first two loans would require approval at the time the framework APL is presented to the Board of
Directors for approval. Barbados (Annex 13) and the Dominican Republic (Annex 14) are the only two
countries to be included in the first phase. The proposed HIV/AIDS project for Barbados is presented as
an exception to the Bank's graduation policy based on the strong public goods and externalities rationale
for including Barbados in a regional program for the control of a communicable disease (such as
HIV/AIDS) and, Barbados' leadership role in these activities in the Eastern Caribbean. The rationale for
including Barbados in the APL is more fully explained in greater detail in Annex 13.1 of the Technical
Annex for Barbados. Subsequent decisions to proceed with country loans/credits would be made based on



6
CAS considerations for other countries, degree of readiness of the countries and their ability to meet the
eligibility criteria set out in Section B.4. It is expected that all the proposed Caribbean countries would
meet the program's eligibility criteria set out in Section B.4 within the next two years. Each would then
seek to reach its own project objectives for HlV/AIDS prevention and control within the ensuing five
years. The countries, which may participate under the proposed program, are listed in table 1 of Annex 5.
Said countries are being assisted by other regional and international organizations such as Caribbean
Epidemiology Center (CAREC), CARICOM, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health
Organization (WHO), and UNAIDS, and have received PHRD Grants financing for the preparation of
their own projects.
Rationale for the APL.  Starting from  the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Caribbean
govemments, with international assistance, have established National AIDS Programs linked to the health
sector and developed short- and medium-term plans for responding to the epidemic. As a result,
throughout the region, there are some country- level successes. The safety of blood supply, for instance,
in the vast majority of the countries is due to early intervention. Yet, despite these successes, the national
programs still operate on a limited scale, reaching only a small segment of the population. What is
needed in most of the Caribbean countries is a comprehensive, multisectoral response that engages
government, civil society, and international donors, and serves the entire national population, as the
WV/AIDS epidemic continues unabated in the region. The proposed APL, by visibly committing
substantial resources (US$155.0 million), and complementing the activities supported by other donors,
would ensure adequate resources to fund the rapid scaling-up of the national programs. Efforts would
also be made to identify financing sources for activities to be undertaken at the regional level. Given the
urgency of the situation discussed above, as agreed with a Quality Enhanced Group (QER) that was
engaged to review the APL proposal, preparation of country projects would give priority to detailing the
activities to be included in the first year of the project with subsequent activities for later years to be
refined in more detail as part of annual project reviews.
2. Proiect development objective (see Annex 1)
The overall development objective of the program is to assist the Caribbean countries in: (i) preventing
the spread of HIV/AIDS by reducing transmission among the high-risk groups; (ii) improving the access
of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to care that is effective, affordable, and equitable within the
context of government health policy; and (iii) strengthening their institutional capacity to respond to
HIV/AIDS in a sustainable way. The development objectives of each individual project would be
country-specific and depend on the stage of the epidemic, income levels, and the socioeconomic status of
those who are infected.
When aggregated, the outcomes of the national projects would collectively establish the basis for gauging
the success of the multi-country program. This would be examined against the epidemiological goals for
the region developed by country public health authorities2, with the support of CAREC, PAHO/WHO and
UNAIDS.
3. Key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
Multi-Country Program Performance Indicators. In the short-term, the Multi-Country Program
would be considered successful if all countries in the Caribbean had begun an expanded response to
HIV/AIDS within the next 20 months. To help achieve this while maintaining standards for quality-at-
entry, a country would enter the program when it substantially meets criteria for readiness that have been

for communicable diseases control, including STIs and HIV/AIDS.



7
agreed as necessary for successful HIV/AIDS prevention and control (see section B4. below). In the
longer-term, the success in actually controlling the spread of HIV will depend on the success of individual
country projects. CAREC has developed regional HIV/AIDS prevention and control goals that would
help set targets for individual country efforts.
Performance Indicators for Country Projects. Each country project would establish its own targets
and progress would be evaluated periodically, relative to its own baseline situation. However, within 5
years covered by a typical project, it might not be possible to observe a significant improvement in some
of the impact indicators. Therefore, during the course of project implementation, heavy reliance would be
placed on "leading indicators" as surrogates for the longer-term impacts. These would guide year-to-year
evaluation and project management decisions. Some of the proposed indicators are listed below:
a) Output indicators:
*  Improved identification and interventions (e.g., behavior change interventions, STI treatment) for
high-risk groups;
*  increase in knowledge of modes of HIV transmission and interventions for the general
population;
*  enhanced quality, capacity and cost-effectiveness of AIDS care;
*  improved institutional capacity in management, information, training and research; and
*  Enhanced HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts in other sectors.
b) Outcome indicators:
*  Reduction in risk behavior among high-risk groups (partners, sexual practice, condom use, etc.);
*  stabilization of the annual percentage increase of sentinel seroprevalence by project completion;
and
*  improved functioning (e.g., increased spending in real terms of program components as per
annual plans) and effective management of program activities (e.g., involvement of community
groups, coverage of high risk groups).
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related CAS goals supported by the APL and Participatiniz National Projects
The proposed APL is consistent with the assistance strategy adopted by the Steering Committee of the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED) during its meeting in June 2000.
This strategy is stated in the documents "Toward A Caribbean Vision 2020: A Regional Perspective on
Development Challenges, Opportunities and Strategies for the Next Two Decades," of June 2000, that
serves as the framework for development and assistance programs for the Caribbean, and "HIV/AIDS in
the Caribbean: Issues and Options, " of June 2000, prepared by the WB in conjunction with CARICOM
and UNAIDS.
Participation in the proposed program is also consistent with the CAS for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-
region of June 2001 (Report No. 22205-LAC). This CAS identifies the need to promote human
development for long-term growth, to be accomplished through health and education programs that



8
emphasize improved access, equity and quality and the need for regionally coordinated actions on issues
when in-country solutions could be significantly disrupted by "off-shore" events. This CAS also outlines
the exceptional case to the Bank's graduation policy to permit IBRD financing for the HIV/AIDS
prevention and control program in Barbados. Said exceptional case is based primarily on the public
goods and externalities rationale for a communicable disease (such as HIV/AIDS) and Barbados'
leadership role in these activities in the Eastern Caribbean. In essence, Barbados is the regional hub with
advanced economic and social infrastructure providing these services to some of the less equipped
countries of the Eastem Caribbean. As indicated in the accompanying CAS, this Barbados proposed
operation would be a one time exception and additional IBRD support is not envisaged. The full rationale
and context for it is explained in Annex 13.1 of the Technical Annex for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Project for Barbados.
Similar goals as in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region CAS are also outlined in the CAS for Jamaica
(Report No. 21187-3M) of November 2, 2000; Dominican Republic (Report No. 19393-DO) of June 9,
1999, for Haiti (Report No. 15945-HA) of August 13, 1996, and for Trinidad and Tobago (Report No.
14028-TR) of March 7, 1995, as well as in the Guyana Policy Framework Paper, 1998-2000 (Report
SecM98-499) of June 18, 1998, and the Belize, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago's Medium Term
Strategy 2000-2002 prepared for CGCED.
2. Main sector issues and Government strate2ies
Main Sector Issues. As documented in the Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS
and the World Bank report "HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean Issues and Options", in nearly all the Caribbean
countries a broad-based response is now needed to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS. The most pressing
issues are:
Mobilizing strong political and government commitment and coordinating an expanded
multisectoral response. High-level support and strong political commitment is key to the long-term
success of any effort. Although some presidents and prime ministers have spoken out publicly on the
importance of the epidemic in the Caribbean, there remains the need to obtain highly more visible,
sustained political will, and commitment at the highest political level.
Participatory national strategic planning with the full involvement of all of the sectors of society -
including the health sector, other sectoral ministries, civil society organizations, and the business sector -
remains weak. Failure to see HIVIAIDS as a developmental concern permeates not only governments,
but also civil society and the corporate community. As the social, economic and political implications of
the evolving epidemic become more visible, the responsibilities of the Ministries of Health must
accommodate both technical demands within the health sector as well as promotion and coordination of
other sectors.
Many countries are in the process of developing national strategic plans, and some have completed them,
but the process needs to be strengthened in most places. National strategic plans should assess the
situation and specific issues of each setting, assess the effectiveness of the response to date and, based on
this, determine the priorities for action. Strategic planning has not yet been consistently undertaken to
determine how best to allocate scarce resources, in particular with regard to cost-effective interventions.
A key challenge is the relatively small scale of the interventions that are in place to address the large and
complex issues of the epidemic. The effective responses need to be supported and scaled up while new
initiatives need to focus on the most critical areas. Given the Caribbean region's social and economic
integration at many levels, and challenges presented by differing levels of capacity in some countries,
some of these issues can be collectively addressed more efficiently through a strong framework for
coordination, rather the simultaneous replication of efforts at each national level.



9
Policy and program development. Very few Caribbean countries have developed national policies
and/or frameworks that address human rights, legal and ethical policy framework for HIV/AIDS. Policy
and program development remain weak for a variety of reasons, including lack of reliable data on the size
and scope of the epidemic, its causes and consequences, and projections of its future course. Adequate
operational and behavioral research is still needed to inform policy making, and the low level of resources
allocated to national programs highlights the low level of priority given to date to the epidemic. For
much of the Caribbean, national leaders have yet to be really mobilized to openly speak about the
epidemic, much less introduce policy and legislative frameworks.
Scaling-up prevention. For lack of political will, lack of openness regarding sexually sensitive issues
and lack of targeted interventions, the speed of behavior change and increases in condom use have been
outpaced by the rate of the spread of the epidemic. Targeted interventions particularly those geared
towards vulnerable, hard-to-reach groups, such as MSM, CSW, mobile populations, young school
children and social dropouts, institutional populations such as prisoners, and uniformed groups (police
and the military) are needed. More specific issues such as prevention of mother-to-child transmission and
blood safety require health infrastructure, technical expertise as well as financial resources. The success
of both general and more specific prevention campaigns depends also on an "enabling" policy
environment that openly acknowledges both the reality of the epidemic and its underlying social and
economic causes and consequences. Specific prevention activities, such as blood safety, the prevention of
mother to child transmission, and a realistic allocation of resources to prevention of highly vulnerable
groups are technical matters as well as ones of policy and legal frameworks.
The needs to expand care and support. Improving access and quality of care for the growing number
of people living with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean must be a priority. Health services are already
struggling to respond to the growing population of persons with HIV/AIDS requiring care, support and
treatment. Indeed, although the average progression from HIV infection to AIDS is similar to that
observed in other regions, the AIDS case fatality rate3 in the Caribbean region as a whole is high (63%)
indicating clear gaps in the care spectrum. Other problems include insuring health workers' ability to
provide timely diagnosis of HIV infection and related conditions. Such diagnosis through counseling,
testing, and improved health worker training, provides important opportunities to improve nutrition,
psychological support, prevention and treatment of subsequent opportunistic infections in HIV-positive
people. Access to knowledge of one's status, and adequate support to deal with it, can also help prevent
unwitting transmission of HIV to others. Sometimes this access is limited not by lack of facilities but by
fear of stigma and discrimination, as island communities are often perceived as being challenged with
greater confidentiality concerns and breaches than larger countries. Therefore, programs aimed at
strengthening the capacity of health services must include not only better access to medications, but
improved quality and privacy of services. Although some countries are exploring ways in which to
improve access to the most advanced treatments, including anti-retroviral (ARV), most governments find
the high costs of these treatments prohibitive. Administering ARV drugs also requires testing, laboratory,
and tracking infrastructure that is complex and demands a high level of skill and experience on the part of
physicians for correct case management, including patient compliance with the treatment regime. Absent
this, the use of the drugs raise at yet unknown risks, particularly the development of drug resistance.
Financial issues. The costs of providing a package of preventive, care and support services that would
have a significant impact on the epidemic will be high in absolute terms. In many cases, they may be well
beyond private means and government budgets. On the basis of a preliminary analysis, the costs of an
effective but modest HIV/AIDS prevention and care program could approach US$90 per capita per year
in the Caribbean. This would represent as little as a 10% increase in current health care costs in Bahamas
3 The case fatality rate is the number of deaths from a disease during a defined period of time expressed as a
percentage of the total number of people with the disease.



10
and as much as a 180% increase in Haiti. Financing the costs may require additional public sector-
generated resources, and adjustments to budgetary priorities. A major issue, therefore, is to craft an
effective but affordable prevention and control strategy.
Government strategies
Health Services Delivery Capacity in the Caribbean Countries. Some of the Caribbean countries have
experienced comparably good health status and managed to eliminate many of the basic health problems
associated with less-developed countries. Traditionally, the public sector, particularly in the English
speaking Caribbean, has been the predominant, if not the only, supplier of health services. The typical
system is structured as a network of health centers and at least one hospital, which together mean to
function as an integrated system with an appropriate and functional referral process. PAHO/VWHO
estimates indicate that among Caribbean countries, Bahamas, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago have
nearly universal primary health care coverage with good quality of services; Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname cover 80-95% of their populations and the Dominican Republic covers
between 50-80%. Haiti coverage is low. Annex 3 provides an assessment of health system performance
in Caribbean countries using WHO indexes.
Notwithstanding structural and financial limitations, national and regional HIV/AIDS programs have
registered a number of accomplishments over the last decade. These include a blood supply that is
generally well protected; establishment of primary testing capabilities in all countries and confirmatory
testing in some; establishment of referral and reference HIV testing services at CAREC; development of
national and regional systems for the surveillance of HIV/AlDS; and awareness among the general
population of HIV/AIDS and its modes of transmission, as a result of early and intensive information,
education, and communication efforts. The challenge now is to build on theses successes and mount a
scaled up response, particularly on HIV prevention.
The Regional Plan of Action on HIV/AIDS. HlV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a major
development problem in the Caribbean. The breadth of the region, its diversity and varying levels of
integration, and the multitude of social and economic forces at work in the Caribbean mean that a variety
of HIV epidemics are already underway there. As national governments, often with the support of
international donors, seek to address its challenges, the importance of coordination at the regional and
national levels has been highlighted
Beginning in 1998, the Regional Strategic Plan of Action, though not a substitute for national level action,
articulated specific opportunities and challenges common to most of the countries across the region.
The Plan was developed with the input of all regional and international players in the area of health,
HIV/AIDS and development (including CARICOM, CAREC, CRN+, UNAIDS and its Cosponsors). It
will be implemented by these institutions under the political leadership of CARICOM and caters to the
member states of CARICOM, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
The overall objective of the Plan is to reduce the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. Its
framework identifies areas for priority action at the regional level, which are focused on promoting a
strengthened, effective and coordinated regional response to the epidemic, and supporting expanded
multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS programs at the national level. The Plan is based largely on the efforts of
different actors to coordinate and prioritize HIV/AIDS work in the Caribbean region. The priority areas
correspond to the challenges described in the previous sections, and are as follows:
* Advocacy, policy development and legislation;
*  support of people living with HIV/AIDS;



11
* prevention of HIV transmission, with a focus on young people;
* prevention of HIV transmission among especially vulnerable groups:
o  Men who have sex with men (MSM)
o  Sex workers
o  Prisoners
o  Uniformed populations (military and police)
o  Mobile populations
o  Workplace interventions
* prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; and
*  strengthening national and regional response capability.
The Plan has found wide acceptance in all the Caribbean countries as a set of guiding principles, and is
considered to be a sound basis for formulating national strategies and projects to be supported under the
proposed WB-financed APL.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed APL will assist national governments in addressing the issues described above, but
government commitment and leadership is the key for success. Countries would be helped supplement
national budgets to finance well-designed and cost-effective activities that would otherwise be beyond
purely local means. A wider circle of stakeholders often excluded for lack of resources would implement
these. The proposed APL would support advocacy and communication for mobilizing political support;
scaling up of prevention, care and support activities; and capacity building with the goal of expanding
coverage and facilitating access to quality services, particularly among high-risk groups, in a sustainable
manner.
4. Program description and criteria for subseauent loans
The proposed APL would have the following features:
Over-arching strategic direction. This program is based on a long-term development plan emerging
from the regional strategy agreed to by all stakeholders, including the donors. The multi-country program
would support individual countries to adapt according to local realities the provisions of the Regional
Strategic Plan of Actions for HIV/AIDS. As noted above, the Strategic Plan outlines priorities in six
areas, which represent a comprehensive response to the epidemic in the Region.
Phased Financing. Country projects would qualify for support under the APL after they have
demonstrated satisfactory preparation to implement an expanded HIV/AIDS prevention and control
program. As there is a wide variety of country conditions in the Caribbean (i.e., widely differing
development levels and implementation capacities), projects would need to adequately reflect the
environment in which they would be implemented with scaling and sequencing of project activities,
management arrangements, cost-sharing provisions, and risk mitigation measures appropriate to the
Borrower's needs and institutional, fiscal and social reality. Consequently, a country with little history of
WB projects and relatively weak institutions could be considered equally "eligible" for inclusion in the
program as a country with a long history of WB involvement and well-developed institutions, as long as
the design of the project is appropriate to country conditions



12
In addition to the well-accepted standards for quality at entry and the respect for the WB's safeguard,
financial management and procurement policies, the following criteria would be used to evaluate the
readiness of country projects for negotiation. A country would be considered "eligible" when it meets the
following eligibility criteria:
a) a satisfactory national strategic plan showing understanding of the issues and goals for addressing
them, actions adapted from best practice and the Regional Strategic Action Plan to meet national
priorities, evidence of strong public support and a well balanced range of stakeholders;
b) national commitment and leadership, including a well structured project management unit empowered
to be proactive, a national leader/champion with sufficient stature to direct the effort, and evidence of
current budgetary support for HIV/AIDS and the strong probability of readiness to meet future
recurrent budgetary requirements;
c) a satisfactory implementation strategy that included program execution through multiple ministries
when the public sector was involved, and through Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs),
community groups and civil society organizations;
d) sturdy and sustainable implementation arrangements (financial, legal, procurement, regulatory) must
be in place and are acceptable to the WB; and
e) clearly defined institutional arrangements for, and readiness to initiate, monitor the evolution of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic and for evaluating project progress and impact.
When countries meet a satisfactory level of readiness on each of these points, the WB would appraise
financial support for the country project. The norms for making this evaluation are presented in Annex 5.
During project preparation, as with most projects, Borrowers would normally advance on meeting all of
these criteria in tandem. Delays would indicate the need for further preparation. Each country in the
Caribbean has been awarded a PHRD Grant to assist the country in meeting these eligibility criteria. The
Grant aims to help the countries make progress towards satisfying all five criteria. However, each
country in the region is starting from a different level in terms of their institutional capacity---in general
and specifically for preparing and implementing HIV/AIDS programs. Therefore, the Bank would make
an informed judgment of country readiness and relative progress based on the countries' starting point and
prevailing circumstances. The WB would seek the advice of key multilateral organizations such as
UNAIDS, and regional institutions such as CAREC, CARICOM, PAHO/WHO and the University of the
West Indies (UWI) in making a judgment on the readiness to proceed with each country case.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Knowledge Sharing. Regional organizations as CAREC, CARICOM,
PAHO/ WHO, and UWI have been monitoring epidemiological trends, including HIV/AIDS, the
implementation of related programs, and their impact for several years. Additionally, they have an active
program for information sharing among countries through publications, regional and national workshops.
Moreover, the Task Force under CARICOM has received a new mandate to implement regional
monitoring of HIV/AIDS, actions being taken to control it, and the identification and sharing of
successful practices. The Task Force, with the financial support of bilateral organizations such as
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), is
expected to sponsor regional seminars, workshops, country exchanges, and a publications program as part
of its work program. Participating countries would rely heavily on this network for assuring the spread of
better practices, and learning, typically associated with APLs.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components
Building an effective national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic would require an enabling
environment and the necessary resources to bring proven interventions quickly up to nationwide scale.
Country projects under the proposed APL would help to operationalize some elements that are
contemplated as part of the Regional Strategic Action Plan (Annex 4), expanding and intensifying the
responses rapidly.  They would consist of a group of interventions based on the countries'
epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting them (Annex 6).
The interventions would be grouped in five broad categories:
a) Communication and advocacy to increase government's commitment, attention, and funding
related to HIV/AIDS and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general
population about HIV/AIDS, including information, communication and education (IEC)
campaigns targeted to policy makers, religious leaders, and the general population.
b) Scaling up prevention activities at the national and community levels, including IEC for specific
target groups to raise awareness and understanding of HIV/AIDS and STIs transmission and to
change high risk behavior, promotion of condom use, voluntary testing and counseling for vulnerable
groups of the population, interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and improved
screening and blood transfusion to ensure a safe blood supply.
c) Scaling up care and support activities at the national and community levels, including treatment
of STIs and opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, strengthening the availability of and access
to essential drugs, training of health personnel, clinical management of HIV/AIDS-related conditions;
and support to home and community-based care and support activities. Because of high price and
sensitivity of anti-retroviral drugs (e.g., the side effects of ARV chemotherapy have made it difficult
to take and viral resistance has developed rapidly to these agents), the proposed program would only
support the development of guidelines and the strengthening of infrastructure to make use of these
drugs safe, effective and sustainable. The WB would remain open, on a case-by-case basis, to
support ARV drugs if intellectual property rights of drug manufactures are respected, and if the health
system is assessed to be ready in terms of infrastructure and laboratory capacity, trained personnel,
consistency of supplies. Although maintenance of such intellectual property rights can result in high
prices for ARV drugs, there is a movement by manufacturers to make special arrangements to reduce
such prices in developing country settings (a movement which this proposed APL would take
advantage of).
d) Supporting research and surveillance at the national level, including baseline surveys of
epidemiology, knowledge and behavior, improved HIV sentinel surveillance to monitor the epidemic,
analysis for the design and implementation of cost-effective interventions, and public expenditure
reviews to track national commitment and funding to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
e) Capacity building, including support for program coordination, resource management, and
implementation at all levels; establishment of monitoring and impact evaluation systems to enable
project management units to monitor performance of project implementation.
Exact costing of the options selected will vary among country projects, owing to choices that are made in
terms of the activities themselves and the level of coverage offered to the public.



14
Resources required to implement these activities could finance civil works, goods, services, and operating
cost. The types and quantities of the inputs required would be determined by annual work plans (C4).
WB loan/credit proceeds could be used to finance any of these requirements up to levels determined on a
country-by-country basis, so as to complement the resources that may be available to the country from
other sources. However, owing to the urgent need for countries to launch their projects, WB loans/credits
could finance a higher-than-usual percentage of project costs.
Each country project proposed for inclusion in the program would have to justify the country's priority
areas of intervention; project components; coverage objectives; input, output and impact indicators;
estimated costs and financing sources; financial management and administrative scheme; the monitoring
and evaluation system; and project management and implementation arrangements.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the proiect
Under the proposed APL, country projects would support raising awareness about HIV/AIDS as a
multisectoral development issue-not only a health concern.  Support would be provided for the
development of participatory national strategic HIV/AIDS plans and deconcentrated organizational and
managerial arrangements for project implementation to facilitate government work in partnership with
persons living with HIV/AIDS, community groups, religious organizations, NGOs, health professionals,
and the private sector. Monitoring and impact evaluation mechanisms, as well as support for research and
surveillance would enhance countries capacity to manage the epidemic effectively.
3. Benefits and target Population
Specific target populations are to be decided by each country. In general, however, the benefit of the
project would be a reduction in the rate of new HIV infections to the general population but especially
within high-risk groups and an increase in the quality and coverage of care for the 300,000-500,000
PLWHAs in the Caribbean region.
Of equal importance, with longer-term benefits, would be the achievement of a more sustained,
participatory and multi-sectoral view of the epidemic as a national threat, and the mainstreaming of
actions to contain it.
An entire population of a country may be considered the "target" for the project. All groups may be
considered as having their own particular need for interventions. Particular focus would be placed
however on persons involved in risky behavior (men having sex with men, sex workers, uniformed
personnel, prisoners, drug and substance abusers) and youth. The population living with HIV/AIDS is
also considered to be a major "target" population.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
In the past, assistance for HIV/AIDS from regional, bilateral and multilateral agencies to the Caribbean
countries has been mostly organized and led by public health officials, through their system structures.
The proposed projects within the APL which would involve other sectoral ministries, government
agencies and civil society (private sector, local community organizations and NGOs) to scale-up actions
on a multi-sectoral basis, would be a major challenge in terms of project planning, coordination,
implementation and supervision. The risks of poor coordination and overlap in achieving the program
goals are likely to be high considering the institutional capacity of these countries. The proposed projects
will, therefore, try to build on -organizations with proven operational capability and -experience. Also,
based on the institutional analysis of the project entities carried out during preparation in each country,



15
the roles and responsibilities of the key players/agencies would be clarified, detailed operational
guidelines would be prepared, and necessary training and technical assistance would be provided.
A typical country project would include the following institutional arrangements:
Project Management. The project will be the primary responsibility of National HIV/AIDS Councils or
an on-going AIDS Program. Ideally, this national body would report to the highest office in Government
to give the program visibility and national significance. However, in some of the smaller countries, it
may be considered better to expand and strengthen the existing AIDS Program within the Ministry of
Health, without having to create new structures. This national body will be responsible for the overall
strategy, policy and operational guidance for the project. It will consist of representatives from the sector
ministries, private sector, civil society groups, universities, including women, youth and organizations of
PLWHA.
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the National AIDS Council or Program would be responsible for
the day-to-day project implementation. Its establishment, clear definition of functions, and satisfactory
staffing would be requirements for country participation in the APL. It will also serve as the Secretariat
to the National Council or its equivalent. The PCU will coordinate actions with the relevant ministries
and civil society organizations regarding all project activities. It will also be the interface with other
regional and international agencies and with the WB on operational matters.
The PCU would be responsible for procurement of works, goods and services under the project,
accounting and financial management and monitoring and evaluation. It would also support the National
AIDS Council or its equivalent in inviting, facilitating and the initial screening of subproject proposals
presented by NGOs and community organizations. Depending on the country capacity, the PCU could
contract firms or qualified consultants to assist in establishing financial management and monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems. The PCU would prepare annual work plans, in conjunction with the sector
ministries, define the actions needed to ensure timely project implementation, and prepare quarterly
reports for the Council and the WB. The PCU would be headed by a Project Coordinator or Project
Director and would include public health, financial management, procurement, and monitoring and
evaluation and support staff. The organizational forms and the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities
may slightly vary for each country, which would be detailed in their respective country project description
and their Operational Manual.
Project Implementation. All public sectors related the respective line ministries and their departments
would implement project activities, outlined in the country project.  The permanent secretary or
equivalent rank in each sector ministry will oversee the operations in their respective Ministry and would
be accountable for their project-related activities and results. Ministries, which may have a large
component to execute through their departments, may form a project support unit to assist and coordinate
operations within their ministry and to work closely with the PCU at the National Council. Other
ministries may assign an HIV focal person who would be responsible for this task. The sector ministries
in large countries would actively involve and support their provincial or local level offices to implement
the project in their local jurisdiction. The line ministries would present their HIV/AIDS plan for each
year to the National AIDS Council or its equivalent/PCU. Once approved, financing could follow
different paths. For example, in some cases, regular budgets for line ministries may contain earmarked
financing for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities, while in other cases, sets of activities
formulated to expand or scale-up ongoing efforts would be financed by the PCU.
The civil society organizations, private sector groups, and NGOs would participate in-the project in two
ways. When preparing their annual plans, the sector ministries will involve the related civil society
groups/private sector agencies in developing proposals and once approved they would implement



16
together. The civil society organizations, private sector and NGOs could also submit proposals directly to
the National Council/PCU. The National Council or equivalent agency, supported by the PCU serving as
its Secretariat, would review and endorse these proposals for project funding based on pre-determined
criteria. The PCU would assist, facilitate and supervise implementation of project activities within each
annual plan. The implementation arrangements of projects would be detailed in the Operations Manual
for each country project. The Operational Manual and the subprojects to be funded would require WB
approval.
Procurement. Procurement under a country project would be carried out in accordance with the WB's
procurement guidelines. Agreements covering procurement methods, thresholds, and other conditionality
would be determined for each country according to its capacity and experience with WB procurement.
T hese would be detailed in a procurement annex to each country project proposal and would be appraised.
The activities covered in a typical countrv project would be implemented on the basis of annual work
plans to allow for needed flexibility in adjusting project work to account for in-country experience and the
lessons from the implementation by other countries participating in the multi country program. As a
result, the following approach to procurement would be adopted:
a) General procurement arrangements for the country project:
Procurement Methods. A calendar procurement plan will be prepared along with the annual work
plan. The procurement plan for each year would be submitted by each Government to the WB for
approval, not later than October of the previous year and would use a pre-defined standard format
which would list as a minimum: (i) works, goods and services to be procured during the following
calendar or fiscal year, as the case may be; (ii) their value; (iii) the method of procurement; and (iv)
the timetable for carrying out the procurement. At the time of approving the annual work plan, the
WB would agree on the application of the guidelines to the specific procurement lots expected during
the year. If needed, the plan could be revised and re-submitted. A format for a typical plan would be
agreed at the negotiation of each country project. The procurement plan for the first year of each
country project would be appraised as part of loan preparation.
Country Assessments. Each country project loan agreement would define the appropriate threshold
for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National Competitive Bidding (NCB) or shopping.
Thresholds would be set on the basis of the latest Country Procurement and Audit Review or WB
assessment of the capacity of the PCU and risks of corruption in that country. The same would apply
for the procurement methods for consultants.
Implementing Agency Assessments. The WB would carry out a procurement capacity assessment
for each PCU to assess its capacity to use Bank procurement guidelines, procurement risks and
recommend ways to reduce the risks. From such an assessment the PCU would be classified in one of
three types of risk categories (A, B or C) corresponding to low, average or high risk. The country
loan agreement would define thresholds for prior review appropriate to the category. Such thresholds
would be defined to minimize prior review as appropriate to the level of risk.
b) As projects would have a strong decentralized implementation, and to help the WB to carry out post-
review of procurement actions, consultants would be hired as a cost to the project to carry out annual
procurement audits of a sample of contracts, under terms of reference acceptable to the World Bank.
c) For several years, a number of specialized UN and bilateral agencies operating in the Region have
supported various country agencies in the procurement of drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipment
and supplies, condoms and other materials. Using this type of assistance may be considered as part of



17
a country project's procurement arrangements when advantageous. It is foreseen the use of UJNDP as
procurement agent in some countries.  For that, UNDP would follow the WB's procurement
guidelines under the standard agreement between the WB and tNDP. It is also foreseen the use of
PAHO for the supply of vaccines and associated medical inputs for vaccination campaigns. This
would be carried out under standard contract agreed with the WB.
d) The Multi-Country Program will present the possibility for selected countries to use loan proceeds to
procure antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV infected persons. The decision to include financing for
these drugs in any country will be based on a strict medical and financial evaluation of the readiness
of the country's infrastructure and capacity to manage ARV treatment in accordance with
international best practices. When decided to proceed, the procurement of ARV drugs will be done
under direct contracting from the patent-holding manufacturers or their licensees. However, the help
of specialized agencies (like UNAIDS) will be sought to profit from the negotiations taking place
with manufacturers to introduce as much price reduction as possible.
Financial Management and Flow of Funds. Each country will have a separate loan/credit account with
the WB, and each PCU will be responsible for assuring that the country's project establishes and
maintains: (i) adequate accounting systems and procedures; (ii) funds flow mechanisms including timely
disbursements to its suppliers; and (iii) appropriate arrangements for regular financial audits. These
responsibilities will be specified in country loan/credit documents. As most PCUs will have been only
recently formed, and will not have established accounting and financial management procedures, they
will have the option of contracting with local accounting and financial management firms for these
services while building their own capacity for doing so. Draft terms of reference for this service will be
furnished to PCUs. Borrowers will be evaluated as to their compliance with WB financial management
standards at the preparation and launching stages, as well as on supervision missions during project
implementation.
The WB is currently evaluating national accounting and financial management practices for several
countries likely to enter the program. These analyses will serve to improve the quality of decision-
making with regard to the optimal financial management and disbursement arrangements for each project.
Where capacity is substantial, options for allowing greater flexibility in accounting and reporting will be
evaluated. For example, where the Borrower is capable of producing timely and accurate quarterly
financial reports, the possibility to disburse via Project Management Reports (PMRs) will be considered.
Disbursement Arrangements. Each Borrower will establish its own Special Account in a bank,
acceptable to the WB, to receive WB funds. Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs), unless and until: (i) the project unit can produce regular PMRs and (ii) the borrower
wishes to use PMRs as a basis for disbursement. For large expenditures, the PCUs could request that the
WB's Disbursements Division process a direct payment to the supplier from the loan or credit account.
Internal controls. Controls over inventories of drugs, medical equipment, and other sensitive and/or
expensive assets will be especially important for these projects. The WB will assess the control
environment of the PCU and implementing agencies during project preparation, and by the auditors in
their annual audit. Significant weaknesses identified will require prompt resolution. Although project
accounting will in most (or all) cases be on the cash basis, the maintenance of a detailed asset register will
be critical for project internal control.
Financial Reporting. Maximum use will be made of a country's existing practices and reporting formats
providing that they meet WB standards. For project monitoring purposes, financial reports will be
required at least semi-annually. To the extent possible, common reporting formats will be agreed
between the government and all financiers, so as to reduce the administrative burden on the PCUs.



18
Financial Audits. Pre-selection of independent auditors for the life of the country project will be
required. An audit report prepared in accordance with WB guidelines will be required to be submitted to
the WB four to six months following the end of the project's fiscal year-end. Where disbursement
arrangements are more flexible, more frequent audits, or more detailed reviews by WB financial
management staff, will be considered.
Country-specific PADs.  Will provide more detailed information as to the particular financial
management arrangements to be put in place in each country.
Monitoring and Evaluation. A well designed and functioning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
would be critical for the implementation country projects to provide coordinated feedback to the
developers, implementators, and policy decision makers at different levels of the system (Annex 7).
There would be two types of M&E activities in the project:
a) Monitoring of project implementation. This is a function of the PCU, which would collect relevant
data from line ministries and other implementation agencies and then compile them into semi-annual
or quarterly progress reports (as the case may be) focusing on status of physical implementation by
component, use of project funds and monitoring indicators using Annex 1 details as the basis.
Specific surveys can be conducted to obtain data for this purpose. Annual expenditure reviews would
be conducted to assess government commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention and control as measured by
budgetary allocations and their distribution by activity.
b) Impact evaluation. The aim of evaluation is to find out whether the interventions are effective or the
program is having the desired impact. The evaluation will include both quantitative and qualitative
aspects and be conducted on a yearly basis. The quantitative aspects will rely on new information
systems and surveys implemented as part of the various components of the project, currently existing
data sources, and primary evaluative data collection efforts. The goal of the qualitative aspect of the
evaluation will be to document perceptions of program managers, staff, patients, and local and
national leaders. Qualitative information will be collected using site-visit interviews, focus groups,
and respondent surveys.
A baseline survey to collect information on epidemiological aspects, knowledge, attitudes and sexual
behavior, coverage and quality of services, and budgetary allocations for HIV/AIDS and related programs
will begin during project preparation and early project implementation. A mid-term review will be
carried out to assess progress in project implementation and the project design would be adjusted, if
needed, including realigning budgets among components and activities. The ex-post evaluation of the
overall project will assess if project activities achieved intended results in terms of change in
attitudes/behavior, quantity and quality of care for PLWHA, and coverage of the program in the country.
The PCU will complete an Implementation Completion Report with inputs from the WB, other donors,
and the regional agencies.
Project evaluation would be conducted by an outside agency. Regional agencies such as CAREC and
UWI, as well as PAHO/WHO and UNAIDS, have been monitoring the epidemic for several years and
assisting countries in this regard. The country projects will draw upon the technical expertise and skills of
these institutions to assist in carrying out certain aspects of the baseline survey and M&E of their
respective programs.
Program Preparation and Supervision. Program planning, preparation and supervision will be
coordinated closely with all the bilateral/multilateral donors and regional agencies that are already active
in the region. This will avoid a piece meal approach to providing assistance and help build a common



19
strategy and program for each of the countries. This is also done with the intention to draw on the
expertise of each of the external agencies and avoid duplication of effort and cost. The WB, along with
CAREC, PAHO/WHO, and UNAIDS, have been working together to help the governments of Barbados
and the Dominican Republic to prepare their national programs and this is expected to be continued in
other countries as well. Similarly, supervision would be carried out in close coordination with the donors
(See Annex 9 for the Supervision Plan).
D. Project Rationale
1. Proiect alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Regular individual World Bank operations vs. Adaptable Program Lending (APL). All of the
Caribbean countries require assistance for operationalizing regional plans and scaling up HIV/AIDS
prevention and control efforts. Because some countries such as the Dominican Republic and Barbados,
and to a lesser extent Jamaica, St. Kitts and St. Lucia, are advanced in program preparation, while others
only have initial plans that would require concerted technical assistance, it was decided that an APL
would allow the flexibility for the WB to: (i) respond immediately to the Dominican Republic and
Barbados given the window of opportunity that exists in the region for scaling up HIV/AIDS programs at
the national level; (ii) not penalize the countries that have prepared projects and taken the required steps;
(iii) allow the slower moving countries to come on board at a later stage; (iv) follow through with
building capacity for long-term sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention and control; and (v) ensure that the WB
is fully responsive to the particular needs of member countries as they arise.
Using the APL will contribute to the regional integration envisioned in the Regional Strategic Plan of
Action through the exchange of information and sharing of experience about country-specific projects
prepared and implemented according to different stages of the epidemic, income levels, and the
socioeconomic status of those who are infected. It would also reduce the cost of preparing and
supervising small operations through the involvement of other international donors and regional
organizations.
Supplemental loans to existing projects. An alternative that was considered was injecting additional
financing, in the form of supplemental loans, to ongoing projects (e.g., in the Dominican Republic and
Haiti) for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities. The importance of the issue and the need to scale
up the response at the country level, however, requires additional focus and impetus to facilitate the
implementation of priority activities. A separate project allows for the establishment of a broader policy
framework and altemative mechanisms to manage resource use and monitor the implementation of
HIV/AIDS activities. More specifically, separate HIV/AIDS project would allow the preparation of
multisectoral national plans that include the engagement of different governmental institutions and civil
society organizations, as well as scaled up efforts to serve the entire population. They would also
facilitate advocacy and a communication to mobilize political support at the highest political level needed
for mounting effective and sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts.
Programmatic lending with disbursements linked to outputs. Project team explored the feasibility of
including in the design of the program some tranched transfer of resources based on the achievement of
agreed milestones in order to finance expenditures in the Borrower's budget. The issue that was raised
(apart from the proposal to tranche an investment loan) is how the WB's procurement and fiduciary
policies would apply. However, after careful consultation within the WB, project team was advised that a
shift from a transaction-by-transaction approach to a wholesale approach in applying these policies is not
viable under current Operational Policies.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The design of the proposed APL takes into account scientific and region-specific information on
HIV/AIDS, lessons of experience worldwide, and lessons learned from project implementation in the
Caribbean.
Key lessons from global experience4 considered for designing the proposed APL and to be adapted to the
national conditions under country projects are:
Setting realistic priorities.  To improve the performance of national AIDS control programs,
policymakers need to build on a smaller core set of objectives, defined in terms of measurable outcomes,
and identify the most cost-effective set of activities and actors to meet them on a national scale.
Build government commitment and strengthen its capacity. Civil society organizations and NGOs
have a crucial role in the effective delivery of AIDS prevention and care, particularly to marginalized
groups who may actually fear contact with government. However, this does not absolve government of
its responsibility to produce those public goods essential to disease control, to coordinate and monitor the
response, to ensure that the NGOs receiving public subsidies are fully qualified and evaluated, and to
ensure that the objectives are met in a cost-effective way. Strengthening these functions is critical for
both limited and expanded responses.
Ensuring behavior change among those with the riskiest behavior. Pilot projects have shown the
effectiveness of reducing transmission through behavior change among those most likely to contract and
spread HIV and Thailand has shown the effectiveness of this approach on a national scale.
Epidemiological models have shown that even in a generalized AIDS epidemic, such as in so many sub-
Saharan countries, this strategy is key to lowering prevalence in the whole population.
Ensuring access to diagnosis and treatment of STIs and opportunistic infections, particularly
among high-risk population groups. The lowest income countries are extremely constrained in their
ability to finance medical care. Although there is no cure for AIDS, there are inexpensive treatments for
STIs and opportunistic infections such as TB that are affordable in low-income countries. Making these
cost-effective interventions widely available would substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection and
improve the quality of life of those with AIDS, at relatively low cost.
Support the development of public goods. The international community has the responsibility for
ensuring the production of global public goods--i.e. knowledge and technology that are public goods.
These investments would be of enormous benefit to less-developed countries. Under the countries,
monitoring and impact evaluation will be emphasized to generate knowledge about the effectiveness of
different strategies and activities in countries with different stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
How to scale up. On the basis of accumulated experience with rural development programs and from
HIV/AIDS programs, the following insights would be considered: (i) build on available models to
achieve behavioral changes: existing projects and programs have had time to develop culturally adapted
best practices, and their staffs and volunteers can train all those involved in scaling up; (ii) involve all
those who are willing to help: staff and elected officers of local or district governments and services,
private firms, persons living with HIV/AIDS, community-based organizations such as churches, producer
associations, local chambers of commerce, and NGOs should all be active participants; (iii) rely on
4The review of lessons learned from international experience is based on two recent publications:
(a) Ainsworth, M., and Teokul, W. Breaking the silence: setting realistic priorities for AIDS control in less-
developed countries. Lancet 2000, 356: 55-60.; and
(b) Binswanger, H.P. Scaling up HIV/AIDS Programs to National Coverage. Science 2000, 288: 2173-2176.



22
community participation and local coordination: as there are enormous variations in needs and
capabilities across communities and districts, only local stakeholders will be able to know these local
conditions and to put the required programs in place; (iv) start with existing capacities, and build them via
"learning by doing": local programs must build on existing capacities even if they are weak; their
improvement becomes one of the goals of the program; (v) focus financing on essential supplemental
inputs (e.g., training, materials such as condoms, teaching materials, test kits and drugs for STIs and
opportunistic infections); (vi) treat prevention as first priority; (vii) information, education and
communication are not sufficient to produce behavior change: intensive and highly participatory
approaches are needed; (viii) make funds available locally and don't allocate them to pre-defined
categories; (ix) promote accountability: transparent budgeting, disbursement, and accounting procedures
are needed to ensure accountability; accountability must first of all be ensured to users of the services,
and upwards accountability to government and donors will be strengthened by this as well; and (x)
improve fiscal sustainability by additional national and local resource mobilization.
Lessons from the Caribbean, particularly from the St. Lucia Watershed and Environmental Management
Project, the Jamaica Emergency Reconstruction Import Loan, and the OECS Emergency Recovery and
Disaster Management APL, are: (i) donor coordination in emergency situations is critical; (ii) the
importance of clearly defining the responsibilities of implementing agencies (ambiguous roles can lead to
significant implementation delays); (iii) flexibility in procurement procedures, particularly for small
contracts, allows rapid implementation; and (iv) the need for greater involvement of civil society
organizations in decision-making and implementation of the project. The proposed APL has been
designed and conceived with active participation of major stakeholders, both local and international, and
the responsibilities of implementing agencies will be clearly defined during negotiations. Both financial
management and procurement procedures have been made particularly flexible for the APL.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
Commitment is building regionally and on a country-by-country basis around a coherent Caribbean
approach to preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS. Evidence includes:
-   strong support by the CARICOM Heads of Govemments of the work of the Caribbean Task Force on
HIV/AIDS (July 2000 and February 2001), which produced the Regional Strategic Plan of Action for
HIV/AIDS;
*   endorsement of a proposal by the World Bank to assist the Caribbean countries through the proposed
APL, at the meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED),
held at the WB June 12-16, 2000, which involved Prime Ministers, Ministers of Finance and other
key decision-makers from member countries, country delegations as well as senior representatives of
other international donors; and
*   further endorsement of the Regional Strategic Plan of Actions and the Bank's assistance strategy at
the Regional Conference on HIV/AIDS, September 11-12, 2000, by the Government of Barbados, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti,
Jamaica, St Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, among others.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project
Highlighting HIV/AIDS as a developmental issue. By incorporating HIV/AIDS prevention and control
activities for Caribbean countries into its country assistance programs and lending portfolios, WB lending
for HIV/AIDS should substantially help to persuade policy makers that HIV/AIDS is not just a health
issue but a developmental issue of concern to all sectors in the economy.



23
Injection of new financial resources. The WB would provide financial backing to countries undertaking
an approved HIV/AIDS project in a form that can readily complement and fill gaps in other sources of
support (including the national budget). Amounts may be substantial compared to the current budgetary
allocations for the health sectors in these countries, providing governments needed "headroom" to both
address current needs and to undertake some institutional improvements that may sustain a longer-term
HIV/AIDS program.  This would also assist governments to consolidate consensus and political
ownership in their countries.
HIV/AIDS project experience. The WB is already financing HIV/AIDS-related projects in more than
80 countries and has accumulated vast experience. The lessons and best practices from these experiences
are being applied to the program. WB would also provide guidance on all aspects of project
implementation, including on procurement and financial management
Bringing in expert advice. Through the proposed program, the WB's project team includes staff
working in other regions and countries of the world, PAHO/WHO, UNAIDS and outside experts, to
provide practical, operational and state-of-the-art approaches for WV/AIDS prevention and control.
Donor coordination. The proposed program has been designed and will be implemented in collaboration
with other international and regional organizations such as CAREC, CARICOM, PAHO/WHO, UNAIDS
and UWI, forging strong regional partnerships. As done during the preparation of the projects in
Barbados and the Dominican Republic, join technical assistance and supervision missions will be fielded.
Accelerating ACCESS to HIV Care. Under the proposed program, some of the Caribbean countries
may be able to benefit from the Accelerating ACCESS to HIV Care initiative announced in May 2000.
This initiative is part of a wide range of efforts being made to increase access to care and treatment of
HIV and related illnesses. Accelerating ACCESS was initiated by and currently involves UNAIDS, the
WB, UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO, along with five R&D pharmaceutical companies.
E. Summary Project Analysis: (detailed analyses are given for each country project in the respective
country Annexes 13 and 14)
1. Economic         [xi Cost Effectiveness Analysis
The spread of HIV infection is the result of private decisions, but public intervention is necessary to
reduce the risk in a society as a whole5:
*   HIV is a communicable disease which inflicts negative externalities on society: a purely private
response is therefore likely to fall short of the social optimum;
*   markets to insure against premature deaths and WIV are incomplete;
*   information regarding HIV transmission is imperfect;
*   HIV makes people vulnerable to other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis;
*   some individuals cannot control their own risk of HIV infection (e.g., spouses, newborns, victims of
rape, accident victims who need a blood transfusion);
*   AIDS may increase both the magnitude and depth of poverty; and
*   early action is needed to prevent the epidemic from reaching the proportions it has reached in Africa.

The costs of implementing an HIV/AIDS program in the Caribbean were estimated. An all-inclusive
program (i.e., one that includes all known surveillance, prevention, and treatment) for HIV/AIDS is
beyond the financial capacity of most Caribbean countries. The countries therefore need to select a subset
among the possible interventions. It is suggested that countries take the cost-effectiveness of the different
set of interventions into account in deciding upon their priorities. Ensuring that the most cost-effective
interventions are mandated and/or financed will help the countries to ensure that their limited program
resources are put to the best possible use. Among the priority interventions thus identified are those
targeted towards reducing the rate of HIV transmission among the high-risk sub-populations specific to
any particular country. The cost-effectiveness data that was utilized to order the interventions was
obtained from evaluations conducted in other countries. Distortions may arise because cost-effectiveness
parameters are sensitive to the stage of the epidemic, among other things. The management information
systems (MIS) supported by the projects at national levels will permit the collection of the data required
to conduct periodic cost-effectiveness analyses specific to the country situations.
2. Financial
A very rough estimation of the cost of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention program was conducted
among a panel of epidemiologists and economists from the Caribbean. The purpose of the exercise was
to estimate the cost of an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment package for 23 Caribbean countries under
various scenarios.  The parameters underlying the base scenario (epidemiological data, coverage
assumptions and unit costs) were obtained from the literature and from the aforementioned panel (Annex
8).
The analysis shows that the cost of providing a comprehensive package of prevention and care activities
for 100 percent of the relevant populations of the Caribbean would be prohibitively expensive. The
comprehensive package (i.e., prevention plus basic care plus highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) at $1,000 for 15% of the HIV-infected population) would increase per capita health spending
in Haiti, for example, from $18 to $97, which is impossible. However, all countries can afford a package
that includes prevention and some basic care. Additionally, if the price of HAART goes down
substantially, then a comprehensive package of interventions will be affordable in some countries in the
Caribbean.
The fact that the countries cannot afford to finance each and every intervention to combat the spread of
the virus means that priorities have to be set. The cost-effectiveness of different types of interventions
should serve as one of the principal criteria for setting priorities. Indicative cost-effectiveness parameters
for different sets of interventions are proposed.
3. Technical
The project is technically sound and well suited to the needs of the Caribbean countries and the stage of
their epidemics. It follows international best practices, as recommended by UNAIDS and proposed by
the Caribbean Task Force on HIV/AIDS. The proposed program is also fully consistent with the WB's
Strategy in the HNP Sector as stated in the Sector Strategy Paper, as it would help achieve three major
objectives in the sector: (i) improve health outcomes among the poor, who are at a higher risk of
developing HIV/AIDS, and protect other segments of the population from the impoverishing effects of
illness and death associated with HIV/AIDS; (ii) enhance the performance of the health care systems by
promoting equitable access to preventive, care and support services for HIV/AIDS; and (iii) secure
sustainable financing for HIV/AIDS programs.
By supporting well-targeted interventions at the country level to promote behavior change and to improve
access to STI treatment among high-risk groups, the proposed program can slow the epidemic



25
dramatically. These are generally recognized as the most cost-effective interventions to control the
spread of HIV/AIDS.  By financing inexpensive treatments for opportunistic infections such as
tuberculosis, that are affordable in less-developed countries, the program would improve the quality of
life and longevity of persons with AIDS. The program would also put emphasis on capacity building to
ensure the long-term sustainability of the scaled up effort, including the strengthening of monitoring and
evaluation systems to track and assess the effectiveness of the specific interventions being financed.
4. Institutional
Implementing agencies.  Because the country projects would be multi-sectoral, participating line
ministries would be in charge of implementing their respective activities included in annual
implementation plans. Technical assistance would be provided to ministries on an as-needed basis, both
on technical and financial and procurement aspects. Projects would require government commitment of
staff and resources to strengthen the capacity of line ministries, while the project would finance some
equipment and technical assistance.
Project management. For project coordination and management, participating countries would establish
PCUs as part of existing institutional arrangements (e.g., National HIV/AIDS Commissions or National
HWV/AIDS Programs). Demonstrating this feature would be one of the factors related to the country's
admission into the multi-country program.
5. Social
The country projects are expected to have a positive social impact, as different stakeholders at the
national and local levels would be involved in their implementation, as they have done during the
preparation of national HIV/AIDS programs and action plans. The key social development outcome of
the projects would be the prevention of the spread of WV in the general population by reducing
transmission among high-risk groups. However, there are some critical issues related to the achievement
of this objective: (i) how to reach high risk groups and promote changes in their behavior, while avoiding
stigmatization of these population groups; (ii) how to increase awareness of HIV modes of transmission
among the general population, particularly among the youth, women in reproductive ages, and uneducated
groups with limited exposure to mass media; and (iii) fear of stigma and discrimination, as island
communities are often perceived as being challenged with greater confidentiality concerns and breaches
than larger countries. Country projects, with the participation of organizations such as PLWHA, would
help address these issues through interventions supporting analysis, public dialogue, and legal and
regulatory reform.
6. Environmental assessment  Environmental Category             [B]
Activities under the proposed APL are not expected to generate any adverse environmental effect as a
large part of the program is geared to support prevention activities. Whatever little medical waste
generated under the care and support component will be managed using existing guidelines in the
countries. The program would also support for updating these guidelines, training for health care workers
to manage medical waste following these guidelines, and the possible purchase of equipment for the
proper handling and disposal of medical waste in participating facilities. These provisions would be
included in the project's Operational Manuals.



26
7. Participatory approach
To date, there has been an active participation of national and regional agencies, community groups such
as PLWHA and the donor community in the development of programs and plans, as well as in the
mobilization of political support for a coordinated HIV/AIDS prevention and control program in the
Caribbean. The Secretariat of the CARICOM has assumed leadership at a political level, and its Human
and Social Development Division has the lead role in developing regional HIV/AIDS initiatives
In June 1998, CARICOM, the EU, and UNAIDS jointly organized a Pan-Caribbean Consultation on
HIV/AIDS involving 22 countries and territories, as well as regional and international partners. That
meeting underscored the need for a well-coordinated, multi-sectoral expanded response to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in the Caribbean and resulted in the establishment of the Caribbean Task Force on HIV/AIDS,
with a formal mandate from the Ministers of Health of the participating countries to coordinate and
strengthen the regional response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Chaired by the CARICOM Secretariat,
members include national experts in key HIV/AIDS programming areas, the Caribbean Network for
People Living with HIV/AIDS (CRN+), UNAIDS, CAREC, PAHO/WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, the UWI,
the EU, the Caribbean Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the WB, the
Caribbean Council of Churches, the Association of Caribbean States, the Caribbean Tourism
Organization, the Commonwealth Youth Program, the Caribbean News Agency, the Caribbean Congress
of Labor, and many other representatives of civil society. Recently, the Caribbean Task Force on
HIV/AIDS led a wide consultative process and developed a comprehensive strategic plan for the region.
That plan, the Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/IAIDS, 1999-2004, has been discussed
at length, and is now one of the substantive bases for the proposed APL.
Supporting much of the consultative process from a technical perspective has been the role of CAREC, a
specialized agency affiliated with PAHO/WHO, which has the longest experience responding
substantively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. CAREC's Special Program on STI has for many years
encouraged the involvement of multiple sectors in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the English- and Dutch-
speaking Caribbean countries. The "Special Program" has been the focus for significant participation of
bilateral and regional support; including that from Canada, France, Germany, and the European Union
(EU). PLWHA in the Caribbean have had a strong role to play in formulating strategy and programs
through CRN+, an organization established in 1996, based in Trinidad and Tobago with as affiliates in 17
countries in the region. Its goals are to share information, build self-help capacity among persons living
with HIV/AIDS, and support HIV/AIDS advocacy.
Such a spirit of inclusion and participation would be mirrored in the structure of national oversight and
management of the respective country projects.
It is expected that country projects would be launched with considerable public involvement, and that
periodic accounting for results would take place, formally in seminars and workshops, and in the regional
press. Periodic formal beneficiary assessments would be part of the WB's supervision of the program.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainabilitv
Critical to the sustainability of country projects under the proposed APL would be the continuous
ownership of this initiative by the various stakeholders, coupled with strong political support and the
availability of an adequate flow of financial resources to carry out project activities. In addition,
institutional sustainability would be ensured by: (i) strengthening of programs to maintain public
awareness of HIV/AIDS; (ii) sustained screening and prevention programs in high risk population groups
as an STI; (iii) ability at the country level to manage the risk factors associated with the transmission of
HIV as a public health rather than a moral problem; and (iv) effectiveness of programs to limit the
spreading of HIV infection to the general population by preventing transmission among high-risk groups.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects
Most of the factors that are contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS involve behavior that may be socially
unacceptable, considered to be private, and in some cases illegal. This means that achieving the types of
interventions, dialogue and compromises needed to reduce the threat and control the severity of the
epidemic will challenge many popular beliefs and social norms, and breed controversy. The political
traditions of most Caribbean countries have given them experience in managing controversies of this
type, when political leadership has been forthcoming. There is at present a high degree of political
commitment to preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS, which is adequate for managing controversies that
will undoubtedly arise.
Another controversial aspect relates to the fact that Barbados graduated from IBRD lending in 1993.
However, for the reasons stated in Section B. I of this PAD and in Sections B. I and D. I and Annex 13.1
to the Technical Annex for Barbados (see Annex 13 hereto) an exception to the Bank's graduation policy



29
in this unique case is defensible.
G. Main Loan Conditions (see Country Annexes)
Most of the key conditions needed to minimize the risks to the national projects wvould be addressed by a
country's meeting the eligibility requirements for entering the multi-country program. The particular
circumstances facing individual Borrowers would determine the number and type of additional conditions
that may be attached to the loan/credit in question. In most cases, standard requirements covering PCU
staffing, management arrangements, provisions for procurement and financial management would be
sufficient.
Minimum conditions of effectiveness of loan/credits would be: (i) the Borrower has prepared and the WB
has approved the Annual Action Plan for the first year; (ii) the Borrower has appointed key PCU staff
acceptable to the WB, and established a financial management system satisfactorily to the WB; and (iii)
the project's Operations Manual has been adopted by the Borrower.
H. Readiness for Implementation (see Country Annexes)
I. Compliance with Bank Policies

Bank policies.

Technical Annex for Barbados, the proposed loan to Barbados to partially finance the HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control Project is being presented as a one-time exception to the Bank's graduation
policy.

Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
The Spread of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean
The Caribbean: A Heterogeneous Region
The Caribbean region' is an extraordinarily diverse region of about 36 million people (see Box 2-1). It
includes English-, Spanish-, French-, and Dutch-speaking nations and territories of varying size. The
region's average regional economic growth rate of about 2% over the past decade has been insufficient to
generate adequate employment and reduce poverty, and individual countries are at varying stages of
development. Some Caribbean countries, including Barbados, the Bahamas, Antigua, and Bermuda, are
ranked high according to the U.N. Human Development Index, and most others, with the exception of
Haiti, are ranked at a medium level. The region as a whole is undergoing a demographic transition-a
process of population change consisting of a gradual evolution from high birth and death rates to low
ones. Haiti with high birth and death rates is at the lowest stage of demographic transition, Jamaica,
Bahamas and Barbados are at the highest. In some countries, including the Bahamas, the Dominican
Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago, the urbanization process is far advanced (more than 60% of the
population reside in urban areas); however, in other countries, including Haiti, large segments of the
population still live in rural areas. Economic activity in the region varies and includes the export of
petroleum in Trinidad and Tobago to heavy reliance on tourism and banana exports in the countries that
are part of the OECS.
Available data suggest that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is spreading alarmingly in the Caribbean region.
CARICOM estimates that more cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in the Caribbean between 1995 and
1998 than had been reported since the beginning of the epidemic in the early 1980s. Perhaps not
surprisingly, given the region's heterogeneity, the epidemics in the Caribbean have different driving
forces and transmission routes. Different countries have also varied in their responses to HIV/AIDS. As
a result, the Caribbean region as a whole might be considered to have not a single HIVIAIDS epidemic,
but a "mosaic" of epidemics (Confronting AIDS, 1998):
* Haiti, Bahamas, Barbados, the Dominican Republic, and Guyana have generalized epidemics,
meaning that HIV has spread far beyond the original subpopulations with high-risk behavior,2 and 5%
or more of women attending prenatal clinics are infected. Better reporting system in Barbados and
Bahamas are contributing to a better understanding of the magnitude of the epidemic.
* Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemics, meaning that their
national epidemics are still affecting primarily population groups practicing high-risk behaviors
(among whom infection rates exceed 5%) but are set to spread more widely in the rest of the
population.
* Other countries in the Caribbean either have insufficient information to be classified or have
nascent epidemics, meaning HIV/AIDS prevalence is still low (less than 5%-even among people
presumed to practice high-risk behavior).
'The fact that non member countries or non eligible Bank member countries are mentioned in this annex, it does not
imply that these countries will participate in the proposed APL.
2High-risk behaviour is defined as engaging in unprotected (i.e., without a condom) sexual intercourse with many
partners or sharing of unsterilized needles or other injecting equipment.

Box 2-1. Overview of the Caribbean Region
Definitions of the territorial scope of the Caribbean vary. Probably the "social/cultural" definition of the
"wider" Caribbean region is most relevant as it pertains to the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the region. The
"wider" Caribbean region includes the following:
1. The sovereign-state members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), including both island-
nations (Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica,
Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and
Tobago) and the mainland countries of Belize in Central America, and Guyana and Suriname in South
America.
2. Spanish-speaking Cuba and the Dominican Republic.
3. The semiautonomous states of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles
islands of Bonaire, Curacao, Saint Marten, Statia, and Saba).
4. The British-dependent territories of Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands,
Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.
5. The U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico and territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
6. The territories of the Republic of France consisting of French Guyana, St. Marten, Guadeloupe, and
Martinique.
The Caribbean is a multiethnic region with many cultural differences. There are English-speaking
countries (e.g., Trinidad and Tobago), Spanish-speaking countries (e.g., the Dominican Republic), French-
speaking countries (e.g., Haiti), and Dutch-speaking countries (e.g., Suriname). The majority of the
population is of African descent, but there are also people of European, Hispanic, and Asian ancestry (e.g.,
East Indians in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana).
The mainland states of Belize, Guyana, and Suriname, which by virtue of language and cultural heritage,
form part of the Caribbean region, are much larger in land mass than the island states of the Caribbean:
Belize (29,963 km2, population 215,000), Guyana (219,470 kM2, population 813,000), and Suriname
(163,820 kM2, population 437,000). The island states of the Caribbean vary in size and population from
Anguilla (91 km2 and 8,000 inhabitants) to Jamaica 11,424 km2 and a population of 2,447,000.
Historically, the Caribbean region has been strongly influenced by Europe and the United States. Many of
the English-speaking Caribbean countries have modeled their educational system, the legal system and the
political system on the United Kingdom. The countries of the English-speaking Caribbean have a
combined population of around 6.7 million scattered over the vast Caribbean Sea, whose farthest points
span about 3,500 kilometers between the coasts of Belize and Guyana. The Bahamas and the Dominican
Republic are economically reliant on the United States. France and Holland also have strong links with
some of the non-English speaking countries, for example Martinique and Curacao. Therefore, there has
been much migration from these countries to the Caribbean. The Caribbean is also a major tourist
destination, attracting visitors from many parts of the world. Similarly, over the past 40 years, for
economic reasons, many Caribbean citizens have migrated primarily to the United States, Canada, and the
United Kingdom. There is also much business travel within and outside the Caribbean.
The geographic, political, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the Caribbean region underscores both the
complexities in understanding the patterns of HIV contagion and successful responses. Given that human
movement throughout the Caribbean and between it and other geographic areas has been the basic
foundation of this region's existence since its formative days of "triangular trade" of slavery and
colonization, it is clear that an appropriate response to the HIV/AIDS epidemics must recognize the
contributing factor of its geopolitical heterogeneity and the complete disregard by HIV of geopolitical
boundaries.

HIV/AIDS Epidemiological Patterns and Trends in the Caribbean
Official statistics on the prevalence and incidence of HIV/AIDS cases in the Caribbean are presented
below. It is important to recognize, however, that these statistics reflect a high level of underreporting of
such cases.
Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean3
In 1999, about 360,000 persons were reported to be living with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region (see
Table 2-1). According to UNAIDS, underreporting varies between 30% and 75%. The prevalence of
HIV among adults ages 15-49 in the Caribbean region is 2%. The Caribbean region currently has the
highest prevalence of HIV of any region of the world other than the AIDS-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa,
where the prevalence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 49 is reported to be 8.0%.
As discussed further below, the primary mode of HIV transmission among adults in the Caribbean region
is sexual intercourse between men and women. For that reason, the percentage of women with
HIV/AIDS is rising. As of 1999, about 35% of the adults affected with HIV in the Caribbean region were
women. Children under age 14 currently account for only a small part of the known WHV-infected
population in the Caribbean region as a whole, but the pediatric share is growing. By late 1996, there had
been 6,911 cases of HIV/AIDS diagnosed in children under age 14 in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Most young children (about 75%) are infected by their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, delivery,
or breast-feeding.
In some Caribbean countries, even though the numbers of children involved are still fairly small, pediatric
cases account for a significant portion of the HV/AIDS population. In fact, the data available as of 1995
showed that certain countries in the Caribbean were among the countries with the highest percentage of
pediatric HIV/AIDS cases in the Americas: 18.2% of HWV/AIDS cases in the British Virgin Islands
occurred among children, 8% in French Guyana, 8.8% in Antigua and Barbuda, 8.4% in the Bahamas,
and 7.2% in Trinidad and Tobago (Health Conditions in the Americas, PAHO/WHO, 1998).
None of the Caribbean countries and territories has been spared from HIV/AIDS. It is important to note,
however, that officially reported HWV/AIDS cases and estimates disguise a wide variation in prevalence
among the countries in the region. Some Caribbean countries have the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS
among adults in Latin American and the Caribbean (see Table 2-2). The most affected countries are
Haiti, the Bahamas, Barbados, and Guyana, with an WIV prevalence rate among adults that ranges
between about 2% and 5%. Haiti, with an HIVprevalence rate of 5.17%, is the most affected country in
the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Cuba, on the other hand, has one of the lowest rates in the
Arnericas (.02%). In terms of numbers of HIV/AIDS cases in the Caribbean, two countries stand out.
Haiti and the Dominican Republic, taken together, account for 85% of the total number of cases in the
Caribbean.
3 Prevalence is a commonly used epidemiological term that refers to the percentage of people suffering from an
illness or condition at a given time. Prevalence rates are typically expressed as a percentage of the total
population. Thus, the prevalence of HIV is defined as the percentage of the total population that is infected with
HIV, including both WV-positive individuals who have not yet developed AIDS and individuals whose WV
infection has developed into AIDS. From a public health point of view, HIV prevalence is important because it
provides a measure of the population's general risk of contracting AIDS. The higher the prevalence of HIV, the
higher the risk of contracting AIDS.

According to UNAIDS, which has estimated the number of HIV/AIDS cases taking into account such
underreporting, several factors contribute to an underestimation of the size and scope of the HIV/AIDS
problem in the Caribbean:
*   A lack of a standardized case definition in the region as a whole, which makes consistent diagnosis
and uniform reporting difficult;
*   few and outdated sentinel surveillance studies to determine HIV seroprevalence4 over time;
*   a lack of national policies in the Caribbean regarding testing and reporting of HIV;
*   limited or no access to voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing; and
4Seroprevalence: the prevalence of an infection in a given population as detected in blood serum.

CARICOM. In the English-speaking
Caribbean countries, the AIDS incidence
rate rose from 142.3 AIDS cases per million in 1991 to 246.2 per million in 1996. In the Latin Caribbean
countries, although Cuba remains with a low AIDS incidence rate, data from Haiti and the Dominican
Republic show a similar upward trend. If Puerto Rico is included in the Latin Caribbean figures, the
observed trend becomes more pronounced.
Incidence, in contrast to prevalence, is defined as the number of new cases of a disease occurring in the population
during a specified period of time. Thus, the incidence of AIDS is often presented as the number of new cases of
AIDS diagnosed during a given year per million populations. Many years typically lapse between the time an
individual is infected with LHV and the time he or she develops full-blown AIDS. For that reason, AIDS incidence
rates reflect rates of WV infection from years before. Absent widespread screening for WV, most cases of
HIV/AlDS are only detected when individuals develop and begin to exhibit symptoms of AIDS. For this reason,
statistics on the incidence of AIDS cases may be thought of as only the "tip of the iceberg," because many people
who are infected with HIV in the population have not yet developed visible signs of AIDS.

younger and younger population groups. About
83%  of AIDS cases are diagnosed in people
between the ages of 15 and 54, and almost half of
these cases are diagnosed in people ages 25 to 34.
These figures suggest, given an estimated average
incubation period of eight to 10 years from HIV
infection to the development of AIDS, that about  Q1  /_ ____=_-__
half of new HIV infections are occurring among         1E  1i  1Mi  198 1iM  19  19  1M ,    -
young people ages 15 to 24. The affected age
groups are those forming the labor force.
Among men, the majority of AIDS cases are in
the 30-34 and 25-29 age cohort; among women,                         Year
the majority of cases are in the 25-29 year-old
age bracket, followed by the 30-34 year age
group (PAHO/WHO, 1998).                       Source. PAHO/WHO, 1998
6 PAHO/WHO reporting of HIV/AIDS statistics for the Caribbean region is usually broken down into two
categories: CAREC countries (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Berrmuda, Belize, British
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, and Suriname); and the Latin
Caribbean group (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Haiti).

Modes of HIV Transmission in the Caribbean
In Latin America and the Caribbean, unprotected sexual contact is the main transmission mechanism for
HI V/AIDS. More than half of all the AIDS cases that have occurred in the Caribbean region to date were
the result of reported unprotected sexual intercourse between men and women. In the English-speaking
Caribbean, heterosexual contact accounts about 60% of reported AIDS cases (see Figure 2-3), while in
the Latin Caribbean it represents about 50% of the reported AIDS cases. The following factors have a
large influence on the rate of sexual transmission of HIV and other STDs (Confronting AIDS, 1998):
*  The longer a person remains infectious;
*  the more frequent a person has sexual contacts; and
*  the more new sexual partners contacted.
Other modes of HIV transmission in the Caribbean region, as discussed further below, are
homosexual/bisexual unprotected sexual relations; the use of contaminated needles by intravenous drug
users; blood-borne transmission; and, increasingly, MTCT. The percentage of AIDS cases due to MTCT
of HIV in the Caribbean is now the highest in the Americas.
Heterosexual Transmission of HIV
Sex between men and women has quickly outpaced HIV transmission by other means. Heterosexual
transmission has been the main route of HIV transmission since 1986. Women are more vulnerable to
HIV than men for biological reasons (i.e., their anatomy makes them more vulnerable than men), as well
as for social and cultural norms (i.e., machismo; male-female power relations whereby many women have
little or no power to negotiate safer sex practices with their male partners). About 35% of the adults
living with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region are women.

Currently, the Caribbean region has one of the highest rates of new AIDS cases among women in the
Americas. The male-to-female ratio for reported H[V infection cases has been declining in both the
Caribbean and Latin America in the 1990s. In the early part of the decade, the ratios were 4.9:1 in Latin
America and 2:1 in the Caribbean, whereas in 1996, they were 3.2:1 and 1.7:1, respectively. According
to PAHO!WHO, the declining male-to-female ratio of HIV infections reflects the growing "feminization"
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in these regions.
In Haiti, the ratio of male-to-female HIV infections is almost 1:1 (i.e., almost evenly split between
genders), and the HIV/AIDS epidemic has spread broadly to 8% of pregnant women-as a result, there is
significant MTCT of HIV in that country. Similarly, in Guyana, nearly 7% of women attending prenatal
clinics were infected with I-V as of 1992. In the Dominican Republic, more than 70% of AIDS cases are
attributed to heterosexual transmission; there, the male-to-female ratio of cases now stands at 2:1 and is
declining. The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is 2.8% nationwide in that country, and in
some areas it has reached 8%. The male-to-female ratio of HIV infections in other countries, including
Dominica, Barbados, Antigua, and Trinidad and Tobago, ranges between 3.6:1 and 2.4: 1.
Men-Who-Have-Sex-with-Men Transmission of HIV
Reported homosexual and bisexual transmission of HIV is relatively low in the Caribbean, accounting for
about 10% of AIDS cases, but MSM transmission is nonetheless considered an important mode of HIV
transmission. Given discrimination against homosexuals and bisexuals in the Caribbean it is quite likely
that the reported data underestimate the true percentage of AIDS cases attributable to MSM transmission
of HIV.
According to CAREC, approximately 20% of AIDS cases among men in the English-speaking Caribbean
are reported to be due to sexual contact with other men, whereas 22% of cases of cases among men are



41
reported as "mode of transmission: unknown." Of the 22%, it is assumed that most are probably through
male-to-male sex.
Injecting-Drug-Use Transmission of HIV
In most Caribbean countries, the transmission of HIV by injecting drug use is reported to be minimal,
ranging from 0% to 2% of AIDS cases. Bermuda is the exception, where injecting-drug-use transmission
represents 43% of total reported AIDS cases. Puerto Rico, reflected in United States statistics, represents
another Caribbean community heavily affected by injecting drug use. Crack-cocaine drug use has been
shown to be associated with higher risk of HIV infection in the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, and
Jamaica. Among crack-cocaine users, HIV seroprevalence can be as high as 42% in Bahamas and
Trinidad and Tobago (CAREC, 1999).
Mother-to-Child and Blood-Borne Transmission of HIV
The percentage of AIDS cases where children were infected by HIV-positive mothers is higher in the
Caribbean region than in any other part of the Americas. Recent estimates indicate that following the
increase in the number of AIDS cases among women, mother-to-child or vertical transmission now
accounts for 6% of all reported AIDS cases in CAREC countries. MTCT is more likely to happen
depending on the stage of the disease that the woman is in, the viral load and procedures carried out
during birth. The transmission of HIV through blood or blood product account for less than 3% of AIDS
cases in the Caribbean.
Populations at High Risk of HIV Infection in the Caribbean
Populations at high-risk are young people who engage in unprotected sexual intercourse, and men who
engage in sexual intercourse with other men. The newborns of HlV-infected women are another group at
high risk.
Many countries in the Caribbean have set up surveillance systems to track the spread of HIV through their
populations. The specific type of surveillance necessary follows the general pattern of infection in a
given country. Sentinel surveillance of population groups in the Caribbean have primarily included CSW,
people attending STD clinics, and pregnant women. These groups are discussed below.
Commercial Sex Workers
CSWs are defined as women or men who provide sex for material gain. In the Caribbean, as noted by
CARICOM (2000), commercial sex work is widespread and increasing throughout the countries. It is
linked to tourism and to other economic endeavors such as mining, migrant farming and informal sector
hawking. Economic hardship is the primary motivating factor for sex work.
Prevalence among sex workers has been rising over the course of the epidemic. The problem is
aggravated by the absence of any regulation in the sex trade industry and the marginalized status of the
trade, implying that social and health services are rarely responsive to the particular needs of CSW
(CARICOM, 2000). In Haiti, 42% to 53% of this population group in the largest urban areas is infected;
in the Dominican Republic, the figures varied between 5% and 6% in 1994-95 (PAHO/WHO, 1998). The
epidemic has also infected significant numbers of CSW in Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
In Guyana, a survey of CSW found a seroprevalence of 25% in 1993. In Jamaica, HIV prevalence among
CSW in Kingston was 11% in 1995, but was higher in Montego Bay at 22%. Surveys of commercial sex
workers in Trinidad and Tobago have also found high rates of HIV infection (EU, 1998).

Attendees of Clinics for Treating STDs
STDs are common in the Caribbean (PAHO/WHO, 1996). Studies in both industrial and developing
countries indicate that people with current or past STDs are two to nine times more likely to be infected
with HIV (Confronting AIDS, 1998). HIV infection rates are high among STD clinic attendees in several
Caribbean countries, reflecting the close interaction between HIV/AIDS infection and STDs. In Jamaica,
HIV prevalence among STD clinic attendees rose from 0.25% in 1986 to 3.1% in 1990 and 6.3% in 1997.
Among STD clinic "repeaters," IHV prevalence was higher; 10% in 1990 and 9.3% in 1993. In Guyana,
HIV prevalence among STD clinic attendees was as high as 13.1% in 1992 and 6.6% among women and
21.0% among men in 1995. In Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas, HIV prevalence among STD
clinic attendees peaked at 13.6% in 1991/92 and declined to 6-7% in 1995/96. Among Haitian migrant
workers living in the bateyes, or sugarcane plantations, of the Dominican Republic in 1995, there was
high prevalence of STDs, including 5.7% for HIV (PAHO/WHO, 1998).
Pregnant Women
HIV prevalence among pregnant women has been monitored in several countries through sentinel
surveillance. CAREC (1999) estimated that in 1997 there was an HIV prevalence rate of 1-2% among
pregnant women in the Caribbean.
Haiti has the highest prevalence of HIV among women receiving prenatal care services in the Latin
Caribbean (ranging from 8% to 9% between 1986 and 1993 in urban areas and from 3% to 4% in rural
areas between 1986 and 1990). In the Dominican Republic the figures ranged from 1% in 1991 to 4%-
8% in 1998. In Cuba there is no sign of infection among this population (PAHO/WHO, 1998).
In the English-speaking Caribbean, the prevalence of HIV infection among women receiving prenatal
care services is less than 1% in the Bahamas, Grenada, the Cayman Islands, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago (PAHO/WHO, 1998). In Jamaica, HIV seroprevalence
among prenatal clinic attendees increased from 1.4 per 1,000 in 1989 to 9.5 in 1997. In Barbados, HIV
seroprevalence varied between 8 and 12 per 1,000 between 1992 and 1996. In Guyana, a survey of
pregnant women in 1992 found an HIV infection prevalence of 7%. In the Bahamas, countrywide HIV
screening of pregnant women was introduced on a voluntary basis. HIV prevalence among pregnant
women was highest in 1993 at 4.8% and declined to 4.2% in 1994 and 3.6% in 1995.
Mortality Due to AIDS in the Caribbean
During the last two decades, there were 6,566 AIDS deaths reported in the region, representing 1.4% of
total AIDS deaths in the Americas (PAHO/WHO, 1998). The actual number of deaths due to AIDS in the
Caribbean is probably higher than the officially reported number (given the probability of underreporting
or inaccurate diagnosis of cause of death).
The AIDS case fatality rate7 in the Caribbean region as a whole is high, 63% in 1996. In the English-
speaking Caribbean, AIDS is now the largest cause of death among young men between the ages of 15
and 44. Recent research in the Dominican Republic shows that AIDS is the most common cause of death
among women in their reproductive ages in the geographic area studied, the National District of Santo
Domingo, which encompasses about 30% of the country's population. About 12% of all deaths among
the women of childbearing age were found to be caused by AIDS in that region; the next most common
cause of death was violence. Unfortunately, mortality from AIDS disproportionately affects young
7 The case fatality rate is the number of deaths from a disease during a defined period of time expressed as a
percentage of the total number of people with the disease.



43
women: 56% of all deaths due to AIDS occur in individuals between 20 and 34 years of age (Caceres
Urafia, 1998).
One of the most devastating impacts of deaths from HIV/AIDS is on the children of parents who are
victims of the disease. HIV/AIDS most frequently strikes adults who are often raising children and are at
the prime of their working lives. By the end of 1999, the cumulative number of Caribbean children
estimated to have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS at age 14 or younger stood at 83,000 (UNAIDS, 1999).
Experience in other regions of the world has demonstrated that deaths and illness due to AIDS among
adults has a profoundly negative impact on the welfare of children in the affected households.
Frequently, poor health and premature death of adults lead to income and expenditures changes that can
have adverse effects on child nutrition and schooling (Confronting AIDS, 1998; Dasgupta et al. 1999).
Some families can no longer afford school costs or the children are needed to help out at home.
Children's education may also suffer as a result, reducing literacy rates in communities. This would be
particularly onerous for poor families given the already stratified educational system in the Caribbean that
is reflected in higher attrition of poor students at all grade levels that becomes deeper and wider at each
successive level, and in a skewed distribution of resources to the detriment of schools in poorer
communities (Caribbean Education Sector Strategy 2020, WB, 2000).
According to UNAIDS (2000), AIDS case fatality rates have remained at a constant high in the Caribbean
due to several factors:
*  Late diagnosis of HIV infection and related conditions;
*  lack of policies, skills, and resources in preventing HIV MTCT in many countries;
*  lack of accessibility to ARV drugs use to treat HIV-positive individuals in countries such as the
United States;
X  lack of access to basic medicines to combat opportunistic infections; and
* lack or denial of services to HIV/AIDS patients in some countries.
In some countries of the Caribbean, HIV/AIDS has pushed back or is starting to reverse the gains in life
expectancy achieved in previous decades as the result of progress in the fight against communicable
diseases. In Haiti and Guyana, life expectancy is estimated to be 5.7 and 5.2 years less, respectively, than
it would have been without AIDS (UNAIDS, 2000). What is ominous for the Caribbean region, however,
is that even if all HIV transmission could be halted today, the impact of the illness and deaths of the
people already infected will befelt over the next two decades.
Socioeconomic Impacts of AIIDS in the Caribbean
HIV has a long latency period, so some of the social and economic consequences of the HIVWAIDS
epidemic may not be felt immediately. Eventually, however, if the prevalence of HIV continues to
increase in the Caribbean as it has been, per capita economic growth may begin to decline. Increased
expenditures for treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related diseases from government budgets and household
savings will reduce the capital for more productive investments.
Preliminary efforts have been made to project the expected macroeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS within
Caribbean countries by the years 2005 and 2020. A macroeconomic impact study of Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago revealed contractions in major variables, such as the GDP (declines of 6.4 and 4.2
percent, respectively). The level of investment was also severely affected as incomes had to be redirected



44
from the production of goods and services to finance HIV- related expenditures. These HIV-related
illness expenditures rose by 25.3% in Trinidad and Tobago and 35.4% in Jamaica. Even using low case
scenario data, impacts upon several key industries were evidenced, the service sector categories were
more greatly affected than employment in agriculture or manufacturing (Camara at al, 1997).
The emergence of AIDS as a major health problem places a tremendous burden on the health care
systems of the Caribbean countries. Assessments conducted by the University of the West Indies
(UNAIDS, 1998) suggest that HIV/AIDS may have important fiscal consequences in the Caribbean, as
national health budgets are increasingly taxed by the costs of care for HIV-infected people (e.g., the
biggest burden to the health care system is that for managing the opportunistic infections, such as
tuberculosis, chronic and severe diarrhea, and other complications, that all put a burden on the bed
capacity of hospitals and outpatient departments). The case management of HIV or AIDS through the
prophylactic administration of an antiretroviral drug like zidovudine (AZT), that costs more than
US$3,000 per year, would represent more than three times the national per capita income in many
Caribbean countries. AIDS drains scarce skills and resources needed for addressing other health priorities
such as childhood diseases or malaria.
HIV/AIDS has considerable potential to cause a negative impact on economic sectors such as agriculture,
tourism, mining, lumber, finance, and trade as a result of lost productivity of economically active adults
with HIV/AIDS and premature death. The shock of AIDS to the labor markets is one mechanism through
which AIDS might adversely affect economic growth in the Caribbean. At present, the affected age
groups (83% of AIDS cases in the Caribbean are in the age group 15-54 years) are those forming the
labor force. A survey of people living with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean indicates that most of them were
already unemployed due in some cases to workplace attitudes (Wint, 2000).
As noted in a United Nations Security Council meeting convened in early January 2000, the first time to
take up a health issue, HIV/AIDS has grown beyond a health epidemic to become a threat to global
security and stability. In a similar fashion, the United States government in April 2000 formally
designated the disease as a threat to U.S. national security because the epidemic could undo decades of
development work in the world. These concerns are highly relevant for the Caribbean because its
HIV/AIDS epidemic could create significant externalities beyond the region (e.g., according to recent
health data, the fastest growing epidemic within Canada is amongst Canadians from the Caribbean,
mainly Haitian in Montreal; the second highest urban HIV seroprevalence in the United States is found in
San Juan, Puerto Rico). The high-profile international attention to this issue implies that Caribbean
governments cannot deny or ignore it anymore.
The Task Ahead
The forces driving the HV/AlDS epidemic and the implications of the epidemic in the Caribbean are
inextricably linked to the region's economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Caribbean AIDS experts
have put forth a number of specific challenges to addressing the problem of HIV/AIDS in the region,
including the following:
* A large discrepancy between cultural, moral, and religious taboos and actual sexual practices in
Caribbean countries;
*  a lack of information and HIV/AIDS prevention programs targeted to groups most at risk (e.g., young
people, CSW, MSM, migrants);
* low approval rate of condom use among men and women, coupled with the church opposition to
condom use;



45
*  stigmatization of and discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS, which contribute to HIV
transmission by discouraging the use of HIV testing and other services;
*  low use of health care facilities for managing HIV/AIDS and other STDs, both in the public and the
private sectors, due in part to concerns about confidentiality and the lack of access to effective
HIV/AIDS therapies; and
*  the lack of ARV drugs for most HIV-infected people and people with AIDS in the Caribbean.
Caribbean governments and their partners have taken several actions to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
but these actions have not yet turned the epidemic around. It is important for Caribbean governments,
with the support of their development partners, to act decisively now before the epidemic reaches the
levels it has in sub-Saharan Africa. A key challenge will be putting more effective HIV/AID prevention
programs into place. As governments operate with resource constraints and fixed budgets, the call for
greater actions in health protection and promotion and disease prevention cannot ignore their cost and
how these services will be paid for. The WB's 1993 World Development Report (WB, 1993)
recommends that developing countries use an approach for setting priorities that involves comparing the
likely costs and impacts of different preventive and curative interventions. This approach is an important
resource allocation tool because cost-effective interventions such as greater use of condoms, cost as little
as U$8 per infection averted, whereas the treatment of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS and
anti-HIV treatment, which does not cure AIDS, costs thousands of dollars per year per patient.

Source: WHO, The World Health Report 2000, Health Systems: Improving Performance
The index of performance on the level of health reports how efficiently health systems translate
expenditure into health as measured by disability - adjusted life expectancy (DALE). Performance on the
level of health is defined as the ratio between achieved levels of health and levels of health that could be
achieved by the most efficient health system. More specifically, the numerator of the ratio is the
difference between observed DALE in a country and the DALE that would be observed in the absence of
a functioning modern health system given the other non-health system determinants that influence health,
which are represented by education. The denominator of the ratio is the difference between the maximum
possible DALE that could have been achieved for the observed levels of health expenditure per capita in
each country and the DALE in the absence of a functioning health system. Econometric methods have
been used to estimate the maximum DALE for a given level of health expenditure and other non-health
system factors using frontier production analysis. The relationship between life expectancy and human
capital at the turn of the century was used to estimate the minimum DALE that would have been expected
in each country (at current levels of educational attainment) in the absence of an effective health system.
The table provides uncertainty intervals for both the absolute value of performance and the rank of each
country.

Annex 4
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS Prepared by the CARICOM-led Task Force,
Priority Areas and Strategic Actions
The overall intention of the Plan is to reduce the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. Its
framework identifies areas for priority action at the regional level, which are focused on promoting a
strengthened, effective and coordinated regional response to the epidemic, and supporting expanded
multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS programs at the national level. The Regional Strategic Plan is based largely on
the efforts of these groups to coordinate and prioritize HIV/AIDS work in the Caribbean region. The
priority areas are as follows:
* Advocacy, policy development and legislation;
* support of people living with HIV/AIDS;
* prevention of HIV transmission, with a focus on young people;
* prevention of HIV transmission among especially vulnerable groups: -
- Men who have sex with men (MSM)
- Sex workers
- Prisoners
- Uniformed populations (military and police)
- Mobile populations
- Workplace interventions
* prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; and
* strengthening national and regional response capability.
Specific actions under these broad categories include:
Priority 1. Advocacy, policy development and legislation
* Promote the incorporation of human rights and non-discrimination practices in policy and legislation,
in accordance with international guidelines, best practice and commitments;
* mobilize regional opinion leaders on HIV/human rights issues;
* promote awareness at multisectoral level on HIV and human rights issues;
* ensure that national level policy decisions reflect international standards/best practice/consistency
with international guidelines;
* increase participation of PLWHAs in policy dialogue;



48
*  expand analysis of the impact of the epidemic on key social and economic sectors;
* identify opportunities for regional participation in international vaccine efforts; and
*  ensure inclusion of HIV/AIDS issues in regional health sector reform activities (at national and
regional level).
Priority Area 2. Care and Support for People Living with HIV/AIDS
* Promote the active formation and participation of networks of people living with HIV/AIDS in
program and policy design, implementation and evaluation (GIPA);
*  develop and promote improved understanding of quality of care issues;
*  improve access to basic medication (for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections);
*  improve access to antiretrovirals;
*  ensure that regional standards for clinical management and care for STI/HIV/AIDS are being met;
*  improve understanding & opportunities for regional bulk procurement of test kits and drugs,
condoms, etc; and
-  strengthen and extend counseling and diagnostic facilities.
Priority Area 3. Prevention of HIV Transmission, with a focus on young people

Annex 5
Multi-Country HlV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Criteria for Country Participation
Rationale
To have maximum impact on reducing the spread and cost of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean, it is critical
that all qualifying countries begin implementing their own country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Projects within the next 24-30 months. Achieving this is one of the development objectives of the Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program.
Most countries have begun formulating concepts and strategies for expanded responses to the epidemic,
with assistance from such agencies as CAREC, PAHO/WHO, and INAIDS, as well as bilateral donors.
The WB will also support this effort through the PHRD Grants provided by the Government of Japan.
Many are following the recommendations of the Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS, developed by
the CARICOM-led Task Force on HIV/AIDS and approved by CARICOM Heads of Government, July
2000. A common problem, however, is that lack of operational plans and sufficient financing is a
significant constraint to implementing these responses. Part of the WB's value added in the effort to
prevent the spread of the epidemic and control its effects is to support the development of implementable
programs and to provide incremental resources to finance country projects that are compatible with the
framework established for the WB's Multi Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program.
For countries to make optimal use of the WB's resources, they should be in a position to absorb the
assistance rapidly and cost-effectively soon after is it made available. This would strengthen the public
credibility and accountability of country projects. Also before beginning its project, a country should
have built the lessons of international experience into its own project. To provide the incentive for this to
occur, a country project would be considered eligible for financing under the Multi-Country Program only
when it met criteria that experience has shown necessary for project success. These would be treated as
conditions for negotiations of the proposed country project (this method mirrors the use of "triggers" in
a one-country APL to initiate the appraisal and negotiation of subsequent loans within a national
program) and necessary conditions for approval. The final decision to borrow and lend would also
depend on other traditional considerations affecting Borrower-WB transactions (including an agreed
CAS; creditworthiness considerations, manifested demand by a borrower, etc).
Eligibility Criteria
Country projects would be prepared and appraised following normal WB procedures, assuring that
quality-at-entry norms apply and that Safeguard policies and standards for maintaining financial
management and procurement discipline are observed. The operational design of each project would
account for the factors normally considered in formulating detailed project components and phasing of
project activities. It would be important that all projects correctly reflect the environment in which they
would be implemented with scaling and phasing of project activities, management arrangements, cost-
sharing provisions, risk mitigation requirements, among others, appropriate to the borrower's current
situation. Consequently, a program in a country with little history of Bank projects and relatively weak
institutions could be considered- equally "eligible" for inclusion in the program as one in a country with
long histories and well-developed institutions, as long as the project design was appropriate for the
situation. Both could, in principle, meet the criteria considered relevant for initiating a successful



52
HlV/AIDS program.
The following are the criteria for entering into negotiations of a country loan, and the standards that
would be used to apply them:
1. Preparation of a National HIV/AIDS Strategy and Program:
Advanced: An eligible country would have an approved national strategic plan showing understanding
of the issues and goals for addressing them, actions adapted from best practice and the Regional Strategic
Action Plan to meet national priorities, evidence of strong public support and a well balanced range of
stakeholders. It would have identified HIV/AIDS prevention or treatment activities that could be scaled
up; have included financing for HIV/AIDS programs in the National Budget; prepared and included in its
strategic target levels of key indicators such as AIDS-related mortality, prevalence among high risk
groups and the general population, and other leading indicators of future reductions; included both
treatment and prevention goals in program plans; and be conducting ongoing public dialogue and/or
involvement.
Moderate: As for "Advanced" but missing some key elements in the plans and without reliable budget
allocations.
Low: Many key aspects missing, especially public dialogue and establishment of goals, requiring
significant additional identification of implementable actions and direction.
2. Readiness of National Leadership:
Advanced: An eligible country would have national commitment and leadership, including a well
structured project management unit empowered to be proactive, a national leader/champion with
sufficient stature to direct the effort, and evidence of current budgetary support for HIV/AIDS and the
strong probability of readiness to meet future recurrent budgetary requirements; a sufficient key
appointments would have been made to begin operations and budget transfers would have begun to
initiate multi-sectoral action;
Moderate: Leadership concepts and design would have been accepted in principle, and some key persons
would be involved in leadership roles; budget transfer mechanisms decided but not implemented; national
commitment equivocal
Low: Concepts under discussion; key persons not associated regularly, low public awareness and little
public commitment.
3. Pro_rammin2 for Multi-sectoral Implementation:
Advanced: A satisfactory implementation strategy would include program execution through multiple
ministries when the public sector is involved and through NGOs, community groups and civil society
organizations: a minimum amount of such activity would be underway and when relevant, past
performance of "de-concentrated" implementation is being used to guide practice.
Moderate: Policy embraces decentralized implementation but important shortcomings in preparedness
and practice remain.
Low: Policy is not clear on multi-sectoral implementation.



53
4. Use of Sustainable Business Arrangements:
Advanced:  An eligible country would have put in place sturdy and sustainable implementation
arrangements (financial, procurement, regulatory); including as needed, legal frameworks that permit
implementation through "de-concentrated arrangements "; and financial management and procurement
arrangements that are acceptable to the WB.
Moderate: Agreement reached in principle on concepts but without actual frameworks and/or practice
being in place.
Low: Policy not decided and/or under discussion.
5. Status of Monitorinig and Evaluation:
Advanced: An eligible country would have clearly defined its institutional arrangements for, and be
ready to initiate the monitoring the evolution of the H1V/AIDS epidemic and for evaluating program
progress and impact;
Moderate: Sketchy baseline information; limited experience with monitoring public health as a regular
practice; structures for behavioral and social monitoring not sufficiently developed for HIV/AIDS.
Low: No discernable capacity.
During project preparation, as with most projects, borrowers would normally advance on meeting all of
these criteria in tandem. Each country in the Caribbean has been awarded a PHRD Grant to assist the
country in meeting these eligibility criteria, assuming that countries are currently satisfying any two of the
five eligibility criteria. The Grant aims to help the countries make progress towards satisfying all five
criteria. However, each country in the region is starting from a different level in terms of their
institutional capacity---in general and specifically for preparing and implementing HIV/AIDS programs.
This would make it difficult for each of them to meet a common absolute standard and still be eligible for
the program in a timely manner. Therefore, the Bank would make an informed judgment of country
readiness and relative progress based on the countries' starting point and prevailing circumstances.
Initial Application of the Criteria
Table I gives a preliminary assessment of country readiness according to the criteria, judged from the
situation at the time of presenting the Multi-Country Program for WB approval. All countries currently
benefit from support through various agencies as well as financing through PHRD grants, to accelerate
preparation of their country projects.

Annex 6
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Operational Guidelines for Scaling up HIV/AIDS Interventions at the Country Level
This annex provides general operational guidelines for activities within the components of the project.
Table 1, which summarizes such activities, is an extension of Annex 1. Although the guidelines
discussed here are somewhat arbitrary and not country-specific, they strive to capture the current body of
evidence of what works in HIV/AIDS programming and aim to provide a framework to prioritize
HIV/AIDS activities. Task Team Leaders (TTLs) might find this framework useful to identify priority
actions when supporting client countries in the Caribbean region to scale up their national responses to
HIV/AIDS.
While the guidelines, in principle, can be applicable to all Caribbean countries, activities need to be
tailored to fit the specific situation and needs of each country in order to be more effective. For a country,
choosing an appropriate mix of prevention and care activities for scaling up can be a complicated task.
There exist various interventions targeting different population groups and of varying levels of
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In the presence of financial and capacity constraints, it is advisable
to focus on a core set of the most effective interventions, which can lead to the largest effect on the
overall epidemic in a sustainable way. This set of interventions, once implemented, will provide the
foundation for further expansion to include other types of HIV/AIDS activities. In countries with a low
HIV prevalence, prioritizing effective preventive interventions will have the greatest impact. On the other
hands, countries with a generalized epidemic need to address the need for treatment and care along side
with scaling up prevention activities.
1. Prevent the spread of HIV in the eeneral population by reduciny transmission amony high-risk
gzroups
High-risk groups such as commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients, men who have sex with men
(MSM) and injecting drug users (IDUs) are the most likely to contract and spread HIV. Preventing
transmission among them is the most efficient way to constraint the spread of HIV in the general
population, even when the epidemic has become generalized. Therefore, ensuring sustained behavior
change in high-risk groups needs to be a high-priority for any national HIV/AIDS program. Caribbean
countries should target them with a core set of prevention interventions, which are already shown to be
both effective and feasible:
* Behavior change communications (e.g. peer education) that move targeted audiences from awareness
of HIV/AIDS to risk-reducing behavior; and
* making condoms, the treatment of STIs, and voluntary counseling and testing for HIV available and
affordable.
Such activities need to be brought up to the national scale in order to have a significant impact. The first
step is to identify the high-risk groups, their behaviors, problems and needs with a participatory mapping
exercise. On this basis, prevention interventions can be provided to them. However, high-risk groups are
often the most marginalized and stigmatized populations and thus very difficult to reach. Criminalization
of commercial sex work and homosexuality in the Caribbean confounds this problem. In many countries,
NGOs and community-based organizations have been shown to be effective in reaching out to those high-
risk groups and facilitating behavior change among them. For this reason, such organizations should



56
receive direct financial and technical support to reach out to high-risk groups at the local level reach,
where the public sector is often less effective. This is one of the most important lessons of the first two
decades of the fight against HIV/AIDS.
HIV-infected individuals, who are in a unique position to stop the spread of HIV, should also receive
prevention services as a standard of care in clinical settings without stigma and discrimination. Other
interventions such as ensuring a safe blood supply and reducing MTCT of HIV also have important
benefits. However, their impact on the overall epidemic is much smaller than that of sustained behavior
change in high-risk groups, as HIV spreads in the population mostly by sexual transmission.
2. Improve access of PLWHAs to a basic care Package. which is cost-effective, affordable, and
equitable within the context of the health system
Although a cure is not yet available for AIDS, people who are already infected still need access to
treatment and palliative care. This need is especially relevant in those Caribbean countries with a
generalized epidemic. Strategies should be mounted by such countries to:
*  Identify a basic package of treatment, care and support which is cost-effective, affordable, and
equitable within the context of the health system; and
 make such services available to PLWHAs.
The treatment of HIV/AIDS is a continuum, which starts with the management of common opportunistic
infections, including TB.  Providing access to cost-effective treatments of common opportunistic
infections should be the first priority in scaling up care activities. This would create a basis on which
other treatments such as ARV can be considered and implemented on a suitable scale contingent on the
capacity of each individual country. Community and home-based care for people with HIV/AIDS should
also be provided. Those alternatives to traditional hospital care are especially relevant in countries with a
generalized epidemic with the purpose to reduce the burden on the health system.
3. Increase government commitment and Public goods in HIV/AIDS
As demonstrated in countries where significant achievements in HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation
have been made, government commitment is an important determinant in the fight against the epidemic.
Governments play a crucial role because they are in a unique position to:
*  Create an enabling environment for an intensified response to HIV/AIDS;
*  mobilize and coordinate the efforts from all sectors of the society (NGOs, community organizations,
private sector, etc.) as well as from external partners; and
*  provide public goods in prevention, care and mitigation activities.
a) Increase government commitment to HIV/AIDS. It is important not only to increase government
overall commitment to HIV/AIDS, but also to improve their commitment to interventions most likely
to have an impact. Despite their potential big impact on the epidemic, prevention interventions for
high-risk groups tend to have very weak constituency and many governments have been reluctant to
make targeting high-risk groups a high priority on their HIV/AIDS agenda,
Increased government commitment to could be achieved through advocacy and policy dialogue.
Policy workshops, national conferences and study tours for policy makers can be-organized to build
consensus on what really works in HIV/AIDS. Additional support can be mobilized by having the



57
Caribbean Task Force on HIV/AIDS, the UN Theme Groups on AIDS address the government and the
civil society on the epidemic.
Efforts help countries improve their legal and regulatory frameworks can be part of this policy
dialogue: in specific cases, issues such as human rights, discrimination against PLWHA at the work
place, absence of clear regulations on privacy and confidentiality of HIV testing need to be addressed.
A review of HIV/AIDS-related legal and regulatory framework can be conducted to provide the basis
for discussion and negotiation with the governments.
b) Increase public goods in HIV/AIDS. Country-specific information on the patterns of HIV infection,
sexual behavior, cost effectiveness of interventions and programs are important public goods, which
help policy makers to make sensible decisions in HIV/AIDS programming. For this reason, the
project should aim to:
*  Establish/strengthen a national second generation surveillance system for HIV/AIDS which monitors
both risk behavior and HIV infections;
*  implement a good monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to track the national HIV/AIDS response
and evaluate its impact on the epidemic. Operational issues in monitoring and evaluation of the
national AIDS program are discussed in details in Annex 7; and
*  evaluate the cost-effectiveness of select pilot intervention(s) in reducing HIV transmission in high-
risk groups and in AIDS treatment and care. The experimental framework (case-control) can be used,
especially for prevention interventions. Such studies can be conducted for similar interventions
across different countries or for different interventions across/within similar countries. This will
provide the basis for the region to learn from the project as it goes through different phrases in the
APL design.

Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Sustained monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a crucial component of the intensified response to
HIV/AIDS. A good M&E system involves routine tracking a range of measures to capture the program's
performance in the more immediate terms and its impact in the longer term. The monitoring of process
and outcome indicators identifies strengths and weaknesses in different areas of program implementation.
Such information can be used to steer and improve the program in the short term. The evaluation of
impact indicators provides valuable information on the overall effectiveness of the program in the long
term. Another function of evaluation is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of specific intervention(s),
which will provide lessons for the program as it moves through different phrases of the APL structure as
well as contribute to evaluate the project as a whole.
The role of M&E in a HlV/AIDS program is amplified by the fact that HIV/AIDS is relatively new and
can be unpredictable, and the epidemic and its impacts continue to shift among sub-population groups.
This calls for a good M&E system, which has strong linkages with behavioral and epidemiological
surveillance.
The M&E unit
A country program will support the establishment of an M&E unit within the Project Country Unit
(PCU). It is important for the M&E sub-unit to be in place from the very beginning of the project. This
unit needs not be built from scratch as it can be formulated based on the existing monitoring and
evaluation capacities in the country
It is likely that the M&E unit itself will not take over the responsibility of conducting behavioral and
epidemiological surveillance. Instead, it will work closely with the National AIDS Program (or the
equivalent) and various international and regional agencies such as UNAIDS, PAHO/CAREC and UWI
to establish or strengthen/expand the surveillance system in the country. UNAIDS and WHO has issued
Guidelines for Second Generation HIV Surveillance (Geneva, May 2000) which gives comprehensive
technical guidance in this subject.
Especially, each project will rely heavily on regional agencies such as CAREC and UWI for the
evaluation component of M&E.
Selection of appropriate indicators
As a country project has a broad range of prevention and care activities, it is important to define a set of
appropriate indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of such interventions. The M&E unit should be
able to follow up the performance of each program component through tracking (i) inputs being
channeled into the program (input indicators), (ii) products created by the program (output indicators),
(iii) positive short-term effects (outcome indicators), and (iv) positive longer-term impacts of the program
(impact indicators). Given the principal goal of the program is to curb the spread of HIV infections, the
success of the program should be measured by a reduction in HIV/AIDS incidence rate in the country.
However, within the first couple of years, the long-term impacts of the program might not be able to
manifest themselves. In that case, outcome indicators (such as an increase in the adoption of safe sex
behavior as shown by behavioral surveillance) can be used to gauge trends toward longer-term impacts.



61
It is important to choose indicators, which are relevant to the local epidemic, and feasible to measure.
This approach will enable a sustained M&E effort. UNAIDS has published "National AIDS Programs: a
Guide to Monitoring and Evaluation" (June 2000) which provides excellent guidance on what indicators
to choose and how to tailor M&E to the country situation.
Annex I proposes a list of key indicators within the logical framework. They includes:
Outputs
*  Completion of a mapping exercise of high-risk groups;
*  number of projects targeting high-risk groups;
*  establishment of a basic care package for PLWHA;
*  development of a national second-generation surveillance system for HIV; and
*  evaluation of cost-effectiveness of select pilot intervention(s).
Outcomes
*  Coverage of prevention interventions among high-risk groups;
* coverage of the basic care package among PLWHA;
-  improvement in policy indicators; and
v  indicators of improved knowledge in HIV and behavior change.
Impacts
- HIV prevalence among young people aged 15-24;
- HIV prevalence among high-risk groups (CSWs); and
*  Syphilis prevalence among pregnant women aged 15-24.
However, it is up to each country program to choose its own set of indicators and therefore data collection
instruments. The choice of indicators should be driven by:
*  the objectives, goals, and activities which constitute the national HIV/AIDS program;
*  the stage of the epidemic; and
*  available resources and capacity for data collection.
Additional indicators to the suggested core set can be considered, for example:
*  % of STI patients properly diagnosed and treated;
*  availability and quality of condoms;



62
* % of health centers which offers VTC services;
* % of pregnant women counseled and tested for HIV;
*  % of transfused blood units tested for HIV; and
*  % of HIV+ women receiving therapy to reduce MTC transmission during pregnancy.
(Details on these indicators can be found in the above-mentioned UNAIDS publication)
It is advisable to focus on a core set of indicators, which is feasible to monitor over time.
The indicators should be prioritized to reflect the priorities of the program. Once the indicators are
decided upon, efforts should be made by the M&E unit to collect their baseline values at the earliest.
Surveys might be required to obtain those values, which are used as benchmarks against which progress
of the program will be tracked.
Monitoring
Existing data collection system should be taken into account. The M&E unit will rely on formal links
with other partners with the expertise for generation of information and analysis. These include the
Ministry of Health, relevant line Ministries, the National Statistical Office, academic institutions and
other regional entities such as PAHO/CAREC. Based on this network, the unit will develop a data
collecting system to monitor the program indicators. It can also contract universities, independent firms
or international agencies to conduct specific surveys for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation.
Evaluation
Evaluation aims to answer the question "Does the intervention(s) really have an impact on the epidemic"?
It is the most valuable way to learn what works and what do not work. In order to address this question,
well-designed studies need to be carried out. Common types of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of
HIV/AIDS intervention(s) include:
* Randomized control trials (RCT);
*  prospective cohort studies;
*  repeated cross-sectional surveys in intervention and comparison groups;
  prospective cohort studies without a comparison group; and
*  repeated cross-sectional surveys without a comparison group.
All these studies need to be followed and evaluated over time, so they would have to be implemented
early in the projects. CAREC and UWI are the regional agencies with the capacity to carry them out.
Such studies can also provide information on the cost-effectiveness of interventions, which in turn can
help reconfigure the program if necessary. For this reason, the result of an evaluation study should be
available at the mid-term review.



63
M&E schedule
A timely reporting schedule should be determined and incorporated into the work plan of the M&E unit.
For example, every six months, the unit will compile and consolidate data related to input indicators (i.e.
expenditures and disbursements data) into an implementation report.  Every year, an annual
implementation progress report will be prepared and submitted to the National AIDS council and
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). A mid-term independent performance
evaluation of the program will also be conducted. The preparation of this mid-term report will involve
the M&E unit, representatives of NGOs, community organizations, as well as key external partners such
as UNAIDS and PAHO. This report includes: (i) changes in effort and context, or the evolution of the
program (ii) an operational audit of the program (iii) the assessment toward outcomes and early
indications of trends towards longer impact, with a focus on the most vulnerable groups (iv) information
on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of intervention(s) if an evaluation study has been conducted. The
information generated by the mid-term evaluation will be used to improve the implementation of the
program. Other specific independent reviews of condom and drugs quality, surveillance, and management
could be done during the implementation period of the project if necessary.

Annex 8
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Economic and Financial Assessment
In this annex', an attempt is made at estimating the costs of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS control program
for the Caribbean. Estimates of the economic benefits of tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic are separately
derived from the recent literature on the subject. The cost and benefit analyses provide a basis from
which to draw policy recommendations for HIV/AIDS programs in the Caribbean. The exercise can
vastly be improved upon as access to more recent and reliable data become available and more
sophisticated epidemiological models are developed.
Costing an HIV/AIDS prevention and control program for the Caribbean
A very rough estimation of the cost of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS vrevention program was conducted
among a team of epidemiologists and economists from the Caribbean . The purpose of the exercise was
to estimate the cost of an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment package for 23 Caribbean countries3 under
various scenarios. The model structure was loosely based on a simulation model being developed by the
World Bank4 and the parameters underlying the base scenario were obtained from the literature and from
the aforementioned panel of experts.
Model and Main Assumptions
Interventions
An exhaustive list of the principal interventions to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus and to
mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on persons and communities was drawn. The list is a summary of the
typical interventions supported by HIV/AIDS programs around the world. No attempt was made to
choose among these activities a priori; it was felt that the best strategy would be to prioritize these
activities in a second phase (and therefore trim down the list) according to the specific financial and
implementation constraints encountered on a country-by-country basis. Ideally, this would be done with
additional information from a cost-effectiveness analysis that would help to rank the interventions.
A first set of indirect interventions includes surveillance, research, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy,
and enhancing regional and national institutional capacity to carry out the programs. A second set of
preventive interventions includes those activities that have strong spillover benefits to society as a whole
' The fact that non member countries or non eligible Bank member countries are mentioned in this annex, it does not
imply that these countries will participate in the proposed APL.
2 The team of epidemiologists, public health specialists and economists from UNAIDS, PAHO, CAREC,
CARICOM, the World Bank and the Health Economics Unit at the University of West Indies collegially decided
upon epidemiological, cost and coverage parameters during a two-day workshop held in Trinidad and Tobago
(August 17 - 18, 2000). The estimates would need to be validated in the country-specific analyses.
3 The countries were loosely grouped according their geographic, cultural and economic proximity. Group 1:
Anguilla, Antigua & Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St.
Vincent. Group 2: Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman, Turks & Caicos. Group 3: Haiti, Dominican Republic. Group 4:
Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Guyana, Suriname. Group 5: Barbados, Belize, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago. Group

in preventing HIV infections and thus reducing the spread of the disease. They include public awareness
campaigns, programs aimed at preventing the spread from high-risk groups such as prostitutes and
intravenous drug users into the general population, screening, ensuring safe blood supply, fostering
behavior change, increasing access to condoms and preventing the transmission from infected mothers to
their babies. The third set of interventions includes various aspects of care and financial assistance for
persons or relatives of persons living with HIV/AIDS. These interventions are palliative (prevention of
opportunistic infections, counseling, home-based care, anti-retroviral therapy) since there is no cure for
AIDS. We also include in this set of activities support to orphans of AIDS patients.
Unit costs assumptions
Unit costs were then estimated for each of these activities. The costs were for the most part taken from
the simulation exercise that is being undertaken in Sub-Saharan Africas and from the consensus view of
the panel of experts6. The information derives from the literature and from the direct experience of the
team of experts with HIV/AIDS programs in developing world settings. Some of the costs are expressed
as the sum of a fixed and of a variable component. The fixed component represents the cost below which
the intervention cannot be conducted meaningfully, while the variable component (expressed as a
multiplier of per capita public spending in health) is an implicit recognition of the budget constraints
affecting each country7. The analyses conducted at country level utilize more realistic cost estimates than
are utilized here.

Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART)        Case              $7,0008                   $10,000
Population and epidemiological information
Estimates for the model parameters were collected or extrapolated from the latest published sources or
generated by the panel of experts who participated in the simulation exercise. The main variables used by
the model are: population, H[V prevalence, birth rates, access to health services, use of ante-natal care
services, ante-natal care WV prevalence, percentage of sexually active population reporting non-regular
partnerships, annual incidence of treatable STIs, proportion of STIs that are symptomatic, average annual
number of commercial sex acts/sex worker, prevalence of syphilis among women, cumulative number of
orphans, HIV prevalence rates among high-risk groups (prisoners, MSM, CSW, military), migrant and
tourist populations, and public spending per capita in health.
_ See footnote 3.
6 See footnote 1.
7 This contradicts, at the margin, the earlier claim that budget constraints are factored only later in the simulation
exercise. This peculiar way of expressing certain costs parameters is no more than an attempt at achieving
compromise between divergent expert opinions.
8 Since the cost of providing HAART is likely to drop to $1,000 per patient per year during the lifetime of the
project, additional simulations were carried out to reflect this possibility. Brazil currently provides ARV drugs at a
cost of $400 per patient per year and India provides the drugs for $700 per patient per year. Both countries
produce the drugs locally, invoking an emergency situation to avoid patent protection issues.



66
Program coverage assumptions
The final set of model inputs was the coverage assumptions.  For nearly all the interventions
contemplated, it was assumed that 100 percent of the relevant population was targeted (e.g., all CSW, all
HIV-infected mothers, all youngsters in school, etc). There were two main departures from the universal
coverage assumption: it was assumed that only 20 percent of AIDS patients would benefit from home-
based care, and that only 15 percent9 of HIV patients would benefit from HAART, the three- and four-
drug combinations against HIV. A 100-percent coverage was deemed improbable for these two
interventions if only because the health system cannot reach all patients and because the take up of home-
based care is partly predicated on client behavior. The cost estimates derived from the model are
extremely sensitive to the coverage assumptions. Note that the implicit assumption here is that scaling up
is achieved immediately - a more realistic costing scenario would involve gradual scaling up over a
period of a few years.
Main Results
Using the assumptions discussed in the previous sections, the following results were derived:

The cost of providing a comprehensive package of prevention and care activities for the relevant
populations the Caribbean would therefore be prohibitively expensive at about US$1.4 billion. Tables 3a
and 3b below show how these costs would translate into per capita terms for a few countries and
compares the estimated HIV/AIDS program costs with current overall per capita spending on health.
9 In the successful Brazil program, only 15 percent of the infected population are on anti-retroviral access despite
100% access.
' Of which $358 million for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, $67 million for Cuba and $150 million for the rest
of the Caribbean.

Implementing a comprehensive package of interventions (prevention, basic care, and HAART for 15% of
the HIV- infected population at current prices) would bump up the current overall spending in health from
15 percent in the Bahamas, all the way to more than a 400 percent in Haiti. The HAART costs are
probably overstated because efforts are being made to reduce the cost of anti-retroviral drugs. If the cost
of providing HAART falls to $1,000 per patient per year, then a comprehensive package of interventions
(prevention and care including HAART) would imply a 10% increase in health spending in the Bahamas
and a 183% increase in Haiti. This is still out of the reach of many countries, but its gradual
implementation is affordable in some of the countries. For example, in the case of Barbados, the
provision of an exhaustive package of interventions (with HAART at $1,000) would add 7% to the
current health spending. Even the prevention program would be costly for Haiti, at 33% of existing
expenditures. For all other countries, the cost of a prevention program would be manageable.
Note that the interventions in this simulation were included irrespective of their cost-effectiveness: in that
sense the package is not an ideal one. It is clear that at country level, only segments of the prevention and
care package would be selected and implemented. The cost estimates generated by this exercise are best
seen as upper limits for HIV/AIDS programs. The spread of the disease can probably be reversed through
preventive programs with the addition of some of the highest priority basic care activities, and these
interventions are feasible everywhere (with the possible exception of Haiti).

Potential benefits" from checking the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean
The benefits traditionally associated with HIV/AIDS programs are: (i) that they contribute to reducing
productivity losses due to HIV/AIDS-related disability and premature mortality; and (ii) that they
contribute to reducing the need for expensive care. These measures ignore the demand for such programs
from the general population to reduce the risk of getting the infection, creating a safer environment, and
so on. The benefits calculated here do no include these possibly substantial 'consumption' benefits.
The table below summarizes the main parameters of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in a few Caribbean
countries.

Using data from the above table (and assuming a constant ratio of AIDS deaths to people living with
HIV/AIDS as well as a constant incidence rate), the number of new infections and the number of new
AIDS deaths can be extrapolated. The table below shows the cumulative number of new infections and
AIDS deaths over a five-year period if incidence and case-fatality parameters do not change. Note that
the results presented are from a simple linear"5 extrapolation, not from modeling the path of the epidemic.
The unchecked epidemic's potential for harm is clear from these figures.

study'6 was conducted by the University of West Indies and suggests that economic losses due to
HIV/AIDS would amount to about five percent of GDP in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago by year
2005. The estimated GDP loss is driven by the number of HIV/AIDS cases and the average loss of
income/output associated with those cases. The study forecasts the economic impact of HIV/AIDS by
modeling the impact on five blocks: output, labor supply, employment, savings and investment, and
spending on HIV/AIDS treatment. An increase in HIV/AIDS-related deaths and morbidity adversely
affects labor supply causing wages to increase. Raising wages and decreasing labor supply translate into
lower levels of employment. The increase in expenditure associated with increased HIV/AIDS incidence
diverts funds away from productive savings, which in turn affects the levels of investment that can be
achieved. Depressed levels of labor and capital affect the levels of output from the various sectors and
therefore overall GDP.
Table 6 below summarizes the macroeconomic impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago according to these studies.

HIV/AIDS Expenditure                  +25.3%             +35.4%
The same study suggests the losses to the economies of the English-speaking Caribbean could reach a
level around $2 billion per year. In other words, stopping HIV/AIDS transmission for that sub-region
yields a benefit of $2 billion per year.
This estimated impact is much higher than those predicted by studies in other parts of the world. The
difference is partly due to the underlying behavioral model which seems to have biased the projection rate
upwards: the projected prevalence rates are five times higher than the official figures for the
corresponding years. An econometric study"8 conducted for African countries gives far lower estimates
for the impact on growth and GDP. Thus, for a "typical" sub-Saharan African country with a prevalence
rate of 20 percent (i.e., around ten times higher than in the Caribbean), the rate of growth of GDP would
be 2.6 percentage points less each year. For countries with a prevalence rate of about 2%, the expected
impact on the rate of growth of per capita GDP would be of the order of -.2% per year. Another paper'9
indicates that the impact of HIV/AIDS on per capita income in the medium run (15-20 years) in Southern
Africa, where the average adult HIV prevalence rate was 19.1% in 1999, varies from 3.1 percent in South
Africa to 4.9 percent in Botswana. Extrapolating from these studies would suggest that AIDS would have

little net macroeconomic impact20 at the current levels of prevalence in the Caribbean. While the net
macroeconomic impact is expected to be small, the effect on the health sector and on the poor is expected
to be substantial in the severely affected countries. One of the ways in which AIDS is likely to exacerbate
poverty is the increase in the number of children who lose one or more parents.
Setting Priorities
The earlier sections indicated that an all-inclusive HIV/AIDS program is out of reach for almost all-
Caribbean countries (see tables 3a and 3b above). In order to generate the highest possible benefits in
terms of averted infections and reduced mortality, a subset of interventions must be chosen from the menu
of possible initiatives. Once it has been decided that public intervention is justified for HIV/AIDS (on the
basis of market failure arguments), then information about cost-effectiveness can help the policy-maker
determine which interventions to prioritize to achieve maximum impact.
Maximum impact is achieved by giving financing priority to those interventions with the highest cost-
effectiveness. The current consensus seems to be that the most cost-effective interventions are those
targeted towards CSWs (peer education) and other high-risk groups (MSM and high-risk heterosexual
men), the management of sexually transmitted infections, and the use of anti-retrovirals to prevent
MTCT.
In all these cases, groups with a high HIV reproductive rate are reached at low costs. The HIV
reproductive rate itself hinges on the amount of time a person remains infectious, the risk of transmission
per sexual contact21 and the rate of acquisition of new partners (high among CSWs for example).
Therefore, all other things being equal, preventing infection in someone with a high rate of partner change
and with risky sexual contacts will indirectly avert many more infections than preventing infection in
someone with low-risk behavior22. This "multiplier" effect is at the root of the cost-effectiveness of the
interventions targeted towards specific population groups. The cost-effectiveness of such population-
based initiatives such as mass media education and education programs for the youth remain to be
established. Typically such programs have low effectiveness but also can be designed to have very low
costs, leading to very high cost-effectiveness. Achieving cost-effectiveness therefore crucially hinges on
the design of these programs. The cost-effectiveness of HAART also has to be further researched; it is
estimated at between $720 and $2,355 per DALY saved for the Brazil HIV/AIDS program.
The table below, adapted from Jha et al. (2001)23 summarizes ranges of values from the literature relating
to the cost-effectiveness of some of the most frequent interventions in HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment.
20 'Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities in a Global Epidemic' (1997) estimates that a generalized epidemic (defined
as a situation where HIV has spread far beyond the original sub-populations with high-risk behavior and where
prevalence among women attendig urban antenatal clinics is 5 percent or more) would reduce GDP by as much
as half a percentage point per year.
21 The probability of transmission of HIV-I infection per 100 exposures is 0.1-0.2 for male-to-female unprotected
vaginal sex; 0.033-0.1 for female-to-male unprotected vaginal sex; 0.5-3.0 for male-to-male unprotected anal
sex; and 1348 for mother-to-child transmission (source: 'Confronting AIDS').
22 This effect is illustrated in a dramatic way in 'Confronting AIDS.' Raising condom use to 80 percent among a
population of 500 sex workers, eighty percent of whom are infected and who have 4 partners a day averts 10,000
infections per year, whereas raising condom use to the same level among 500 low-income men of whom 10% are
infected and who have 4 partners per year averts 88 infections. If the cost of raising condom use is the same in
both cases, targeting sex workers proves to be significantly more cost-effective than low-income men.

countries.' Background paper of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, the World Health
Organization.

DALY saved
Individual country programs would maximize the number of infections averted and the number of
DALYs saved if they were to ensure that the most cost-effective interventions obtain sufficient attention
and financing. Countries that propose to finance HAART should particularly be attentive to making sure
that preventive interventions that are known to be cost-effective are not crowded out in the process.
Targeting some of the high-risk groups may be more costly and more difficult to achieve in countries
where such practices are illegal (such as homosexuality and commercial sex work in the Caribbean), but
this should only mean that Governments should seek innovative ways (for example through NGOs or peer
education) to reach these populations because of the compelling epidemiological and economic reasons
described above. Those countries that are particularly resource-constrained - such as Haiti where even a
program purely focused on prevention would increase per capita spending on health by 33 percent -
should be particularly attentive to prioritizing the most cost-effective interventions such as sex worker
interventions and STI management.
The information about cost-effectiveness, in combination with epidemiological data, could also provide
countries with a rough guide as to how much they should aim to spend to prevent the spread of the
epidemic. It has to be noted, however, that cost-effectiveness ratios are highly population-specific and
depend, among other things, on the scale of the activity and the stage of the epidemic. The information
provided in the table above should therefore be used with caution and modulated for the country situation,
as preventing MV infection is inseparable from care and support for those affected by HIV/AIDS.
Prevention of infection and amelioration of the impact of the epidemic will have to go hand in hand. The
proposed project will enable countries to generate data on the alternative ways of lowering HIV in
specific country contexts so that resources are channeled to their best possible use.

Annex 9
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Adaptable Lending Program (APL) for the Caribbean Region
Supervision Plan
The supervision of this project would be a major challenge considering the small size of many countries,
widely differing development levels and implementation capacities, the multi-sectoral approach, limited
country/sector experience with the WB, and logistical difficulties. Supervision will be planned in a way to
make to make it both cost-effective and efficient so that the WB can be actively and continually involved
during the implementation phase to help achieve the project goals. The supervision plan outlined here
provides an overall strategy, the co-ordination arrangements with other donors, likely costs, and the
staffing composition.
Supervision Objectives and Strategy:
The objectives of the supervision program for this APL would be to:
a) ensure that implementation agencies and the PCU implement the project with due diligence to
achieve the program development objectives;
b) identify problems promptly as they arise during implementation and help the implementing agencies
resolve them;
c) adapt the project to lessons learned during implementation and other relevant changes in order to
enhance the prospects of achieving the agreed project objectives; and
d) facilitate collaboration among donors supporting HIV/AIDS programs in the Caribbean.
Each country project would be established with clear benchmark and performance criteria to permit a
high degree of self-supervision of input use and results. The management information systems planned
for procurement, financial management and M&E will capture routine data and information in a
systematic way to help guide the project team in suitably executing the project. The PCU through its
periodic semi-annual or quarterly reports, as the case may be, and annual progress reports, including the
audited accounts, will help provide the WB an overview of project implementation status on a regular
basis. The PCU staff will play a major role in overseeing and supporting the operations of the sector
ministries and the local communities. The technical and administrative staff in the PCU in which
members of the National AIDs Council/equivalent agency will also participate, if necessary, will
undertake periodic field visits.
WB supervision would be carried out in close coordination with all donors and the regional agencies
active in the region. This would include joint supervision missions and full exchange of progress reports
and supervision mission reports of donors from their independent missions. To strengthen the countries'
institutional capabilities and increase the cost-effectiveness of WB supervision, the project will engage
the regional and local agencies to help carry out project supervision. The specialized regional agencies
that have technical expertise and experience in the area such as CAREC, PAHO/WHO, UNAIDS are
expected to take the lead in providing technical guidance to help implement the country project. The WB
has agreed to establish a memorandum of understanding with the most active of these agencies (CAREC,
PAHO/WHO, UTNAIDS) to formalize the collaboration.



73
To get the project off to a good start and to assure quality implementation, the WB will be actively
involved with at least two to three supervision missions a year, at least in the early years. However, the
intensity of Bank supervision for each country will depend on its implementation capacity, experience
with Bank projects and stage of project implementation. As such, countries like Barbados, Dominican
Republic and Jamaica, which are entering the program in the earlier phases of the APL, are likely to need
less support than those countries coming in the subsequent phases. The supervision missions will be
combined for a cluster of countries or largely done by calling several countries together which would help
in considerable cross-fertilization of implementation experience among the countries and learning from
each other. This process will also result in substantial cost savings of supervising a program of this size
since we can eliminate a number of repetitious tasks in each country.
The main elements of the project supervision would be as follows:
*  The PCUs will institute a process of systematic supervision of the project and the subprojects. They
will meet with the implementing agencies and the NGOs, local communities involved in the project
and submit a periodic report to the Bank team of project progress;
*  continuous technical advice will be provided to the project teams, based on their need, by the regional
agencies;
*  supervision during the first year would concentrate on project launch activities and formal and
informal training in supervision techniques. During the second and third year it would gradually shift
toward program management;
-  there will be two joint supervisions with other donors - - one will coincide with the discussion of the
annual work plan; and the other to focus on technical aspects of the project. During the technical
supervision mission, workshops will be held to discuss selected topics bringing together all the
countries in the region. In these workshops, countries would report on their experience with specific
elements of the project. The workshop would normally be held for about three days in one of the
countries that has some notable achievements under the support of the Task Force. External experts
will also be invited in these workshops to update on current international developments and
experiences; and
*  as part of the plan to pool donor efforts, it is envisaged that supervision of and technical support for
the country projects will be shared with each donor having primary responsibility for specific areas.
They are:
CAREC:  Surveillance
PAHO:   prevention, care, treatment, and health systems development
UNAIDS: prevention, care, and treatment:
WB:       economic and epidemiological assessments, overall project management, procurement,
financial management, safeguards, NGO involvement
The Mid-Term Project Review. The mid-term review will be carried out in partnership with other
partners (CAREC, PAHO/WHO, UNAIDS), to assess the program's progress and overall impact on the
spread and treatment of HIV/AIDS in the region (according to outcome/impact indicators agreed with
individual countries). The main purpose of the mid-term review will be to determine if there are any
major problems or issues in the project, which necessitate rethinking the original project design. The
review would synthesize lessons learned and could lead to any necessary adjustment in the program
and/or country projects to improve their effectiveness, and the reallocation of financial resources among
project components. At that time, a decision would be made concerning the form and substance of the
Bank's continuing support for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the Region.



74
Composition of Missions. The supervision missions will include as appropriate at the time, specialists in
the following areas: public health, general management, training, IEC, surveillance, medical waste
management, procurement, financial management and NGOs participation. Most of the technical experts
related to public health and HIV/AIDS will be provided by other donor agencies. Matching the special
skills and expertise of supervision members with particular problems facing the projects will be critical.
Supervision Cost. As part of the World Bank's annual work program agreements (WPA), a supervision
plan with detailed supervision costs will be prepared for all the countries in the program. Each country
would be rated as "high" or "low" risk in terms of financial management, procurement, safeguards, and
implementation capacity. Those countries, which are considered low risk in any of these areas, will need
relatively less supervision and may be clustered together for supervision missions. The others may need
individual attention and support. The average cost of supervision for a project in the Latin America and
Caribbean Region about US$65,000. There will be some economies of scale in overseeing this operation
in several countries by involving donors and combining missions. Considering that Dominican Republic,
Barbados and Jamaica are the countries that are likely to have their loans effective by next year, the
Bank's supervision budget for the next fiscal year combining these three countries is likely to be about
US$130,000.
Supervision outputs/outcome. On the basis of project monitoring and evaluation, the supervision
missions would be geared to ensure that implementation of the projects is progressing as planned and to
anticipate or detect any problems (e.g., adequacy of supplies, appropriateness of training). These
missions would also focus on determining the degree of progress in meeting set goals or project
performance on the basis on evaluation of inputs (human and capital resources available for project
implementation) and project operation variables (who is to do what, where, when and how), as well on
assessments of impacts and outcomes that may include changes in knowledge, attitudes, behavior, risk
factors, disease and disability.

A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development obiective: (see Annex 13.2)
Barbados has a window of opportunity to prevent the spread of the Human Immune-deficiency virus (HlV)/
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, as its Government is now publicly committed to support
vigorous action immediately. The Government of Barbados has established a National Commission on HIV/AIDS
(NACHA) under the Prime Minister's Office with a mandate to implement a broad-gauged program to limit the
further spread of the epidemic into the general population, by preventing HIV infection among vulnerable and high-
risk groups, without stigmatizing them, and treating infected persons. The Barbados Parliament approved increased
budgetary allocations for line Ministries' HIV/AIDS activities at the beginning of April 2001.
The proposed HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project would assist the Government of Barbados to:
* reduce the rate of new HIV reported cases;
* increase the life expectancy of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA);
* improve quality of life for PLWA; and
* build sustainable institutional arrangements for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 13.2)
Key performance indicators for monitoring progress would be:
* annual percentage of HIV new reported cases (Number of positive HIV tests/total HIV tests preformed in
Barbados plus HIV positive cases diagnosed elsewhere and reported;
* mortality rates attributed to AIDS;
* life expectancy of PLWA
* changes in high-risk sexual behavior and attitudes, as measured by changes in condom use, age at first sexual
encounter for men and women, and reporting of unsafe sex practices;
* percent of HIV/AIDS cases due to mother-to-child transmission;
* percent transmission through blood transfusion; and
* quantitative and qualitative changes in quality of life for PLWAs.
The project would also expect to build sustainable institutions to continue managing the response to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in the post project period. However, evidence of success of this effort would not be available within the
project period. Therefore, institution building performance would be evaluated as "work in progress" against various
processes and other leading indicators of future sustainability, such as.the quality of project administration, achieved
levels of participation in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment activities, and growing non-discriminatory social
attitudes and perceptions of the epidemic and its victims.
Barbados has been monitoring the evolution of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with externally provided assistance.
Available studies covering selected populations would be used to establish base-line indicators similar to the ones
described above, for future comparisons.  The project would support improving the in-country HIV/AIDS
surveillance, monitoring and evaluation system in-country and the selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate
project implementation. The project would also assist line Ministries to establish their "micro" level indicators for
their own programs as part of the institutional development component. Throughout the development of its
surveillance system, Barbados would conform to the needs for developing data compatible to regional research
efforts established under such programs as the Caribbean Cooperation in Health initiatives (CCH II) led by the
Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC).

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) tgoal supported by the project (see Annexes 13. land 13.2)
Document number: 22205-LAC          Proposed date of CAS discussion: June 28, 2001
The Country Assistance Strategy for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region is scheduled for Board discussion at the same
time as this project. This CAS highlights HIV/AIDS prevention and control as a key policy issue and an urgent area
of intervention for the Eastern Caribbean. Even though Barbados graduated from IBRD lending in 1993, Barbados
is being included in the Eastern Caribbean Regional APL for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control as an exceptional
case to the World Bank's graduation policy due to the following reasons (Annex 13.1 explains these in greater detail
and also documents why alternative financing sources for this program are not available to Barbados on reasonable
terms):
* Public goods and externalities: Barbados is both a regional hub with significant population movements across
the Caribbean, as well as a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. Effective containment of an
infectious disease such as HIV/AIDS requires that the entire region be part of the prevention and control
measures and excluding any country would undermine the success of the program region-wide.
* Leadership: Barbados has traditionally been a regional leader, and has been particularly active in providing a
leadership role in shaping the sub-regional program for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Its inclusion in this
program is key to strengthening the chances of success for projects not only in the other Eastern Caribbean
countries but also throughout the Caribbean region.
e Health infrastructure: While health care service delivery in the OECS is generally adequate, all countries in
the sub-region still experience shortcomings. Barbados has a much stronger health infrastructure, used by many
neighboring countries. Its inclusion in the Bank's HIV/AIDS program will allow it to play a broader and more
effective sub-regional role.
- Transferable development lessons: Barbados is a front-line participant in the UNAIDS Accelerated Access
Initiative. Its experience in promoting HIV/AIDS treatment through anti-retroviral therapies will provide
valuable models for integrating such treatment into general public health, not only in the Eastern Caribbean
region but also in developing countries more generally.
The special circumstances of the public goods and externalities aspects of the HIV/AIDS prevention and control
program and Barbados' leadership role in the highly inter-related economies of the Eastern Caribbean form a unique
and compelling case for including Barbados in the regional HIV/AIDS program. In essence, Barbados is the regional
hub with advanced economic and social infrastructure providing these services to some of the less equipped countries
of the Eastern Caribbean. As indicated in the accompanying CAS, this Barbados proposed operation would be a one
time exception and additional IBRD support is not envisaged.
2. Main sector issues and Government strateev
The Problem
The first case of HIV/AIDS was detected in Barbados in 1984. At that time, as was the situation in most of the
world, HIV/AIDS was viewed first more as a consequence of risky personal behavior, than a public health issue. The
epidemic was also thought to have been confined to men who have sex with men and not the general population.
Efforts to manage and control the epidemic were focused on medical and key public health issues such as the
protection of blood bank supplies. The number of reported HIV cases continued to rise particularly among the
general population 15-49 years of age, and the most economically active 25- to 49-year-olds.
As of June 2000, the total cumulative HIV positive persons were 2,415 of which 1,252 have been diagnosed with
having AIDS, including 45 children under the age of 15. These figures are, however, conservative. It is estimated
that the 2,415 persons testing positive represents only one-fifth of the infected population. Given that HIV and
sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing is not mandatory in Barbados, it is possible that persons feeling that they
are high-risk individuals may seek diagnosis/treatment overseas or do not seek diagnosis and treatment, thus
remaining unaware of their HIV status.



96
In 1988, the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACA) was formed and in 1995 committed itself fully to a
program designed to transfer ownership of the challenge of HIV/AIDS from government to the individual citizen,
Ministries other than Health, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs) and people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs)-the "multisectoral" approach. A summary of some of its main activities is
contained in Annex 13.9. The Government of Barbados recognized that the epidemic had social and economic
dimensions in addition to its medical and public health aspects. In addition to continuing clinical and public health
actions, incremental efforts were devoted to prevention education campaigns, designed to inform and influence
particular target groups. Among the more notable were those aimed at:
*  Primary schools (age group 5-11 years) in three age groups 5-6 years; 7-8 years; and 9-11 years, with age-
appropriate education;
*  commercial sex workers as a voluntary activity;
*  teenage peer counselors sponsored by corporate Barbados (for example: The Barbados Light & Power Company
Ltd. and Texaco);
*  school principals in primary and secondary schools; guidance counselors and selected teachers; and
*  religious leaders grouped under the Barbados Christian Council, the Barbados Evangelical Associations and
other religious groups.
Despite numerous HIV/AIDS prevention educational campaigns designed to reach particular target groups, it is clear
that these interventions have not impacted significantly on the incidence rate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the
educational messages designed to reach particular target groups have been effective in motivating behavioural
changes, as research and evaluation have not been systematically performed.
The socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS in Barbados is of critical importance since the infection rates continues to
increase among the economically productive age group 25-49 years, and hence a high mortality rate within this age
group is expected which presents a serious challenge to Barbados' social and economic development. Deaths in this
age group impoverish both family and country. Many of the individuals in this age group are parents. Sometimes
both the mother and father in a family die. Grandparents and children are left without support, thus increasing
demands on social welfare services. Similarly, the epidemic could eventually undermine the capacity to govern in
Barbados, as essential resources, public services in health, education, and social services become weakened. Small
countries such as Barbados cannot afford the kind of long-term losses that other countries in sub-Saharan Africa have
undergone so far due to HIV/AIDS. Small impacts on key sectors that significantly contribute to the growth of gross
domestic product (GDP) would produce an enormous crippling effect on the country's economy.
The Issues
In most respects, Barbadians enjoy a good state of health, and are being well served by the national health delivery
system. Life expectancy for males is about 73 years of age, and females about 77 years. Literacy is among the
highest in the Caribbean (95%), availability of safe piped water is universally available (94% served at home, and the
remainder through public stand pipes). The five leading causes of death have been cardiovascular disease (about
19%), malignant neoplasms (17%), cerebrovascular disease (14%); diabetes (10%); and other diseases of the
circulatory system (4%). Births to adolescent mothers, and STIs have generally been declining. Health services have
been provided by public facilities, centered at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) (with 547 beds, providing 24 hour
acute care services, and wide range of specialized preventive and curative services), and eight associated polyclinics
(Annex 13.2B). An additional 100 private physicians practice on the island. Laboratories in two public and four
private facilities provide capacity for conducting about five tests per person per year, and have been sufficient to date
for general health support. The Barbados blood bank has routinely screened blood supplies for HIV, Hepatitis B and
C, Syphilis and HLTVI. The system is supported by the Barbados Drug Service (BDS) which has been designated a
WHO Collaborating Center, and controls the importation and distribution of essential drugs.
However, since 1995, the Ministry of Health through the AIDS Management Team (within the Department of
Medicine at the QEH) and committed volunteers, have attempted to address the needs of HIV/AIDS infected and
affected individuals, working with non-earmarked and inadequate resources. By 2000, the AIDS Management Team



97
was monitoring the viral loads and CD4 counts and providing counseling to about 350 persons (30% of all HIV
infected persons) and only about 15 confirmed cases of AIDS were being actively treated with Antiretroviral therapy
(ART), supported through private me.-s. The lack of sufficient political awareness of the magnitude of the problem
has meant that multisectoral efforts have not received adequate human or financial resources. Moreover, the NACA
was essentially "advisory" and its operations highly dependent on the initiatives and resourcefulness of its leadership
and membership, not a sustaining institutional framework.
As a result, it has been difficult to plan strategically and the response to HIV/AIDS in Barbados has been reactive
rather than proactive. The programs instituted for prevention and control, in particular, have not been sufficiently
broad-based to address the full range of socio-economic, cultural, and behavioural aspects of the disease. The
program has not given fully integrated attention to the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as part of the
HIV prevention and control focus. Lastly, insufficient attention has been paid to the application of research and
information to decision making; lessons learned or best practices have not always informed policy development; and
the issues of discrimination and stigma were not adequately addressed. The previous programs seemed not to have
adequately taken account of impact of external factors on local conditions.
Limited Impact of Past Efforts
Notwithstanding the numerous efforts made to combat this disease, its spread has continued. In 2000, there were
approximately 70% more HIV infected persons than predicted in 1990, and the number of new infections is growing
relative to that in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) countries. To date, the overall national
response has been confined to the health sector with limited support from international and national resources. The
current approach with a predominant health focus to respond to the epidemic, can no longer serve to promote a broad
based expanded response to the epidemic. A proactive response with a multisectoral approach, has to be launched if
there is to be a reversal in the current trend of this epidemic.
Barbados' Strategic Plan-Towards a Multisectoral and Proactive Approach
In response to the above problems, the Government of Barbados has issued a strategic plan for the restructuring of its
national HIV/AIDS program. Barbados' Cabinet approved a Comprehensive Program for the Management,
Prevention and Control of HIVIAIDS, 2001-2006 (the Program), in November 2000 to be managed under a new
National Commission for HIV/AIDS (NACHA), supported by an executive office with a full-time paid staff. The
challenge for the government is to do the following:
*  become proactive in managing the epidemic rather than being reactive to it;
*  broaden the effective scope of the activities undertaken to be truly multisectoral;
*  address treatment and care as well as prevention as a continuum;
*  generate more collaboration and partnership among national institutions;
*  involve the private sector more fully in the management of the epidemic;
*  establish accountability for results; and
*  progressively mainstream and then sustain management efforts both institutionally and financially.
Barbados' strategic plan for HIV/AIDS draws on elements of the Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan of Action
formulated by the CARICOM-led Regional Task Force on HIV/AIDS, and approved by CARICOM Heads of
Government in July 2000. The strategy includes the following elements:
*  Restructuring the system for managing STI/HIV/AIDS as a national priority, giving it a high level of political
commitment and setting a high level of national accountability;
*  institutionalizing this system -to effectively manage a short and medium term program of action, and to be
sustainable in the long term;
*  developing and implementing appropriate public policies to address HIV/AIDS issues such as work place
discrimination;



98
*  strengthening existing health services in major areas as well as social support for people affected by HIV/AIDS;
* further enhancing understanding and changing attitudes and behavior that affect HIV transmission; and
* establishing a comprehensive and operational research agenda.
The plan also includes two strategic thrusts that make it unique at this moment.
a) Regional leadership. Barbados has established a leadership role in the Caribbean, particularly among the OECS
countries' which have smaller populations and fewer economic resources. Barbados assumed an early leadership
role through its sponsorship of region-wide collaboration and advocacy at the political level for an expanded
response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in September 2000, and subsequently in January 2001. Barbados has also
played the role of a regional advocate with the major manufacturers and suppliers of anti-retroviral drugs for a
change in manufacturers' drug pricing and marketing strategies in the region. It has been confirmed by
independent sources that this has been effective in changing the approach that these companies may take when
establishing commercial contracts in the region. Finally, while designing its program to serve the needs of its
own population, Barbados is positioning its investments in treatment and care facilities and technical capacity to
be an anchor for the expansion of services to smaller countries with little or no capability to make similar
investments. To this end, Barbados recently established an electronic link with Caribbean countries including
Haiti with a view to exchange information.
b) Introduction of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Private physicians send HIV/AIDS patients to the AIDS
Management Team at the QEH. This Team has been treating about 15 confirmed cases of AIDS in Barbados,
with the triple therapy drug regime. These are privately financed treatments relying in part on laboratory
facilities off-island. The Govemment of Barbados (GOB) has concluded, however, that ART is an integral part
of a comprehensive prevention, treatment and care package and has decided to extend ART to all residents of the
country as a matter of public policy and in the exercise of its responsibility for public health. The GOB' policy
includes:
o  Preserving the physician's prerogative to prescribe the actual therapies needed by patients;
o  importing only branded and registered drugs to respect intellectual property rights;
o  building the physical and human infrastructure that will allow for rapid and specialized review and treatment
of cases in-country, as well as monitoring cases throughout treatment;
o  developing protocols for testing and treatment and an integrated system involving home, community as well
as facility-based care; and
o  procuring anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) through transparent price competition in cases where there are
competing patent-holding manufacturers and their licensees (the BDS has developed a world-recognized
system for efficient and transparent procurement of drugs to serve the needs of the island, and has been
designated by WHO as a "Collaborating Center for Drug Supply Management" in the region), or through
direct contracting from the sole patent-holder or licensee.
The GOB expects to phase in the provision of ART concurrent with the development of facilities and experience
among an expanded staff over the next 24 months. Barbados has been receiving advice from internationally
respected sources concerning the criteria for infrastructure and staff performance it should meet before undertaking a
rapid scale-up of the ART services. These criteria are given in Annex 13.11, and would be used by the Bank as a
basis for its decision to finance ARV drugs and laboratory reagents in quantities needed to facilitate this expansion of
service.
Implementation through the Multi-country Program
Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines



99
As part of its implementation strategy, Barbados has requested the financial assistance of the World Bank (WB)
under the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending (APL). It has substantially
met the following basic criteria for participating in this program:
a) Preparation of a national HIV/AIDS strategy. The GOB has approved a coherent multisector program for
addressing its HIV/AIDS issues. New budgetary resources were made available to support the initial steps in
implementing the program during 2000-2001 through special appropriations. Funds have been included in the
2001-2002 budget year for the continuation of the program.
b) Readiness of national leadership. The GOB established the National Commission on HIV/AIDS (NACHA)
whose Chairman is under the Office of the Prime Minister. Appointments of key executives were made prior to
the negotiation of the project.
c) Programming for multisectoral implementation. The operational plan for the GOB's strategy will involve the
active participation of several line Ministries (including Health) which have already received additional
earmarked resources for this purpose. In addition, community groups are to be involved via their association
with Ministries as well as directly managing project activities. Barbados has a tradition of involving larger and
better organized CSOs in the implementation of its policies, through funding for activities such as family
planning, health education, cancer research, and social and community transformation. Over 50 such health
organizations are currently active in Barbados. It would extend this tradition by assisting new community-based
organizations to develop.
d) Use of sustainable business arrangements. The project will be executed through an Office established in the
Office of the Prime Minister which will give it a firm institutional base. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
will use tested and simplified administration-wide financial management and procurement methods that have
been assessed by the Bank. While the emphasis is on building institutional experience, GOB may out-source
administrative services that might be needed to launch project implementation quickly. The project could also
contract with qualified civil society organizations who could scale up ongoing promotion, treatment and care
services effectively to achieve short term impacts in addition to strengthening already mainstreamed services.
Lastly, while the BDS has an excellent record in maintaining adequate supplies of essential drugs in the country,
the Ministry of Health is also seeking government approval for establishing modified procurement systems for
expanded imports of ARV drugs to support the development of the Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy
(H-AART) program, and is developing a protocol for ARV distribution to patients.
e) Status of monitoring and evaluation: The information system supporting current patient case notification has
been highly reliable for AIDS surveillance in Barbados. With project support, improvement would be made to
allow the system to provide information on both medical and socio-behavioral aspects of the epidemic (second
generation monitoring).
As a result, Barbados is considered to be ready to begin project implementation soon after appraisal and approval of
the proposed loan.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strateEic choices
Barbados experience in managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been more reactive than proactive. Preventive
interventions have been limited in number and coverage of target groups, and with unknown effectiveness, except for
the successful HIIV/AIDS mother-to-child prevention and the blood safety programs. Scaling up treatment with anti-
retroviral drugs requires a sophisticated infrastructure in terms of laboratory testing, treatment facilities, patient
compliance and follow-up and trained personnel, which is limited in Barbados today. Efforts in bringing together
multiple actors, both public and private have been of little effect.
The project will concentrate on the following:
*  Introducing and scaling up cost-effective preventive programs and treatment efforts, that have been successful in
other countries and in Barbados-in particular, strengthening and expanding the prevention and control of STIs;
*  establishing a staged implementation approach to ensure adequate lessons from experience leading to better
informed public and private stakeholders and decisions on scaling up prevention and treatment services;



100
*  building sustainable and proactive institutions to implement Government of Barbados's current and future
HIV/AIDS management programs; and
* ensuring Government leadership at the highest level and multi-sectoral participation through various line
Ministries.
The project would be open to efforts to scale up or introduce initiatives or actions that hold promise for managing the
epidemic (guided by past experience in other countries), rather than focusing on a pre-selected narrow set of options.
It would be prepared to evaluate the usefulness of such activities during implementation and either continue or
abandon activities on this basis. Combined private/public sector implementation would be sought, since NGOs play
a central role in effectively reaching high risk groups. Given the newness of some preventative programs in
Barbados and the complexity of scaling up ART, a phased approach to project implementation has been chosen.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Proiect components (see Annex 13.3 for a detailed description and Annex 13.5 for a detailed cost breakdown)
The project is part of the WB Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control APL and would finance significant
parts of the GOB's Program. The project would scale up ongoing HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives, while allowing
the government to embark on new treatment and care initiatives. In the recent past, Barbados has benefited from
technical assistance from the European Union, the German Government (GTZ), Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) /World Health Organization, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
and Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), for the implementation of HIV/AIDS program
initiatives which made important contributions to the country's fight against the epidemic. The project would, as
appropriate, complement, reinforce, and operationalize these early initiatives. The project's activities would grow
and evolve over the implementation period. Each of the project/program components to be financed is discussed
below.
Component #1: Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS Transmission-US$5.7 million
A full review of ongoing and immediately planned prevention activities (workshop February 21-23, 2001 conducted
with the different Ministries of Barbados), has been the basis for eight Ministries and the Government Information
Services to formulate enhanced work plans incorporating best practices and options. Eight Ministries and the Office
of Government Information Services would each establish HIV/AIDS Coordination Units, responsible for designing
and managing implementation of specific interventions according to target populations.
l Target populations identified for prevention interventions are the following:
i Adolescents (both genders) in and out of school;
* pregnant women;
* sex workers and "beach boys";
* men who have sex with men;
* persons with STIs;
*  uniformed personnel;
* hard-to-reach individuals and groups;
* health workers;
* hotel, motel and tourism personnel; and
* people with HIV/AIDS.
During the first year of project implementation, each Ministry would start implementing at least two core national
program interventions: information, education and communication (IEC), specifically addressed to behavioral
change and condom distribution among different target groups. As part of their implementation activities, Ministries



101
may contract technical assistance and NGOs to assist in reaching beyond traditional constituencies or hard-to-address
populations to advance their respective prevention programs.
The following prevention programs would be developed through the different Ministries (see Annex 13.2), under
NACHA coordination, monitoring and evaluation:
Information Education and Communication: This program aims at maintaining people's awareness of HIV/AlDS
risks and protection measures, promotion of behavior changes for safe sex practices and risk reduction, and advocacy
among public and private leaders on human rights protection, abolition of discrimination practices and learning to
live with PLWHAs. The Government Information Services would be an important facilitator of mass media use
(radio, TV, press, open letters, etc.) for implementing IEC.
Condom Distribution: Use of social marketing, peer groups, vending machines, and other strategies to make
condoms available and accessible to all segments of the adolescent and adult population; visible access to condoms in
hotels, motels, restaurants, entertainment and other public places. Each Ministry would choose the best strategy to
make condoms available and accessible to its clients (target populations).
Prevention and Control of STIs: The MH would strengthen the STIs prevention and control program through its
network of polyclinics. The project would finance the pre-packed STI therapy for implementing the syndromic
management approach, which has been highly successful in many countries. This program would be implemented by
the MOH, and other Ministries would promote it among their target populations.
Prevention of HIV/AIDS Mother to Child transmission: The project would support the MH to continue the
implementation of its successful HIV/AIDS preventive program. Other Ministries would promote the use of services
offered through this program among pregnant women.
Control of Laboratories and Blood Supply: This is another successful effort of the GOB over the years, as
reflected in less than 1% HIV cases due to blood transfusions. The QEH has maintained high standards for
laboratory quality control and blood bank screening for infectious diseases including HIV. The project would
support the continuation of this preventive program under the Ministry of Health responsibility.
Component #2: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Care for HIV/AIDS-US$14.3 million
The project would scale up the diagnosis, treatment and care for HIV/AIDS patients, as part of the GOB's
commitment to meet patients' clinical and emotional needs, reduce opportunistic infections, reduce work disability,
and improve quality of life. Under this component, the project would support scaling up the following interventions:
* Voluntary testing and counseling;
* laboratory strengthening;
* pharmacy strengthening;
*  community and home care; and
* facilities for opportunistic infections (Ols) treatment and ART for patients with AIDS.
The project would support the implementation of following sub-components:
Strengthening Voluntary Counselling and Confidential HIV Testing: The project would support: (i) upgrading
eight polyclinics for counselling and testing, a new AIDS Reference Unit (see below), where a counseling clinic
would be set up; (ii) training of 50 HIV/AIDS counsellors of which, eight would be located at the upgraded
polyclinics, two at the counseling clinic of the AIDS Reference Unit, and the remaining 40 located at other Ministries
and community organizations involved in HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
Strengthening Laboratory Capacity: Provision of ART has significant repercussions on laboratory capacity for
testing and follow up of patients- under treatment. The Government has made arrangements with providers for
installing equipment (flow cytometer for CD4, and a viral load rented machine and reagents for viral load testing),
and training four to five laboratory technicians for performing the tests. Also, supplementary investments in



102
remodeling space, laboratory technicians, equipment and reagents will be provided by the project to strengthen
present lab capacity for early diagnosis of opportunistic infections.
Pharmacy Strengthening: At present the BDS makes available seven out of 11 manufactured anti-retroviral drugs.
The project would support Barbados' discussions with UNAIDS to seek agreements with providers for lowering cost
ARV drugs through the UNAIDS Accelerated Access to Drugs Initiative and help to finance said drugs. In order to
provide a supportive environment for the utilization of ARV, the project would upgrade some aspects of current
pharmacy services: space would be provided for a satellite pharmacy in the AIDS Reference Centre outside Queen
Elizabeth Hospital, to facilitate swift dispensing practices, increase patient compliance, improve patient education
and permit better tracking and accountability within the pharmacy service. In addition, a program to monitor drug
quality, safety and efficacy would be instituted to ensure that reduced drug cost does not imply reduced quality.
Strengthening Infrastructure for Community Health Services: In addition to upgrading the eight polyclinics, the
project would provide training for a core of 40 health workers from the eight polyclinics and NGO volunteers on the
WHO model of Continuum AIDS Care. Particular attention would be given to education on the importance of
compliance vis a vis resistance, meaning of CD4 and viral load counts.
Expanding the Infrastructure for 01 Treatment and Introduction of ART: The project would support: (i) the
refurbishing and remodeling of the old nursing building for establishing the HIV/AIDS Reference Unit, a state-of-
the-art site for clinical treatment and patient monitoring, strengthening laboratory capabilities (see above), improving
pharmacy services (see above) upgrading in-house information management technology for improved HIV/AIDS
surveillance. The project would also support civil works for providing additional space and facilities for the
enhancement of treatment and care. Civil works for adapting these facilities for care and treatment of HIV/AIDS
patients will be ready by the end of 2001, except the site for the HIV/AIDS Reference Center, which would be started
later this year. Finally, although introducing ART will not substantially increase the volume and types of medical
waste, GOB will, in the first two project years, provide technical assistance for reviewing the legal framework
governing medical waste handling and disposal, upgrade the coding for handling of medical waste of different types
and sources, updating the manual for the handling and disposal of medical waste at the QEH, training of personnel
for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste, and if deemed necessary, financing for the repairing or the
replacement of the incinerator at the QEH. In addition, the loan would finance a study to assess improved
alternatives for medical waste disposal in Barbados, and said study shall include the carrying out of a fully
consultative environmental assessment of any alternatives the study might recommend. Such alternatives may be
carried out only in compliance with the environmental mitigation measures identified by said assessment.
Criteria for Patient Enrollment and Follow Up (see Annexes 13.10 and 13.11): The project would set up criteria
for patient enrollment, follow up, and monitoring and evaluation of ART according to QEH HIV/AIDS Management
Team advice. Low compliance would be addressed through strong education campaigns carried out by treating
doctors who are managing patients, counselors, health workers, and voluntary organizations working close to
patients' home. The project would support periodic seminars for updating patient enrollment and treatment follow-
up according to new findings published in the scientific literature.
C. Component #3: Management and Institutional Strengthening-USS3.5 million
Management Strengthening. This subcomponent would support the restructuring of Barbados' existing National
HIV/AIDS Program to ensure a sustainable institutional structure and management that will allow Barbados to
effectively control, prevent, and care for HIV/AIDS over the long term. This would be accomplished by providing
the necessary leadership, advisory services, staffing, goods, and general operating costs of the following institutions:
The National Advisory Committee on HIV/AIDS (NACA) has been reformulated into a National Commission on
HIV/AIDS (NACHA) with executive powers, under the Prime Minister's Office. In addition to a Chairperson and an
Executive Director, NACHA has representatives from the private sector, the Church, the Youth Organization, the
Media, the Trade Unions, the NGOs, the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs), and the Director of the AIDS
Management Team of the QEH (see institutional and implementation arrangements).
The Executive Director's Office is functioning as the Secretariat of NACHA and is responsible for project
implementation, that is, it would become the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The Office is be staffed by the



103
Executive Director, a Deputy Director, an Assistant Director responsible for coordinating programs in prevention
(including education, training and research); and a Financial Officer.
HIV/AIDS Program Units in Key Ministries. In the initial stages of the project, six Ministries and the Government
Information Services would each have key roles to play in reaching the goals of the five main prevention activities.
They would each form a core management group, to be responsible for implementing HIV/AIDS prevention and
control activities directed at their respective target populations. Each of these Ministries has included a line item for
HIV/AIDS activities in its budget for 2002. The Ministries that would participate in the project are as follows:
* Ministry of Health (MH)
* Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs and Culture (MEC)
* Ministry of Social Transformation (MST)
* Office of the Attorney General and Ministry of Home Affairs (MAG)
* Ministry of Tourism (MTIT)
* Ministry of Labor, Sports and public Sector Reform (MLS)
* Government Information Services (GIS)
Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will support the MH implementation of standardized protocols for
behavioral ("second generation") and biological surveillance with the assistance of the Chronic Disease Research
Center (CDRC) of the University of West Indies (UWI) and CAREC. CAREC will also assist the MH providing
technical support towards the strengthening of the STI/HIV/AIDS information system, programming and execution
of surveys. The standard data and criteria for the HIV-AIDS information system are detailed in Annex 13.3. The
database design would provide access to online information on diagnostic and lab testing relative to the management
of opportunistic infections, anti-retroviral status, CD4 and viral load, applied history and date-sensitive treatment,
non compliance alert, as well as up to date information on drug dispensation, online therapeutic protocols, adverse
effects help, utilization and effects. Integrity and confidentiality of the electronic medical records would be assured
with encrypting technology.
The project would fund the technical assistance required for the selection, acquisition, adaptation and implementation
of clinical information systems focusing HIV-AIDS case management and surveillance from applications available in
the market.
Research. The scope of research activities would include the following:
* Social and economic impact studies, particularly HIV/AIDS household impact and cost effectiveness of
HIV/AIDS prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and projected demand for treatment;
* situation analyses starting with baseline indicators for monitoring HIV/AIDS epidemic and demographic trends,
KAP studies for assessing knowledge, attitudes and practices in sexual behaviors and attitudes towards
PLWHAs;
* needs assessment studies, including criteria and provision of anti-retroviral treatment, payment capabilities,
funding options, and service needs according to community groups and PLWHAs; and
* research capacity building on HIV/AIDS, with local, regional and international collaboration and support.
Staged Implementation. All project components would build up their activities, based on lessons learned as
implementation progresses. This recognizes that the effectiveness of many project activities, especially those that are
directed at changing behavior and attitudes is difficult to predict and that modifications in implementation rates,
scope and details would be necessary throughout the implementation period. Annual progress reviews and a mid
term review will be important project management tools and are provided for in support to project management. The
work plan for the first project year is attached to Annex 13.3.
Of particular concern is Barbados' ability to scale up the ART program that now serves about 15 patients, to one that



104
serves the estimated population of about 1,250 HIV positive persons who could qualify for ART in the medium term
(24 to 36 months). A significant scaling up of ART and the use of loan proceeds to support it would be initiated
only after the proposed infrastructure has been completed, and staffing and training contemplated under this
component is found satisfactory (see Conditions and Annex 13.11 for the criteria to be applied in making the
determination of readiness). The progression of project actions leading to the decision would be:
a) Management Organization: Establishing and operating the PCU within NACHA's organization, the Inter-
Ministerial Committee and the HIV/AIDS Ministerial Units to ensure a sustainable institutional structure and
management for GOB's HIV/AIDS overall program (and project implementation) and the reconfiguration of the
AIDS Management Unit in the MH. This first stage would be accomplished in the first 12-18 months of project
implementation .
b) Preparation and Development of Prevention Programs: The five key prevention programs would be fully
prepared including objectives, target populations, types of interventions, staffing, and other inputs with their
respective budget. Initiating the implementation of all of the five programs would be expected at the beginning
of the second project year.
c) Completion of Infrastructure for scaling up ART: Infrastructure to support an expanded ART program would
be complete when:
o  The civil works (refurbishing, remodeling, expansion of facilities)  providing the required space for
voluntary counseling and testing, laboratory and pharmaceutical services, and home and hospital care for
HIV/AIDS patients are completed;
o  the laboratory equipment and staff training for HIV testing (ELISA test), opportunistic diseases, CD4 count
and viral load testing is completed;
o  the procurement process for required quantities of ARV drugs has been clearly established;
o  staffing and training for the HIV/AIDS Referral Center has been completed;
o  review and updating of protocols for ART has been completed and found satisfactory, as well as the updating
of the manual for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste at the QEH; and
o  financial feasibility and sustainability for further annual scaling up the number of patients under ART
treatment are achieved.
These steps should be completed in the first 20-24 months of the project.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the proiect
The project would support the strengthening of Barbados' HIV/AIDS management capacity to ensure the long-term
sustainability of scaled up efforts by developing a proactive Commission on HIV/AIDS and a solid Office of the
Director; formally recognize the participation of CSOs through grant and other contractual arrangements to
implement parts of the government HIV/AIDS Management Program; and mainstream addressing HIV/AIDS issues
in various Ministry programs.
3. Benefits and target population
The project would provide the following benefits for Barbados. First, by slowing the rate of new HIV infections it
would be reducing the number of new AIDS cases that would appear in the future, and the consequent human and
social costs, human suffering, and financial burdens to families. Second, the project would extend the lives of
PLWHAs, most of whom are between 25 and 49 years of age, extending their productive contributions to society.
Thirdly, on a macro-economic point of view, these effects would allow Barbados to significantly reduce the risk of
losses in GDP, poverty rates, and erosion of social cohesion. Finally, the project would allow Barbados to continue
to manage the epidemic through the longer term.
4. Institutional and implementation arraneements
The project would be implemented under the authority of the Office of the Prime Minister (who is also the Finance
Minister). At the political level, an Inter-ministerial Committee would set the political strategy guiding the
implementation of the National Program. The Prime Minister and the Inter-ministerial Committee are finalizing
executive appointments of experienced staff to assure sound implementation of the program.

National Commission on HIV/AIDS (NACHA). Responsibility for determining the strategic content and direction
for implementing the project in Barbados would be vested in the NACHA. This body has been created by the
Barbados Cabinet as a "statutory board" to oversee the performance of the project and be accountable for its success
to the public. The NACHA would advise government on HIV/AIDS policy, advocate and promote the active
involvement of all sectors and organizations in implementing HIV/AIDS management actions, create partnerships to
broaden the national response to HIV/AIDS, mobilize resources, internationally and locally to support the efforts,
and to monitor and be ultimately accountable to the public for the successful implementation of the project.
NACHA will comprise representatives from groups in many sectors of Barbados with stakes in reducing the threat of
HIV/AIDS. It would be led by a Chairperson who would be an individual of recognized public leadership, capable of
mobilizing public action and managing controversy. The Chairperson would be selected by the Prime Minister and
serve on a full-time paid basis. The 12 to 14 additional members of the Commission would receive honoraria in
accordance with regulations governing other Statutory Boards.
NACHA would be expected to be proactive in listening to public concerns and expert advice and probing issues. It
would also have access to consulting services and assist in formulating strategies for dealing with these issues.
NACHA would solicit assistance and participation of NGOs, community groups or public sector agencies to sponsor
and be accountable for implementing such strategies. This would extend to recommending changes in legal and



107
regulatory frameworks, as needed. It would report to the Inter-ministerial Committee and to the public through the
media.
Office of Director (the Office). The daily work of implementing the program will be executed through the Office of
the Director, serving as a secretariat for NACHA. The Office would be established within the Prime Minister's
office as a government department, which would have its own budget approved by the legislature, management team,
and responsibilities to the Prime Minister as its hierarchical authority. The Office would also be the PCU for the
World Bank-financed project.
The Office would be managed by a Director, appointed at the level of a Department Head in the civil service. In
addition to the regular duties of a department head, he/she would perform the following functions:
* Advise the Inter-ministerial Committee and the Commission on the formulation of national programs and policy
for HIV/AIDS management;
* assure the development of the overall HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project prevention and control work
programs and coordinate its implementation through various Ministries' implementation plans and through those
of stakeholders in the private sector, NGOs and community groups;
*  advise on budgetary allocations to be made to line Ministries for HIV/AIDS activities and report on the financial
performance of Ministries and to NGOs and community groups in relation to HIV/AIDS;
* assure, through subordinates, the sound financial management of the project, and be ultimately responsible for
project procurement; and,
* monitor and evaluate the performance and results of actions implemented by Ministries and stakeholders.
* The Director would have senior-level working experience in the government service or in a comparable agency.
The Office would also be staffed with a Deputy Director, an Assistant Director and a Financial Officer
responsible for:
* HIV/AIDS prevention programs and programming, including guiding the design and implementation of
education, training, and behavior change motivation in other Ministries, as well as through the Office directly;
e policy, planning, research and monitoring and evaluation intended to continue to focus the activities financed
under the project on key target groups in a cost-effective manner;
* financial management related firstly to the management of resources provided through the WB and other donors
as these may become available (resource allocation, accounting, disbursements); and secondly to monitor and
advise on the uses and needs for financing Ministries' and NGOs HIV/AIDS activities; and
* procurement management, devoted essentially to the use of WB loan proceeds.
The terms of reference for these key personnel and their accountabilities would be contained in a project operations
manual, and qualifications and experience agreed with the WB. Appointments are immanent.
The staff of an AIDS Program Unit, being reformed under the MH to assume expanded responsibilities for
prevention and managing the treatment of ART, would be considered as an adjunct management staff of the Office.
Considering the relative size of their financial responsibilities, they would be considered as "co-managers" of the
project.
As a government department, the Office would have a legal status that allows it to receive treasury resources as a
"line item" authorized by the legislature, and from donor agencies; be audited by independent auditors, to establish
contracts under Barbados' laws governing tendering and to commit public monies. Administratively, the Director
with his financial officer (a position analogous to a Ministry's Finance Officer) would have full accountability for the
program, its spending and results. -



108
Ministry Implementation Units. Coordinated by the Office, significant parts of the project would be implemented
through the efforts of several core Ministries including: Health; Education, Youth Affairs and Culture; Social
Transformations; Office of the Attorney General and the Ministry of Home Affairs; Tourism; Labor, Sport and
Public Sector Reform; and the Government Information Services.
Each of these Ministries and agencies would establish its own programs to promote behavior changes, and contribute
to the prevention of HIV transmission among the populations and target groups that it normally serves (see Annex
13.3). Each would organize its work through (or in the case of the Ministry of Health re-establish; see below) a
specific HIV/IAIDS Prevention Unit, managed by a designated Ministry coordinator to be responsible for
consolidating the Ministry's work plan, supervising its execution, and coordinating its efforts with the Office. For
planning and monitoring purposes, these units would consist of key Ministry staff (Minister, permanent secretary,
relevant technical officers), representatives of the Ministries' constituencies, and a representative of PLWHAs. The
coordinator would establish the work and programming and budget covering the Ministry's expected contribution to
the project, coordinate these plans with the national program managed by the Office, and upon inclusion in the
national work program, assure its implementation. Each Unit would be responsible for maintaining financial and
performance records for its own activities, and for being accountable under the public service system which places
these accountabilities with permanent secretaries and Ministry Finance Officers.
The Ministry of Health has been primarily responsible for the national AIDS Control Program since 1984 and has
managed it through an AIDS Management Team within the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. To improve the management
of the expanded prevention and treatment components, MH would constitute an HIV/AIDS Program Unit that would
include the HIV/AIDS Management Team responsible for treatment, and additional staff responsible for the MH
prevention activities. The Unit's composition would be modified and would be physically relocated to allow it to
increase the level and quality of preventive actions, clinical treatment, counseling, social services, nutrition
counseling, patient education and community care management.
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). CSOs would be fully involved in the design and implementation of the
project. Key formal NGOs would be represented on NACHIA to participate in strategic and policy management of
the project. They would also have a direct role in implementing various HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project
activities, supported through public sector financing in two ways. First, each Ministry would identify a role for these
organizations within their own areas of responsibility, and proactively solicit their participation. Such solicitation
would be on the basis of well-defined tasks, with clear and monitorable expectations, and an expected time frame
and budget. Secondly, NGOs, community groups and CSOs could develop proposals that may address themes that
are not aligned with specific Ministry responsibilities, and submit these to the Office directly for funding. These
proposals would also specify the task, accountabilities and monitorable deliverables and outcomes, and the time and
resources proposed to perform the task.
NGOs, community groups and civil society organizations that are either invited or proposing to contribute to the
project would meet criteria to establish their technical competence, managerial capacity, financial accountability, and
credibility in the eyes of their constituencies. Evidence would include past records of accomplishments,
qualifications and experience of managers, audited financial statements, bank records, or other evidence of sound
business practice, and testimonials or other representations of the intended beneficiaries of the organization's
activities. The cost of tasks assigned to these partners would normally not exceed by more than 20%.the cost of
"projects" that the organization has typically managed.
Barbados has a long tradition of partnering with established NGOs to implement public-sector sponsored initiatives.
Part of the project, however, will be to offer technical assistance to community groups and others in organizing to be
more effective "NGOs", and thus participate in the project.  This would have the effect of broadening the
commitment to and ownership of the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment agenda, as well as increasing its "reach".
The Office would adapt guidelines currently being used to support community groups in the area of social
development for Ministries wishing to engage such non-governmental partners. These-would be included in the
Operational Manual of the project. The process of soliciting and selecting NGOs, community and civil society
groups would be shared by the Ministry concemed and the Office of the Director. The Office would maintain



109
contractual arrangements with the NGOs financed with World Bank funds, and technical ministries (or the Office as
the case might be) would assure technical supervision of the tasks involved.
Project Planning and Programming
An indicative project implementation plan for the first project year has been agreed, based on the program's strategic
objectives, an initial needs assessment and expected budget and resource availability would be appraised (Attachment
to Annex 13.3). Subsequently, the project would be implemented through rolling annual work programs to allow it
to evolve over time, building on success and accommodating new initiatives and partners. Following a timetable
established by the Office that would correspond to the budget cycle of the government (April-March), each Ministry
implementation unit would establish its HIV/AIDS program of activities, resource needs, statement of
implementation arrangements and near term outcomes for inclusion in the national program of that year. The Office
would review, evaluate and compile the programs into a national plan of action. Independently, the Office would if
necessary, identify additional activities that should be included in the program, and would then arrange with
Ministries or other agencies (NGOs) for implementation.
The operational plan would be submitted to the Commission for advice, and subsequently submitted to the Inter-
ministerial Committee and Cabinet for political approval. Once approved, the respective Ministry programs would
be implemented.  The above programmatic and budgetary instruments would constitute the participation
arrangements for project implementation according to the terms of the Operational Manual and satisfactory evidence
of which would be provided to the WB. Ministries would administer their earmarked HIV/AIDS budgets according
to Barbados budget regulations, and the Office would manage the flow of project funds to suppliers and community
groups to complete program activities. The Office would monitor all activities, budget execution and results under
the project.
A half-yearly review of progress would be conducted by the Office as a basis for mid-year adjustments and
modifications to the program and budgets. An end-of-year review of implementation progress would also be
conducted and a program for the subsequent year would be developed in December of each year, and agreed with the
Bank, along with a procurement plan (see below). Among the elements to be reviewed would be the level of public
expenditures being made on HIV/AIDS, and an evaluation of the continuing sustainability of such expenditures.
Independent consultants may be engaged for part of this work, and the participation of such agencies as PAHO,
UNAIDS, CAREC and Caribbean Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (CMR+) would be solicited. A full
mid term review would be conducted after 30 months of project implementation. This is expected to coincide with a
review leading to a decision concerning WB financial support for Barbados' expanded ART program.
Procurement. Procurement under the project would follow WB guidelines for works, consulting services, and
goods when Bank funded and would be complemented by Barbados tendering regulations when purchases are to be
totally funded by Government funds (see Annex 13.8). The Office would supervise and account for all procurement
activity a part of its functions as project coordinator. The PCU would also perform the procurement function for
purchases financed under the project for all participating Ministries except the MH.  Individual Ministry
implementation units would procure goods and services with their individual treasury allocations. In cases where a
Ministry's activity may not be fully financed with it's legislative "vote", it would agree with the Office on a cost
sharing arrangement that allowed the Office to procure the goods, services and works needed to complete the
Ministry plan. In the case of the MH, however, it would perform the procurement function all of its project related
needs either through the HIV/AIDS Project Unit or the BDS according to the relevant guideline. It would maintain
its own records, and assure that the PCU was aware of its activities so that a full accounting of project procurement
would be maintained.



110
The following procurement processes would be adopted:
* The Office would prepare a procurement plan for each year which would be submitted by Government to the WB
for approval, not later than December of the previous year. It would specify: (i) major lots of goods and services
to be procured; (ii) the method of procurement; and (iii) the timetable for carrying out the procurement. If
needed, the plan could be revised and re-submitted. The procurement plan for the first year of the project has
been prepared and agreed at appraisal.
* In the case of activities being contracted for execution by NGOs, if this involved further purchasing of goods and
services, the community groups or CSOs, each would carry out its procurement in accordance with procedures
accepted by the Bank, that would be described in their contract with the Office. These would follow the same
thresholds as for the project as whole.
* Barbados is expected to be included in the Accelerated Access Initiative for ARV drugs, which would result in
substantially reduced prices being offered for these drugs by six major companies. Barbados would procure
ARV drugs from these companies according to registered brand names. Procurement would thus be considered
as "sole source" and a technical justification would be submitted for Bank approval at the time of purchase which
addressed the ARV drug procurement at the source.
A procurement capacity assessment has been completed and approved by the RPA's office. The risk on procurement
in considered AVERAGE. Procurement actions will be basically concentrated in the Office of the Director, in
Ministry of Health Unit and in Barbados Drug Service. Procurement performance will be re-assessed through a
performance assessment conducted by the Bank during a Mid-Term Review of the project, and thresholds may be
modified accordingly. The initial applicable thresholds for prior review and for recommended procurement methods
are given on Annex 13.8.
Financial Management. The Office would be responsible for maintaining financial accounts for all project
expenditures, and for having these audited annually by independent auditors. While participating Ministries would
maintain their own accounts covering their parliamentary "votes", the Office would also maintain a consolidated
account for the government on HIV/AIDS activity.  The Office is new, however, it is expected that the
accountant/financial manager appointed to serve in the Office will be fully familiar with the Barbados centralized and
computerized "Smart Stream Financial" system (a cash accounting system installed in recent years in Barbados and
many OECS countries, among others). A financial management assessment was completed by the Bank as part of
the project appraisal process, and its results are discussed in Annex 13.8, which also contains a more detailed
discussion of some of the topics referred to below.
Budget and Financing Cycle. The Office, as other Ministries and departments in Barbados, would prepare its
annual budget and financing needs in December of each year. The legislature approves budgets by mid March for
implementation at the start of the Barbados fiscal year (which runs from April - March), and this would apply to the
Office and the project. Authorized commitment levels would then be established for the year. While quarterly
spending and commitment levels are estimated, some flexibility is permitted in executing the budget, provided
overall authorized amounts are not exceeded.
Payment Flows and Accountabilities. Ministries in Barbados do not handle cash, but work on a payment order
system. The Director, in conjunction with the financial Manager would maintain control of the issuance of payment
orders and the orders would be executed by the Barbados Accountant General. The project and the Accountant
General have access to the same accounts through the centralized computer system. The Accountant General's office
subsequently would draw from the loan proceeds through the Central Bank, after which the Accountant in the PCU
would submit Special Account (SA) replenishment applications to the Bank.
Disbursements. Disbursements would be made following traditional WB disbursement methods, until the borrower
has met requirements to disburse via Project Management Reports (PMRs) and has expressed its desire to use this
disbursement method.
Retroactive financing of up to 10% of the loan amount, or US$1.5 million, would be authorized for eligible
expenditures made after May 15, 2001, that have been made following Bank procurement guidelines. These are
likely to include civil works and equipment.



III
To facilitate disbursements, a SA would be opened at the Central Bank with an authorized allocation of US$ I
million, covering four months of expected eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, GOB would withdraw
US$500,000, or 50% of the authorized allocation. When the aggregate amount of funds withdrawn from the Loan
Account and outstanding commitments reaches US$4 million, the remaining 50% may be withdrawn.
Replenishment applications will be submitted approximately monthly, with full documentation for contracts above
the prior review threshold. It is envisaged, however, that substantial disbursements would be made through
statements of expenditure (SOEs), with expenditure records maintained by the Office for inspection of WB missions
and external auditors. SOE thresholds and further information on project disbursements are shown in Annex 13.8.
Audits. The project accounting records and financial statements would be audited annually by independent auditors,
in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Auditors would be selected at the start of the project,
as a condition of effectiveness, and the same audit firm would be retained throughout the implementation period,
unless their performance was at some point considered to be unsatisfactory by the government or the Bank. Their
terms of reference would include providing a Report on Internal Controls, and giving separate audit opinions on the
Statement of the SA, the validity of SOEs, and compliance with legal covenants. Audit reports would be submitted to
the Bank within four months of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Supervision. Owing to the size of the loan and the political importance of this
project, the Planning and Priorities Committee of the Cabinet would regularly review its implementation, results and
costs. The PCU at the NACHA would have major responsibility for monitoring and evaluating the implementation
and results obtained from each project component. The PCU would provide quarterly reports of implementation
progress and an annual report on the results obtained relative to program expectations. The strengthening of the HIV
/AIDS Surveillance and Information System would ensure timely data collection and analyses for monitoring and
evaluating project performance.
The WB would commit adequate supervision resources to ensure timely and proper follow up of project phases in
order to agree with the GOB on decisions as to keep or change the course of implementation. This is particularly
important in the case of starting support for ART. The Bank would invite such organizations as UNAIDS,
PAHO/CAREC, and CRN+ to join it in discussing project results with the Government, and in providing advice on
these decisions. This would contribute to assure Bank's fiduciary responsibilities. As part of its regional leadership
role, Barbados expects to continue to participate in the work of such organizations as the CARICOM Task Force on
HIV/AIDS to both share its experience to others and to learn.
D. Project Rationale
1. The Rationale for Bank Financin! for Barbados' HIV/ADS Proiect
It is of critical importance to include Barbados in the Caribbean Regional HIV/AIDS APL supported by the World
Bank because of the strong public goods and externalities aspect of the regional HIV/AIDS program explained in
Section B. I and Barbados' unique leadership role in the sub-region. Despite the critical importance of this project,
our analysis indicates that Barbados cannot finance the proposed operation through alternative sources at reasonable
terms. (See Annex 13.1 for greater details). An analysis of alternative financing options indicates the following (and
this lack of alternative sources makes IBRD lending to Barbados permissible under the IBRD Articles of
Agreement):
Options for own financing of the 1IV/AIDS project. Barbados already allocates a significant proportion of its
overall budget (12 percent or US $100 million annually) to health, including HIV/AIDS, and has additionally
committed to financing an additional US$7.6 million of the proposed HIV/AIDS program. If Barbados were to
finance the entire project from its own resources, other critical health services would likely suffer.
Options for international financing. The other option would be for Barbados to seek international financing of the
HIV/AIDS programn. Our consultations with international financial institutions indicate that Barbados would not be
able to raise the required resources for expanding its HIV/AIDS program from international commercial or
multilateral sources on reasonable terms.
* Commercial borrowings. Commercial banks typically do not provide financing on a project basis for non-
revenue generating projects, such as the HIV/AIDS project.



112
* Bond Issues on the regional Caribbean or global bond markets. The Caribbean regional market can
accommodate the relatively small US$15.15 million financing needs of this Project. However, the regional
market would charge a very high interest rate spread (about 350 basis points), despite Barbados' A- Standard &
Poor's credit rating. The interest rate spread is likely to be somewhat lower on the global bond markets, but
US 15.15 million would be too small an issue for the global market, and the timing of any such issuance would be
contingent on the issuance of a larger bond issue. The need for HIV/AIDS financing, however, is urgent.
* Other international financial institutions. The multilateral banks (the IDB and the CDB), of which Barbados
is a borrowing member, were consulted by the Bank on co-financing the HIV/AIDS project but neither institution
showed interest at that time. As of July 2000, IDB had a portfolio of US$230 million in Barbados, though it had
no operations in the health sector. As of now, it does not have any HIV/AIDS operations with any of its clients
and has not yet developed the technical capacity to design and supervise such programs. Similarly, CDB does not
currently finance any health sector projects in the Caribbean. With respect to bilateral agencies, though many
support regional HIV/AIDS programs in the Caribbean, currently there is limited support for national level
activities.
2. Proiect alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
This proposed project in Barbados is one of the first to be proposed for financing under the Caribbean Multi-Country
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program. It has been designed as a Specific Investment Loan to conform to the
World Bank's strategy of employing a regional APL framework for accelerating its assistance to Caribbean countries
as part of its response to the epidemic world wide. The specific features of the project have been guided by the
Bank's decision to recommend to its borrowers adapting the Caribbean Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS to
their specific needs.
The following project altematives were considered in the specific case of Barbados:
Vertical or decentralized care delivery: The selected interventions with cost-effective anti-retroviral drugs will
principally be delivered through the QEH's AIDS Management Team in coordination with the primary health care
network. This was considered to be preferable from a public health point of view, to minimize the risks of poor case
management, low continuity in treatment, misuse of the drugs, and over-prescription. It also allows Barbados to
react quickly to changes on recommended therapy regimes.
Single- versus Multi-sectoral approach: The response of the Barbados Govemment to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has
been characterized by a broad partnership involving the Government, NGOs, religious groups, communities, PLWA,
and local and international donors. The creation of the National Commission on HIV/AIDS--NACHA--was an
important policy decision that recognized the importance of program implementation through different sectors. The
health sector clearly does not have a monopoly on the instruments to promote behavioral changes and to break HIV
transmission paths. The proposed project's strategy is to support those efforts that are being conducted outside the
strict confines of the health sector and that are demonstrably cost-effective.
3. Maior related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned).
World Bank lending to Barbados has been limited for several years. An education project approved in 1993, which
was the last, is now closed. The WB has not lent for the health sector in Barbados. Apart from having provided
technical assistance to the MH, and support for advocacy, there have been no major projects addressing HIV/AIDS in
Barbados. As mentioned in point I above, neither the Inter-American Development Bank or the Caribbean
Development Bank provide financing in the health sector or for an HIV/AIDS project in particular, nor any of the
bilateral agencies. However several other development partners are active in HIV/AIDS control and prevention in
the Caribbean. UNAIDS, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Caribbean Epidemiological
Center (CAREC), are active at the regional level and will complement the Bank's efforts.



113
4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design.
The project adapts design features that underpin the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, and
have been successful in other countries. These include the following:
* Demonstrating a high level of government commitment and providing clear national leadership for a program;
* building collaboration networks with NGOs, community groups and CSOs, as a complement to public sector
agencies;
* deconcentrating the initiatives for efforts to address the epidemic;
* including the focus on treatment and care as a continuum in the program;
* providing focus on behavior change as a key element of prevention and control; and
* adopting implementation measures that provide flexibility and responsiveness to the epidemic as it evolves.
The proposed project also adapts lessons from the Government experience with the NACHA in that direct line
authority for the project's implementation is attached to the Prime Minister's Office to give institutional structure to
the effort. Second, the project is being driven by pre-identified monitorable goals with financial resources allocated
through Ministries to achieve them. Third, management of the HIV/AIDS activities is being assigned to dedicated
persons both within Ministries and within the new Office, which brings managerial accountability.
Other lessons of previous Barbadian experience are less easily built in to the project's design; notably the difficulty
of motivating behavioral change in individuals even when they may be well informed about the epidemic. The
proposed project is designed to at least accommodate this risk by allowing for annual evaluation of results and the
presumption that the activities to be financed (especially in the area of prevention) will change over time as a result.
This project also includes a major lesson from the other regional APL on Disaster Management in the Eastern
Caribbean. Multi-country projects need a strong regional component to coordinate strategy and actions.  This
project will include such a regional coordinating mechanism.
5. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownershiD
The Government of Barbados organized its first nationwide effort to address the issues of HIV/AIDS in 1985. It
established HIV/AIDS in public thinking and as a part of public dialogue. Government has now placed the advocacy
and responsibility for achieving an effective response to the epidemic directly in the Office of the Prime Minister. It
adopted a comprehensive program for the management, prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in September 2000.
This program corresponds to recognized "best practices" as agreed by agencies such as UNAIDS, PAHO/CAREC,
and CARICOM. Implementation of the program will involve a broad cross-section of Barbadian leadership from the
public sector, NGOs, communities and civil society. For 2001, GOB has, in addition allocated new budgetary
resources specifically for the program, and has re-qualified for "borrower status" from the World Bank (having
previously been graduated). These are strong indications of commitment to effectively reversing the epidemic's
trend.
Barbados has also been a key leader in mobilizing efforts to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic
throughout the Caribbean. As Chairnan of CARICOM, the Barbadian Prime Minister gave strong impetus to
reaching agreement on a Caribbean Regional Strategic Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS by Caribbean Heads of
Government during July 2000. Barbados hosted a Caribbean Conference on HIV/AIDS in September 2000 that
further built support for HIV/AIDS programs by governments as well as multilateral and bilateral donors. Most
recently, (January 2001) Barbados has given additional encouragement to the OECS countries to invigorate their own
national responses to the HIV/AIDS threat.
Finally, Barbados has agreed to devote additional resources to become one of the two "flagship" countries to launch
the Caribbean Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program, and serve as a model for subsequent country projects.

6. Value added of Bank support in this proiect
The most important value of Bank involvement in supporting this project would be its contributions to policy
consolidation on HIV/AIDS in Barbados, improved management of prevention activities, and technical expertise for
ensuring appropriate scaling up of ART. The Bank's support for this project will assist Barbados to effectively
establish an operational multisectoral HIV/AIDS program.
At present, Barbados is receiving strategy advice and advocacy support for its initiatives, but making them
operational has been assumed almost exclusively by the country. The Bank has supported detailed planning of the
prevention and institutional development program, and in particular is contributing to Barbados planning to initiate
ART for all residents within a few years. The Bank would provide incremental resources that will allow Barbados to
undertake a scaled-up level of prevention activities in the short term, and finance an ART program at a national level,
as a matter of public health. This would be one of the first such experiences among developing countries and would
be a critical pilot project in establishing the credibility of similar programs in other countries.
Through the project, the Bank would also be supporting Barbados' establishment of an institutional framework that
would perpetuate the management, prevention, treatment and control program in the longer term. This activity is
likely to require a period of experimentation and adaptation of processes to succeed and the project would provide a
phased implementation within which this can occur. In addition, the Bank's proposed project package also includes
technical advice, assistance in designing an implementable program, advice on procurement, regular supervision and
assistance with monitoring and evaluation.  These intangibles, and the continuing transfer of global lessons of
experience, are particularly important in a complex area such as HIV/AIDS where best practice is still emerging.
Finally, by supporting Barbados, the Bank would be assisting in establishing an anchor for the rest of the OECS and
the Caribbean in general, in establishing their own prevention and treatment programs, several of which may depend
on future partnerships with Barbados to be viable.
E. Summary Project Analysis (detailed assessments are in the project file; see Annex 13.13)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 13.6)
[xl Other (specify)
An economic analysis of the non-ART components of the project was carried out. Additional analyses will be carried
out in the early stages of project implementation to evaluate the economic feasibility and financial sustainability of
the ART component. The partial economic analysis carried out here indicates that the expected rates of return are
high (62.3% in the base scenario) and quite robust to changes in key parameters (reduction in incidence achieved by
the project, savings on hospital care, etc).
2. Financial:
Barbados health system infrastructure is already well-developed. To absorb an ART program, relatively modest
improvements in facilities, laboratory equipment, and staff training would be required. Improvements in the
surveillance system via improved information technology applications are being designed to manage care, and a
proven system for monitoring "second generation" effects of prevention programs is being adapted. Barbados
medical community is very expeiienced in managing individual AIDS cases, as well as other STIs.
Once introduced, the ART program should reach its maximum client group, estimated to be about 1,250 persons,
relatively quickly. Barbados is geographically small with excellent ground transportation. The Government program
expects to implement a broader community care network that should facilitate home-to-clinic movements and
following clinical prescriptions out of the clinics. Barbados' population exhibits a literacy rate in excess of 95%
which indicates a high degree of readiness to understand and follow ART instructions. Barbados' program also
expects to improve knowledge and practices on the part of health care workers and professionals to better serve HIV-
positive and AIDS individuals. Barbados currently follows WHO-approved protocols for treating HIV/AIDS, for
blood-bank protection and for post contact prophylaxis.



115
Barbados' guidelines for the admission of patients to ART follows international clinical norms for viral load and "C'
cell count. It intends to practice a policy of free and universal access to ART for Barbadian residents meeting the
clinical test. This policy is widely known in the country.
Barbados is a relatively well-off middle income country, with GDP per capita of about $9,000. It currently spends
about 5.8% of GDP and about 3.8% of public expenditures on health care. At the last analysis, Barbados spent about
US$8 million for drugs in the public sector which represented 10% of public health expenditures. If the estimated
yearly cost of the ARV is added, then Barbados' expenditures for drugs will be increased by 30% or about US$2.6
million. A preliminary estimate of the impact of public sector financing of ARV drugs at negotiated prices would be
to raise public expenditures by about 2%. A further refinement of this estimate is required, but indicates that the
problem of post-project sustainability may be smaller than anticipated.
These indications suggest that Barbados is in a good position to absorb support for and sustain ART as a feature of its
HIV/AIDS program.
3. Technical
A select core group of Barbados' public health service providers is well informed on evolving medical and scientific
basis of HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Barbados is less informed on the options available to it in the area of
prevention, but is mobilizing technical advice to address these weaknesses.
The February 2001 workshop in Bridgetown reviewed several local and international experiences in the use of IEC
for positive behavioral change in different risk groups, and other cost effective prevention programs such as STIs
prevention and control using the syndromic approach.  An important agreement was the identification and
assignment of target groups (high-risk and vulnerable groups) to be addressed by different Ministries according to
their own sphere of work. In some cases where these groups overlap, the Ministries would be able to coordinate
activities to jointly ensure total coverage of their stakeholders. This project would support means for improving the
management, prevention, treatment, and control of HIV/AIDS that are derived from successful international and
regional experience. A menu of options analyzed during the February 2001 workshop will be included in the project
operational manual. The technical issues to be resolved will be essentially in adapting actions that may have been
successful in changing behavior, attitudes and eventually practices of the general population and high risk groups
elsewhere to the Barbadian situation.
Barbados is currently treating about 15 cases of AIDS with ART. These are managed by a core group of public
health service providers upon referral from private physicians, and financed with private funds. Two separate recent
technical analyses of Barbados' readiness to scale this experience up to a national level have concurred that the limits
to meeting this objective are correctable in the medium term with project assistance. They include:
*  Improving the number and quality of sites (using existing polyclinics) and supporting infrastructure
(laboratories) to accommodate a larger number of patients in testing, counseling and facilitate referrals;
*  training and including additional health care professionals in the safe and effective use of ARV drugs,
diagnosis and follow-up care and surveillance of ART patients after prescription;
*  strengthening continuum of care from home to referral hospital by involving community groups, local
clinics and other satellite health centers; and
*  consolidating the capacity to procure, ARV drugs (the reliability of current regulatory mechanisms against
the misuse and misappropriation of the drugs is rated as satisfactory) and to acquire ARV drugs at affordable
prices.
The difficult decision whether to scale up ART would be preceded by project support to address these requirements..
A phased implementation that permits experimentation and learning, and periodic evaluations to change or stop
implementing project interventions is a technical feature to ensure better informed decisions (see C, Component 2).



116
4. Institutional
Executing Agencies. Project implementation will be assured through line Ministries. Principal among these, the
Ministry of Health through its AIDS Referral Unit has long experience in the management, treatment and care of
persons affected by HIV/AIDS and in treating STIs through its polyclinics. Other Ministries have had varying
degrees of contact with HIV/AIDS programs specifically, but all are managed by experienced career civil servants
who serve as chief executive officers for the government's programs.
Barbados' NGOs, community organizations, and CSOs have had varied experiences in implementing project activity
under contractual relationships with the government including being accountable for results and financing. The
project operational manual would include criteria for qualifying such organizations as partners in the program
Project Management. The Office of the Director is not at this point experienced in managing WB financed
projects. However, Barbados benefits from adequate management resources that would be mobilized for this purpose
and is currently searching for qualified staff to be appointed before project appraisal. The Office could out-source
some financial management functions in the short term to accommodate project management demands.
5. Social
The project is expected to have positive social consequences through continuing the public dialogue on HIV/AIDS,
in empowering comrnunities, families and individuals to deal with the aspects of the epidemic that affect them, and to
seek assistance more openly than may have been possible in the recent past.
The project would also seek to change discriminatory attitudes and behavior against persons living with AIDS
through promoting legislation and regulation, information and education, that make violations of rights less likely.
6. Environmental assessment      Environmental Category  [ ]  A  [x]  B [ ]  C
At the PCD stage, the project was assessed as Category B, considering a risk that might accompany the treatment of
medical waste associated with increased ART in public health facilities.
An assessment of the medical waste situation (Annex 13.3-B) shows that the Barbados MH and The QEH, the major
hospital facility in the country, have appropriate practices and institutional capabilities for managing hospital
infections and for handling wastes (about 15% of all hospital and clinical waste is infected biological material).
Asepsis and antisepsis are routine practices for handling patient care and biomedical equipment such as needles,
razors, scalpels, endoscopy instruments, etc.
HIV/AIDS management in the health care network will add relatively little additional medical, laboratory and
hospital wastes. For practical purposes, management of used goods in handling HIV/AIDS patients will not have
different treatment than those already established for asepsis and antisepsis in any ambulatory and hospital setting.
No additional technology for managing health care wastes appears to be needed to accompany introducing or scaling
up HIV/AIDS care.
However, the management of medical wastes would be improved as detailed in Annex 13.3-B.
7. Participatory approach
Primary Beneficiaries and Other Affected Groups
Barbados has a tradition of community self help which would be encouraged through the project. Information would
be made public encouraging "demand-driven" initiatives to address HIV/AIDS care, treatment and prevention
activities.
Project monitoring and evaluation would rely on beneficiary assessments as part of its basis for introducing
modifications to activities, and informing policymakers.
Other Key Stakeholders
The membership of the NACHA will include representatives of all identifiable stakeholders in the management of
HIV/AIDS.



117
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainabilitv
The project itself is likely to be sustained throughout its implementation period owing to the high level of ownership
and commitment being shown by the government. The project would involve a broad number of stakeholders in its
actual implementation, which will also raise the level of general ownership of the program and its subsequent
sustainability.
The project would also satisfy other conditions that will build longer term loyalty and commitment including:
* Having immediate impacts on PLWHAs quality of life;
*  strengthen NGO capacity to deliver services;
*  resolving regulatory and legal issues that have been controversial;
*  encouraging broad participation, involvement, and therefore ownership; and
*  addressing prevention as well as treatment.
While less problematic in the short term, achieving financial sustainability of an ambitious program in the longer
term will require further study and policy decisions. Government expects to arrive at a long term financial
sustainability plan at project mid-term evaluation.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects
The Bank's support of the Government's commitment to provide ART free of charge to all HIV/AIDS patients may
raise controversy as to the affordability of such a policy and concern among the international community on full
compliance with international intellectual property rights. IBRD financing of this component may also be
controversial as it is not being offered to all countries in the APL.
Though the cost-effectiveness of anti-retro viral drugs is uncertain, evidence on its rates of return is still evolving.
Increasing evidence of the beneficial impact of ART on morbidity and mortality from HIV infection is increasingly
being reported in Europe, and North America. By effective restoration of the immune system with ART, many
opportunistic infections do not occur or are halted, thus greatly improving patient management, costs, quality of life
and life expectancy. This is particularly important for small health care systems such as in Barbados, where if we
also take into account the potential costs of overloading the health care systems with AIDS related infections.  In
fact, ART has made it increasingly possible to consider HIV infection as a manageable chronic disease. Given that
best practice on this issue is still evolving, the inclusion of ART in Barbados, though potentially controversial,
provides an important pilot that could provide lessons for other countries. Barbados is suitable for such a pilot
because of its small size, the financial sustainability of such an approach because of its good fiscal management, and
its superior procurement and financial management capacity. Further, all such drugs will be obtained exclusively
from patent holding manufacturers or their licensees. The experience of this component will be an important part of
the Bank's own learning and best practice for HIV/AIDS prevention programs world-wide.



119
Major difficulties, such as low compliance and drug resistance, may also arise if ART is not backed up by a well
established infrastructure: lab facilities and equipment, timely drug supply, adequately trained staff for diagnosis and
treatment, and adequate patient follow up in his/her community and in hospital. Although Barbados has good
facilities and a well trained medical and nursing staff with up to date information on recent scientific developments in
ART, the project would support the provision of facilities, laboratory equipment, and additional staff and training for
ensuring high standards in ART management (see Annex 13. 10).
Because Barbados is a small country, HIV anonymous testing to better track the "hidden part of the iceberg" may be
controversial because it would be unacceptable not to make an effort to identify those tested positive and provide
advice and support. The recommendation of performing anonymous testing may be suspended if the conflicting
positions become an implementation issue. Instead, the project would make provisions for greatly expanding
voluntary testing and counseling.
Other controversial subjects to be dealt with are working with socially uncomfortable issues areas such as the
behavior of sex workers, men who have sex with men, teen sexual activity, to name a few. Government has already
encountered some controversy over the provision of condoms to prisoners. However, the project would involve
NGOs, community groups and CSOs with direct experience and a mission to deal with such issues who would assist
in overcoming controversy in appropriate ways.
Eventually, with more information and experience, govemment will have to address issues of financial sustainability
of the program in the longer term. Controversy would be managed as phased project implementation provides full
information on options and consequences.
Another controversial aspect relates to the fact that Barbados graduated from World Bank lending in 1993. However.
for the reasons set forth in Sections B.1, D.1, and Annex 13.1 hereto, an exception to the Bank's graduation policy in
this unique case is defensible.
G. Main Loan Conditions
1. Effectiveness Conditions
The Borrower would have adopted the Project Implementation Plan for the first project year, and accompanying
procurement plan, approved operations Manual, complied with the relevant steps described in the financial
management action plan (Annex 13.8), opened a special account in the Central Bank, and appointed auditors
satisfactory to the WB.
2. Conditions for Disbursement for ART
A condition of disbursements for ART would be a positive assessment of Barbados' readiness to expand ART
conducted by independent reviewers following terms of reference acceptable to the WB (see Annex 13.1 1), and the
upgrade of the manual on medical waste management.
H. Readiness for Implementation

ANNEX 13.1
Rationale for Including Barbados in the Caribbean HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention Regional
APL
Barbados graduated from IBRD lending in 1993. However, as one of the countries more severely
affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean, and also one with a strong leadership role in the
sub-region, there is a strong economic and social justification for its inclusion in the Bank's Caribbean-
wide HIV/AIDS program. This operation for Barbados is being proposed as an exceptional case. This
annex outlines the scope of the AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean, the Bank's strategy to respond to it, the
critical importance of including Barbados in this program and the reasons why Barbados cannot finance
its participation through alternative sources.  Finally, this annex then spells out the reasons why
Barbados' inclusion would be fully consistent with the Bank's Articles of Agreement.
The AIDS Epidemic in the Caribbean
HIV/AIDS and the Caribbean. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean is second only to that of sub-
Saharan Africa. In the English-speaking Caribbean, AIDS is now the largest cause of death among young
men between the ages of 15 and 44 years, and by the end of 1999, the cumulative number of Caribbean
children estimated to have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS at age 14 or younger stood at 83,000. In fact,
HIV/AIDS is already reversing life expectancy gains from previous decades in some countries.
HIV/AIDS also has a debilitating economic impact, hitting hardest in the labor force's core age group, a
particularly important issue for the small Caribbean economies which do not have the cushion of large
populations. As an illustration, preliminary assessments by the University of the West Indies (UWI)
indicate that over a five year period, the economic costs of HIV/AIDS even in relatively less affected
economies such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago could reach as high as 6.4 and 4.2 percent of GDP
respectively. Though a similar estimate is not currently available for Barbados, the economic impact is
likely to be greater as the infection rate in Barbados is estimated to be 4.5 percent, amongst the highest in
the Caribbean, and comparable to Haiti and the Bahamas.
Learning from the experience in Africa, the Caribbean countries are now acting decisively to prevent the
further spread of the epidemic, with Barbados taking a leadership role. In September 2000, Barbados
took the lead in organizing a Regional Conference on HIV/AIDS, so as to build consensus among
neighboring countries and development partners on a regional approach to fight the epidemic. At this
meeting, the Caribbean Heads of State, led by Prime Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados, requested
immediate assistance from the international community and since then, the WB has taken the lead role
amongst the development partners in the preparation and financing of a comprehensive program to
combat HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean.
The World Bank's Response to the AIDS Epidemic in the Caribbean
The Horizontal APL approach. WB assistance for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean is being structured as an
horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL) of US$155 million, to be implemented across the 14 countries
of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Dominican Republic. Under this APL, only one loan
is envisaged for each participating country. The APL would provide a common framework for separate
investment loans for each country to finance its national HIV/AIDS project. Each country-specific loan
would typically include the following types of interventions: (i) communication and advocacy to promote
positive behavioral change and government commitment; (ii) scaling up prevention activities to change
high risk behavior, such as promotion of condom use, voluntary testing and counseling, especially
amongst youth, interventions to eliminate mother-to-child transmission and improving the safety of blood
supply; (iii) scaling up care and support activities such as the treatment of sexually transmitted and



122
opportunistic infections; (iv) support of research and surveillance at the national level; and (v) capacity
building for program coordination and monitoring and evaluation.
At the same time as the framework APL, we are presenting the first two of the national loans to the
Board, with Barbados being one of them (the other being the Dominican Republic). The proposed loan
for Barbados of US$15.15 million (of a total project cost of US$22.6 million) will be less than 10 percent
of the overall regional program. The Barbados project is based on the country's own strategic plan, and is
consistent with the framework APL and the Bank's policy in the sector. Barbados' program also
demonstrates readiness at entry, as the country has already met the basic criteria for participating in the
APL program, such as the preparation of a national HIV/AIDS strategy, strong support by the national
leadership, effective programming for multi-sectoral implementation, readiness to adopt simplified
business arrangements, and the existence of basic monitoring and evaluation capacity.
The Importance of Barbados' Participation in the Caribbean Program
Even though the proposed loan to Barbados forms only a small part of the overall program for HIV/AIDS
prevention and control in the Caribbean, its inclusion in the program is of critical importance for several
reasons:
Public goods and externalities. As noted by the April 2001 Development Committee, "Disease respects
no borders, impoverishes andposes huge obstacles to development...."2  Barbados is both a regional hub
with significant population movements across the Caribbean, as well as a popular destination for tourists
from all over the world. The frequent movement of people inevitably leads to the import and export of
diseases. Effective containment of an infectious disease such as HIV/AIDS requires that the entire region
be part of the prevention and control measures. Excluding any country, especially a regional hub such as
Barbados, would undermine the success of the program region-wide.
Leadership: Barbados' proven economic and political leadership in the Caribbean implies that its
absence from the program could significantly undermine the chances of success for the entire Caribbean
program. Indeed, it is only due to Barbados' central role in the September 2000 HIV/AIDS Conference,
and the Prime Minister's personal leadership, that the Caribbean countries now have a shared strategy for
combating this epidemic.
Regional center for technical expertise and health infrastructure: In addition, Barbados is also the
regional leader in developing technical expertise and health care infrastructure, and has a sub-regional
center for services to smaller countries with lesser institutional capacity. For example, the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital in Barbados is the only one in the Eastern Caribbean with adequate standards for
laboratory quality control and blood bank screening for infectious diseases, including HIV, and potential
treatment of AIDS with anti-retroviral drugs. Assisting Barbados in developing the right strategies and
technical approaches, and in expanding their outreach to neighboring countries, would have significant
positive spillovers to the entire region. In this regard, it is important to keep in perspective that the entire
English-speaking Caribbean has a population of about 7 million, less than a metropolitan area in the
United States. Movements across sovereign borders mean less than we may commonly expect and for
obvious economies of scale, the small island economies are highly inter-dependent for specialized
services and infrastructure. In essence, Barbados is the regional hub with advanced economic and social
infrastructure providing these services to some of the less equipped countries of the Eastern Caribbean.
2 See Poverty Reduction and Global Public Goods: A Progress Report DC2001-0007, April 13, 2001.



123
Transferable development lessons:  Through its continuing dialogue with anti-retroviral drug
companies, Barbados is also a front-line participant in the UNAIDS Accelerated Access Initiative.3 Its
experience in promoting HIV/AIDS treatment through anti-retroviral therapies will provide valuable
models for integrating such treatment into general public health for developing countries across the world.
The Rationale for Bank Financing for Barbados' HIV/AIDS Program
Options for own financing of the HIV/AIDS project:  Barbados already allocates a significant
proportion of its overall budget (12 percent or US $100 million annually) to health, including HIV/AIDS,
and has additionally committed to financing an additional US$7.6 million of the proposed HIV/AIDS
program (that is, about $1.5 million annually). If Barbados were to finance the entire project from its own
resources, other critical services would likely suffer. There is little scope for financing it through other
expenditure cuts or additional revenue efforts as Barbados is a prudently managed economy, both from a
macro and a resource allocation point of view. One option would be an annual increase in the
government deficit of about 0.2% of GDP (FY 1999/2000 numbers). Financing this increased deficit
from domestic borrowing would not be advisable as it would crowd out private investment and lead to
inflationary pressures. A higher deficit could also result in a corresponding reduction of official reserves,
which stood at about four months of imports in December 2000. Given Barbados' small economy and its
highly concentrated and volatile export earnings, the Bank would normally recommend reserves of about
six months of imports.
Options for international financing. The other option would be for Barbados to seek international
financing of the HIV/AIDS program. Our consultations with international financial institutions indicate
that Barbados would not be able to raise the required resources for expanding its HIV/AIDS program
from international commercial or multilateral sources on reasonable terms.
- Commercial borrowings. Commercial banks typically do not provide financing on a project basis
for non-revenue generating projects, such as the HIV/AIDS project.  This was confirmed by
consultations with three major banks active in the Anglophone Caribbean. All indicated that they
would not consider financing the HIV/AIDS project under any conditions.
* Bond Issues on the regional Caribbean or global bond markets. The Caribbean regional market
can accommodate the relatively small US$15.15 million financing needs of this Project. However, the
regional market would charge a very high interest rate spread, despite Barbados' A- Standard & Poor's
credit rating. Market estimates indicate that the interest rate spread for a ten-year bond would be at
least 350 basis points over US treasuries. Such a spread appears excessive given that other countries
with the same credit rating are currently paying spreads of about 170 basis points over US treasuries,
or about half of what Barbados would be paying. The additional spread is due to the relatively small
size of Barbados' offering, and the associated low trading volumes for its bonds on the secondary
market. Though these spreads may be somewhat lower on the global bond market - in the range of
270 basis points based on past indications - these are still high compared to other countries with
similar credit ratings. Furthermore, US$15.15 million would be too small a bond issue for the global
market, and the timing of any such issuance would be contingent on the issuance of a larger bond
issue. The financing needs for this project, however, are immediate.
* Other international financial institutions. Although Barbados has good relations with the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), neither institution

affordable costs and under highly effective conditions. Several African, Latin American, and Asian countries are pilots to this

has worked in the area of HIV/AIDS. As of July 2000, the IDB had a portfolio of US$ 230 million in
Barbados, though it had no operations in the health sector, and as of now, no HIV/AIDS operations
with any of its members. The CDB has no operations in the health sector in any of the Caribbean
countries. Both institutions were originally consulted on potential co-financing of the Bank's
HIV/AIDS regional program, but declined. More recently, both have declared that they would like to
make HIV/AIDS a new priority area.4 However neither organization has as yet developed the
technical capacity to put together a complex regional operation on HIV/AIDS. Given the CDB's
expressed interest, the World Bank is ready to offer its help in building its operational capacity in this
technical area. CDB could then potentially support future activities in this area.

The Role of Other Development Partners
Several other development partners are active in HIV/AIDS control and prevention in the Caribbean.
IJNAIDS, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Caribbean Epidemiological Center
(CAREC), are active at the regional level and will complement the Bank's activities. CAREC in
particular is financed by other development partners such as the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), the UK Department For International Development (DFID), Germany (GTZ), and the
US Agency for International Development (USAID).

similar declaration in May 2001 during the CDB's Annual Meetings.

Articles' Provisions on Exceptions to the IBRD Graduation Policy
Barbados graduated from IBRD lending in 1993, in line with the Bank's existing graduation policy, which
was developed in the early 1980s5 and has since been interpreted by the Vice President and General
Counsel.6
As explained in a 1997 Memorandum of the Senior Vice President and General Counsel, the Board of
Executive Directors can approve loans to graduated members as long as the proposed operation meets the
requirement of Section 4 (ii) of Article III of the Articles. This section provides that the Bank must be
satisfied that the Borrower would be unable, under the prevailing market conditions, to obtain the loan
under terms which the Bank considers reasonable to the Borrower. As explained in the above paragraphs,
approval of the HIV/AIDS project for Barbados would be consistent with the provisions of this Article as
Barbados cannot find financing for the HIV/AIDS project on reasonable terms.
In making the exception to the graduation policy, the Bank also takes into account the provisions of
Section 4 (v) of Article III of the Articles which provides that "the Bank shall pay due regard to the
prospect that the Borrower will be in position to meet its obligations under the loan; and the Bank shall
act prudently in the interests both of the particular member in whose territories the project is located and
of the members as a whole". Barbados meets this provision as well, given its prudent macroeconomic
management and its A- Standard & Poor's credit rating.
Consequently, given the exceptional nature of the Barbados case (as outlined in the above paragraphs)
making an exception to the Bank's graduation policy would not be inconsistent with the Bank's Articles
of Agreement.

ANNEX 13.3-A
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project
Detailed Project Description
The MH of Barbados, has undertaken a multisectoral national response to the AIDS epidemic. Under the
leadership of the Prime Minister's Office, the National AIDS Commission, the Inter Ministerial AIDS
Committee and AIDS units in each of 10 Ministries, the GOB has proposed the implementation of the
Management, Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS Project, with three main components, as discussed
below.
A. Component #1: Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS Transmission-US$5.7 million
The first component of the project is the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS transmission. After a full
review of prevention activities (workshop February 21-23, 2001) conducted with the different Ministries
of Barbados, a proposal to internalize best practice and the most cost effective options for affecting
prevention was agreed upon. Eight Ministries and the Government Information Service in Barbados have
begun to formulate work plans incorporating these practices and options.
The target populations identified for prevention interventions are:
*  Adolescents (both genders) in and out of school;
*  pregnant women;
*  sex workers and "beach boys"',
*  men who have sex with men;
*  persons with STIs;
*  uniformed personnel;
*  hard-to-reach persons and groups;
*  health workers;
*  hotel, motel and tourism personnel; and
*  people living with HIV/AIDS.
The following prevention programs would be developed through the different Ministries (see below),
under NACHA coordination, monitoring, and evaluation:
Information Education and Communication: This program aims at maintaining people's awareness
on HIV/AIDS risks and protection measures, promotion of behavior changes for safe sex practices and
risk reduction, and advocacy among public and private leaders on human rights protection, abolition of
discrimination practices and learning to live with PLWHAs. The Government Information Services
would be the sole user of mass media (radio, TV, press, open letters, etc.) for implementing IEC. Other
Ministries would use person to person education, curricular changes, teachers training in sex education,
peer groups communication and education, recreation and artistic activities, etc.
Condom Distribution: Use of social marketing, peer groups, vending machines, and other strategies to
make condoms available and accessible to all segments of adolescents and adult groups; visible access to
condoms in hotels, motels, restaurants, entertainment and other public places. Each Ministry would
choose the best strategy to make condoms available and accessible to its clients (target populations).
Prevention and Control of STIs: The MH would strengthen the STIs prevention and control program
trough its polyclinics network. The project would finance the pre-packed STI therapy for implementing
the syndromic management approach, which has been highly successful in many countries. This



131
program would be implemented by MH, and other Ministries would promote it among their target
populations.
Prevention of HIV/AIDS Mother-to-Child Transmission: The successful implementation of this
preventive program in Barbados achieved a 82% reduction in HIV transmission from HIV/AIDS mothers
to their newborn children, since 1995. The savings per averted infection has been estimated at US$7,000
without estimating gains in quality of life and life expectancy. The project would support the MH to
continue the implementation of this important preventive program. Other Ministries would promote
among pregnant women the use of services offered through this program.
Control of Laboratories and Blood Supply: This is another successful effort of the GOB over the
years, as reflected in less than 1% HIV cases due to blood transfusions. The QEH has maintained high
standards for laboratory quality control and blood bank screening for infectious diseases including HIV.
The project would support the continuation of this preventive program under the MH responsibility.
The Government Ministries and Offices would be responsible for implementing prevention activities on
HIV/AIDS for their client populations. They would each establish an HIV/AIDS Coordination Unit
responsible for designing and managing implementation of their respective programs. These units would
work closely with the PCU (NACHA's Director's Office) for developing specific interventions according
to target populations. The Ministry of Health would act as technical facilitator, when needed, to
NACHA's Director's Office (PCU) and to each Ministry's HIV/AIDS Coordination Unit. Also, joint
activities, when target populations are overlapping, would be developed by the Ministries.
During the first year of project implementation, each Ministry would implement two core national
program interventions designed jointly with NACHA: IEC, specifically addressed to behavioral change;
and condom distribution among different target groups. Other interventions specifically designed (with
NACHA support, when needed) for their target populations would be undertaken by each Ministry's
HIV/AIDS Unit according to their readiness for implementation. The target populations and key
prevention interventions to be undertaken by each Ministry agreed upon at the workshop were as follows:
Ministry of Health
*  General population: IEC for awareness and behavior changes on HIV/AIDS prevention and services;
*  sex workers and patients attending STI clinics: Behavior change communication, treatment, and
condom distribution;
*  general population: Voluntary counseling and Testing;
*  blood donors and recipients: Safe blood collection and transfusions;
*  laboratories: Quality control for HIV, 01, STI testing;
* pregnant women and newborn: Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission; and
*  Ministry HIV/AIDS Unit: Staff training for developing HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
In addition, the MH would be also responsible for diagnosis, treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients
and HIV/AIDS reporting and surveillance (third component).
Ministry of Home Affairs
*  General population: Policy, legislation and regulation of patient confidentiality, tattoo piercing,
disability legislation, and protection against discrimination of PLWHAs. Review of legislation on
homosexuality and prostitution with a view to protecting human rights;
* law professionals: IEC on HIlV/AIDS patient rights;
*  uniformed personnel: Behavior change communication on HIV/AIDS and condom distribution;



132
* staff of the Attorney General Office: Workshops on substance abuse reduction and prevention,
promotion of safer practices from abstinence to condom promotion, sexual education and life skills;
* youth groups: Promotion of "youth friendly centers" within existing structures;
* police officials: Bio safety at workplace; and
*  Ministry HIV/AIDS Unit: Staff training for developing HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs, and Culture
*  School children and university students: Incorporating sex education and HIV/AIDS education into
curricula;
*  school populations: Establishing peer sex and HIV/AIDS education for students;
* youth groups: Use of youth commissioners in community education;
*  artists and youth: Use major cultural activities and festivals for IEC, involving artists in the design

133
* parliamentarians, media people, churches, NGOs and private sector;
* production and dissemination of mass media campaigns using TV, radio, newspapers, letters, etc.,
with messages on prevention and services for HIV/AIDS. The objective being raising awareness and
support for Government efforts to prevent, control and treat HIV/AIDS among the Barbadians, and
promoting safe sexual behaviors.
As part of their implementation activities, Ministries may contract technical assistance and NGOs to assist
in reaching beyond traditional constituencies or hard-to-address populations to advance their respective
prevention. The PCU would pay services contracted and each Ministry would supervise and evaluate
products contracted. Direct involvement of PLWHAs in planning and implementation would be stressed.
For this, the NACHA would promote the organization of coalitions or groups of PLWHAs.
B. Component #2: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Care for HIV/AIDS-US$14.3 million
The second component of the project would scale up the diagnosis, treatment, and care for HIV/AlDS
patients in the island. As noted earlier, the GOB has already made a commitment to meet patients clinical
and emotional needs, reduce opportunistic infections, reduce work disability, and improve quality of life.
Under this component, the project would support scaling up the following interventions:
* Voluntary testing and counseling;
* laboratory strengthening;
* pharmacy strengthening;
* community and home care; and
* facilities for treatment of Ols and ART therapy for patients with AIDS;
These interventions are currently carried in a very limited extent through the QEH and MH polyclinics.
QEH has established an HIV/AIDS Management Team which has been operating since 1991. Private
health providers send their patients to this hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the
infrastructure assessment for HIV/AIDS patient management done during project preparation, Barbados
requires strengthening of present laboratory and health care facilities, trained staff, and improved
protocols and management information systems to ensure efficient and effective diagnosis, therapy and
follow up for HIV/AIDS patients. The bright spot is the transparent procurement and efficient
distribution of drugs through the BDS, a MH agency whose best practices have been acknowledged by
WHO.
Based on identified needs both from the demand and supply side on patient management, the project
would support the implementation of subcomponents discussed below.
a) Strengthening Voluntary Counseling and Confidential HIV Testing.  This service, when
implemented in a supportive environment, will improve people's willingness to access HIV testing
sites and services where they can receive appropriate pre and post-test counselling. This has been
evidenced in Barbados, where counseling and HIV testing were offered through local community
outreach efforts. Thus, the project would support: (i) upgrading eight polyclinics for accommodating
space, furniture and audio visual equipment required for counselling and testing; (ii) relocation of the
AIDS Management Team to a temporary space at the refurbished old PNUD building, and then to the
new AIDS Reference Unit (see below), where a counseling clinic would be set up, including
furniture, equipment, and two staff. (iii) Training of 50 HIV/AIDS counsellors of which, eight would
be located at the upgraded polyclinics, two at the counselling clinic of the AIDS Reference Unit, and
the remaining 40 located at other Ministries and community organizations involved in HIV/AIDS
prevention programs.



134
b) Strengthening laboratory capacity. Provision of ART has significant repercussions in lab capacity
for testing and follow up of patients under treatment. HIV testing (ELISA) is currently available, and
staff is adequately trained to perform this test; CD4 can be performed only once a week at the QEH
laboratory. Viral load tests are not available and test samples are processed outside the country at
US$300 per test. Clinical decisions on therapy and patient follow up require CD4 and Viral Load
testing on a permanent basis. The Government has made arrangements with providers for installing
the equipment (flow cytometer for CD4, and a viral load rented machine and reagents for viral load
testing) and training four to five lab technicians for performing the tests. Recently, the QEH
laboratory hired a high level trained medical laboratory professional who would greatly improve
management and quality testing. The AIDS Management Team has estimated that about 5000 CD4
tests and 7500 viral load tests per year would be required when they reach 1250 HIV/AIDS patients
(the currently total detected number) for treatment. This patient load would be reached possibly in
the fourth or fifth year of project implementation. Also, supplementary investments in remodeling
space, laboratory technicians, air conditioning, safety hoods, and testing equipment and reagents will
be required to strengthen present lab capacity for early diagnosis of Ols, especially for MAI complex,
PCP, and Cryptococcus.
c) Pharmacy strengthening. ART drug procurement, storage, distribution and dispensing is well
organised. Eight local wholesalers representing close to 250 international drug companies and local
drug laboratory, participate in the bidding. The local suppliers are responsible for drug storage and
inventory availability, as well as monthly distribution as demanded by public pharmacies and
hospitals according to written authorization provided by the Barbados Drug Service. This mechanism
provides efficient cash flow, reduces storage costs and prevents expiration and obsolescence of drugs.
At present, the pharmacy has available seven out of 11 anti-retroviral drugs procured last year: two
protease inhibitors, three nucleoside analogues and two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. The choice of the HIV/AIDS Management Team for ART therapeutic regimens is a triple
combination of two non-nucleoside reverse transcripatase inhibitors (efavirenz and niverapine) or two
nucleoside analogues (zidovudine, lamiduvine or zidovudine/lamiduvine) with one protease inhibitor
(Indinavir or Nelfinavir). Criteria for using these combinations are based on literature reports, drugs
available, and cost (see Annex 13.9, Table A9-3). The Team preferences for ARV combinations can
make cost of ART range from US$1,317 to US$9,240 per year. In 2000, the team provided testing,
counseling and support services to 350 HIV persons with advanced symptoms and has managed up to
15 AIDS patients with ART.
The project would support the BDS conversations with UNAIDS to seek agreements with providers
for lowering cost ART drugs through the UNAIDS Drug Access Initiative. In order to provide a
supportive environment for the utilization of ART, the project would upgrade some aspects of current
pharmacy services: space would be provided for a satellite pharmacy in the HIV/AIDS Reference
Centre, outside Queen Elizabeth Hospital. This would facilitate swift dispensing practices, increase
patient compliance, improve patient education and permit better tracking and accountability within
the pharmacy service. In addition, a program to monitor drug quality, safety and efficacy would be
instituted to ensure that reduced drug cost does not imply reduced quality.
Disbursing against ART by the project would be initiated after the proposed infrastructure has been
completed satisfactorily, and staffing and training contemplated under this component is found
satisfactory.
d) Strengthening infrastructure for community health services. Many HIV/AIDS patients and those
with opportunistic illnesses can be cared for in a home setting, if provided proper support and
community back up from local clinics (polyclinics). In addition to upgrading the eight polyclinics
(see above), the project would provide training for a core of 40 health workers from the eight
polyclinics and NGO volunteers on the WHO model of Continuum AIDS Care and how to utilize
available resources for such care. The caring doctor and the core health workers would interact with



135
the NGOs located near the patient's home in order to provide clinical follow up, education for the
patient and family members, moral and psychosocial support, and referrals whenever necessary.
Particular attention would be given to education on the importance of compliance vis a vis resistance,
meaning of CD4 and viral ]oad counts.
e) Expanding the infrastructure for 01 treatment and introduction of ART. The project would
support: (i) the refurbishing and remodeling of the old nursing building, where the HIV/AIDS
Reference Unit would function as the state-of-the-art site for clinical treatment and patient
monitoring; (ii) strengthening laboratory capabilities (see b above); (iii) improving pharmacy services
(see above) to speed up drug delivery, improve drug tracking and accountability; and (iv) upgrading
in-house information management technology for improved HIV/AIDS surveillance (see component
3). The project would also support civil works for providing additional space and facilities for the
enhancement of treatment and care including: (i) two drop in centers for psychosocial support for
PLWHAs to be located near easy access routes; (ii) an AIDS Food Bank to facilitate nutritional
support, education, counseling and to provide cooked meals; and (iii) a hostel care facility and its
operation of up to 20 beds. The project would also support the construction, operation and staffing of
a 10-20 bed hospice unit for PLWHAs. Civil works for adapting temporary facilities for care and
treatment of HIV/AIDS patients has begun and permanent facilities will be ready by the end of 2001,
except the site for the HIV/AIDS Reference Center, which would be started later this year. Finally,
although introducing ART will not substantially increase the volume and types of medical waste,
GOB will provide technical assistance for reviewing the legal framework governing medical waste
handling and disposal, upgrading the coding for handling of medical waste of different types and
sources, updating the manual for the handling and disposal of medical waste at the QEH, training of
personnel for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste, and if deemed necessary, financing
for the repairing or the replacement of the incinerator at the QEH. In addition, the loan would finance
a study to assess improved alternatives for medical waste disposal in Barbados, and said study shall
include the carrying out of a fully consultative environmental assessment of any alternatives the study
might recommend. Such alternatives may be carried out only in compliance with the environmental
mitigation measures identified by said assessment.
Criteria for patient enrollment and follow up (see Annex 13.1 1): QEH HIV/AIDS Management Team
has set the following criteria for patient enrollment: (i) a valid Barbados ID card; (ii) a CD4 count of 350
cells/mm3 or less; and (iii) a valid prescription by the HIV/AIDS clinic director (for adults) or the Head
of Pediatrics (for children). Follow up of patients includes: CD4 count every three months (four
times/year) and Viral Load every three to four months (three to four times/year), in addition to periodic
clinical evaluations. Monitoring and evaluation of ART would be carried out by the treating doctor who
would track: (i) toxicity experienced by patients; (ii) clinical improvement of symptoms and signs and
general status of the patient; and (iii) virologic response as measured by viral load counts. Low
compliance would be addressed through strong education campaigns carried out by treating doctors,
counselors, health workers, and voluntary organizations working close to patients home. The project
would support periodic seminars for updating patient enrollment and treatment follow up according to
new findings published in scientific journals. The project would not contemplate subsides, but would
channel patients in need to government welfare programs.
C. Component #3: Management and Institutional Strengthening-US$3.5 million
The third component of the project would support sustainable institutional structure and management that
will allow Barbados to effectively control, prevent, and care for HIV/AIDS over the long term. This
would be accomplished by providing the necessary leadership, advisory services, staffing, goods, and
general operating costs of the institutions discussed below.
The National Commission on HIV/AIDS (NACHA)
The existing National Advisory Committee on AIDS has been reformulated into a National Commission



136
on HIV/AIDS (NACHA) with executive powers, under the Prime minister's Office. In addition to
having a Chairperson and an Executive Director's Office, NACHA would be formed with representatives
from the private sector, the church, the youth organization, the media, the trade unions, NGOs, the people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs), and the Director of the AIDS Management Team of the QEH.
NACHA would do the following:
*  Advise government on HIV/AIDS policy;
*  advocate and promote active involvement of all sectors and organizations in implementing HIV/AIDS
activities and create partnerships to broaden the national response to HIV/AIDS;
* mobilize resources, internationally and locally;
*  coordinate and support implementation of HIV/AIDS interventions with the 10 Ministries involved;
*  execute, monitor, and evaluate the proposed project; and
*  be ultimately accountable to the public for the successful implementation of the project.
NACHA chairperson would be a recognized public leader in Barbados, capable of mobilizing public
action and managing controversy. He would be selected by the Prime Minister and serve on a full - time
paid basis. The Executive Director would be appointed by the prime Minister at the level of a permanent
secretary of the government and would have legal status allowing him/her to receive funds from donor
agencies, be audited by independent auditors, and establish contracts, and disburse public monies.
The Executive Director's Office would function as the Secretariat of NACHA and would be responsible
for project implementation, that is, it would become the Project Management Unit PCIJ. Terms of
reference for the NACHA staff who would function as the PCU would be presented and agreed upon at
appraisal. Salaries of key staff and operating costs of the Office would be covered by the project.
The Office would be staffed by the Executive Director, assisted by a Deputy Director, an Assistant
Director and a Financial Officer. Collectively, they would be responsible for programs in prevention
(including education, training and research); policy development, planning and monitoring and
evaluation; financial management; and procurement management. These key personnel would have
specific terms of reference and accountabilities to be contained in a program operations manual, and
qualifications and experience agreed with the WB. The senior staff of the MH charged with managing
treatment and care would be considered as an adjunct staff of the Office.
The terms of reference for the NACHA Director Office would include the following responsibilities:
*  Develop and coordinate the implementation of the project through various Ministries and partners in
the private sector, NGOs and community groups;
*  advise on budgetary allocations and report on the financial performance of Ministries [and partners]
in relation to HIV/AIDS;
*  manage the distribution of funds from donor agencies across various sectors, Ministries and NGOs;
*  monitor and evaluate the performance and results of actions implemented by Ministries and partners;
*  follow up on initiatives taken by the Commission, and prepare such reports and documentation in
collaboration with Ministries and partners that the Commission may require; and
*  advise the Inter-ministerial Committee and the Commission on the formulation of national programs
and policy for HIV/AIDS management.
HIV/AIDS Prevention Units in Key Ministries
Eight Ministries and the Government Information Services would form a core management group each, to



137
be responsible for implementing HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities within their target
populations. Each Ministry would identify a full time coordinator, and an office for this function within
its staff and office space. A management committee comprising the Minister, Permanent Secretary, and
relevant representatives of the Ministry's target populations, including PLWHAs, would advise and
support each HIV/AIDS Prevention Unit.
Essentially, each Ministry would implement two core national program interventions designed jointly
with NACHA: IEC, and condom distribution, and others specifically designed (NACHA will support,
when needed) for their target populations (see Component #2). The Government has already authorized
to include a line item for HIV/AIDS activities in each Ministry's budget. The Ministries that would
participate in the project are the MH; Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs, and Culture; Ministry of
Social Transformation; Ministry of Home Affairs; Ministry of Tourism; Ministry of Labor, Sports and
Public Sector Reform; and the Govemment Information Service.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Research
a) Project monitoring and evaluation. The GOB blueprint for the HIV/AIDS 2001-2006 Action Plan,
calls for the upgrade of the present system and incorporates "CAREC recommendations for improved
surveillance and monitoring of the epidemic". The expected upgrade of the surveillance system
includes also the updating of the HIV-AIDS information system for monitoring and evaluating the
project.
Current biological, behavioral, and HIV-AIDS case surveillance information should include protocol-
based HIV sentinel surveillance on vulnerable groups as a complement to monitoring voluntary
testing and counseling, and the integration of STI databases in the HIV-AIDS-STI surveillance
system. The standard data and criteria for the HIV-AIDS information system would include:
o  Biological indicators: HIV prevalence, STI prevalence, TB prevalence, 01 cases, HIV and AIDS
cases;
o  behavioral indicators: age at first sex; age of partner at first sex; bisexual or homosexual contact
in lifetime; number of sex partners in last 12 months; number of sex partners in lifetime;
o  condom use in last 12 months; condom use in last sexual intercourse with non-regular partner;
o  perception of being at risk of HIV/AIDS; ever gave or received money, things or drugs for sex;
ever used crack/ cocaine;
o  socio-demographic indicators: age, sex, socio-economic and educational status, residency and
migration status, marital status;
o  data sources, particularly MH, Queen Elizabeth Hospital laboratory and blood bank, private and
public polyclinics and hospitals, and NGOs;
o  standard coding definitions for patient identification (personal ID code, restricted access to
patient name, ID card), diagnosis (ICD10), procedures (medical, laboratory tests, blood bank,
diagnostic imaging, hospital, others);
o  classification of vulnerable subgroups;
o  data validation and cross-analysis from HIV-AIDS case notification system  and sentinel
surveillance systems;
o  security and confidentiality of HIV-AIDS-STI databases and research studies, electronic transfer
protocols, encrypted double key, access control, electronic trail and auditing, compliance
monitoring and quality control procedures; and
o  interface with the drug supply system.



138
The project will support the MH implementation of standardized protocols for behavioral and
biological surveillance with the assistance of the Chronic Disease Research Center (CDRC) from the
University of West Indies (UWI) and CAREC. CAREC will also assist the Ministry of Health
providing technical support towards the strengthening of the STI/HIV/AIDS information system,
programming and execution of surveys. Also, CAREC would assist in training of participating staff
in surveillance, HIV and STI diagnostics, behavioral sciences and research, mass media, strategic
planning, program management and NGO support. CAREC will be able to provide this support
through its own technical staff, through advisers of bilateral donor agencies (CIDA, GTZ, French
Cooperation, DFID), and through its network of regional experts.
The database design should provide access to online information on diagnostic and lab testing relative
to the management of opportunistic infections, anti-retroviral status, CD4 and viral load and applied
history and date-sensitive treatment, non compliance alert, as well as up to date information on drug
dispensation, online therapeutic protocols, adverse effects help, utilization and effects. To protect
patient's privacy rights as well as the integrity and confidentiality of the electronic medical records,
the selected application should include encrypting technology and double key facilities, restricting
access to name to authorized personnel only. Epidemiological studies and surveillance processes
should be based on coded data.
To provide up to date clinical and epidemiological information required for the HIV-AIDS-STI
surveillance and case management, the current manual HIV-AIDS clinical records system will be
computerized with project resources. The project would fund the technical assistance required for the
selection, acquisition, adaptation and implementation of clinical information systems focusing HIV-
AIDS case management and surveillance from applications available in the market. The system
should provide protocols to transfer and analyze data on mapping applications with geographical
reference. To ensure cost-effectiveness of the HIV-AIDS treatment and in particular ART, the
treating physicians will require among others, the systematization of clinical records to assure
compliance, prevent redundancy of treatment, monitor drug effects and efficacy, and to provide real
time online information for decision making.
The proposed platform should be scalable and compatible with Ministry of Health current platform
and the GOB Data Processing Department policies and standard specifications. Training to all users
should include the use of microcomputers and windows environment, office applications, and the use
of the HIV-AIDS-STI application in decision-making, surveillance analysis and monitoring and
evaluation. The availability of case studies with online help would provide computer based self-
tutoring. The terms of reference for the request for proposals, should include in addition to two years
of maintenance and upgrade of the software, the establishment of a help desk to support the users on a
day to day basis for the duration of the implementation and one year after, subject to contract
extension according to performance.
The terms of reference to be prepared for the request of proposals, should reflect the work to be
executed by the technical assistance for the design or acquisition, adaptation and implementation of
the information system for HIV-AIDS surveillance system. Also, terms of reference should include
in addition to two years of maintenance and upgrade of the software, the establishment of a help desk
to support the users on a day to day basis for the duration of the implementation and one year after,
subject to contract extension according to performance.
b) Hardware and software, data storage and servers location. The implementation of the HIV-AIDS
surveillance system would require to add, replace or upgrade current workstations and to acquire and
install servers, communication equipment and local area networks (LAN) to be linked with the wide
area network being implemented by the BDS. To protect confidentiality and secure the integrity of
the HIV-AIDS database, the server application and the server database should be located in an area
with restricted access and monitoring system in the MH. The intranet should be protected with virtual



139
private network (VPN) application to assure proper encryption, restricted access and confidentiality
of patient's electronic medical records. The implementation of the system will be staged according to
the demand and progress of the remodeling of the physical installations and the relocation of the
different units. Those units are the following:
o  AIDS Reference Center (3 servers, LAN and 5 workstations);
o  Queen Elizabeth Hospital Laboratory (I server, LAN and 4 workstations);
o  Public Health Laboratory - Sir Winston Scott P/C (I Server, LAN and two WS);
o  two selected Polyclinics (one server each, LAN and two workstations each);
o  Chief Medical Officer (one server, LAN and three workstations);
o  Chief Pediatrics (two workstations);
o  HIV-AIDS Surveillance Center (one server, LAN and four to workstations); and
o  National AIDS Commission (two servers, LAN and seven workstations).
The MH through the Project Implementation Unit, would develop the technical specifications
according to the protocols defined by the Barbados Data Processing Department, to be included in
bidding documents for the purchase and installation of the hardware and respective operational
software; structured wiring for local area networks (LAN); communication equipment (optical
equipment, routers, switches, hubs, multiplexes, paneling) and telephone systems for the wide area
network (WAN); and extended warranty for the repair and maintenance of the equipment for at least
three years.  The providers should be responsible for the installation of the equipment, the
configuration of the servers and operational system and the interconnection of the different
components of the wide area network, including the training of MH staff responsible for the day to
day technical support, in database administration and network operation and management.
c) Research. The scope of research activities would include the following:
o  Social and economic impact studies, particularly HIV/AIDS household impact and cost
effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and projected demand for
treatment;
o  situation analyses starting with baseline indicators for monitoring HIV/AIDS epidemic and
demographic trends, KAP studies for assessing knowledge, attitudes and practices in sexual
behaviors and attitudes towards PLWHAs;
o  needs assessment studies, including criteria and provision of anti-retroviral treatment, payment
capabilities, funding options, and service needs according to community groups and PLWHAs;
and
o research capacity building on HIV/AIDS, with local, regional and international collaboration and
support.
D. Staged Implementation
All project components would build up their activities, based on lessons learned as implementation
progresses. This recognizes that the effectiveness of many project activities, especially those that are
directed at changing behavior and attitudes is difficult to predict and that modifications in
implementation rates, scope and details would be necessary throughout the implementation period.
Annual progress reviews and a mid term review will be important project management tools and are
provided for in support to project management. The work plan for the first project year is attached to this
Annex.
Of particular concern is Barbados' ability to scale up the ART program that now serves about 15



140
patients, to one that serves the estimated population of about 1,250 confirmed AIDS cases in the medium
term (24 to 36 months). A significant scaling up of ART and the use of WB loan proceeds to support it
would be initiated after the proposed infrastructure has been completed, and staffing and training
contemplated under this component is found satisfactory (see Conditions and Annex 13.11 for the
criteria to be applied in making the determination of readiness). The progression of project actions
leading to the decision would be:
  Management Organization: Establishing and operating the PCU within NACHA's organization,
the Inter-Ministerial Committee and the HIV/AIDS Ministerial Units to ensure a sustainable
institutional structure and management for GOB's HIV/AIDS overall program (and project
implementation) and the reconfiguration of the AIDS Management Unit in the MH. This first stage
would be accomplished in the first 12-18 months of project implementation.
*  Preparation and Development of Prevention Programs:  The five key prevention programs
would be fully prepared including objectives, target populations, types of interventions, staffing, and
other inputs with their respective budget. Initiating the implementation of all of the five programs
would be expected at the beginning of the second project year.
*  Completion of Infrastructure for scaling up ART: Infrastructure to support an expanded ART
program would be completed when:
a) The civil works (refurbishing, remodeling, expansion of facilities) providing the required space
for voluntary counseling and testing, laboratory and pharmaceutical services, and home and
hospital care for HIV/AIDS patients are completed;
b) The laboratory equipment and staff training for HIV (ELISA test), opportunistic diseases, CD4
count and viral load testing is completed;
c) The procurement process for required quantities of ARV drugs has been clearly established;
d) Staffing and training for the HIV/AIDS Referral Center has been completed;
e) Review and updating of protocols for ART has been completed and found satisfactory, as well as
the updating of the manual for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste at the QEH
carried out; and
f) Financial feasibility and sustainability for further annual scaling up the number of patients under
ART treatment are achieved.
These steps should be completed in the first 20-24 months of the project.

ANNEX 13.3-B
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project
Medical Organization, Infrastructure and Waste Management in Barbados
This note includes:  (i) a description of the Barbados' Health Care System; (ii) a description of the
infrastructure currently available for ART; and (iii) analyses the implications of additional medical waste
produced by scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention and control into the system and present recommendations for
appropriate health-care waste management.
I. Organization of the Health Sector
Institutional Arrangements. The Government operates QEH, a large secondary and tertiary care facility, a
network of four district hospitals for geriatric care, a main geriatric institution, a mental health hospital and a
half-way house, two small rehabilitation institutions for the physically and mentally handicapped, an AIDS
hostel, a development center for disabled children and adolescents, and a nutrition center.
A nationwide network of eight polyclinics provides a wide range of preventive and curative services as well as
limited rehabilitative services. These polyclinics and four satellite stations provide traditional public health
services such as matemal and child health, family life development, communicable disease control,
community mental health, chronic disease programs; dental health, nutrition and general practice. These
services also cover environmental health, which includes food hygiene, mosquito and rodent control, building
development control, atmospheric and chemical pollution monitoring and control, monitoring and control of
water quality, monitoring and control of sewage disposal, solid waste disposal, the maintenance of cemeteries,
and the licensing and control of stray dogs.
The Government also operates the BDS, a WHO collaborating center, that controls the importation and
distribution of essential drugs in the country, thus ensuring that Barbadians receive affordable quality drugs
and pharmaceuticals.
The private sector is comprised of about 100 general practitioners operating singly or in multiple practice;
consultants (senior doctors working in government hospitals or polyclinics) also have private practices. There
is only one small private hospital in the country -- Bayview Hospital-- with fewer than 30 beds, representing
under 4% of the country's total acute bed capacity, Private sector health services and facilities also include 18
homes for long-term care, as well as pharmaceutical, laboratory, diagnostic, dental, psychiatric, and physical
therapy services.
Staff at all levels are well trained and continue to receive regular updates. All of the polyclinics are supplied
with the necessary equipment for the delivery of quality health care. There is a referral system between clinic,
hospital, and other support services.
The MH maintains autonomy over the health services. The decision on how money is to be spent lies within
the Ministry, but the Ministry of Finance appropriates the overall budgetary allocation. And while the GOB
exercises some independent control over health professionals with regard to health service legislation,
physicians and nurses maintain involvement in health policy dialogue through their own trade union.
In order to improve health, the health sector must work with other public sector agencies, the private sector,
civic organizations, community groups, and citizens. The MH, the private sector, and other government
ministries collaborate on several activities, such as the vector control education program, "World Health Day,"
"World Environmental Day", and "World AIDS Day".
Health Services Delivery. Health service delivery falls into the following seven program areas: primary
health care; 24-hour acute, secondary, tertiary and emergency care; mental health care; care for the elderly
including rehabilitation services; drug service; assessment services and rehabilitative care; and health
promotion. Primary health care services encompass maternal and child health; family life development,
including family planning and ophthalmic and dental care for schoolchildren; care for the disabled, pregnant



142
women, and the elderly; general medical care with clinics for hypertension, diabetes, and sexually transmitted
infections; nutrition; pharmaceutical services, and community mental health and environmental health care.
The Chief Medical Officer is responsible for all matters affecting public health and medical services on the
island, advising the MH on these matters, the Chief Medical Officer also plays an integral role in health
planning and health infrastructure development. Two Senior Medical Officers support the work of the Chief
Medical Officer, and a team approach is applied for each program area.
Each polyclinic is managed by a Medical Officer, who functions as a clinician and an administrator, heads a
team of clinical medical officers and public health nurses, and works closely with the Public Health
Inspectorate. Additional staff comprises pharmacists, community nutrition officers, dental officers, and other
ancillary personnel. An administrator, a clinician, support medical staff, and other ancillary staff similarly run
other institutions.
The major problem at the primary health care level is the shortage of staff resources, especially at the clinical
level. This results in longer waiting periods and the inability to offer services at some of the polyclinics after
4:30 p.m. and on weekends.
At the secondary care level, the Government operates the QEH, a 547-bed facility that offers 24-hour acute,
secondary, tertiary, and emergency care. The hospital houses more than 90% of the country's acute care beds;
clinical services include outpatient, emergency and inpatient care in surgery, medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics
and gynecology, pathology, radiology, radiotherapy, rehabilitation therapy, ophthalmology, and ear, nose, and
throat. The hospital's diagnostic equipment includes a CAT scan and ultrasound and modem radiotherapy
equipment. A cardiac catheterization unit was established in 1993, and by the end of 1996 had performed 50
open-heart surgeries and 242 cardiac catheterizations.
Mental health care is provided by the government run psychiatric hospital, which has 627 beds, and at the
eight-bed unit at QEH. The Psychiatric Hospital offers the following services: (i) acute psychiatric care,
including child and adolescent care; (ii) long-stay psycho-geriatric care; forensic psychiatric care for the
subnormal; and (iii) addiction services. Community mental health services include a district nursing service
that follows up persons who have been discharged from the hospital, and a primary community mental health
program offered from the polyclinics.
Health Regulatory Activities. The country has a comprehensive health legislation. The Health Services Act
and its regulations, which were enacted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, cover all areas that fall under the
jurisdiction of the MH and the Environment. The Ministry has undertaken to improve the legislation for
effective administration of the health services, the regulation of related public activity, and the services given
to the public. Among laws to be reviewed are: (i) the Dental Registration Act; (ii) regulations regarding
alternative medicine; (iii) food hygiene and restaurant regulations as they relate to street vending operations;
(iv) random testing of food-handlers; (v) the Mental Health Act and all related legislative instruments that
affect mental health, such as housing and the General Nursing Council Act, regarding the enforcement of the
regional examination and registration for nurses. In addition, (i) the solid waste management plan; (ii) the
regulation of private hospitals and nursing homes; (iii) regulation of organ donation and organ transplant; (iv)
the development of a national spill contingency plan, (v) registration of medical specialists; and (vi) the
establishment of criteria for general fitness to practice medicine will all be part of the review and reform
process.
Several pieces of legislation regulate the registration, licensing, and governance of health professionals
through the establishment of councils. There are councils for medical, dental, general nursing, pharmacy, and
paramedical professions. The last one, which encompasses such professions as physiotherapists, occupational
therapists, chiropractors, and laboratory technologists, may be amended to include nutritionists, acupuncturists,
and osteopaths.
Barbados has specific health regulations designed to control food safety, and public health inspectors who
issue licenses to all food establishments enforce these regulations. Currently, these regulations are under



143
review, so that food handlers will only be issued their annual licenses after undergoing several training
sessions. Legislation dealing with the licensing and control of the itinerant vendors also is being reviewed.
The well organized BDS, is Government owned and controls the importation and distribution of essential
drugs in the country, ensuring good access by Barbadians to affordable quality drugs and pharmaceuticals. It
has been selected as a WHO collaborating Center.
The private sector is well developed, with about 100 general practitioners operating singly or in multiple
practice, and consultants (senior doctors working in government hospitals or polyclinics) who also have
private practices. Private sector health services include a small 30 bed hospital (less than 4% of total acute
bed capacity in the country) and 18 homes for long-term care, as well as pharmaceutical, laboratory,
diagnostic, dental, psychiatric, and physical therapy services.
II. Infrastructure for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.
The proposed HIV/AIDS Management Prevention and Control project would provide the required
infrastructure to ensure appropriate scaling up of preventive and therapeutic activities for HIV/AIDS in
Barbados. This infrastructure would require the same routine and practices on asepsis and antisepsis carried
out at the QEH, and appropriate management of wastes from care of patients with HIV/AIDS.
Facilities. As the number of HIV/AIDS patients has increased continuously, space difficulties in the QEH
have become a quality issue for counselling, testing and monitoring of treatment. Hence, the proposed project
would shift some of these services to an adjacent government building, which would be remodelled and
adapted for: (i) Counselling Services; (ii) a Drop-In/Walk in Centre for psychosocial support of persons living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWA); and (iii) an HIV/AIDS Food Bank for nutritional education and preparation of food
for PLWA, presently located at the QEH. Also, construction is proposed of a 10-20 bed hospice and
expansion of a hostel to accommodate additional four to six beds for PLWA.
Present overcrowding difficulties of the QEH laboratory facility would be solved by expanding and
refurbishing its plant, thus ensuring appropriate space for processing laboratory tests for opportunistic
infections, HIV testing and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy.
Other space needs to be met by the project are: (i) facilities for pre and post-test counselling and testing at
eight Polyclinics through rehabilitation or expansion of present facilities; and (ii) space for the AIDS
Management Team, which would be temporarily relocated to an adjacent government building and eventually
to the AIDS Reference Unit which would be located at an old nursing building close to the QEH, which would
be refurbished and adapted by the project. This 30 bed AIDS Reference Unit would be state of the art for
managing HIV/AIDS patients both in ambulatory and hospital settings.
Logistics for drug supply and monitoring and evaluation of antiretroviral therapy would be strengthened
through the BDS, training of health care staff, and improvement of the surveillance and information system.
Home Care Program for HIV/AIDS. The NACA has proposed a Home Care Program which would promote
a continuum of care, integrating institutional, community and home-based care. This Program would be run
by trained staff to provide care with respect, dignity, sensitivity and confidentiality to HIV/AIDS patients.
III. Management of Medical Wastes related to HIV/AHDS Projects
Health care activities such as immunizations, laboratory tests, medical treatments, and surgical procedures
generate wastes and by-products which require special handling. From the total wastes generated by health-
care activities, almost 80% are general waste comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 20% is considered
hazardous materials that may be infectious, toxic or radioactive.
Infectious and anatomic wastes represent about 15% of total waste in health care activities. Infectious wastes
come from laboratory cultures and batches of infectious agents, wastes from infected patients, wastes



144
contaminated with blood and its derivatives, discarded diagnostic samples, infected animals from laboratories,
and contaminated materials (swabs, needles, bandages) and equipment (disposable medical devices etc.).
Hazardous sharp wastes such as:  (i) syringes, disposable scalpels and blades represent about 1%; (ii)
chemicals and pharmaceuticals amount to about 3%; and genotoxic waste such as radioactive matter and
heavy metal content represent about 1%.
High-income countries can generate up to 6 kg of hazardous waste per person per year, whereas most low-
income countries may produce between 0.5 to 3 kg. The problem is not so much the volume but lack of
appropriate handling of wastes, which in many cases, are not separated into hazardous and non-hazardous
waste.
Risks. Health care wastes can cause infections, injury, poisoning, and pollution. The groups at risk in order of
importance are hospital patients, health workers, and the general population. Worldwide, re-use of syringe
needles without sterilization may cause 8-16 million hepatitis B; 2 - 4.7 million hepatitis C and 80, 000 to
160, 000 HIV infections, each year.
Land filling can potentially result in contamination of drinking water. Inadequate incineration, or incineration
of materials unsuitable for incineration can result in the release of pollutants into the air. For instance,
incineration of materials containing chlorine can release dioxins and furans, which are possible human
carcinogens. Dioxins, furans and metals are persistent and accumulate in the environment. Only modern
incinerators working at 800-1000 C, with special emission-cleaning equipment, can ensure that no dioxins
and furans (or only insignificant amounts) are produced.
Perceived risks by the general public related to health-care waste management may be significant and can
become a sensitive and ethical issue.
Waste Management. Many countries do not have appropriate regulations on health-care waste management,
or do not enforce them. The absence of waste management, lack of awareness about the health hazards,
insufficient financial and human resources and poor control of waste disposal are the most common problems
connected with health-care wastes. An essential issue is the clear attribution of responsibility of appropriate
handling and disposal of waste. According to the 'polluter pays' principle, this responsibility lies with the
waste producer, usually being the health-care provider, or the facility involved in related activities.
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project in Barbados
Health-care waste management is important for ensuring safe quality care to patients and a safe environment to
health workers and the general public. Wastes caused by HIV/AIDS prevention and care of patients represent
a very small fraction in terms of quantity and quality to current wastes in the health care system of Barbados.
This can be confirmned by examining what is done in delivering services in ambulatory and hospital settings to
a typical user of the HIV/AIDS program: initially, he/she is interviewed and tested. If positive, he/she will be
entered into different protocols according to the stage of the infection, for management and care in ambulatory
or hospital services. About two or three in 10 would need hospitalization. Surgical procedures are similar to
those in other infected patients, that is, routines in asepsis and antisepsis are carefully enforced.
Ambulatory and hospital care for an HIV/AIDS patient requires the same asepsis and antisepsis routines for
handling other infected patients such as: (i) those with hepatitis B or C; (ii) Polio; (iii) diphtheria; (iv)
septicemias from different germs, etc. For practical purposes, management of used goods from handling
HIV/AIDS patients will not have different treatment than those already established for ambulatory and hospital
settings dealing with infected patients.
As described below, the QEH has appropriate practices and institutional capabilities for managing hospital



145
infections. Measures to protect and prevent iatrogenic or hospital infections such as hepatitis B or C, are well
established in hospital practices and are similar to those required in the management of HIV/AIDS infections.
A possible beneficial effect would be improved compliance and practices in the management of biological,
pharmaceutical, pathological and potentially infectious waste. Likewise, improved surgical practices in
operating rooms, and more appropriate use of intravenous therapy may result from scaling up HIVIAIDS
diagnosis and care, due to refreshing courses in better asepsis and antisepsis and apprehension that may exist
in some health workers.
No new technology for managing health care wastes is needed due to introducing or scaling up HIV/AIDS
care.
Management of Hospital Waste in Barbados' QEH.
There are some waste management measures well established as part of the operation of the hospital to prevent
risks and exposure to hazardous health-care waste.  However, such measures although sufficient, could
benefit for improvement.
Wastes in the QEH are classified under three categories:
*  Regular waste: solid and liquid wastes, which are similar to domestic related residues. The solid generated
wastes are collected according to a pre-deterrnined schedule among the ordinary-municipal-waste
collection system. As all domestic wastes, they are disposed at the sanitary landfill of the island. The
liquid waste is collected and discharged to the Bridgetown sewer system.;
*  radioactive waste, usually generated from Cancer Treatment Machines and other Radioactive based-
operated equipment are handled by the representatives of respective manufactures who are responsible for
their handling, collection and their shipment outside of the island;
*  hazardous wastes include all hazardous health-care generated waste. This category includes:
a)  used items as sharps, needles, syringes;
b)  anatomical and pathological residues;
c)  waste contaminated with human blood, fluid, excreta,;
d)  chemicals and pharmaceutical wastes; and
e)  discarded containers e.g. bottles, cans, boxes etc.
Those wastes are disposed and burned at the hospital incinerator. The ashes are then transported to the
sanitary landfill of the island.
The Infection Control Department of the QEH exercises the control and handling of all health-care-generated
wastes in the hospital. This department has also established a set of rules for handling health-care wastes. All
waste classified as hazardous are disposed in special plastic containers. When filled, those containers are
sealed by trained nurses and transported to the incinerator site for burning and disposal.
Several clinics, other hospitals and laboratories use the incinerators of the QEH. In the island, there are two
other incinerators operational in addition of the incinerator at the QEH: one is at the Sea port, and the other
one is at the airport.
There is not a coding system for the categorization of different type of hazardous waste. There is no special
marking obligation, at the exception of the wastes coming from outside clinics which come with markings of
point of origin, type of waste and date of generation.
The QEH has a single-chamber incinerator, which, under good condition, reach 15000 F as burning
temperature. Its capacity is 500 pounds an hour. According to the hospital operator, the technology is old and



146
it constantly needs repairs. The pollution from the exhaust of tfie incinerator has been cause of complaints by
the neighboring residents of the hospitals.
The hospital management is well aware of the need to update its waste management program for the hospital.
The Barbados's legislation is very silent with regards to management of hospital waste management. In the
Health Services Act of 1989, there are three pages dealing with health-care wastes under the Health Services
(Nuisances) Regulations. These recommendations found in the regulations here attached are generally vague
and not specific to hospital waste disposal measures. As a result, the QEH and the other health care facilities:
clinics, polyclinics, health centers are operated outside of any legal frame work with regards to health care
waste disposal.
Recommendations.
Therefore, in agreement with the Engineering Division of the MH and the management of the QEH, several
actions have been proposed to improve the conditions of healthcare waste management in Barbados. These
include:
I. Technical assistance to review the overall framework of health-care waste management in Barbados.
2. Technical assistance to QEH to upgrade the Standard Operation Procedures for hospital waste handling
and disposal.
3. Technical assistance to conduct a study of hospital waste categorization that covers all health facilities in
the island.
4. Technical assistance to conduct a study to assess improved alternatives for medical waste disposal in
Barbados. Said study shall include the carrying out of a fully consultative environmental assessment of any
alternatives the study might recommend. Such alternatives may be carried out only in compliance with the
environmental mitigation measures identified by said assessment.

ANNEX 13.6
Barbados HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project Prevention and Control Project
Benefits and Cost Analysis Summary
A. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Summary of Benefits and Costs
The cost of the program runs at $23.5 million over a five year period and the proposed objectives are to
reduce the rate of newly reported cases by half and to increase the life expectancy of PLWHAs by three
or more years. About US$14.3 million are earmarked for diagnostic and treatment activities, of which
US$4.5 million are destined for the purchase of anti-retroviral drugs. Some $8.8 million are destined to
support a variety of prevention and institutional development initiatives. The analysis below bears on the
project exclusive of anti-retroviral drugs component. Anti-retroviral drugs will be introduced in the
program in a gradual fashion subject to an evaluation of the country's institutional and financial readiness.
The evaluation criteria and the steps towards the gradual introduction of anti-retroviral drugs are
described in Annexes 13.9 and 13.10.
Hypothetical scenarios of the evolution of HIV/AIDS prevalence and incidence were constructed: (i)
under the assumption of a 50% reduction in HIV incidence over project lifetime, and (ii) under the
counterfactual assumption of a constant HIV incidence. The difference between these two scenarios then
yields the number of HIV infections prevented due to the project. Table A.13.6-1 presents a scenario
where incidence decreases linearly to half its original value over a five-year period. Table A13.6-2 shows
what would have happened if the incidence rate had stayed at its initial level.
The following additional assumptions are made: (i) the natural population growth rate is 0.4%; (ii)
incidence is taken to be 498.1 per million in year 0; (iii) the number of deaths due to AIDS in year t is
calculated as 7.26% of prevalence in year t-1; and (iv) prevalence in year t is equal to prevalence in year
t-I + incidence in year t - AIDS deaths in year t.

From tables A.13. 6-1 and A.13.6-2, the number of infections averted due to the project can be derived.
In turn, it is possible to obtain rough estimates of the productivity losses and cost of treatment thus
averted with the use of the following parameters: (i) on average, averting HIV infection 'buys' an
individual 10 more years of productive life; (ii) average annual productivity is valued at 1999 GDP per



154
capita (US$8,620); (iii) a patient who gets infected will live for 10 years with adequate care; (iv) the
average annual cost of care per patient is US$1,3807; (v) the consumption benefits of a lower HIV
prevalence are not factored in; and (f) the stream of benefits is supposed to last 12 years after project
closing.

The valuation of productivity losses obviously is a lower bound on the value of lives lost to the disease.
The rates of return associated with the project were calculated using the assumptions discussed above and
are shown in table A.13.6-4 below.

Productivity valuation         $8,620 per year      $1,805 per year
In addition, if the stream of costs stays the same but the stream of benefits is delayed by one year, then the
rate of return drops to 38%, and if the stream of benefits is delayed by two years, the IRR drops to 29%.
The returns to the project are therefore robust to significant negative biases against project feasibility.
The economic analysis above was conducted on the non-ARV part of the project. Annex 13.1 1 discusses
the further analyses that will be conducted during the early stages of project implementation to ensure that
This is calculated as $210 + 3 x current health spending per capita ($58), which mirrors the hypothesis made in the cost
estimation exercise for the Caribbean as a whole (see Caribbean HIV/AIDS Control APL PAD).
Because of discounting, the present value of the benefits tapers off rapidly over time.



155
the purchase of ARV drugs is economically desirable, equitable and sustainable. The critical issues will
be whether ARV crowds out other programs and whether the country is able to shoulder the incremental
recurrent costs upon project closing. At the current market price of $10,000 per patient per year,
providing ARV to 1,300 patients costs $13,000,000 or 13% of total public health spending. If the prices
go down to $2,000 per patient per year, the incremental recurrent spending on drugs represents 3% of
total public health spending, and if prices are at $1,000, then the additional financial burden of providing
ARV is only 1.3% of public spending in health (exclusive of the fiscal impact of prolonged longevity).
2. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Once it is decided that a set of interventions warrants public intervention in the form of financing,
provision, regulation or mandate, then infonnation about cost-effectiveness is useful to determine to
prioritize among those interventions.9       Table A.13.6-6 below, adapted from  Jha et al. (2001)10
summarizes ranges of values from the literature relating to the cost-effectiveness of some of the most
frequent interventions in HIV/AIDS prevention.
Table A.13.6-6: Cost-Effectiveness Ratios for Different Groups of Interventions
Sex worker         STI        Voluntary           Anti-           [EC to           Anti-

DALY saved                                           17.78                                             $2,355
The proposed project gives clear financing priority to those interventions that are most cost-effective
(especially interventions targeted at sex worker and other high-risk groups such as the military, the police,
prisoners and sugar-cane workers-see Annexes 13.2 and 13.3). As such, it is expected to achieve
maximum impact in reducing the spread of the epidemic. The project priorities are also closely aligned
with those suggested by Ainsworth et al. (2000).13
Eighty-six Vercent of the project corresponds to the categories identified in the above table. If the
parameters' in the table above apply to Barbados"5, then it can be shown that the cost-effectiveness of the
components of the project which support interventions of known cost-effectiveness ratios is $22.58 per
(DALY) saved. The overall cost-effectiveness of the project is extremely sensitive to the distribution of
resources among the above series of interventions: if the project neglects to allocate adequate amounts
9 There is an ongoing debate about the use of cost-effectiveness to guide public financing decisions. Public financing decisions
should be made on the basis of market failure arguments. Jack (see footnote 1) suggests that the correct approach to public
financing decisions would be to carry out a full cost-benefit analysis to include the external benefits and the costs of raising
public revenues. Hammer (in Hammer, J., (1997) 'Prices versus protocols in public health care' World Bank Economic Review,
11 (3)) also argues against the use of cost-effectiveness in guiding public finance decisions on the grounds that if there is private
demand for an intervention, then publicly-subsidized provision substitutes for private demand so that the net health effect is
typically smaller than in the absence of public demand. Cost-effectiveness is not used here to guide public financing decisions
but to order the interventions once it has been decided that they should benefit from some form of public intervention.

to prevent mother-to-child transmission as interventions of known effectiveness in preventing HIV infection and AIDS.

for sex worker interventions, STI management, and voluntary counseling and testing, this translates into a
low cost-effective ratio.
The project will enable the collection of relevant cost and effectiveness data to enable the periodic
calculation of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions being supported and allow policymakers to
update the national strategy to combat the spread of the epidemic.

Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements
I. Procurement
Procurement Guidelines
1. Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995 (revised
January/August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised in
September 1999 and January 1999), and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
2. Barbados' own tendering laws will be used for procurement of activities under Government
budgetary funds. They establish three general processes, related to the expected size of the contract
as follows:
a) Contracts under BDS$ 20,000 (US$ 10,000): purchase made on the basis of price quotations from
local suppliers; approved by the Ministry Permanent Secretary and executed by the Ministry
Financial Officer;
b) Contracts of between BDS$ 20,000-BDS$ 100,000 (US$10,000-US$50,000): price quotations
invited through local media, evaluated by a ministry tendering committee (optional) advising the
Permanent Secretary and Financial Officer, with contracting concluded by the Solicitor General's
Department; ex post; and
c) Contracts over BDS$ 100,000 (US$50,000): tendering managed by the contracting ministry,
following a process similar to the World Bank concept of "National Competitive Bidding", with
contracting concluded by the Solicitor General's Department, which is consulted ex ante.
Procurement Responsibility
Procurement responsibilities will be divided between the PCU and the MH, which has the bulk of
procurement to be performed. The Office of the Director (also the PCU) which serves as the Secretariat
for the National Commission on AIDS (NACHA), and is located in the Prime Minister's Office will
supervise and maintain consolidated account of the project's procurement. It will also perform the
procurement activities for the ministries other than the Ministry of Health, participating in the Project.
The PCU will employ a procurement-competent Financial Officer for these purposes. Individual
participating ministries would have their own line-item budgets to support their individual HlV/AIDS
management activities and would follow government tendering rules in deploying Government funds.
However, in most cases, ministries will also use loan proceeds to complement existing funding, and, in
these cases, they would follow World Bank guidelines for the entire amount. When the cost of an activity
to be financed exceeds the ministry "vote", it would agree with the PCU on cost sharing and the PCU
would procure the goods and services to be financed by loan proceeds.
In the case of the Ministry of Health, the HIV/AIDS Program Unit would procure all of its project-related
needs and use loan proceeds as required to complement its "vote". It would maintain its own records, but
assure that the PCU was fully informed. In the specialized area of drug purchases, including the eventual
purchase of project-financed ARV drugs, the BDS would manage the process. Established in 1980 by the
MH, the BDS has implemented best practice procedures supported by appropriate information systems.
The World Health Organization recognized the good performance of the BDS by selecting it as a
collaborating center for drug supply management. The drug purchasing process is designed to ensure the
availability of drugs for a yearly contracted period (July-June). Once tendering documents are prepared, a
bidding notice is posted in the two principal newspapers in the country. The bidding process beginning in



159
November provides a competitive mechanism to purchase the required quality specifications and
acceptable past performance at the lower bidders. Eight local wholesalers representing close to 250
international drug companies and local drug laboratory, participate in the bidding.
The BDS has direct management responsibilities for 13 of the public pharnacies located in the
polyclinics and district hospitals. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Psychiatric Hospital are supplied
with drugs by the BDS on a semi-decentralized scheme. The public pharmacies and most of the country's
private pharmacies (close to 80) participate in the distribution and dispensing of drugs. The BDS
provides a negotiated mark-up with private pharmacies, assuring immediate access and availability to MH
patients. The BDS's computerized supply system provides for the purchasing, patient benefit verification,
private pharmacy reimbursement, inventory control and point of service dispensing.
Procurement methods
A procurement plan will be prepared along with the annual work plan. The procurement plan for each
year would be submitted by the PCU to the WB for approval, not later than December of the prior year
(Barbados operates on an April-March budget and fiscal year) following a standard format which would
list as a minimum: (i) goods and services to be procured for the year, (ii) their value; (iii) the method of
procurement; and (iv) the timetable for carrying out the procurement. At the time of approving the annual
work plan, the WB would agree on the appropriate methods of procurement to be used in each package.
If needed, the plan could be revised and re-submitted. A format for a typical plan would be agreed at the
negotiation of the Program. An indicative procurement plan for the first year has been agreed at
appraisal and finalized prior to loan approval.
The methods to be used for the procurement described below, and the estimated amounts for each
method, are summarized in Tables A.13.8-1 and A.13.8-2. The threshold contract values for the use of
each method are fixed in Table A.13.8-3. Both, methods and thresholds will be reviewed and adjusted
annually, if necessary when the new plan is presented to the Bank.
Procurement of Works. Works procured under this Project will include the remodeling and refurbishing
of the PCU offices, establishing a new site for the AIDS Management Team, remodeling of existing
government properties to house a drip-in center, AIDS food bank, polyclinics, some laboratory facilities,
counseling services, and for new construction of a 10-20 bed hospice, and extended hostel
accommodation. The project would also finance works associated with the upgrading of incinerator
facilities and waste management. Total cost is expected to reach US$1.6 million and various lots would
be procured under NCB.
Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this Project will include general medicines, condoms,
computers, surveillance network and office equipment, and educational and campaign publications,
laboratory equipment and testing reagents for an aggregate amount of $6,367,000. In addition, while the
Bank agrees in principle to finance the procurement of ARV drugs, a final decision would await a full
analysis of Barbados' progress in preparing the necessary infrastructure, staff skills and surveillance
systems. If agreed, an amount to about US$4,482.,000 is envisaged for procurement of ARV drugs from
suppliers according to registered brand marks. Procurement would thus be carried out under "sole
source".
To the extent possible, contracts for goods will be grouped into bidding packages of more than $250,000
equivalent and procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, using Bank-
issued Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs). Contracts (other than anti-retroviral drugs) with estimated
values below this threshold per contract may be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures up to an aggregate amount of $400,000 equivalent, using standard bidding documents agreed
in advance with the Bank. Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped into larger bidding packages and
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract may be procured using shopping (National
/International) procedures, up to an aggregate amount of US485.000 based on at least three quotations



160
received in response to a model request for quotations which will include detailed technical
specifications, required delivery date, guarantees and conditions and a basic form of agreement
satisfactory to the Bank
Selection of Consultants. Consulting services will be contracted under this Program in the following
areas of expertise: HIV/AIDS Education and Prevention Campaigns, Investigation, Studies, Technical
Assistance and Training, Monitoring and Impact Evaluation, Implementation of part of the Program
through NGOs, Auditing, Development and maintenance of information and statistical Databases, and
participation in National and International Congresses and Workshops. These services are estimated to
cost US$3.5 million equivalent and would be procured using Bank Standard Request for Proposals.
Firms. Contracts for firms would be selected using QCBS. Small and simple contracts estimated to cost
of less than US$100,000 for an aggregate amount of US$1.0 equivalent would be selected using Least
Cost Selection (LCS).
Individuals. Specialized advisory services would be provided by individual consultants selected by
comparison of qualifications of three candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 5.1 through 3.5 of the Consultant Guidelines. Additionally, owing to the temporary nature of
the PCU, individual consultants would be hired to complement up to 50% of the PCU staff. All
individual consultants amount to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million
NGOs. NGOs will be hired to assist ministries and the PCU in the implementation of the Project to
address high risk groups (sexual workers, prisoners, street children, hotel employees, casual sex workers
port employees), including training, monitoring and evaluation. Barbados has had some experience in
awarding targeted grants to better recognized NGOs and this would continue.  Criteria for the
qualification and selection of NGOs would focus on their experience, credibility with their target group
and financial reliability. The decision to include NGOs would be made annually as part of the annual
programming exercise.
Operating Costs. Sundry items, utilities and general operating costs including national consultants will
be procured by the PCU using well-tested government of Barbados administrative procedures which were
reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$7,425,000.
Review of Procurement Actions
Review of Procurement Plans. Every year a detailed procurement plan shall be furnished to the Bank
before December for its review and approval. This plan will include: a firm list of contracts to be
procured in the next fiscal year; estimated contract costs; schedule for bidding; and method of
procurement or of selection of consultants. The plan shall be consistent with the provisions above for the
procurement methods for goods, works and the selection of consultants. Once approved the plan is
binding and changes will require review and approval by the Bank.
During the fiscal year, if changes are required in the procurement plan a revised version should be
submitted to the Bank for its review and approval four weeks in advance to any invitation to bid not
included in the previous plan.
Prior-Review Thresholds. The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the procurement
capacity assessment of the project implementing unit and are summarized in Table A.13.8-3.
Project Implementing Unit Procurement Capacity Assessment
A procurement capacity assessment of the CPU was carried out and approved by the RPA on 04/11/200 1.
The procurement risk is assessed as AVERAGE. The major risks identified and actions recommended to
address them are:
a) Office of the Director (PCU): The Office is a new agency which will be responsible for
coordination of the whole program and will carry out procurement actions for the different ministries,



161
except for Ministry of Health. The lack of procurement experience in this unit and the need for strong
coordination with several ministries should be addressed by hiring a finance officer with procurement
experience to assist the Director.
b) Ministry of Health: This Ministry will carry out about 66%of the procurement for the project,
including all civil works, the majority of goods and specialized consultant services. The Ministry has
staff very well trained in procurement, however, with limited experience of Bank procurement. To
address this issue, a procurement seminar of one whole week is recommended to all staff working in
procurement in the project (PCU, Barbados Drugs Service and all Ministries) as soon as all staff are
appointed.
c) Barbados Drug Service: This agency will carry out the procurement of drugs (including ARV) and
condoms for the whole program. It has excellent experience in procurement of drugs, however, it has
not have any exposure to Bank procurement. To address this, BDS should participate in the one week
training recommended in (b) above.
d) Filing: The Office of the Director will establish such a system to systematically maintain records on
all procurement in the project for purposes of auditing reports and to comply with legal covenants in
the Loan Agreement. The Ministry of Health will maintain records of its procurement and assure that
the Office/PCU has identical information. Initial Bank's supervision missions should validate the
establishment of adequate filing system of documents, and electronic data bases on procurement and
financial records of contracts financed under the loan.
Frequency of Procurement Supervision
The project will need strong support from the Bank in the first six months particularly to create
procurement capacity. in the PCU and on Bank guidelines in the Ministry of Health and the BDS. After
this initial phase, the project would receive a minimum of one full supervision mission to visit the field to
carry out post review of procurement actions, six months after implementation and then one every 12
months. The post-review field analysis should cover a sample of not less than one in five contracts
signed.

II. Financial Management
As part of reviewing the government's readiness to begin to implement the above-named project, during
the week of April 9-13, 2001, the Bank carried out a Financial Management (FM) Assessment. As stated
in the Bank's FM Assessment Toolkit, the objective of this exercise is to assess whether the project
complies in all material respects with the FM requirements of the Bank. Additional objectives are to
agree with the borrower to an Action Plan for establishing the mechanisms necessary to manage and
control project funds, and to identify areas where the Bank can be of assistance in this process
(Attachment 1).
Agreed-to Framework for Project Financial Management
Discussions held during the assessment resulted in an operational framework for project financial
management. The project is to be coordinated by a central Project Management Unit (PMU), located in
the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). This unit will include a Financial Officer, trained as an
accountant who will coordinate and organize all project financial management activities. Each of the six
Ministries involved will have their own budget for the project (the vast majority of expenditures will be
incurred in the Ministry of Health and OPM), and will make expenditures under the uniform budgetary
categories of the HIV/AIDS program. The Accountant General will control the Special Account and
periodically (approximately monthly) reimburse the government's Consolidated Fund with a transfer
from this account.18  The Accountant General will promptly inform the PMU as to expenditures
reimbursed, so that the PMU can make the necessary accounting entries and prepare loan account
withdrawal applications.
Staffing - Responsible Party for Project Financial Management
The OPM will contract a Project Financial Manager/Accountant. This person should understand
government accounting procedures, including the Smart Stream system, while also having strong skills in
accounting and the use of computers. His/her main responsibilities will include accounting, preparation of
financial reports for project management, preparation of disbursement applications, and liaising with all
of the implementing ministries as well as other entities such as the Accountant General's Office and the
project's audit firm. A model Terms of Reference for a Project Financial Manager/Accounting Specialist
is attached as Attachment 2.
Funds Flow from the Bank to the Project
The project will disburse via traditional Bank disbursement procedures, under which an initial advance -
the amount of which is fixed in the loan agreement - is made to the US$ Special Account following the
submission of the first withdrawal application, and subsequent replenishments to the account are made
based on transaction listings of disbursements made (Statements of Expenditure - SOEs) submitted to the
Bank on approximately a monthly basis. At the same time, the project will produce quarterly Project
Management Reports (PMRs -see Attachment 3) which include a financial report, a discussion of project
progress including a summary of project implementation indicators, and a report on procurement and
contract management. The initial PMR financial reports will focus primarily on cash balances,
expenditures made classified in accordance with the agreed Chart of Accounts (see below), and Special
Account activity. Should the government eventually decide to disburse via PMRs instead of SOEs, the
financial report would need to be augmented with more detailed information about disbursements made
(PMR Report 1 -D) and a forecast for the subsequent 2 quarters of project activity (Report I -E), which
would serve as the primary basis for advances to the Special Account. For large purchases the
government will have the option to submit a request for a Direct Payment from the Bank to the supplier,
but the PMU should maintain appropriate communication with the Accountant General's Office to ensure
s No local currency bank accounts will be established for the project, as all expenditures will be made via government
budgetary/disbursement procedures (i.e. from the Consolidated Fund).



167
that any payments made are incorporated into the Estimates of Expenditure and project accounting
records.
The OPM would be responsible for preparing and approving the SOEs and PMRs, although disbursement
applications may also require sign-off from the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Authorized signatories
should be sent to the Bank once the loan agreement is signed.
Chart of Accounts.
An important aspect of keeping project accounting "simple" will be the establishment of a straightforward
Chart of Accounts which allows for the tracking of all key elements of the program. It was agreed that
the MH will immediately work to unify all budget classifications for any HIV/AIDS program-related
expenditure that appears in the current government budget. Then, following loan signing, this effort will
be further extended by the then-functioning PMU, so that the Budget Office of the Ministry of Finance
and Planning will create the budget classifications necessary for project accounting. The budget
classifications will represent the accounting structure of the project, and are expected to be roughly as
follows:
Program:      HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control
Subprograms: The 3-4 Project Components (e.g. Treatment), to be defined in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD)
Items:        The disbursement categories (e.g. Civil Works), to be specified in the Loan Agreement,
Schedule I (see Table A8-4)
Sub-Items:   A further breakdown of the Items (this level is flexible, and can be used for any desired
dis-aggregation of project expenditures)
In this way the Chart of Accounts will capture the essence of the project design, while at the same time
being integrated into the government's budgetary framework. The PCU will monitor the project accounts
via a reporting mechanism which will be set up by the Accountant General's office (see below).
All loan-financed expenditures would be included only in the budgets of the MH and OPM - with all
expenditures in other Ministries being accounted for as counterpart funds. This type of arrangement
would need to be clearly spelled out in project documents, including Schedule I of the loan agreement, so
that no confusion is caused in accounting and disbursement processes.
Financial Reporting
Most project financial reporting would be done via the Smartstream System. An obstacle to this is that
currently most ministries have very limited ability to produce financial reports, due to constraints in the
hardware and software of the system. Reporting is therefore generally centralized in the Accountant
General's office. For the project, it was agreed that the OPM and other Ministries will be provided with
appropriate access rights and reporting capabilities. It is recommended that the PCU and MH have full
rights to view all program information and create the consolidated financial reports required, with other
ministries having access rights consistent with existing government practices. Report formats (e.g. for
PMRs, other management reports, and annual audited statements) will be arranged between the PCU,
Accounts Department in the MH, and the Accountant General so that the project Financial Manager will
be able to manipulate information and generate reports as needed.19 Models for the PMRs and the annual
audit report are available electronically on the website referred to above. For PMRs, as stated earlier in
this report, the Reports I-A and l-B are most important, and for these reports, the "Planned" and
"Variance" columns are not considered to be critical.
19 The Financial Manager will not be able to "override" the entries of the ministries, but will need to have full capabilities to
manage and report this information.



168
Funds Flow within the Project.
Expenditures will be made within the Ministry where the budget lies, in the same way that normal
government expenditures are made. This process is explained above, as well as in the Bank's in-process
CFAA. Stated briefly, each of the six Ministries involved, as well as the OPM, will be given a "vote"
(budget) for the relevant subcomponents that it may be responsible for. Expenditures are entered into the
Smartstream system and approved within the Ministry. Receipt of the goods or services is recorded by
the same Ministry, and this "receipt into the (Smartstream) system" is then acted upon by the Treasury,
which approves payment and produces a check. The check is sent to the Ministry, which then delivers it
to the supplier. This process, especially as it specifically applies to the project, will be explained in more
detail in the Financial Manual (see Attachment 3).
Internal Controls including Control of Assets
The project will establish reporting relationships, approval procedures, and other processing-related
internal controls, and document these within the Financial Manual (which forms part of the Operational
Manual.) Included in this manual should be a description of how assets - especially large-volume (e.g.
condoms) or high-value (e.g. medicines/drugs) assets - will be purchased, maintained, and distributed.
The control risk over medicines is considered to be mitigated to a large extent by the expected heavy
involvement of the Barbados Drug Service, a government-run service that procures drugs for the
country's pharmacies but generally does not inventory them. The Drug Service has a good reputation for
handling the types of activities that it will deal with under the project.
Retroactive Financing of Eligible Expenditures
Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures from a approximately May 15, 2001, would be perrnitted.
The exact amount of retroactive financing under the loan would be 10% of the loan value and the types
of expenditures that will be financed under such a provision - will need to be determined during the loan
preparation and negotiation process.
Project Audit
The project will require a financial audit in accordance with relevant Bank guidelines and international
auditing standards. The audit will be carried out by a private auditor, who will prepare an audit report
which can be submitted to the Bank within 4 months of the end of the financial year (April - March).
Assuming that project processing proceeds as planned, the first audit report would therefore be submitted
to the Bank by July 31, 2001.
The GOB will follow Bank procurement procedures in contracting the audit firm for the project. These
procedures include the submission of auditor terms of reference - in line with the Bank's model TORs for
audits and a short list of audit firms, to the Bank for its No Objection. The procurement process should
be started as soon as possible to allow for selection of the firm prior to loan effectiveness. The Bank
recommends using the same fwrm for the life of the project, provided that its performance is satisfactory.

ANNEX 13.9
Barbados HIV/ AIDS Management, Prevention, and Control Project
Recent HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs in Barbados
Introduction
Historically, National AIDS Programs in the Caribbean were set up under WHO's Global Program on
AIDS, in the Ministries of Health. With the transition to the UNAIDS Program in 1996, the global
program committed to a multisectoral program involving Ministries of Governmental Organizations, civil
society and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
Background
Between the years 1995-1998, Barbados the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACA) committed
itself fully to a multisectoral program designed to transfer ownership of the challenge of HIV/AIDS from
government to the individual citizen. To that end, target groups were identified and creative programs
established so as to reach a wide cross section of the community. Target groups included primary school
children, out-of-school youth, commercial sex workers, religious leaders, parents, and sexually active
young people.
Barbados' national program was guided, initially, by the 1992-1997 five-year plan. In 1997, NACA, after
extensive consultations with the Ministry of Health's Chief Planner, QEH's AIDS Education Officer, a
technical adviser from CAREC and the UNAIDS representative produced the 1998-2002 National
Strategic Plan. One of the cornerstones of this Policy would be the inclusion of PLWHA at every level in
the program and empowerment of this group which is critical to the growth of the program.
Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS in Barbados, 1995-1998
Barbados' Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs, and Culture joined with NACA and the MH in a series
of workshops for primary and secondary school principals, guidance counselors and selected teachers.
These workshops were based on a UNICEF Workbook Program which had been field-tested in Barbados.
Subsequent to this, the Ministry of Education has moved towards the incorporation of age-appropriate
HIV modules into their curriculum. This program had attracted some funding from the Gennan
Govemment (GTZ) and CAREC.
Peer education was used in a pilot project in the secondary schools, Teenage AIDS Prevention, partially
funded by the private sector. This project trained forty peer counselors from ten secondary schools. The
significant private sector interest in this project was not pursued but this program is considered one of the
most important projects which should be built on to ensure sustainability.
Out-of-school youth were targeted primarily in their communities using a short, seven-minute AIDS video
based on a dub song, "Fatal Attraction.." In collaboration with service clubs (Optimists, which produced
the video, and the Leo Club which provided the "community bridges"), this video was used by the NACA
Chair as the basis of community education.
The Ministry of Education, Youth Affairs, and Culture's Youth Commissioners were identified as another
means of educating out-of-school youth. An initial workshop with the Youth Commissioners provided
basic education and sensitization. This initiative resulted in a number of well-attended community events
at which the AIDS program provided the resource persons and the Youth Commissioners ensured
community-based audiences.
The Commercial Sex Workers program was carried out between two Public Health Inspectors and
NACA's Chair. A number of brothels were visited to provide education (and condoms) initially for the
proprietors who in turn brought the sex workers together for education as well as encouraging regular
health checks and testing. The sensitivity of this issue was brought to the attention of the Attorney
General (Ag) at the time. This program also attracted funding from CAREC/GTZ.



174
A series of workshops was held with the National Conservation Commission so as to educate beach
rangers and lifeguards. It was envisioned that they would have in turn been able to provide education on
the beaches.
Religious leaders of both the established Church (through the Barbados Christian Council) as well at the
Evangelical Churches (through the Barbados Evangelical Council) were targeted in two workshops in
1995 and 1996. This was followed by a numerable request to the AIDS Program to address churches.
Chair of NACA was invited to address the Anglican Synod, the Barbados Christian Council and met with
the Roman Catholic Bishop, Bishop Gait. Harlem's "Balm in Gilead" program provided a follow-up to
this initiative as she shared in the events of AIDS Awareness Week in 1996.
Parents were targeted through the National Council of Parent Teachers' Association (NCPTA). A
simplified module was presented to them explaining the salient points in the information being presented
in the Schools. The Program met with the Central Executive of the NCPTA.
Initiatives designed to reach sexually active youth included an initiative which saw the West Indian
Cricket Team signing a T-shirt and then the sale of these by NACHA members at Kensington Oval during
a Test Match. We also used fonner Barbadian Cricketers who were on the West Indies Team to do short
public service announcements using cricketing analogies, "glove up before you go out the bat. "
NACA also joined with Hardcore Promotions to co-produce a Bujo Banton Show, billed around "Cover
the Willy'. The erection of a Tent at the Stadium from which volunteers distributed thousands of
condoms between 6:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., allowed interaction with thousands of young people who may
not otherwise have attended any HIV/AIDS presentation. NACA and AIDS Society of Barbados also had
a presence at all the major national festivals where brochures and condoms were distributed. A
Kadooment Band was also produced in 1996.
In 1996, an AIDS Awareness Week was introduced. This was intended to increase aware of AIDS,
building up to World AIDS Day on December 1. Under this initiative, service clubs and corporate
Barbados were targeted in an initiative which saw Service Clubs manning a Food Collection Drive at a
number of Supermarkets. This food was earmarked for the AIDS Food Bank. NACA decided to make
this an annual event in which the PLWHA would always play an important part.
It was agreed that a television promotion should be done every six months. Its policy of carrying out
focus groups within the group being targeted, prior to production of the public service announcements,
was instituted. Public sector training was done by the Ministry of Health and NACA across Government
Ministries in a vertical fashion in a series of workshops between 1995-1997.
Status of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs in Barbados
Of all these programs, only that with the Primary Schools has been sustained. The programs for
commercial sex workers and out-of-school youth have not been built on. The program with religious
leaders was scheduled to have been extended to young pastors and clergy across the spectrum but has not
been done. Similarly, the initiative with the NCPTA's has not been continued. Annual workshops for the
core of young peer educators in the schools would provide continuity of the program. Two sets of
students should be trained - first formers to target the influx of new students entering secondary school
every year and third formers to reach the fourth and fifth formers. This would ensure sustainability of the
project. The private sector (i.e., Texaco) had shown interest in this proposal. These peer educators would
in turn be encouraged to design programs of community outreach to reach the school's neighboring
communities. This would be done in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Transformation.
It will be important to ensure monitoring and evaluation for every program, and if successful, attract
resources (human and capitol) to ensure continuity. The German Government (GTZ) and CAREC had
promised to fund such an evaluation tool which could be applied to several projects.



175
Advocacy was also seen as a priority area. Under this heading, NACA Chair addressed a wide range of
organizations and groups, among them:
Permanent Secretaries of Barbados; Caribbean Ministers of Education; Insurance Association of the
Caribbean; Barbados Workers' Union; Barbados Christian Council; Anglican Synod; Barbados Chamber
of Commerce; Barbados Association of Professional Engineers; Barbados Family Planning Association;
National Council of Parent Teachers' Association; Service Clubs; Nation Newspaper; Staff of Radio
Liberty.
Gaps in the program included the following:
*  Sensitization of the Cabinet;
*  adequate documentation of projects;
*  targeted research;
*  programs for two key government sectors, tourism and transport; and
*  programs targeting men having sex with men.
There continues to be a need to involve PLWHAs in all the programs. The empowerment of this group
remains a priority but a difficult task.
There are several important needs:
a) To ensure continuing representation of PLWHAs at the highest level and in the implementation
process;
b) To have the National Strategic Plan approved by Cabinet. This document based on the UNAIDS
document format, was compiled by NACA after consultation and with the assistance of the Chief
Planner, Ministry of Health, the Health Education Officer, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the UNAIDS
representative and CAREC. The two areas accorded priority were "Care and Management" and
'Legal and Ethical Issues";
c) To strengthen existing NGOs, in particular, the AIDS Society of Barbados. In 1995 a network of
people in the field of HIV/AIDS, "Barbados HIV/AIDS Network" was formed. It was a network
reflecting the Barbados situation and therefore included Government agencies, NACA, NGOs, and
individuals in the field of HIV/AIDS. It was launched after initial workshops coordinated by the
Ministry of Health and PAHO, and had an initial membership of 64 individuals/organizations. After
the initial enthusiasm, this network floundered due to burnout, relocation of members and an inability
to sustain the Secretariat functions. Similarly, Artists Against AIDS, which was formed in 1996 and
after a weekend workshop with NACA held their own workshop in Queen's Park for the public,
suffered a similar lack of sustainability. As Barbados moves to a full multisectoral program, note
must be taken of the need to attract human resources and funding to strengthen NGOs, which should
be a vibrant partner in this program.

*      Preservation of future treatment options
*      Use of resistance testing in selected clinical settings
A. Criteria for Selecting Patients for the Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)
Initiation or changes in ART should be guided by monitoring the laboratory parameters of plasma viral
load (RNA particles-copies--of HIV) and CD4+ T cell count, as well as the clinical conditions of the
patient. The following criteria are used for initiation of ART therapy:
* All patients with symptomatic HIV infection, regardless of CD4+ count and viral load levels;
* All patients with CD4+ counts below 350/mm3; and
* All patients with viral load above 30,000 copies/ml by RT-PCR essay (Roche).
B. Measuring Viral Load and CD4+ for ART Decisions
Measurement of plasma viral load should be performed at the time of diagnosis and every three to four
months thereafter in the untreated patient (see Table A.13.10-2). CD4+ cell counts should be measured at
the time of diagnosis and generally every three to six months thereafter. These intervals between tests are
merely recommendations and flexibility should be exercised according to the circumstances of the
individual case. Viral load levels should also be measured immediately prior to and again at two to eight
weeks after initiation of ART. This second measurement allows the clinician to evaluate the initial
effectiveness of therapy, since in most patients adherence to a regimen of potent anti-retroviral agents
should result in a large decrease in viral load by two to eight weeks.
21 From "Safe and Effective Use of Antiretroviral Treatments in Adults" published by UNAIDS, lAS and WHO (Jan.2001), and
the Guidelines developed by the Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV Infection convened by the Department of
Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (Feb 5, 2001).

Table A.13.10-2. Viral Load (HIV RNA) Measurements in Monitoring ART
Viral load suggested for therapy initiation
Above 30,000 copies/ml by RT-PCR
"Below limits of detection" (50 or less copies/ml
Target level of viral load after initiation of  RT/PCR
treatment                                <400 copies may be acceptable in some settings
"Below the limits of detection" within 3- 4 months of
Timing the target response               initiating ART.
(In patients with high levels of viral load, maximal
suppression may not be for 6-8 months )
At baseline: 2 measurements 3-4 weeks apart
Within 1 month therapy started to confirm anti-viral
Frequency of viral load measurements     activity of the regimen
Every 2 months until viral load is below limits of
detection
Every 3-4 months thereafter together with CD4 count
The viral load should continue to decline over the following weeks and in most individuals becomes
below detectable levels (currently defined as <50 RNA copies/ml) by 16-20 weeks. However, the
absence of a virologic response of the magnitude above should prompt the physician to reassess patient
adherence, rule out malabsorption, consider repeat RNA testing to document lack of response, and/or
consider a change in drug regimen.
Once the patient is on the therapy, viral load testing should be repeated every three to four months to
evaluate the continuing effectiveness of therapy. With optimal therapy viral levels in plasma at six
months should be undetectable, that is, below 50 copies of HIV RNA per ml of plasma (5). If viral load
remains detectable in plasma after 16-20 weeks of therapy, the test should be repeated to confirm the
result and a change in therapy should be considered.
C. Monitoring the Efficacy of ART
Clinical improvement and favorable results of CD4+ and viral load tests are critical assessments of the
ART efficacy.
Clinical Indicators
*         Body weight gain
*         Increased lymphocyte count
*         Decrease frequency/severity of opportunistic infections
*         Decrease occurrence /severity of HIV related malignancies
CD4+ Count
Rise of CD4+ count is indicative of treatment efficacy. A median increase in CD4+ cells of about 100 -
200 cells per year is expected in patients with undetectable viral load. Following initiation of ART the
"CD4+ response" is slower than the "viral load response." A reasonable frequency of CD4+ count in
patients under ART is every three to six months.
Viral Load Count
*        Viral load should be measured within one to three months after initiating ART as a check for
its effectiveness.



178
*         When other indicators show unfavorable response to ART, viral load count should be
performed.
D. Testing for Drug Resistance
* Genotyping assays detect drug resistance mutations that are present in the viral genes (i.e., RT and
protease). Genotyping assays can be performed relatively rapidly, such that results can be reported
within one to two weeks of sample collection. Consultation with an expert in HIV drug resistance is
encouraged to facilitate interpretation of genotype test results.
* Phenotyping assays measure the ability of viruses to grow in various concentrations of anti-retroviral
drugs. They are generally more costly to perform compared with genotyping assays. Interpretation
of phenotyping assay results is complicated by the paucity of data on the specific level of resistance
that is associated with failure of different drugs. Again, consultation with an expert may be helpful
for interpretation of test results.
E. Use of Resistance Assays in Clinical Practice
*         Resistance testing appears to be a useful tool in selecting active drugs when changing anti-
retroviral regimens in the setting of virologic failure.
*         There are currently no prospective data to support the use of one type of resistance assay over
the other (i.e., genotyping vs. phenotyping) in different clinical situations. Therefore, one type of
assay is generally recommended per sample; however, in the setting of a complex prior treatment
history, both assays may provide important and complementary information.
*         IThe currently favored approach is to reserve resistance testing for cases in which viral load
suppression was suboptimal after initiation of therapy, although this may change as more
information becomes available on the prevalence of resistant virus in anti-retroviral naYve
individuals.
F. Considerations for Discontinuing Therapy
Patients who have begun highly active ART (HAART) at CD4 T cell counts >350/mm3 may
wish to discontinue treatment. There are no clinical data addressing whether or not this should be
done or can be accomplished safely.
Potential benefits include reduction of toxicity, drug-drug interactions, selection of resistant
variants, and improvement in the quality of life.
*         Potential risks include rebound in viral replication and renewed immunologic deterioration.
If the patient and physician agree to discontinue therapy the patient should be closely monitored.
G. Adherence to Therapy in HIV Disease
*         A high degree of adherence is necessary for optimal virologic suppression with ART.
*         90-95% of doses must be taken for optimal suppression. Lesser degrees of adherence are
often associated with virologic failure.
Non-adherence in patients on ART is the strongest predictor of failure to achieve viral
suppression below the level of detection.
*         Imperfect adherence is common. One-third of patients may miss doses.
*         Reasons for missed doses: forgetting, being too busy, being out of tow, being asleep, being
depressed, having adverse-side effects, and being too ill .
70%  adherence among the homeless was achieved utilizing flexible clinical staff, and



179
incentives.
*        Predictors of poor adherence to HIV medications:
a) Poor clinician-patient relationship,
b) active drug and alcohol use;
c) active mental illness, in particular depression;
d) inability to patients to identify their medications;
e) lack of reliable access primary medical care;
f) medication side effects; and
g) domestic violence and discriminations.
*        Predictors of good adherence to HIV medications
a) Availability of emotional and practical life supports;
b) ability of patients to fit the medications into their daily routine;
c) understanding that poor adherence leads to resistance;
d) recognition that taking all medication doses is important; and
e) feeling comfortable taking medications in front of people
H. Adherence to Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART)
Patient-Related Strategies
1. Inform patient about, anticipate, and treat side effects
2. Simplify food requirements
3. Avoid adverse drug reactions
4. If possible, reduce dose frequency and number of pills
5. Negotiate patient commitment to an understood treatment plan
6. Take time, multiple encounters to explain therapy goals and need for adherence
7. Assess readiness for ART before the first prescription
8. Recruit family and friends to support patient for adherence
9. Develop plan for regimen, food, daily schedule, side effects
10. Provide daily or weekly pill boxes, alarm clocks, pagers, and other aids for adherence
11. Develop adherence support groups
Clinical and Health Team-Related Strategies
1. Establish trust
2. Serve as educator, source of support and monitoring
3. Provide access between visits for questions/problems
4. Intensify monitoring in periods of low adherence
5. Consider impact of new diagnoses on adherence



180
6. Use nurses, pharmacists, peer educators, volunteers, drug counselors, etc. for reinforcing adherence
7. Provide training for support team related to ART and adherence
8. Add continuity-of-care to improve patient access
9. Use directly observed therapy (DOT)

ANNEX 13.11
Barbados HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project Prevention and Control Project
Economic and Technical Criteria for World Bank Lending for ART in Barbados22
I. Present Status of Barbados Infrastructure and Practices for Providing ART
Antiretroviral Therapy - ART - has been proven effective, under certain circumstances, in delaying the
onset of AIDS, reducing opportunistic infections, improving productive life and prolonging life
expectancy among HIV-positive persons. However, the country's health system needs a well defined
infrastructure for providing ART to ensure these results. The following assessment provides a concise
view of the present status of infrastructure in Barbados for providing ART.
Government Commitment. There is a strong political commitment and leadership at the highest level of
Government for developing a national effort to treat, control and prevent HIV/AIDS. Besides the obvious
concerns of the MH related to the HIV/AIDS situation, there is growing awareness of other govemment
branches on the seriousness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and willingness to participate in a national effort
to control it.
The MH has been in command of current prevention, control and treatment activities, and now has
committed itself as facilitator for other ministries to be involved in a national effort. Although it has a
motivated staff to work on AIDS an looks adequately prepared, there seems to be some concern about its
future leadership and role when the Prime Minister's Office takes over the responsibility for program
implementation.
Access to voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT). Pre and post counselling are mainly
performed at the QEH Counselling Clinic. The clinic is overcrowded and this negatively affects quality
of counselling provided. More, there are no alternatives for expansion of the clinic within QEH building
to cope with the rising number of testing requests. The polyclinic network in the island is not fully
utilised for access to voluntary counselling and testing.. Some polyclinics perform pre-test counselling,
collect blood for HIV testing and send the specimen for testing to QEH. However, in general, when an
HIV test is positive, the result is not sent back to the polyclinic. The polyclinic is asked to refer the
positive patient to the hospital for follow up. This contributes to a growing cohort of HIV+ persons,
which is becoming out of control for the hospital due to inadequate staffing and infrastructure for the
demand for care. Yet, the level of organisation and the profile of the personnel within the polyclinics
would allow to host voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) facilities.
Enrollment for treatment: The established criteria at the QEH are:
1. A valid Barbados Identification Card
2. HIV patients with CD4 count below 350 cells per mm3. No viral load is taken into consideration.
3. A valid prescription from the HIV/AIDS Clinic Director for adults
4. A valid prescription from the HIV/AIDS Pediatric Director for patients 16 years and under.
Protocol
l. The drugs to be used are available at QEH pharmacy.
2. ARVT drugs would be made available free of cost through the pharmacy attached to the HIV/AIDS
clinic only.
22 From "Safe and Effective Use of Antiretroviral Treatments in Adults" published by UNAIDS, IAS and WHO (Jan.2001), and
the Guidelines developed by the Panel on Clinical Practices for Treatment of HIV Infection convened by the Department of
Hlealth and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Famnily Foundation (Feb 5, 2001).



183
3. All patients benefiting from free drugs must be known and well documented (name and address) for
follow up and accounting purposes.
4. Niverapine will be used for prevention of maternal to child transmission when CD4 count is 350 or
above.
5. ARVT will be used for HIV/AIDS pregnant women with CD4 count below 350
Treatment Regimens.  The first choice is a triple combination of two non-nucleoside reverse
transcripatase inhibitors (efavirenz and niverapine) or two nucleoside analogues (zidovudine, lamiduvine
or zidovudine/lamiduvine) with one protease inhibitor ( Indinavir or Nelfinavir). Criteria for using these
combinations are based on literature reports, drugs available, and cost. However, the main determinant of
choosing the triple combination is affordability by the patient The response to treatment  has been
recorded in terms of: (i) toxicity experienced by patients; (ii) virologic response as measured by viral
load counts (very few); and (iii) clinical improvement of symptoms and signs and general status of the
patient. The treating doctor's preferences can make cost of ART range from US$ 1,31 7,oo to US$9, 240.
Follow up of patients includes. CD4 count every three months (4 times/year) and Viral Load every two
months (6 times/year). However, this does not occur because financial constraints, especially in the case
of the viral load test, which has to be sent to Miami at a cost of US$600 each.
Compliance. Evaluating compliance is done by recalling the patient every two to three months for
review of CD4 count, and viral load (when afforded by the patient). Compliance appears as an emerging
issue due to low collaboration by patients. This issue has to be properly addressed before expanding
access to ARVT to all possible beneficiaries.
Monitoring and evaluation. The treating doctor monitors (i) toxicity experienced by patients; (ii)
virologic response as measured by viral load counts (very few); and (iii) clinical improvement of
symptoms and signs and general status of the patient. Survival rates are not being used because limited
experience so far. Evaluating possible resistance through laboratory and clinical status of the patient is an
important part of the therapy protocol.
At present, there is no clear continuum of care of PLWHAs in general, and of psychosocial support in
particular from the community to the referral Hospital. Yet, there is clearly a link between the polyclinics
and the community. What is clearly missing in the chain is a link between the QEH and the polyclinics.
Capacity to recognize and appropriately manage common HIV related illnesses and opportunistic
infections
The 600 bed QEH is the only tertiary care facility in the country. There is also a private hospital with
about 30 beds for primary and secondary care. The Pulmonary Unit of the QEH is in charge of the
treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. Neither the polyclinics, nor the private sector deal with HIV/AIDS care.
All suspected cases from private and public facilities are referred to this unit for care. In 1991, an AIDS
Management Team has been set up with multidisciplinary representation: Internists, pediatricians,
surgeons, psychologists, nurses, social workers, etc. These people meet once a month to review AIDS
cases, treatments and policies. However, in practical terms, apart from those professionals working in
QEH, no other health professional is exposed to the daily management of HIV/AIDS infection.
Staffing shortage is a problem to cope with provision of counseling, reception and management of
referrals from all, private and public health providers for diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Last
year, the Pulmonary Unit provided services to 250 HIV persons and has managed 10 to 12 AIDS patients
with ART. According to his director (Dr. Timothy Roach), TB as an opportunistic disease is not a
problem so far, due to good public health programs and BCG coverage: the island may have six to seven
new cases of TB per year.
Blood Safety and HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis. The existing strategy to ensure blood safety and
use of anti-retroviral treatment after exposure have shown success in Barbados over the years. However,



184
these efforts need to be sustained, and complemented with alternatives to the transfusion of whole blood
and blood products, with clear policy guidance and strengthened rigorous infection control practices.
Laboratory services for monitoring immunologic and virologic parameters of HIV infection. and
drug toxicity
The QEH laboratory service is well organized and equipped for providing blood, chemistry, parasitology,
and microbiology tests. Concerning HIVV/AIDS, it provides adequate quality testing for opportunistic
infections, and ELISA for HIV. CD4 testing is available in limited quantities and viral load is not. When
ordered by the treating doctor, the blood sample for viral load is sent to Miami for testing, at a cost of
US$600. The facilities are now crowded and understaffed for the needs and services being performed.
Though the polyclinics are designed to perform basic lab tests, HIV test is available in none of them.
This is explained by the government policy to centralize HIV testing in one center for recording purposes.
Assurance of an adequate supply of quality drugs, including drugs for the treatment of
opportunistic infections and other HIV related illnesses
The BDS established in 1980 by the MH has implemented best practice procedures supported by
appropriate information systems. Good performance was recognized by the WHO, appointing the BDS as
a collaborating center for drug supply management.
The drug purchasing process is designed to ensure the availability of drugs for a yearly contracted period
(July-June). Once tendering documents are prepared, a bidding notice is posted in the two principal
newspapers in the country. The bidding process beginning in November provides a competitive
mechanism to purchase the required quality specifications and acceptable past performance at the lower
bidders. Eight local wholesalers representing close to 250 international drug companies and local drug
laboratory, participate in the bidding.
The bids are presented to the Drug Tender Committee responsible for awarding the contracts to be
approved by the Minister of Health. Eventual disagreements from the MH relative to the selection of
suppliers are presented to the Cabinet before final decision is made.
The local suppliers are responsible for drug storage and inventory availability, as well as monthly
distribution as demanded by public pharmacies and hospitals according to written authorization provided
by BDS. This mechanism provides efficient cash flow, reduces storage costs and prevents expiration and
obsolescence of drugs.
The BDS has direct management responsibilities on 13 of the public pharmacies located in the polyclinics
and district hospitals. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Psychiatric Hospital are supplied with drugs
by the BDS on a semi-decentralized scheme. The public pharmacies and most of the country's private
pharmacies (close to 80) participate in the distribution and dispensing of drugs. The BDS provides a
negotiated mark-up with private pharmacies (32%, including drug distribution to the pharmacies),
assuring immediate access and availability to MH patients. The BDS's computerized supply system
provides information for the purchasing, patient benefit verification, and private pharmacy
reimbursement, inventories controls and point of service dispensing.
Identification of sufficient resources to pay for treatments on a long-term basis
To date, only 15 patients have access to antiretrovirals through the public facilities. These patients pay
from their pocket. Some of them manage to seek support from the government welfare program. There
are also reports of shipment of antiretroviral drugs trough relatives based abroad.
The government plans to provide ART free of charge to all Barbadians. There is some political
dimension for this project since the government already announced in April 2000 that antiretrovirals
would be made available to all Barbadians by the end of 2001. Since then, the population is somewhat
awaiting the implementation of the announcement. To minimize the cost of the treatments, the
government applied to be part of the Accelerating Access Initiative. This has been well received by



185
UNAIDS, which is willing to work with the Barbadian Authorities within the initiative. Meanwhile, the
Government starts some negotiations with certain of the pharmaceutical for price reduction of HIV/AIDS
commodities.
In the medium term (when the World Bank loan will be over), the government intends to continue
funding the procurement of antiretrovirals through regular funds from its normal budget. According to
the Minister of Health, the government prefers to invest on the procurement of those life-saving drugs for
the active population than for in any other new health program. The Minister even raised the government
is ready to cancel of a project for a new cardiovascular unit in favor of a program on access to
antiretrovirals for people living with HIV/AIDS.
Information and training for health professionals on safe and effective use of antiretroviral therapy
At present, those who are aware of safe and effective use of antiretrovirals are the members of the AIDS
management team. The current practices on the prescription of triple therapy are not tailored to the socio-
economic reality of patients.
Out of the AIDS management team, there is clearly a lack of real knowledge of the standards of care for
people living with HIV/AIDS.
Establishment of reliable regulatory mechanisms against misuse and misappropriation of
antiretroviral drugs
The current drugs provision and distribution system provides safeguards for proper use of antiretroviral
guaranteeing absence of misuse or misappropriation of the drugs.
The following drugs have been part of the last tender and are available in the country: stavudine,
nelfinavir, efavirenz, indinavir, zidovudine, and nevirapine. For Zidovudine, a Canadian manufacturer
(Apotex) won the bid. This contrasts with the government position to exclusively import HIV/AIDS
drugs from the R&D companies.
The current cost of a triple therapy in Barbados varies from 4500 USD to 9500 USD per year. As a
matter of comparison, the lowest price for a triple therapy in Uganda within Accelerating Access is 622
USD per year. According to the local distributors of drugs, there is currently almost no markup on
antiretrovirals. Given the high cost of these drugs, a 32%-markup will represent an important part of any
grant for antiretrovirals. While discussing with some of the distributors, they reported that they are
prepared to renegotiate (at a lower fare) their markups with the government if a big program on access to
antiretrovirals is implemented. According to the Government, another alternative is to directly involve
the BDS in the importation, storage and distribution of antiretrovirals. However, at present, the BDS
obviously has not the capacity to take such responsibility.
In summary, main constraints on infrastructure for providing ART are: Funding, insufficient space, and
staffing shortage, particularly nursing. However, the MH is refurbishing three government houses, one
for an HIV/AIDS patients food bank, another for a "drop in center" ( a transient lodging for released
hospital patients, or HIV/AIDS patients willing to receive care and guidance, and a third for laboratory
services. A third facility (the old building of the nursing school) is being considered to be upgraded/
refurbished for organizing the hospital for AIDS, with some 20-30 beds. The proposed PMPC would
supply resources needed to complete the infrastructure that ensures quality and cost effective treatment
with ART. The staffing shortage seems a more difficult problem to address because a large number
migrate attracted by a good market and salaries in England, USA and Canada mainly. Funding the drug
treatment costs (between US$1.3million up to US$9.2 million per year, without including lab testing and
follow up) would be a difficult decision if free provision is maintained.
PLWAs do not participate except for a small advocacy group (CARE) organized recently. This is due
largely to social stigmatization and lack of confidentiality. However, Civil organizations show interest in



186
working with AIDS programs and the proposed Government Program has addressed this issue through
advocacy and promotion activities.
Surveillance is a major problem. Only the Pulmonary Unit, the laboratory and the MH have records of
cases which are handled manually. However, Dr. Roach says that figures are accurate, and quality control
and confidentiality are good. CAREC has tried to develop a surveillance system, but the Pulmonary unit
is too busy to do it. It seems that staffing shortage is not the only constraint (possibly lack of agreement
on some aspects of the approach is also a constraint.
II. Criteria for Assessin2 Readiness to Scale up ART
GOB's policy is to continue providing ART as a public health measure, and to scale up its initial
experience to cover all diagnosed cases. An important part of the WB financed project would be to
support creating the infrastructure and develop the know-how needed for this to occur. Prior to doing
this, however, it would make a critical assessment of the progress made in improving the environment for
ART. The assessment would address technical, medical, infrastructural and financial sustainability
questions. A condition for disbursing WD loan proceeds for ART would depend on a positive assessment
of these factors.
In this context a team of independent analysts (including: Public Health/HIV/AIDS Program Specialists,
a Pharmaceutical Economist, and a Procurement Specialist, financed by the project and agree by the GOB
and the WB) would concentrate in assessing:
ART Demand Management in Barbados
a) characteristics of patient enrollment: (i) proposed stage of the disease criteria for accessing ARV
(WHO standards); (ii) CD4 plus cell count criteria; viral load at start of treatment criteria; and (iii)
what is the criteria for the selection of patients eligible for subsidies?.
b) treatment regimens: proposed dual therapy or triple therapy criteria, as a first line treatment in light
of toxicity, virologic non-response, clinical disease progression, and financial affordability.
c) compliance: proposed mechanisms for ensuring good compliance of persons living with AIDS
(PLWAs).
d) monitoring and evaluation of survival and immunologic and virological response to therapy and
pattern of resistance: (i) proposed mechanisms to monitor and evaluate CD4 plus cell counts; (ii)
agreed above baseline and viral load below baseline after one year of treatment.
e) access to antiretrovirals: (i) is the cost of ARV a barrier to treatment?; (ii) what are the proposed
mechanisms for procuring and reducing the price of ARV?
ARV Supply Management in Barbados
a) role of ARV in the overall HIV/AIDS prevention and control country program: is the proposed ARV
treatment component well complemented with proposed scaling up activities to ensure wider access
to a comprehensive care and support package, including IEC among high risk groups and infected
persons and their families and communities, voluntary counseling and testing psychosocial support,
management of opportunistic infections and palliative care?; what are the proposed mechanisms to
expand the geographic access to treatment and monitoring (e.g., expanding the referral system and/or
develop a care package for the peripheral centers).
b) capacity to manage and absorb ARV drugs in a clinically controlled situation: (i) Administering
ARV drugs requires testing, laboratory, (ii) and tracking infrastructure that is complex and requires a
level of skill and experience on the part of physicians for correct case management. Absent this, the
use of the drugs raise at yet unknown risk. What is the health care delivery capacity in Barbados?;
and what is the practical know-how on the part of physicians and health care professionals to manage
ARV?



187
c) financial feasibility and sustainability: As a public cost, ART would compete for budgetary resources
with many other public health programs. Incremental costs of mainstreaming ART would have to be
seen as affordable without non-government resources. In this context, is the Government of Barbados
planning to allocate more and new funds for ARV treatment access in order not to detract resources
from other public health programs and from HIV prevention efforts?, if so, what is the financial
proposal or plan?; is the Government contemplating including other stakeholders than government
agencies and international donor community for funding wider access to HIV/AIDS drugs (e.g.,
private companies to buy treatment for their own employees)?.
d) procurement and distribution of HIV/AIDS drugs including ARV into the national pharmaceutical
structures: is the Government of Barbados contemplating including the ARVs as part of its essential
drug program?; does it have good accountability?; what are the proposed mechanisms for ensuring
good storage and distribution control?
III. Analysis of the Financial Sustainability of the Strate2v
A usual concern regarding the design of health policies is its sustainability. Financial sustainability refers
to the capacity of the health system to provide the future resources required for the appropriate
functioning of a given strategy. In the case of ART, ensuring financial sustainability requires an
estimation of the future costs of the ARV drugs and other related health care cost and a projection of the
expected health care revenues and of costs of other programs.
Estimation of Future Financial Needs
The estimation of the expected costs of ARV treatment should start by a reasonable estimation of the
present and future number of eligible patients. Data on HIV infected people are normally missing or
underestimate the actual figures, due to the stigma associated with the disease. However, if an ARV
treatment is made available free, or at a subsidized cost, previously unrecorded patients are likely to
appear. Data on treated patients may therefore not be an appropriate reference figure for projections.
There are several modeling approaches that allow making reasonable estimations/projections of future
prevalence of HIV/AIDS patients. These models usually require data, estimates or assumptions on the
following:
* The incidence of AIDS since the start of the epidemic;
* the average time from HIV infection to AIDS;
*  the survival of AIDS patients; and
*  the future incidence of HIV infections.
Of course, it has to be taken into account that #1 and #3 have to be changed appropriately to obtain
projections of HIV/AIDS patients under the assumption of the introduction of the ARV treatment.
The costs of the ARV drugs-and of the associated health care costs-are easy to compute on the basis of
the treatment protocol once the former projections have been obtained. It is much more difficult to
forecast the evolution of other costs, namely those related to opportunistic infections and other
complications of the disease.
Data from other countries may be acceptable in some cases if local information is missing. For instance,
data from clinical trials carried out elsewhere may be used to estimate the changes in the incidence of Ols
caused by the introduction of the treatment. However, local studies would be required to assess the
patterns of resource use and the unit (monetary) cost of each resource.
The introduction of ARV treatment may reduce the incidence of 01, but the effect on total expenditure is
more uncertain, because the increase of survival logically implies an increase in the prevalence.
Moreover, it is important to assess the financial and other implications of a reduction in resource use. For



188
instance, a reduction in hospitalizations is not likely to produce significant financials savings, although it
may free hospital beds for other patients.
Projection of Expected Revenues and Expenditure for the Health System
One of the feared effects of introducing an ARV drug program is that it may detract resources from other
equally or more important programs. To assess that possibility, financial projections of total health care
expenditure and financing should be made. The WHO has developed a tool for that purpose (SIMFIN,
Guy Carrin et al. WHO, Geneva).
The projection of health system revenues requires an understanding of the way the system is funded.
Projections of GNP and other basic macroeconomic variables may allow a reasonable estimate of the
future revenues of the health system if the present financial structure (average tax or social contribution
rates) is maintained or if it is modified in a certain way.
Estimations of the likely evolution of the components of health expenditure (other than the ARV drugs
program) should also be made, based on past trends and expected changes in demography, coverage,
intensity of care, etc.
Comparing projected revenues and expenditures will allow assessing the financial feasibility and
sustainability of the proposed ARV drug program and of health policy in general.
If the expected expenditure is larger that the expected revenues, policy makers can either increase the
funding of the health care system of decide which programs should be reduced. If none of these options
is chosen, some form of spontaneous rationing will take place. The programs more likely to be affected
by the scarcity of resources are these, which beneficiaries are more vulnerable, and have less political and
social influence.
Opportunity Costs
The introduction (and allocation of resources) of the ARV drugs program has opportunity costs in the
form of other programs that will either be eliminated (or reduced) or not introduced. These are ultimately
political decisions, but the decision maker should be aware of the benefits foregone by allocating the
available resources to ARV drugs program. This would require the economic assessment (by means of
cost-effectiveness analysis or similar approaches) of the programs likely to be forgone. The likely
volume of resources that ARV drugs treatment may absorb is of such an absolute and relative amount that
effects on other programs should not be ignored or overlooked.
Equity Considerations
The equity considerations of introducing ARV drugs treatment should also be considered. If the whole
treatment - including diagnostic and monitoring services - is not fully publicly funded and available to
everybody, the more disadvantaged groups are not likely to benefit at all from the program. A
undesirable but not unlikely scenario, would be one where some basic, universal and highly cost-effective
programs-for example, infant immunization-would be reduced, mostly affecting the more
disadvantaged population groups-while ARV treatment is only partly subsidized, thus only benefiting
middle- and upper-income groups.

Implications for Future World Bank Policy
Any model used to make projections for health system planning is subject to many uncertainties and
limitations. The results must be taken as "if...then..." scenarios rather than as predictions or forecasts.
Nevertheless, they may help policy makers to make a first assessment of the coherence and feasibility of
policies. This seems especially relevant in the present case, where a single intervention has such a
relevant resource implication. It is also important to be aware of the high political cost of interrupting a
program such as ARV drug treatment, which makes such a decision practically unfeasible.
It seems clear that it makes sense for the WB to provide technical and financial support to the countries
for making these previous planning studies, before they commit themselves to implement the program.
The same can be said of lending for investments required for its appropriate performance.
It is less obvious the rationale of lending for the countries being able to buy ARV drugs. This may on one
hand raise the expectations of other countries of similar and lower income level. If for any reason, the
countries are not able to fund the future procurement of ARV drugs, the WB may appear to public
opinion as responsible of the discontinuation of the program.

A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development obiective (see Annex 14. 1)
This project would assist the Government of the Dominicanl Republic (GODR) in curbing the spread of
the Human Immune-deficiency (HIV) epidemic throughi the scaling up of programs and activities targeted
to high-risk groups; expanding awareness about HIV/Acquired Immunle-deficienicy Syndrome (AIDS)
among the general population; and strengthening institutional capacity to ensure the effectiveness and
sustainability of the effort.
2. Key performance indicators (see Annex 14. 1)
Key outcome indicators for monitoring progress include: (i) the frequency of HIV/AIDS in the
Dominican population, particularly among high-risk groups, as measured by the proportion of IIIV
reported cases/number of HIV tests perforned in the general population: (ii) extent of coverage with
programs for voluntary counseling, condom promotion, prevention and control of sexually transmitted
infectionis and tuberculosis; (iii) awareness among the population about HIV/AIDS infectioni and
prevention; (iv) proportion of AIDS patients cared for at home; and (v) completeness of a disease
surveillance system.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strate2y (CAS) goai supported by the projec (see Ann1ex
14.1)
Document number: 19393-DO              Date of latest CAS discussion: June 9, 1999
The CAS discusses a number of prerequisites for poverty reduction and sustained growth in the
Dominican Republic (DR).  Among them  is the need for continuing to support social
development. Explicit reference is made to an HIV/AIDS project as one of several instruments to
increase access by poor people to the benefits of social development and economic grow-th.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy
The Issues
The HIV/AIDS Epidemic. The HIV prevalence rate among the adult population is estimated at 2-3%,
suggesting that HIV/AIDS is in a transitioni from a concenitrated to a widespread epidemic. Only a
fraction of HIV/AIDS cases are reported. The Sexually Transmitted Infectionis and AIDS Control
Directorate (DIGECITSS) of the Secretariat of Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS) estimates
that approximately 120,000 people in the DR are living withi HIV-about nine times thie total reported
accumulated cases-and that over 16,000 have already died as a consequenice of AIDS. In 1998, nin1e
hiundred cases of AIDS deaths were reported to SESPAS, making this disease the leading cause of deathi
from infectious diseases. Other studies performed on the general population inidicate that AIDS is the
principal cause of death among women of reproductive age. 2
The principal means of HIV transmission in the DR is sexual transmissioni-in particular, heterosexual
intercourse, which accounts for about 70% of cases. The majority (81%) of HIV/AIDS cases occur
among individuals in their prime reproductive and economic ages, i.e., between 15 to 44 years. The ratio
of male to female hias varied, and there has recently been a major increase among young women. It is
estimated that 4,000 pregnant women who have prenatal checkups are iiifected with HIV, and may deliver
1,300 infected childreni in the absence of a program to reduce vertical transmission) It is estimated that

2.5% of the sexually active population, between 2% and 9% of commercial sex workers (CSW), and 1 1%
of men who have sexual relations with men (MSM) are infected withi HIV. Furthermore, 6% of persons
who have checkups for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infected.
Despite efforts made in the DR-to control the epidemic, conditionis still exist for it to spread rapidly.
These conditions are expressed in high rates of infection of sexually transmitted diseases; high rates of
births among adolescent and young women; active migration to and from the country; a growing number
of CSW; hidden homosexuality and bisexuality; and stigmatization of the disease that keeps it from being
dealt with openly. The existence of a large and hard-to-reach migrant population compound the situation.
Over 2 million tourists visit the country each year and there are an estinated 500,000 Haitians residing
legally and illegally in the country, most of them young men who migrate to work in the construction and
agriculture sectors. Country projections indicate that if current trends continue, HIV prevalence could
reach 5% of the adult population by 2005.4 Studies performed in other parts of the world indicate that
when the epidemic reaches these levels, HIV spreads much more rapidly and the country's economic
growth is reduced by more than 1%5 per year.
The reproductive rate6 of HIV depends upoIn the time a person remains infectious, the risk of transmission
per sexual contact and/or per infected needles, and the rate of acquisition of sexual partners. An HIV-
infected person remains infectious about 10 years and his/her capacity to transmit the infection is greatly
influenced by belhavior.  Thius, tile challenge facing the DR  is to reduce the reproductive rate of
transmission by inducling positive behavioral chaniges in the entire populationi, but especially in high-risk
groups.
The GODR recognizes that the HIV/AIDS epidemic puts the economic and social development of the
country in serious jeopardy and considers reducing the rate of HIV transmission a national priority. Apart
from having an economic impact on the country due to disability and years of life lost prematurely,
HIV/AIDS imposes substantial direct costs on the health system. If the cost of treating an AIDS patient
remains constant at the 1998 rate of US$5,000 per year, then the costs of hospital care will increase over
50% from US$4.8 million in 1998 to US$7.4 million in 2005. If anti-retroviral therapy were included, the
total cost of treatment would reach nearly US$52.6 million in 2005, or 18.2% of the health budget. The
situation is compounded by the emergenice of opportunistic diseases associated with HIV/AIDS (some
5,440 cases of tuberculosis due to AIDS are expected for the period 2001-2005). Finally, besides the
direct toll on the infected population and on the health system, there is the tragedy of an increased number
of orphans-a number that could double from 18,500 in 1999 to nearly 38,200 in 2005.
The Tuberculosis (TB) Epidemic. Tuberculosis is one of the most important public health problems in
the DR. The reported case rate in 1999 was 70 per 100,000 population, with a markedly rising trend, as
compared with the low rates in Barbados (2.6/100,000) and Jamaica (4.9/100,000). The Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO)/ World Health Organizationi (WHO), however, estimates that the rate is
higher than 100 per 100,000 population. The total number of reported cases (5,320) is among the highiest
in the Latin America and Caribbean region (e.g., Barbados and Jamaica reported 7 and 121 cases,
respectively). TB is the principal opportunistic infection and the leading cause of death of HIV/AIDS
patients in the country. At the same time, HIV infection has become an important risk for TB patients.
Although reliable national figures are not available, some estimates consider that approximately 10% or

Prioridades en el Desarrollo de Intervenciones.'
5 Studies conducted by the University of West Indies suggest that the economic impact of the epidemic will reach around 5% of
GDP in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago by 2005. If these calculations are to be true, then it can reasonably be surmised that
the effect is much higher in the DR, where the prevalence rate is about twice that of the other two countries.
6 The reproductive rate of an infectious disease is the average number of susceptible people infected by an HIiV carrier over
his/her lifetime. In a population in which HIV has a reproductive rate of less than 1, the epidemic becomes controlled and will
tend to disappear or become endemic at low levels.

more of TB patients are HIV+. Tlherefore, the strengthieninig of the National Tuberculosis Program
constitutes an important contributioni to the struggle against HIV/AIDS.
The prevalence of TB and HlV/AlDS also constitutes a serious healthi problem In Haiti, whicih borders
with the DR. A bilateral plan has been developed by both countries to effectively to control and prevent
communicable disease on both sides of the border.
Intrasectoral Fragmentation, Inequitable Access and Coverage, and Institutional Weakness. The
heath sector is not poised to respond effectively to the above chiallenges. The current intrasectoral
fragmentation implies that different institutions make policies, set plans, and implement programs more
or less indepenidenitly, resulting in duplication of investmenits and activities. In principle, SESPAS is
responsible for providing healthi care to 70% of the population. Yet with the 47%  of public healti
spendinig it controls, SESPAS provides services to only about 45% of the population. The Dominicani
Social Security Institute (IDSS) controls 29%  of public healthi spendinig and serves about 6% of the
population. The private sector serves about 20% of the population.
Equity is a serious concerin; about 20% of Dominiicanis and 33% of the poor lack or have limited access to
healthi care, particularly in rural and pen-urban areas. Total healthi care spending represents a modest 5%
of GDP per year (below the average in thie LAC Region of 7.2%); In comparison with other Latin
American coulitries, public spendinig on health as a proportion of GDP is among the lowest (about 1.2%).
It is also inequitable and inefficienit.  SESPAS anid the IDSS account for 0.8%  and 0.4%  of GDP,
respectively, or 13% and 10% oftotal health care spendinig, allowing average per capita spendilig in the
public sector of only US$27, well below the average in the LAG Region of US$97. Direct houselhold
expenditures amount to about 2.8% of GDP or 49% of overall healtih spendinig; thiis situation implies that
the poorest 40% of the population in addition to suffering a disproportional higil burden of disease spend
a significanit portioni of their income on healthi care, whichi averages about 9%, as opposed to less thani 3%
for the noni-poor. Expenditires on private health care insuranice account for 1% of GDP or 18% of total
health spending. Other public and private arrangemenits, includinig NGOs, account for the remaililig 10%
of total health spending.
Important services are neglected, resources are allocated inappropriately, and efficiency is low in the
public sector. Public services are mainily curative and located in urban hospitals, depleting resources from
primary and preventative services for patients in rural and peri-urban areas. All of the above translates
into lligh user dissatisfaction with government health services. Poor quality medical care is also provided
In private settings due to the lack of accreditation staiidards and monitorinig practices to ensure that healthi
providers meet minimum quality standards. Risk selection and exclusion of costly treatments and chronic
diseases are common among private healthi insurers, as commercial insurers, pre-paid group practices, and
self-insurance plans operate within a regulatory void.
The Government's Strategy. The GODR's efforts to curb the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are in
keeping with the general process of reform  in the healthi sector. Throughi its Health Sector Reform
Program formulated in thie second half of the 1990s, the GODR is seeking to improve hiealthi and n-utrition
status of the population, particularly the poor. by facilitating access to quality healthi services In an
efficient and sustainable way. The strategic thrust of the reform program is the gradual introductioni to the
health sector of elements of political and administrative decentralizationi, and devising mechanisms to
minlimize the finanicial risk of catastrophic healthi events.
Since 1997, the WB has been supporting a project7 in support of the reform program. The WB-financed
project is complemented by projects finaniced by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), European
Unioni (EU), and the U.S. Agency for Interinationial Development (USAID). The WB-finianiced project is
amned at implementilig the fo-.lowing sector strategies:
7Provincial Healthi Services Project (Report No. 17199 DO).



205
*  Establishiment of a new legal and operational framework of inter-inistitutional relations within the
sector;
*  Deconcentration of sectoral stewardship to Regional Supervisory Offices (OSR) and Provincial
Healthi Directorates (DPS); and
*  Reorganizationl of basic (primary) and specialized (hospital) lhealth services networks following a
virtual integration approach.
In March 2001, the GODR promulgated the new General Health Law, which was prepared withi the
support of the Provincial Health Services Project (Ln.4272-DO). The General Health Law incorporates
major chianges in the DR's health care organization and finanicing.
The Government's efforts to stem the further spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are in keeping with the
general process of reforn  in the health and other public sectors.  As such, the strategic response
capitalizes on the opportunity that the reform process offers for making decisions at local level. It is
assumed that this approach will make it possible to respond to local needs and make use of the response
capacity at provincial and municipal level so that the actions planned for execution can be sustainable.
The Government's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic incorporates the following elements:
* Dealing with HIV/AIDS from multiple perspectives-economic, social and cultural-so as
to achieve the greatest impact.  In order to prevent and mitigate the impact of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in the country to the greatest extent possible, it is necessary to involve different sectors and
actors of the Dominican society.
*  Strengthening and expanding strategies that have been successful and including innovative
interventions to address the changing nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Such strategies include
implementation of HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary testing, control of STIs, reduction in mother-
to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT), and home care for the ill provided through the primary care
system.
*  Maximizing project impact by focusing on the most cost-effective interventions, typically on
that target the frequent transmitters of the virus. This would help to use available resources,
which are insufficient to ensure the finanicing of an exhaustive package of interventions.8
Recent achievements in the realm of HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the DR. These include tile
followinig:
*  The 1995 promulgation of Law 5593 dealinig witl- HIV/AIDS;
*  the preparation and adoption of the 2000-2004 National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS (PEN), with
the participation of public, private, and community stakelholders, includinlg interinationlal donors;
*  the launcihing of HIV/AIDS  and STI information, education, and communication  (IEC)
campaigns targeted to high-risk groups and the general population;
*  increased coverage of screened blood, from 80% in 1995 to 95% in 1999, leading to a reduction
in the HIV transmission rate due to transfusions of blood and its byproducts from 10% to 1% between
1988 and 19989;
It is estimated that a comprehensive package of services that would include all known prevention measures, surveillancc.
research, universal provision of pal4iative care, subsidies for AIDS orphans as well as the provision- of highly active anti-
retroviral therapy to 50% of infected individuals would cost an unaffordable $254 million annually.

Establishment of COPRESIDA and PEN implementation. The DR's Presidential HIV/AIDS CouLIcil
knowil as COPRESIDA was created to spearhead and coordinate the HIV/AIDS strategy at the higlhest
political level on January 8, 2001 (Presidential Decree #32-01). The council is made up of the State
Secretary of Health (president), the Director of the IDSS (vice president), an Executive Director, the
Technical Secretary to the Presidency, the State Secretary of Education and Culture, the President of the
National Higher Education Council (CONES), the Director of the Health Corps of the Armed Forces and
the National Police, the President of the National Businessmeni Council (CONEP), the President of the
nongoverinmenital organizationls (NGOs) coalition against AIDS, and a representative of persons living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
COPRESIDA's key mandate is to coordinate national policy formulation, provide oversight fuLictionls and
carry out advocacy with regard to HIV/AIDS. COPRESIDA will be in charge of implementing the PEN,
attaching greater emphasis on1 stakeholder participation, improved integration aind cross-sector
collaboration, and the wider use of effective interventionis, suclh as home-based care, as a means of
reducing the pressure on health care facilities.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and stratezic choices
The GODR has embarked on health reforms that require substantial political and finaicial support to
bring to fruition. At the same time, it faces social pressures to containi the HIV/AIDS epidemic, within
constrained resources. Although it is clear that there is strong political support for issuing nationial
policies and developing action plans to control the epidemic, the challenge is to make these policies
operational through a set of priority interventions for HIV/AIDS, STIs, and TB prevention and control.
This project is a concrete response to this challenge.
Activities supported by the proposed project are contemplated in the 2000-2004 PEN. The project will
provide resources necessary to do the following:
*  Building sustainable and proactive institutions to implement the Government's current and future
HIV/AIDS strategies and programs;
*  scaling up efforts that have been cost-effective in preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS, and
undertaking new initiatives to match the changing nature of the epidemic;
*  ensure better informed public and private decision-making by establisiling a sound basis of
analysis and informationi of disease patterns and trends; and
*  supporting activities contemplated under HIV/AIDS Law 5593 that create a more hospitable legal
and regulatory framework for the management of HIV/AIDS, and better quality of life and
opportunity for PLWHA.
As envisaged in the CAS, the proposed project in conjunction with the WB-financed Provincial Health
Services Project and the projects supported by the IDB, EU and USAID, would help to reconfigure the
health system, promote integration of public and private services within a decentralized context, and
reallocate health expenditures to basic health care for the poor. In addition, the implementationi of the
proposed project would be closely tied to HIV/AIDS-related activities supported by USAID, UNAIDS,
and PAHO/WHO, to ensure complementarity in financial and technical assistance.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 14.2 for a detailed description and Ann1ex 14.3 for a detailed cost
breakdown)
To support the implementation of the PEN, the project would finance activities grouped under three
cornponelnts:
Component 1: Promotion/Prevention to Reduce HIV Transmission-US$17.20 million. Under this
component. the project would support the development of five cost-effective priority interventions:
*  IEC activities to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission, with emphasis on high-risk groups;
*  condom social marketing programs, with emphasis on high-risk groups
improved management and treatment of STIs;
*  interventionls to prevent mothier-to child transmission of HIV; and
*  quality control of HIV testing in blood bank and laboratories
Component 2: Diagnosis, Basic Care and Support of Individuals Affected by HIV/AIDS-US$4.8
million. Under this component, the project would support the implementation of the following diagnostic
and basic care intervenitionis aiming at reducing disability and death due to HIV/AIDS, reducing the
reservoir of HIV/AIDS, and mitigating the suffering of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS:
- Organiizationi of voluntary HIV testing witlh pre- and post-test counseling services;
-     support of home care for HIV/AIDS patients;
*  establislhment of basic AIDS Health Care Units;
*  implementation of directly observed treatment (DOT) regimens for TB patients; and
  support to childreni orphanied by AIDS.
Component 3:  Strengthening HIV/AIDS and STI Surveillance; and Project Coordination,
Monitoring, Evaluation and Research-US$7.75 million. Under this componenit, the project would
support:
* Improvements in the HIV/AIDS and STI disease surveillance system, and,
project coordinationi, monitorinig, evaluation and research.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
The proposed project would raise the awareness of HIV/AIDS in the DR and would commit officials and
private citizens at the highest level of decision-making to support a national multi-institutional and multi-
sectoral mobilization against the epidemic-a mobilization that would support enforcinig existing laws
and regulations and would encourage institutions, services, patients, families and communities to change
their outlook, practices and behavior to prevent and control HIV/AIDS.
The essential focus of the project would be to scale up knowin and potentially helpful actions to achieve
tihe broadest possible impact on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, usinig existing institutionial
relationishilps and structures. The project would also support the improvement in the quality of care and
treatment of PLWHA. The absence of clear regulations favoring privacy and confidenitiality, distributioll
of condoms in prisons, has in some cases, frustrated screening, testing and the prevention of HIV
transmnission1.
3. Benefits and tar2et population:
Thle entire population of the DR will benefit directly from avoidance of HIV infectioni and AIDS, and
from better access to prevention, treatment, care, support and mitigation activities supported by the
project. The immediate beneficiaries of the project in terms of reduced exposure to risk and/or increased
access to care and support, however, will be the following target populations:
*  Street childreiin
*  adolescents in and out of school;
*  population with low perception of risk of HIV infectioni;
*  population with sigils and symptoms of STIs;
woinmen whio have prenatal checkups;
*  commercial sex workers;



209
*  men who have sexual relations with other men;
*  health services personiel;
*  armed forces personinel;
*  other groups at high-risk of HIV infection (inmates, residents of bateyes, inter municipal drivers);
and
*  PLWHA.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Project Implementation.     Implementation period: 5 years
Executing agencies. The project will be executed by COPRESIDA, and its Directive Council would
serve as an advisory Project Steering Committee. The Director of COPRESIDA would be the Secretary
of the Steering Committee, and responsible for the overall coordination of the implementation of PEN and
all activities uLnder the project. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that would be part of COPRESIDA's
organizational structure would support the Director of COPRESIDA. The PCU would be comprised of a
Technical Coordination Team, physically located at COPRESIDA, responsible for:  (i) leading,
coordinating and monitoring project implementation as set forth in the Operations Manual for the project
and in coordinationi with the Provincial Health Services Project; (ii) coordinating techinical assistance for
the design and implementation of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and institutional strengthening
activities supported under the project; and (iii) promoting and coordinating inter-institutional and inter-
sectoral arrangements for project implementationi, includinig the coordination with HIV/AIDS unlits in line
State Secretariats, and with civil society organizations, private sector institutions, and NGOs (see Annex
14.2-B .
The Administrative-Financial Unit of the Executive Commission for Health Sector Reform (CERSS), that
is charge of managing the implementation of the ongoing WB-supported Provincial Health Services
Project (Ln. 4272-DO) would also support project implementation in coordination with the PCU's
Technical Coordination Team. CERSS was established by Presidential Decree No. 308-97 of July 10,
1997 as a body responsible for integrating government policy-making efforts within a state modernization
and reform framework, providing political support for undertaking substantive change withiin the health
sector, leading the reforn effort, coordinating international assistance, and managing the implementationi
of projects finaniced by interinational agencies (it currently manages the implementationi of WB and IDB-
financed projects in the health sector, and the coordination with EU and USAID-finaniced healthi projects).
The CERSS' Unit, headed by a Financial and Administrative Director and staffed with professional and
support personnel, would be responsible for providing administrative and financial support for all project
activities, including the maintenance of accounting records, processing disbursements, mainitainilig
administrative records, contracts, and the carrying out of related activities. This unit would review all
contracts and make payments for activities related to the project. To this end, the project would finance
the hiring of additional personnel to strengthen the Administrative-Finanicial Unit of CERSS. During
project preparation, the COPRESIDA's PCU staff developed expertise in technical and administrative and
financial aspects of investment projects supported by the WB.
Technical and Operational Support. The SESPAS' DIGECITSS, which has broad capacity and
expertise for designing and implementing HIV/AIDS prevention and control strategies, programs and
activities and for disease surveillance, would provide technical and operational support required durinig
the implementationi of the project (see Annex 14.2-C).
International agencies of the United Nations system, such as Joint UJIited Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and PAHO/WHO, would provide technical
assistance for project implementation, as part of their country assistance programs. The PCU would



210
coordinate with the USAID-supported HIV/AIDS, STI and TB preventionl and control activities, and witi
other donor agencies or governments, to ensure those activities are complementary.
Operations Manual. A draft Operations Manual has been prepared by the COPRESIDA's PCU and sent
for WB review. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the project that the COPRESIDA's PCU shall
have drawn up an Operations Manual satisfactory to the WB, and be adopted by the Governmenit. It
would include the conditionis for project implementationi, such as environimenital guidelines for prepariig
and implemenitiig project activities, as well as technilcal norms and administrative, budgetary,
disbursements and procurement procedures to be followed during project implementationi, whicih would
be reviewed and foulid satisfactory by the WB. The preparation and adoption of a manual, whicih contailis
guidelines and procedures for medical waste haandling and disposal related to HIV/AIDS programs, would
take place not later thani March 31, 2003 (see Section 3.08 of Loan Agreement).
Project Implementation.  All public sectors related project activities in the project would be
implemenited by the respective Line State Secretariats, IDSS, and their HIV/AIDS ullits, as mandated by
the Presidential Decree that established COPRESIDA.  The Director of such units In each sector
secretariat will oversee the operations in their respective State Secretariats and in the IDSS would be
accountable for their project-related activities and results. In addition, State Secretariats and IDSS would
actively involve and support their provincial or local level offices to implement the project in their
jurisdictionis.  The Line State Secretariats would present their HIV/AIDS plan for each year to the
COPRESIDA's PCU. These plans would be part of the anilual implementationi plan for the project as a
whole. Once approved, finanicinig could follow different paths. For example, in some cases, regular
budgets for line State Secretariats may containi earmarked financing for HIV/AIDS prevention and control
activities, while in other cases, sets of activities formulated to expand or scale-up onigoinig efforts would
be financed by the COPRESIDA's PCU.
The civil society organizations, private sector groups, and NGOs would participate in the project III two
ways. Wheln preparing their aninual plans, the sectoral State Secretariats would involve the related civil
society groups/private sector agencies/NGOs in developing their HIV/AIDS plans.  For project
implementationl, civil society organizationis, private sector and NGOs could be contracted following
criteria and procedures in the Operations Manual. The COPRESIDA's PCU would assist, facilitate and
supervise implementationl of these activities. The criteria to be used for contractinlg these organizations
would include: techinical and efficiency criteria; cost-effectiveness criteria; assessments of their
implementationi capacity, record keeping arrangements, experience and reputationi of the sponsors in
techniical, organizationial and finanicial matters.
Project Implementation Agreements. For the preparation and implementation of project activities, the
Borrower shall enter into an agreement or amend the existing agreement (the Participation Agreements)
withi the corresponding Participating Entity, and/or cause COPRESIDA  and tile corresponding
Participating Agency (e.g., line secretariats and other public agencies) to enter or amend the existing
arrangeinenit betweeni said agencies (the Participation Arrangemilenit), as the case may be, all on terms and
conditionis satisfactory to the World Bank. Contracts between the COPRESIDA's PCU and civil society
organizations, private institutions, and NGOs would be signed following WB's procurement guidelines.
Sucih agreements and contracts reflect the institutioiial structure of COPRESIDA aiid aim at fostering a
deconcentrated arrangemenit for project implementation and the participation of other sectoral actors and
civil society organization in HIV/AIDS prevention and control, reserving to COPRESIDA's PCU the
tasks of coordinating techinical assistance and the monitorinig of the implementation of project activities.
Arrangements between the COPRESIDA's PCU and participating line State Secretariats and other
public institutions.  The formulation and implementationi of multi-sectoral and interilnstitutionial
HIV/AIDS preventioni and control activities would require a great deal of autonomy from COPRESIDA's
PCU.  Increased autonomy would be linked with greater finanicial and managerial flexibility by
participating institutions and accountability to clearly defined milestones of quality, user satisfaction and



211
cost-effectiveness. To these ends, upoIn approval of the correspondinig Anilual Action Plan by WB, tihe
Borrower shiall: (i) enter into an agreement or amend the existing agreement (thie Participation
Agreement) withi the corresponding Participating Entity; and/or (ii) cause COPRESIDA  and the
correspondinig Participation Agency to enter into an arrangement or amend the existing arrangemncit
between said agencies (the Participation Arrangement), as the case may be, all on terms and conditiolis
satisfactory to the WB, including, inter alia. the obligation of said Participating Entity or tihe Participating
Agency, as the case may be, to: (i) assist the Borrower in the implementationi of the correspondinig
Annual Action Plan; and (ii) follow the provisions of the Operational Manual and the maniual referred to
in Part B.3 (f) of the Project in providing said assistance.
Initially, arrangemenits would be established with the State Secretariats of Education, Labor, YoutIl,
Tourism, and Women Affairs, as well as with CONES, CONEP, and the Armed Forces and Police' s
Medical Programs.  Said participation arrangements would establishi the overall framework for the
activities to be carried out under each institution as part of annual implementation plans; such anilual
implementationi plans would be prepared, evaluated and executed in accordance withi the Operations
Manual for the project. The COPRESIDA's PCU would act as a liaisoii agency withi the WB and, witi
tile support of tile CERSS' Administrative-Finanlcial Unit, would be responsible for the procurement aiid
disbursement process pursuant to the WB's applicable rules; in case of noni-complianice by any
participating institutioni of any of its obligations the COPRESIDA's PCU may withi tile agreement of tile
WB suspend or cancel the finanicinig of any of the activities originally assigned to suchi institutioll, and
reallocate the respective resources to othier institutions. The WB may, on thie otlier hland, decide to
exercise its riglhts set forth in the General Conditions.
Contracts between COPRESIDA's PCU and Civil Society Organizations, Private Institutions, and
NGOs. These organizations would be contracted under the project to support the field implementationi of
intervenitionis targeted at high-risk groups included in annual implementationl plans. The siginiig of
contracts following WB procedures detailed in the project's Operations Manual would allow the
involvement of NGOs and other civil society organizations in the preparation and implementation of
project activities. Contracts and agreemenits will include the followingg: (i) objectives and targets; (ii)
description of activities; (iii) persons directly responsible for their execution; (iv) timetables; (v) budget;
(vi) process and impact indicators; (vii) sources and meanis of verification; and (viii) supervision and
monitorinig responsibilities by contractinig agencies. The civil society organizations, private institutiolis
and NGOs would be contracted following procedures satisfactory to the WB, includinig prequalification
procedures in national registries, locally advertised, regularly updated and based on qualificationi criteria,
acceptable to the WB.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements. The financial administrationi of the
project (includinig contractinig and disbursement) would be coordinated by thie COPRESIDA's PCU, with
the support from tihe CERSS's Administrative-Financial Unit. To facilitate disbursements. a Special
Account with a 30-day advance would be established. An indepenidenit auditor acceptable to the WB will
audit the project annually.
Monitoring and evaluation. The COPRESIDA's PCU would be responsible for project monitoring and
evaluation, withi support from  the HIV/AIDS Units of the line State Secretariats. UNAIDS aiid
PAHO/WHO, as part of their country assistance programs. A well designed and fuLictioniing moniitorinig
and evaluation (M&E) system  would be critical for tihe implementationi of the project to provide
coordinated feedback to the developers, implementators, and policy decision makers at different levels of
the system.
There would be two types of M&E activities in the project:
a) Monitoring of project implementation. Progress reports regarding project implementation results
and expenditure for the preceding six months and a related review of achievemenits and shortfalls
based on established plans and objectives would be sent by the COPRESIDA's PCUJ to the WB every



212
six months. The two reports covering the immediate prior calendar semester shall be consolidated
into an annual review held by the WB and the COPRESIDA's PCU in the first quarter of each
calendar year during project implemenitation.  A  mid-term  review  would be carried out at the
beginning of the third year of project implementation to conduct a comprehensive review of the
project componeits. It would include, in addition, an evaluation of the effectiveness of provision of
project inputs in achievinig key targets for improving program  performance Using Aninex 14.1 details
as the basis. The project design would be adjusted, if needed, includinig realigninig budgets amonig
componenits and activities, on the basis of the mid-term  evaluation.  Specific surveys can be
conducted to obtain data for this purpose. Annual expenditure reviews would be conducted to assess
governmenit commitnenit to HIV/AIDS preventioni and control as measured by budgetary allocations
and their distribution by activity.
b) Impact evaluation. The aim of evaluation is to find out whether the intervenitionis are effective or the
program is havinig the desired impact. The evaluation will include both quantitative and qualitative
aspects and be conducted on1 a yearly basis. The quanititative aspects will rely on new informnatioln
systems and surveys implemented as part of the various componenits of the project, currenitly existing
data soLirces, and primary evaluative data collection efforts. The goal of the qualitative aspect of the
evaluationi will be to document perceptions of program  managers, staff, patients, and local and
national leaders. Qualitative information will be collected using site-visit interviews, focus groups,
and respondenit surveys.  A  baseline survey to collect information on1 epidemiological aspects,
k'nowledge, attitudes and sexual behavior, coverage and qLuality of services, and budgetary allocations
for HIV/AIDS and related programs will begin during project preparation and early project
implementation. The ex-post evaluation of the overall project will assess if project activities achieved
intenided results in terms of chanige in attitudes/behavior, quantity and quality of care for PLWHA,
and coverage of the program  in the country.  The COPRESIDA's PCU  will complete an
Implementationi Completion Report with inputs from  the WB, other donors, and the regionial
agencies. Project evaluation would be conducted by an outside agency.
Supervision.  The project is anticipated to require intensive supervision especially in the initial
implementation phase because of its multi-sectoral and interinistitutionial nature and the fact that this
would be the WB's first operation that would operationalize the HIV/AIDS Preventioni and Control
Multi-Country Adaptable Program Lending (APL) in the Caribbean.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The following project alternatives were considered and rejected:
An exhaustive versus a limited gamut of interventions. The following areas of intervenitioni were
chosen as the priority ones:  (i) strengthening of condom  distribution and use, control of sexually
transmitted diseases''; (ii) reducing HIV transmission from mother to child'2; (iii) voluntary testing and
counselinig for HIV/AIDS; and (iv) medical care for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS.  These
intervenitionis do not exhaust the list of possible preventioni and control activities. Trying to pursue every
single line of activity would have been beyond the collective techilical and financial capacity of the
various stakeholders. In a simulation exercise carried out in the course of project preparation, it was
estimated that some US$254  million would  be needed annually to cover an exhaustive list of
The rates of incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STls) are particularly higih in the Dominican adult
population. Chlamydia is the main cause of infection (15% prevalence rate) among ,ex workers (TRSX) who have medical
checkups. Since 1984, the trend for gonorrhea and syphilis is decreasing; however, it should be pointed out that 75% of strains
ofNeisseria gonorrhea correspond to those who are resistant to penicillil.
Prevention of vertical transmissioni to be integrated to existing reproductive health services has been recommended by WIHO
Consultation Technical Task Team. WHO Iechniical Consultation on Behalf of the LJNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/UNAIDS Inter-
Agency Task Team on MTCT of HIV. Geneva 11-13 October 2000.



213
interventions. Providing this package is unrealistic as it would be tantamount to spending 53% of
resources available for the healthi sector from all sources solely oii AIDS preventioni and control. An
alternative would have been to pursue all knowni lines of interventions but to make them available to only
some of those wlho need them (i.e., ration by coverage rather than by interventions) in order to respect the
budget constraint. The project preparation team felt that this was inadequate because this meant giviig
the same importance to intervenitions with wide differences in cost-effectiveness.
Including or excluding highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).  The cost of providing
HAART to all HIV/AIDS patients in the DR is estimated at US$926 million annually"3-or twice total
annual spending in the country's health sector. Unless the price of HAART goes down substantially,
providing suchi care to all needful patients is clearly beyond the finanlcial means of the country. It was
decided that the project would not finance anti-retroviral therapy but that the Government as part of
counterpart obligations would provide nevirapine (obtained from the patent-holder or its licensees to
prevent the mother-to-child transmission. The project would also provide limited assistance to palliative
care and to the cliical management of opportunistic infections'4 so as to mitigate the suffering of AIDS
patients and their families.
Vertical or integrated delivery. The selected interventions with cost-effective anti-retroviral drugs will
principally be delivered through the primary health care system. The adoption of a primary health care-
based approach stems from the need to take into account the process of reform and modernization of the
health sector, and of capitalizing on the opportunity that this process offers for making decisions at local
level. It is expected that this approach will make it possible to respond to local needs and make use of the
response capacity at provincial and municipal level so that the actions planned for execution can be
sustainable.
Sectoral versus intersectoral approach. The response of the DR to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been
characterized by a broad partnership involvinig the GODR, NGOs, religious groups, communities,
PLWHA, and local and interniational donors. The creation of COPRESIDA was an important GODR
decision for policy making and implementation through different sectors. The health sector clearly does
not have a monopoly on the instruments to promote behavioral changes and to break HIV transmissioni
paths. The proposed project's strategy is to support those efforts that are being conducted outside the
strict confines of the health sector and that are demonstrably cost-effective.
3 Assuming a prevalence rate of 2.8%, a population of 8.3 million and an intervention cost of $4,000 per patient per year.
4 Recent studies reveal that. in the absence of HIV infection, the incidence of TB in the country would be around 5% in adults.
In the presence of HIV infection, the incidence of TB increases to 14.5%. An estimated 5,440 cases of TB due to AIDS are
expected between now and 2005. Besides the effect on costs of medical care due to the increased incidence of tuberculosis
associated with AIDS, problems such as the appearance of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, making treatment more
difficult and costly. also arise.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project desi2n
More thani two decades of experience In attempting to control the spread of HIV and treat AIDS victims
shows that successful efforts share key features:
*  (Governm11enit commitmnenit in placing the epideiiiic in open discussion., acceptiing that a problem
exists and that thle meanis of transmission are knowil, reducilIg policy barriers and striving for
reductionl of the stigma associated witlh infectionl
  cooperation and collaboration among different groups and sectors in whicil all stakeholders
incltidinig Pl WHA, religioLIs groups, industry, NGOs, hiealth care professionals play separate but
coordinated roles and recognitioni that public sector agencies cannot address all of the issues
in volved;
*  decentralized and participatory approaches to preventioni and treatment to ensure that responses
are tailored to the needs of specific population groups and regions and to ensure sustainability
thrOLughl greater owniershiip.  Adopting a decentralized and participatory approach implies



215
substantial additional costs and time (capacity building, empowering regions and communities)
that must be understood and accounted for;
*  the creation of a National AIDS Commission is necessary to ancilor government commitment and
to coordinate the country's HlIV/AIDS response, especially if a decentralized and inter sectoral
approach is adopted;
*  actions that influenice the socioeconomic determinants of behavior that make people vulnerable to
infectioni and that seek to change behavior directly, especially of the youlng;
*  inclusion of treatment and care in country projects and the involvement of PLWHA in policy
making and the implementation of activities would lower taboos, raise hope, openness and
acceptaince of the condition;
*  adequate HIV/AIDS surveillance systems must be strengtllenied for effective monitorinig anid
evaluation of the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions; and
*  adopt good experienlces in WB financed projects related to implementation procedures that favor
flexibility, learning and innovationi, aind responsiveness to opportunities and demaind.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The GODR hlas given concrete expressioin to its comlnmitmlenlt to coordinate aild multiply efforts to
mitigate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by establishing COPRESIDA at the beginiling of 2001. COPRESIDA
operates under the leadership of a proimninent inational health and political personality aind a multi-sectoral
commissiolo, within tIle office of the President. The preparation of the proposed HIV/AIDS Prevention
and Control Project was carried out with the direct involvement of COPRESIDA members in all aspects
of the project design. The project closely mirrors the priorities established by the 2000-2004 PEN, wllici
was put togetlher tlhrough a participatory process and benefits from a higll degree of owinership from all
the stakeholders involved.
5. Value added of World Bank support in this project
WB value-added is threefold:
*  It provides new resources to scale up successful cost-effective HIV/AIDS prevelitioll activities.
The WB supported project can readily complement and fill gaps il other sources of support
(including the national budget). Amounts may be substantial compared to the current budgetary
allocations for the liealth sectors in the counltry, providing governments needed "headroom" to both
address current needs and to undertake some structural and iilstitutional improvements thlat may
sustain a longer-term HIV/AIDS program.
*  The WB is well positioned to nmake regional and interniatiollal experienlces available to the
project.
*  It provides the Government with assistance in designing a program that achieves maximum
impact at an affordable cost. Since the provision of HIV/AIDS-related services will gradually be
assimilated hilto the basic health plan provided by primary lealtll care units upon project closiing, the
ability of the counltry to take upon the financial burden of the program is a critical factor of success.
E. Summary Project Analysis (detailed assessments are in tile project file, see Anilex 14.8)
1. Economic. (see Anilex 14.4)
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis
The economic analysis indicates tlhat, in the base scenario, a minimnum decrease in the HIV incidenice rate
of 31% was needed to yield rates of return of 10% or more. The incidence rate is unlobservable. The



216
observable rate of new HIV infections is a very imperfect proxy for the incidence rate in the presence of
substantial underreporting.  The path of new  HIV  infections will depend on the initial degree of
underreportling and the degree to wlich the project corrects it. Various scenar-ios are explored and
implications for project monitorinig are derived.
Cost-effectiveness data, derived from other countries, were used to suggest whicil intervenitionis should be
given policy priority in the DR. The project will collect the relevant data to enable periodic cost-
effectiveness assessments of different sets of intervenitionis. These studies will allow revising the program
priorities to ensure proper support for those intervenitionis that have the maximum impact on reducing the
spread of the epidemic.
2. Financial (see Annex 14. 5)
The project will generate incremental recurrent costs that will have to be fully borne by the Governmenit
upoIn project closing. These costs are estimated at around $4 million a year and represent about 0.8% of
current public spendinig on health. It is expected that these costs will be easily absorbed by the GODR,
especially since the project will also generate incremenital fiscal savings that will go some way towards
offsetting these incremental recurrent costs.
3. Technical
The project follows internationally accepted best practices for HIV/AIDS responses, as validated by
UNAIDS and PAHO/WHO.  The project hinlges mainily on well tested cost-effective preventive
intervenitionis such as condom  use, preventioni of HIV vertical transmissioni, supply of safe blood,
prevention and control of STIs and TB, and face-to-face IEC for positive beliavioral chaniges, particularly
among high risk groups.
The country has a capable and experienced staff working for several years in HIV/AIDS preventioni and
conitrol programs and has bilateral agencies supporting NGOs in small-scale programs which only can be
scaled up with substanltial financial support, as is the case in the present project.
Current accepted best practices in technilcal standards for healti inifrastructure, especially the hanidlilng of
medical equipment and supplies and the disposal of medical waste have been adopted in order to
minimize environmental impact. The direct involvement of COPRESIDA  in the preparation of
componlenits ensures their consistency with national techilical standards.
4. Institutional
Executing agencies. Because the project would be multi-sectoral, participating line State Secretariats
would be in charge of implementing their respective activities included in annual implementation plans
agreed with the COPRESIDA's PCU. Technical assistance would be provided by the COPRESIDA's
PCU and thie CERSS' Administrative-Financial Unit to HIV/AIDS Units in thie respective Linie State
Secretariats and other participating organizations on an as-needed basis, mainly for strategic planinilig,
finanicial managemenit, procurement, anid the recruitment of consultanits in specialized areas. Because tile
capacity of some of the implementinig agencies must be strengthiened, projects would require governmenit
commitment of resources and staff for some of the implementinig entities. Line State Secretariats, civil
society organizations, private institutions, and NGOs, and other private sector organizations have been
actively involved in the preparation of the PEN, ensurinig their active participation in the project.
Project management. The COPRESIDA's PCU, which enjoys hiigh-level political support, is staffed
with well-trained professionals from various disciplines, who have accumulated broad experience and
expertise while working in different public and private institutionis with a loig tradition in dealing with
STIs, TB, amid HIV/AIDS preventioni and control efforts. This would lhelp to eiisLire that the project is
carried out in an effective and efficienit manner. In addition, the COPRESIDA's PCU would benefit from
the project implememitation experience of the CERSS' Admilistrative-Finanicial Unit in charge of the
implementationi of the ongoing Provincial Health Services Project (Ln. 4272-DO). This unit is already



217
four years old and has a good performance record. The Provincial Health Services Project is allead of its
disbursement schedule. The use of this unit to support the implementationi of the proposed project is also
justified by the need to keep the response to HIV/AlDS as aii integrated part of the Governmeit's strategy
to improve health outcomes and access to health services in the DR.
5. Social
The project would deal with sensitive social issues concerning HIV/AIDS and opposition may arise to
providing assistance and empowerment to vulnerable groups such as PLWHA, and especially socially
marginialized groups such as intravenous drug users, men having sex with men, and inmates. Moreover,
PLWHA and their families face continiued stigmatization and discriminationi. The project is expected to
have a very positive social impact by assisting and empowering people and institutions to deal more
effectively with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  The project, with guidance from  COPRESIDA, will
permanenitly monitor social impact and correct for social issues that may arise during implementationi.
6. Environmental assessment           Environmenital         ]  A  [X] B   []  C
Category
The medical waste produced in health care facilities is potentially iiifectious, yet most health facilities il
the DR still manage medical waste like household waste. An auspicious development, however, is the
GODB's recent enactment of two laws-the General Law on the Environ-ment and Natural Resources in
August 2000 and the General Health Law on March 8, 2001. The enactment of these laws indicates that
environmenital protection and the improving the managemenit of medical waste have become nationial
priorities. Furthermore, the laws provide a clear legal and institutional framework for addressing the
managemenit of medical waste produced in health care facilities.
An assessment of medical waste disposal infrastructure and practice was carried out and found to be
adequate for purposes of carrying out the project. Activities under the proposed project are not expected
to generate any adverse environmental effect as a large part of the program  is geared to support
preventioni activities.  Whatever additional medicals waste generated under the diagnosis and care
componenit would be managed using existing guidelines in the country.
Given the deficient environimenital situation observed in public hospitals, with support of the ongoilig
WB-finaniced Provincial Health Services Project and a parallel operation supported by the IDB, SESPAS
is implementing specific activities, as set forth in an environmental and social impact statement prepared
for those projects. These activities, as detailed in Anniex 14. 2-D, are: (i) development of policies, norms
and enforcemenit mechianiisms to control and manage liquid and solid waste in hospitals; (ii) development
of training and environmental education programs on waste managemenit for health authorities and
hospital personnel; and (iii) rehabiliationi of infrastructure and the installation of incinierators in the main
hospitals of the country for the disposal of medical wastes. Building upoIn this process, the proposed
project would support: (1) an assessment of medical care waste hanidlinig and disposal related to
HIV/AIDS programs and activities under the project; (2) the revision and updating by COPRESIDA (the
Presidential Commission for HIV/AIDS), through the SESPAS' DIGECITSS and other specialized
institutions, of the existing manual for medical waste handling and disposal; and (iii) the training of healthi
personnel associated with HIV/AIDS programs and activities under the project in the application of these
staiidards to protect high-risk human groups such as patients as well as health staff in the participatiig
facilities.
7. Participatory approach
The preparation of the 2000-2004 PEN, whichi provides the basis for the project, has been a highily
participatory one. Line State Secretariats, multilateral and bilateral agencies, and more than the 30 civil
society organizations, private sector institutions, and NGOs dealing with HIV/AIDS in the country
participated in the preparation of the operating plans formulated by all provinces.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability
Thlree factors contribute to increasinig the likelihood of program sustainability after project completion:
(i) there is a very clear political commitment at thie hiighiest level of the GODR: HIV/AIDS is considered a
matter of nationial priority given the enormous and increasiig economiiic and social cost caused by the
epidemic; (ii) because the process has been participatory, tile beneficiaries and the stakeholders hiave a
great sense of ownership of the PEN, wlich would likely continue upoIn project closing; (iii) the project
was designed to ensure that its incremenital recurrent costs can be and are picked up by the hiealthi system.

acting on general knowledge. Continuous monitoring of the
impact of activities (particularly of IEC) on behavior chanige will
be used to modify project activities as needed.
Longer tern political commitment may erode      S       The project will build institutional capacity in various sectoral
post project                                            agencies, assuring a deconcentrated HIVAIDS management in
the long term, reducing the sensitivity of thc program to political

3. Possible Controversial Aspects
The proposed HIV/AIDS Preventioni and Control Project in the DR may give rise to concerins stich as the
followinltg:
*  Some may argue that the project is not ambitious enougil. The U1S525 millioni loan will covcr a
significant share of prevention efforts but an insigiificant shiare of the needs for care. It miust be
noted that the WB loan is only one of several sources of finanicinlg for the 2000-2004 PEN.



219
* Governments may be uncomfortable working with socially excluded groups such as commercial
sex workers, intravenous drug users, prisoners, or men who have sex with men. Issues such as
distributing condoms to youth may raise cultural and religious sensitivities. The involvement of
stakeholders experienced in dealing with such issues-especially NGOs and PLWHA-will help
overcome such cultural barriers in locally appropriate ways and ensure that no groups are excluded in
program implementation
*  Although COPRESIDA represents a concrete commitment at the highest decision making level of
the GODR, there is need for practical commitments by other line State Secretariats different from
health. The project would have to display attractive initiatives for partnership and alliances withi other
line State Secretariats formally involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and control.

Annex 14.2-A
Dominicani Republic HIV/AlDS Preventioni and Control Project
Detailed Project Description
To help implement the 2000-2004 National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS (PEN), the proposed project
would support activities grouped under thiree components:
*  Componenit #1: Prevention/Promotion Activities to Reduce HIV/AIDS Transmissioni;
*  Componenit #2: Diagnosis, Basic Care and Support of Individuals Affected by HlV/AIDS; and
*  Componenit #3: Strengthieninig of the HIV/AIDS and STl Surveillanice System, and Project
Coordination, Monitorinig, Evaluation, and Research.
Component 1: Prevention/Promotion Activities to Reduce HIV/AIDS Transmission-US$17.2
million
Component I of the project would support the development of five priority intervenitionis, each of whicl is
discussed furthier below.
*  Information, education, and communicationi (JEC) activities to reduce HIV/AIDS transmissioni.
with emphasis on high-risk groups;
*  conidom social marketing programs, with emphasis on highi-risk groups;
*  improved management and treatment of STis;
*  interventiolis to prevent mother-to child transmiiissioni of HIV; and
*  quality control of HIV testing in blood banks and laboratories.
Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) Activities to Reduce HIV Transmission, with
Emphasis on High-Risk Groups. [EC programs and mass media campaigns would be implemented as
means to reachi all segments of the Dominicani population, particularly hligh-risk groups, in order to raise
awareness and understanidinig about HIV/AIDS and STIs, promote behavioral chaniges to avoid the spread
of HIV; seeking voluntary testing and counseling; and reducing stigmatizationi of HIV infected persons.
Awareness of the existence of HIV/AIDS is fairly common in the general population in the DR.
According to a 1996 survey, 92% of women and 100% of men reported that they knew of HIV/AIDS and
at least one means for preventing its sexual transmission. . However, the perception of individual risks is
low and attitudes towards PLWHA remain very negative. These factors would be taken into account in
the design of IEC activities, whichi in the end have to aim at positive behavioral chaniges to improve
perception of risk and its avoidance and to reduce biases against PLWHA.
To reduce HIV transmission, sex education, includinig preventioni of HIV/AIDS and STI, would be
introduced in the secondary schiools curricula in collaboration withi the State Secretariat of Educationi and
Culture. Face-to-face education programs for higih-risk groups, particularly commercial sex workers,
PLWHA, adolescents, street childreni, drug users, and STIs patients would be developed in collaboration
with line State Secretariats that have direct or indirect responsibilities withi these target groups.
To make IEC activities through mass media cost-effective, specific audiences to which messages would
be targeted would be chosen from among priority target groups. Experts in JEC would design campaigns

Bank.



225
for each priority group, addressing the issue of possible impact on awareness and behavioral change with
each proposed campaign and materials to be used (e.g., posters, pamphlets, brochures, manuals, press
notes, radio jingles, and TV spots).
The campaigns and materials produced with project support would be coordinated between COPRESIDA
and Line State Secretariats. Agreements to be signed between COPRESIDA and each State Secretariat
would specify the sharing of inputs and costs, time of exposure and coverage of target audiences.
The expected outputs under this subcomponent are:
*  advocacy campaigns to supportive and key policy makers, religious leaders and the press;
*  incorporation of HIV/AIDS and STI preventioni into education policies and programs;
*  implementation of sex education programs, including HIV/AIDS and STI prevention, and programs
with a face-to-face methodology;
*  design and production of IEC material on sex education aimed specifically at target population
groups;
*  teachers training to act as facilitators in school sex education programs;
*  activities to raise awareness and understanding of HIV/AIDS and STI transmission and promote safer
sexual practices;
-  targeted interventions among specific sub-groups at greater risk of contracting and/or spreading HIV
including homosexual and bisexual men, intravenous drug-users, commercial sex workers,
adolescents, inmates, truck drivers, and others, as well as activities oriented to other vulnerable
groups such as women and low income groups;
-  information on HIV/AIDS and STI prevention available to hotels, motels, nightclubs, and
entertainment places;
*  informiing and educating men and women to change their behavior and attitudes about HIV/AIDS and
STI risks;
*  empowering women by teaching negotiation skills around condom  use, and about reproductive
health.
Condom  social marketing programs, with emphasis on high-risk groups.  There is universal
knowledge about the effectiveness of the condom method for preventing STIs and HIV/AIDS, but this
has not led to a change in behavior regarding its use. This is demonstrated by the low rate of condom use
in casual sexual relations. Of persons who stated they had had sexual relations with more than one person
in the last 12 months, only 29% used condoms in their last encouniter. Condoms are seen among couples
more as an element of suspicion than a means of protection, and there is general resistance to the use of
condoms.
Distribution and access to condoms have improved significantly in recent years, through different
commercial and personal service outlets (e.g., pharmacies, grocery stores, barbershops, beauty salons),
based on the novel distribution strategies of several NGOs and the private commercial sector. However,
community distribution networks have exhibited an irregular flow of condoms, most of them donated by
international donor agencies [United Nations Population fund (UNFPA) and USAID] to NGOs dealing
with HIV/AIDS and those involved in reproductive healtlh. The unstable situation in the area of condoms
is also affected by the appearance on the local market of new commercial brands and of subsidized
condoms destined for neighboring countries and that end up in the DR.
In the country, there is no a national condom  policy to guide matters related to condom quality.
availability and distribution.



226
Currently, there are some activities that are being carried out to promote condom use. However, thiese
efforts hlave been hampered by the lack of political will to address thle negative perceptions about
condom. As a result, condom use is still a taboo subject.
Althioughi there is a law that obliges casual sex establishments (e.g., motels, brothels) to make condomlis
available, they do not comply with this law. Mechaniisimis to enforce the stipulations in AIDS Law 5593
hiave not yet been identified by the responsible agencies.
The project would support tihe scaling up of Govenmenit's efforts to promote condom use, particularly
amonig higih-risk groups. The outputs from this subcomponeilt will include:
*  Mass communicationi, face-to-face contact, condom fairs and othier promotional activities, and formal
and informal sex education programs to promote condom use and its acceptability as an effective
HIV/AIDS and STI preventioni alternative, and to reduce cLultural and social barriers to their use.
*  Extensioni of the successful "100% Condoms" campaign addressed to commercial sex workers to
other high-risk groups sucil as members of the armed forces, inimiates, inter-municipal drivers, and
migrant workers and people livinig in "bateyes".
*  Establishmelint of a nationial policy on condomii distribution with the participation of all sectors,
determininig the system and conditionis for providing thiem according to the group that demands thlem.
*  Development of a regulation framework for the public, private and NGO distribution system
(defininig a distribution network aiid identifyinig whio would be part of the network).
*  Developmenit of subsidy policies for providing easier accesses to condoms, particularly for low-
income houselholds (e.g., price reduction or free distribution).
*  Desigin. implementation and monitorinig of a system  to control quality and expiration dates of
condoms.
*  Establislhment of a system  to monitor and control condom  availability  in casual sex
establishiments (e.g., motels, brothels), applying the corresponding articles of thie HIV/AIDS Law
5593.
Improved Management and Treatment of STIs. Having an STI increases the risk of contractinig HIV
ninle-fold. Notwithstanidinig progress in statistical reporting of STIs, reliable informationi on the prevalence
of STIs in the DR is still lacking. Throughout the country, there are only 10 specialized centers for
managinig STis. Access to drugs for treating STIs is limited, and incorrect treatment provided by
phiarmacies is a common practice, leading to the spread of disease agent strains tilat are resistant to
treatment. In addition, STI services carry a stigma in the DR, mainly because commercial sex workers
use them. Few counseling services for preventing STIs are integrated with general medical care services.
Althougih a significant number of staff has been trained in the management of STI syndromes, the
inadequate supply and logistics of STI drugs leads to inefficiency and ineffectiveniess of STI control
services.
Project would support the development of the syndromic approach for STI management of
symptomatic patients to allow the rationalization of treatment according to pre-determined
clinical criteria: Expected outcomes include:
*  Strengthening of diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of STIs in health care facilities, through
*  training in STI case management, and provision of re-agents, pre-packed treatments kits,
*  including the necessary drugs for treating symptomatic vaginitis, genital ulcer disease and
*  pelvic inflammatory diseases, condoms, educational materials and other supplies;



227
* social marketing programs to promote use of kits for treating syndromes associated with STI;
* establishment of referral centers (CITS) for frequent transmitters of STIs; and
* strengthening of capacity of provincial directorates for supervising STI services.
Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV. Currently, about 2,700 of the 134,000 children
born each year in the DR are born to women infected with HIV. Of these children, approximately 930 are
born infected with HIV.  Interventions including prophylaxis with anti-retrovirals together with
nutritional baby formula could significantly decrease the number of babies infected with HIV. However,
very high costs preclude a wide use of azido-deoxy thymidinie (AZT) in pregnanit women infected with
HIV to prevent transmission to children. Currently, only one Social Security hospital (the IDSS materity
hospital) offers AZT to pregnant women. The supply of diagnostic tests, counseling, HIV prophylaxis for
infected women, traininig and the supply of nutritional baby formula can cost the country approximately
US$1,933 per infectioni prevented. Replacing breastfeeding with baby formula also carries risks, the most
frequent being unsafe drinkinig water.
Preliminary results from a pilot program being carried out in two maternity services of Santo Domingo
(Materidad La Altagracia, Materidad de los Mina, and Arned Forces and Police Hospital), and of
Puerto Plata North Region (Ricardo Limardo Hospital) indicate that giving pregnant women the anti-
retroviral drug nevirapine (accepted by the WHO Technical Task Force on HIV/AIDS as a cost-effective
anti-retroviral)16 as a prophylactic in a single dose before the delivery of a child, and giving the newborn a
single dose per day for three days, holds promise as a cost-effective means of preventinlg mother-to-child
(or vertical) transmission of HIV: 80%  of children born to HIV+ mothers in the pilot program are
negative for HIV. In addition to providing nevirapine (to be provided by the Government as part of its
counlterpart funds obligation; the Government would obtain nevirapine from  the patent holding
pharmaceutical company through a grant program), the pilot program offers advice on alternatives to
breastfeeding.
The project would support the expansion of the pilot program in Santo Domingo to the maternity services
in six provinces in the DR where sentinel surveillance is being carried out by DIGECITSS: San Juan, San
Francisco, La Romana, Puerto Plata, Barahonia, and Pedernales. Provided that results are cost-effective,
nationial policies on preventinig the vertical transmission of HIV would be issued for public and private
maternal and child health care services, and the expansion of such efforts would be pursued to the extent
that SESPAS could afford it.
Expected outputs under this componienit include:
*  Evaluation of the cliical and economic impact of prophylaxis with nevirapinie and baby formulas
*  in preventing transmission from mothers to babies;
*  development of a nationial plan and standards for the regimes for reducing vertical transmissioni;
*  implementation of voluntary HIV testing and counselinlg in maternity centers;
*  training programs for nursing and medical staff;
* development of a logistical system for distributing and timely provision of nevirapine; and,
* development of infant feeding counseling programs.

Quality Control of HIV Testing in Blood Banks and Laboratories. The country lhas approximately
300 laboratories and 60 blood banks and/or transfusioni services that perform  HIV testing withi an
acceptable level of quality and 3 referral laboratories to confirimi positive testing. The diagnosis of a
numnber of opportunistic HIV-related illnesses is deficient. Blood screenilig to detect agents that are
sexually transmitted and/or though contact with blood (syphillis, hepatitis, HIV, among others) hias hiad a
positive impact on controlling the transmission of thlese illnesses.  In the early stages of the HIV
epidemic, 10% of the incidence of AIDS cases was from blood transfusiois. Currenitly, less thani 1% of
accumulated cases have contracted the infectioni through this means.
The project would support the Government's effort to maintaini the level of efficiency achieved to date
and to increase the levels of coverage, bothi in support of HIV diagnoses and in the screening of donated
blood. The outputs from tlis subcomponent include:
*  Strengthieninig of the quality control system  of laboratories and blood banks, including the
certification of reagents authorized by SESPAS;
*  anonymous HIV testing withi pre- and post-test cOLilselilng would be establishied for blood donors and
other persons seeking the test, and trained would be provided for blood banks counselors:
*  strengtheninig quality control in laboratory testing to diagnose HIV and other STis;
*  traininig programs oii diagnosis and quality control for staff of private and public cliical
*  laboratories and blood banks;
X  encouragilng voluntary blood donationis and monitorinig blood screeninig to ensure the
-  supply of safe blood;
X  reactivation of the external system for evaluating performance of laboratories and blood
.  banks;
*  strengtlheninig of supervision of laboratories in accordance with HIV/AIDS Law 5593;
*  strengtheninig and support of referral mechianiisms to confirm positive tests for HIV and
*  other STIs; and
*  procuremenit of low-cost reagents for diagnostic tests syphilis, gonorrihea, chlainydia,
*  hlepatitis, and others. and opportunistic agents associated withi HIV/AIDS infectiolis.
Component 2: Diagnosis, Basic Care and Support of Individuals Affected by HIV/AIDS-USS4.8
million
Under this componenit, the project would support the implementationi of the following diagnostic and
basic care intervenitionis aiming at reducing disability and deathi due to HIV/AIDS, reducing the reservoir
of HIV/AIDS. and mitigating the suffering of childreni orplhaned by HIV/AIDS:
*  Organizationi of volunitary HIV testing with pre- and post-test counseling services;
*  support of hiome care for HIV/AIDS patients;
*  establishiment of basic AIDS Health Care Units;
*  implemenitationi of directly observed treatment (DOT) regimens for tuberculosis (TB) patients; and
*  support to children orphiancd by AIDS.



229
Organization of Voluntary HIV Testing and Pre- and Post-Test Counseling Service. To enforce the
HIV/AIDS Law 5593 mandating that all HIV testing should be preceded by previous counselinig and the
test report should be also accompanied by counseling, the project would support the organizationi of
voluntary HIV testing with pre and post counseling in those services offering prevention of vertical
transmissioni of HIV, and in the eight centers for basic care located in areas with high HIV/AIDS
prevalence:
*  Santo Domingo Center (Padre Billii Hospital);
*  Santo Domingo West (Herrera Hospital);
*  San Pedro de Macoris (Antoniio Musa Hospital);
*  Santiago (Jose Maria Cabral Hospital);
*  Barahona (Jaime Mota Hospital);
*  San Francisco de Macoris (San Vicente de Paul Hospital); and
*  Puerto Plata (Ricardo Limardo Hospital);
*  La Romana (SESPAS Hospital)
These centers would open these services to the public and would promote voluntary HIV testing and
counseling. The main constraints for organizing these units are inadequate space and equipment, as well
as number of trained personnel for counseling.  The project would support the rehabilitationi and
refurbishing of physical infrastructure, purchase of equipment, and training of staff.
Support of Home Care of HIV/AIDS Patients. Care of HIV/AIDS patients require simple but precise
and reliable compliance with indications and drug administration. Most care activities can be carried out
at home with appropriate training of staff and support services in neighboring hospitals or referral centers.
Benefits and savings rendered with appropriate home care to HIV/AIDS patients are important
justifications for includiig this interveitioni for project support. Home care also reduces the stigma and
taboo in the community where patients live.
The project would support home care for HIV/AIDS patients. Home care would be separate but
coordinated with hospital care. The project would support the development and printinig of training
manuals, training for healthi staff at local and provincial levels, counseling for relatives of the patients,
and basic clinical tools for patient check ups and laboratory testing.
Establishment of Basic AIDS Health Care Units in selected hospitals. Provincial and local hospitals
are reluctant to offer hospital care when needed to HIV/AIDS patients, and usually refer them to the
Integrated Care Unit of the Santo Domingo's National Sanitary Center.
To allow hiospital care to be provided to HIV/AIDS patients close to the patient's place of residence,
family, and friends, with project support, SESPAS would make available basic hospital care for
HIV/AIDS patients. To this end, Basic AIDS Health Care Units would be established in the following
hospitals located in areas of the country with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS cases:
*  Santo Domingo Center (Padre Billini Hospital) and Santo Domingo West (Herrera Hospital) serving
about 2 million people and with an estimated 10% prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults;
*  San Pedro de Macoris (Antonio Musa Hospital) covering about 1 50,000 people and many highi-risk
groups in free trade zones and tourism centers where STIs are highly prevalent;
*  Santiago (Jose Maria Cabral Hospital), with about 500,000 people, with a large segment living in
poverty and increasing migrationi from neighboring Haiti;
*  Barahonia (Jaime Mota Hospital), with about 80,000 people and a growing number of HIV cases,



230
*  especially in young adults;
*  San Francisco de Macoris (San Vicente de Paul Hospital), with about 120,000 people and about 20
deaths by AIDS per year; and
*  Puerto Plata (Ricardo Limardo Hospital) with about 100,000 people, where AIDS is the first cause of
death amaonig young women (I15- 49 years of age).
The project would support the rehabilitationi and refurbishinig of physical infrastructure in hospital wards,
traininig of healthi personilel, HIV testing with pre and post counselinig, development of best practice
guidelines for managing opportunistic diseases, testing, and cost-effective treatment of opportunistic
diseases, group therapy for HIV/AIDS patients and families, mourilinig management, basic general
hospital care. No anti-retroviral treatmenit would be finaniced by the project, except for preventioni of
vertical HIV  transmission  under the preventioni of mother-to-child transimiissioni of HIV/AIDS
subcomponenit described above.
The development of a nationial policy regarding the provision of drugs for opportunistic infectionis, and
the establishment of a logistical system to make the supply of drugs for prophylaxis and treatment of
some opportunistic infectionis associated with HIV/AIDS more efficient would also be supported.
In coordinationi withi the ongoinig Provincial Health Services Project, support would be provided in
participating hospitals for conductinig an assessment of medical care wastes hanidlinig and disposal related
to HIV/AIDS programs and activities, preparation of a manual to address proper hanidlinig and disposal of
medical wastes, and training of health personilel.
Implementation of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) for Tuberculosis (TB) Patients. TB is the
principal opportuinistic infectioni and the leading cause of death of HIV/AIDS patients in the country. At
the same time, HIV infectionl has become an important risk for TB patients. Although reliable nationial
figures are not available, some estimates consider that approximately 10% or more of TB patients are
HIV+. To enhanice TB prevention and control activities, the project would support the implementation of
DOTS for TB patients, starting with a few provinces and expandinig througlhout the country, giving
priority to the areas where HIV/TB co-infectioni constitutes a serious healtlh problem.  Under this
component, in coordination with ongoitg activities supported by USAID and PAHO/WHO, the project is
expected to strengtheni the following:
  Provision of care for highi-risk groups: inmates, people living in beteyes, and persons requestinig
*  HIV testing.
*  the laboratory iietwork in priority provinces of the country;
*  the supervisioni and evaluationi capacity oftthe National Tuberculosis Program;
*  joint activities between TB and STD/AIDS programs:
*  healthl worker training, as well as training for workers in other sectors that participate in TB
*  control; and
*  activities by the TB Programs of the Dominicanl Republic to control TB in border areas with Haiti.
Support to Children Orphaned by AIDS. To provide support to childreni affected by AIDS, existing
community organizations (such as "Villa Bendicion," and "Aldeas SOS") would be contracted under th e
project to run 2 or 3 pilot initiatives concenatratinig on schooling and healthi of childreni orphanied by AIDS
following different models, promotioni of efforts to reduce stigma and misperceptions about orphanis, and
strengthieninig of support networks withinl the childreni's commun1ities, includinig psychosocial support and
life-skills development.  Replications would be considered on the basis of results of evaluation of
experience with sucIh initiatives.



231
Component 3: Strengthening HIV/AIDS and STI Surveillance System, and Project Coordination,
Monitoring, Evaluation and Research-US$7.75 million
Under this componenit, the project would support:
*  Improvements in the HIV/AIDS and STI disease surveillance system; and
*  HIV/AIDS program coordiniation, monitoring, evaluation anid research activities.
Strengthening HIV/AIDS and STI Disease Surveillance System. The project would support the
strengtheniing of the SESPAS' surveillanice system to increase the knowledge of the health situation in
general, and of the HIV/AIDS/STI situation in particular, to improve decision-making and resource
allocationi. Priority would be given to the development and imlplemenitationi of a second generationi HIV
surveillance system according to UNAIDS recom-nmendations. Specifically the project would support: (i)
the development of standardized protocols for undertaking cross-sectional surveys of belhavior, including
collection of data on site and population clharacteristics, focusing on high-risk groups and in the general
population; sentinel HIV sero-surveillance among pregnant women, urban and rural, focusing on younger
age groups; and surveillance of TB and other HIV/AIDS related illnesses; (ii) the expansion of
participating hlealth facilities, laboratories and blood banks for HIV  sentinel surveillance and
expansion/upgrading of the HIV/AIDS and STI case notification system; (iii) the development of a
HIV/AIDS information system and respective information technology (IT) platform; and (iv)  the
integration of multi-sectoral databases with a management information system to improve collection of
vital registration data, support HIV-AIDS-STI situational analysis,. case management and decision
making.
Project Coordination, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research Support would be provided to
strengthen technical and managerial capacity for strategic planning, project coordination,
financial management, communication, dissemination of best practices for target interventions,
establish and manage networks of technical expertise in HIV/AIDS, STI and TB to inform policy
decisions, and implementation at all levels. Project would also support the development of
monitoring and impact evaluation systems to enable the COPRESIDA's PCU to monitor and
evaluate performance of project implementation, including conducting baseline, mid-term, and
impact evaluation, and assessment of yearly budgetary allocations by Government to support and
sustain the scaling up of HIV/AIDS programs. The undertaking of studies would also be
supported to increase DR's capacity for research on HIV/AIDS (e.g., national study of STD
transmission, study on syndromic STD case management, HIV prevalence studies among high-
risk groups, assessment cost and impact of interventions, behavior case trend assessments,
among others).

Annex 14.2-D
Dominiicani Republic HlV!AlDS Preventioi anid Control Project
Medical Waste Management Assessment in the Dominican Republic
The recent enactment of two new laws In the DR are an encouraginig sign that the GODB is committed
both to protecting the enviromnenit and to reducing the risks posed by the improper managemenit of
medical waste. These laws provide a new framework for managinig infectious and otlher medical waste
that poses healtih risks to patients and health care staff, as well as to people who are exposed to such waste
outside health facilities.
The solid waste produced in health facilities is potentially hlazardous, infectious, contagious. or toxic,
producing the risk of the spread of diseases.
The proposed HlIV/AIDS Preventioni and Control Project, building on the World Bank-finianiced
Provincial Health Systems Project, would support activities related to the haiidlinig of medical waste from
patients infected with HIV/AIDS in the Dominican Republic. Specifically, it would support (1) an
assessment of medical care waste handling and disposal related to HIV/AIDS programs and activities; (2)
the developmenit and adoption of a manlual to address proper hanldlling and disposal of medical waste; and
(30 the training of health personinel associated with HIV/AIDS preventioni and control programs and
activities supported uLider the project.
'The following sections ofthis docum-len1t:
*  Describe what constitutes medical waste and discusses the management of medical waste;
*  Provide an overview of the new legal and institutional framework for addressing the problem of
medical waste in the DR;
*  Discuss investmenits finaniced ulider the ongoiig WB-finaniced Provincial Health Systems Project in
the Dominicaan Republic; and
  Identify how the proposed HIV/AIDS Preventioni and Control Project will contribLite to addressing
the problem of medical waste in the Dominican Republic.
A. What Constitutes Medical Waste
Medical waste is defined as any material disposed of by a hiealth facility, whiether it be in solid, liquid, or
gaseous state. Health facilities are understood to be public hospitals, private centers, clinical laboratories,
pharmacies, etc.
According to the interinationial standards dictated by the WHO, medical waste falls into the followiig
categories:
General medical waste. This category includes paper and byproducts, plastic and glass products, and
noni-inifectious materials.
Special biomedical waste. This is infectious or other waste produced by a health facility that poses
healthi risks botih withill the health facility and beyond it.
Infectious biomedical waste. This includes blood, secretions, needles, syringes, vaccines, and pointed or
sharp materials that may have been contaminiated with infectious agents. Preventive measures In halidlilig
and final disposal of such waste are important.
Chemical waste.  This includes disinfectanits and other chemicals used for examTrinationis, research,
cleaning, etc.. Special regulations are required for the handling and final disposal of such chemical waste.



237
Radioactive waste.  This is waste contaminated with radioactive substances used in diagnostic
examinations or special therapeutic procedures. The elimination of radioactive waste requires specialized
procedures because of its hazardous nature.
Anatomical waste. This consists of corpses or humani remains from births, abortions, mutilations, or
surgical operations. Anatomical waste poses a great risk spreading infection. Both forensic medicinie
regulations and ethical considerationis are important in the halidling of such waste.
Internationally accepted standards establish a total production of medical waste between 3.3 and 11
pouLids per bed per day. Eighty -percent of this consists of general medical waste arid the remaining 20%
consists of special biomedical waste, approximately 14% of which corresponds to infectiotis waste. A
study performied in 1992 by the Universidad Aut6noma de Santo Domingo, based on the analysis of a
sample of 29 public and private health facilities in the DR, found that the production of medical waste per
bed per day was 5.5 pounds.
lnterinationially accepted standards for the % ages of waste produced by various corliponienits of health
facilities are as follows: food service (50%); hospitalizationi service (18%); maternity service (8%);
emergency service and orthopedics (8%); surgery (5%); and administrative, diagnostic arid other services
(I 1%). The 1992 study of 29 public and private health facilities in the Dominicani Republic found the
following distribution of waste production by type of service: (25.6%); kitchen (20.8%); surgery (11%),
and outside consultationi (9.2%).
B. Approaches to the Management of Medical Waste
This managemenit of medical waste requires special care that requires the provision of information and
training to the staff of a health facility that are involved in the various aspects of waste production and
management. The waste management process has several phases, which control waste from the point of
production to its final disposal, as detailed below:
Classification. Classification of waste at the point of production (i.e., separating infectious and
hazardous waste frorn the conventional waste stream with the goal of reducing the amouiit of waste
that needs to be specially treated) makes it possible to reduce the volume of infectious waste and
minimize treatment costs.
a      Internal collection. Intenmal collection refers to the use of special containers, designed for the
type of waste to be hanidled, placed near where the waste is produced and used only once.
Internal transfer. The shortest route between the point of production arid initerrnediate storage
of waste should be selected for the internal transfer of waste. Waste containers should be checked to
ensure that they are closed. Special measures should be taken to protect the staff involved in transfers.
Storage. The storage place where the containers with waste are held before the treatment and/or
finial disposal of the waste should be equipped with hermetically sealed containers.
*      External transport. The transport of waste from the point of intermediate storage to the waste
treatment point should be done using special vehicles that can be disinfected.
*  Treatment.  Waste treatment includes methods, techniques, or procedures that chanige the
characteristics of waste, reducing or eliminating the possibility that the waste will affect people's
health or the environment.
The WHO has identified several procedures for medical waste treatment:
*      Incineration. lncineration involves burning waste in a medium under controlled conditions to
oxidize the carbon anid hydrogeni present in the waste. This method reduces the volume of solid waste
by 80-95%. Althouglh incinerationi can produce environni7ental toxins sLuch as dioxin if adeqLate



238
controls are not adopted, it is often recommended because it is the only waste treatment method
applicable to all types of biomedical waste.
Steam sterilization. This method involves submitting the waste to steam inside an Autoclave, at
an adequate temperature and pressure and for a determined time.
*      Gas sterilization. This method consists of destroying pathogenis present in waste by placing
them in a compressed air chamber in which sterilizing agents are introduced, such as ethylenie oxide
or formaldehyde.
*      Chemical disinfection. This process involves treating waste with liquid chemical disinfectants.
*      Other methods of sterilization. Other methods of waste treatment that are less commonly used
are including exposure to ultraviolet radiation or microwaves.
C. The Dominican Republic's New Legal and Institutional Framework for Handling Medical
Waste
The enactment of the General Law oni the Environment and Natural Resources in August 2000 and the
enactment of the General Health Law on March 8, 2001, that was prepared with support of the World
Bank-finaniced Health Services Project, are an auspicious development in the DR. The enactment of these
laws indicates that environmental protection and the improving the managemenit of medical waste have
become priorities for the GODR. As discussed below, the laws also provide a clear legal and institutional
framework for addressing the management of potentially hazardous, infectious, contagious, or toxic waste
produced in health facilities.
General Law on the Environment and Natural Resources
The purpose of the General Law on the Environment and Natural Resources was to establish guidelines
for the conservation, protection, improvement, and restoration of the environmenit and natural resources,
thus assuring their sustainable use and to create institutions to take the lead in addressing issues related to
the protection of the environment and natural resources.
The General Law on the Environment and Natural Resources created the State Secretariat of Environmenit
and Natural Resources as the lead agency for environmental management. In addition, it designated the
National Council for the Environment and Natural Resources as the body responsible for programming
and evaluating policies and for a biodiversity conservation strategy. This council is composed of the
State Secretariats of Environment and Natural Resources, of Agriculture and Livestock, of Public Health
and Social Assistance, Education, Public Works, Armed Forces, Tourism, Industry and Commerce,
Foreign Affairs, Labor, along with the Municipal League, the Natural Resources Institute, and regional
representatives of NGOs, peasant organizations, universities (public and private), and the nationlal
business sector.'7
Responsibility for the handling and disposal of waste water is distributed by territoriality: the Santo
Domingo Aqueduct and Sewer Corporation (CASAD) of the National District; the Santiago Aqueduct
and Sewer (CORAASAN) of the province of Santiago; and the National Institute of Drinking Water and
Sewers (INAPA) in the country's other provinces.
Several special offices and commissions created by decree also have objectives related to environimenital
preservation, including the Commission for the Study of Causes of Environimenital Pollution (Decree
2596-72); National Council of Radiology Protection (Decree 413-91); National Commission to Monitor
Agreements of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and the developmenit of the "Land
17 Prior to the enactment of the Genceal Law on the Environment and Natural Resources in August 2000. the responsibility for
environmental protection in the Dominican Republic was shared by several institutions. They included the State Secretariat of
Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS); the Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS); city councils; the State
Secretariat of the Armed Forces; and the General Bureau of Forestry.



239
Summit" (Decree 340-92): Office for the Reforn  and Modernizationi of the Drinking Water and
Sanitation Sector (Decree 203-98); National Institute of Environmental Protection (Decree 216-98); and
the Coordinating Commission of the Natural Resources and Environment Sector, created by Decree 152-
98.
General Health Law
The General Health Law enacted on March 8, 2001, incorporates major chaniges in the DR's health care
organizationl and finanicinig. Provisions of the Gieneral Health Law pertaining to the management of
medical waste, whichi supersede provision of previous laws dealing with this topic,'  are summarized
below.
SECTION IV-Solid Waste
Art. 46. The State Secretariat of Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS), in coordination with the
State Secretariat of Enviro-nmenit and Natural Resources and other relevant institutionis, shall prepare the
official regulations that govern the disposal and managemenit of solid waste whose use, collection,
treatment, holding, recoii version, industrializationi, transport, storage., elimination, or final disposal may
be hazardous to the population's health.
Art. 47. The institutionis of the health system and all those hiealth facilities which, due to their operations,
utilize toxic or radioactive materials or substances, contaminanits or other substances that may spread
elements which are pathogenic or harmful to health, should have waste elhiminationi systems developed in
terms of the pertinent regulation prepared by the SESPAS, in coordinationl with the State Secretariat of
E.nvironimenit and Natural Resources and other relevant institutiols.  Medical waste shall be stored
separately, technically treated In the establishment of origin and/or delivered to the correspondinlg
municipality or institution, as the case may be, for transport and proper final disposal.
Art. 48. Health autlhorities must inforimi the State Secretariat of Einvironimilenit and Natural Resources about
those establishments or places whichl constitute a hazard to the healtlh or life of the population due to
undue, unhygieniic accumulation of solid waste, so that said Secretariat may order them to be cleaned and
may execute the correspondinig administrative and safety measures.
SECTION V-Disinfection and other Measures
Art. 67. Those substances or objects that, by favoring the spread of diseases and causing harm to people's
health, are considered hazardous shall be handled, sterilized, or destroyed by their owners or those in
charge, or by the health authority itself, following the instructions and regulations that are prepared for
this purpose by the health authority, in coordinationl with the relevant envirolimenltal authority and
without jeopardizing compliance with prevailing environmental regulations and measures.
Paragraph. SESPAS shall collaborate witlh the State Secretariat of Enviro1nmen1t and Natural Resources
on the preparation of a list of hazardouIs substances and products, on the constanit updating of this list, and
on the preparation of regulations governinig the waste management of these substances.
Art. 68. The owners, directors or heads of health or medical care facilities and other places where humani
groups stay or pass througlh. should avoid the spread of transmissible diseases within their establishment
or towards the community, and shall be responsible for ensuring that the establishment has the necessary
elements to avoid SuChl spread, and that the staff of their agency carry out prophylactic practices in a
timely and proper maniner.
18Prior to the enactment of the General Health Law. medical wastc problems were addressed by a diversity of codes and laws,
including the National Public }]ealth Code (1956) and general health care guidelines contained in Health Law 456-38: Law
1459-38 on Health Procedures: the 1956 ILabor Code; and Law 1896-62 on Social Security and General Hospital Regulations
(Decree 351-99).



240
Art. 100. SESPAS is responsible for equipping the institutions or health establishmenits and, togethier with
the advisory unit of the National Commission for the Accreditation of Clinics and Private Hospitals, for
accrediting these institutions, ensuring the application of rules related to the minimum  requirements
which, according to their classification, said institutions should meet, with regard to physical installations,
equipmenit, personnel, organizationi and operation, to ensure that the user receives a proper level of care,
even in the case of disasters.
Paragraph I. ln coordination with the corresponding institutions of the nationial health system, SESPAS
shall regulate, by resolutiolln, the equipping, operation and accreditation of health establishments and
promote quality assuranice, which shall be carried out throughi the assessment of public and private
establishmenits, by rules and mandatory minimum criteria, and of their staff.
Paragraph II. SESPAS shall establish the general regulatory guidelines based upon which the duties
assigned in this article shall be complied with.
Art. 101. The professionals or technical directors of health establishments in which natural or artificial
radioactive material, or equipment designed for the emission of ionized radiation for diagnostic, medical
therapy or dental purposes or for scientific research, is used should seek a permit from SESPAS that
endorses their activities, without jeopardizing the duties of the State Secretariat of Environimenit and
Natural Resources in this regard.
Art. 102. The boards of directors and the admilistrationi of health establishmelits shall be responsible for
ensuring that staff correctly and properly performs their duties, so as not to expose the health or life of
patients to unlllecessary risk due to the lack of technilcal or therapeutic elements for reasons of unihealthiy
environmental conditiolls.
Art. 106. Health laboratories shall be directed by an expert in the subject who is duly accredited il the
correspondinig discipline and who shall be responsible for the establishmenit's progress, compliaiice with
biosafety regulations, suitability of operations, and precision and quality in reports issued on the results of
analyses.
Paragraph. Authorized staff who perform analyses or special testing in public, private, civilian, military,
and other laboratories, should adjust their work to the technical regulations stipulated by the Laboratory
and Blood Bank Divisions of SESPAS. Said staff shall be subject to technical control of the quality of
their analyses of the aforementioned divisions.
SECTION VI - Blood Banks, Blood Transfusion Services, And Serology Control
Art. 107. The drawing of humanl blood, the fractionating and industrial transformationi of human blood,
and the practice of any of the activities mentioned in this article, may only be performed in blood banks
and in blood derivative plants authorized SESPAS, whicih shiall define, through the corresponding
regulation, the rules for the installationi, operation and control of these establishments, in coordination
with perthienit institutionis.
Paragraph I. The supply and transfusion of blood and its derivatives constitutes an act of legal and ethical
responsibility. Doctors shall be the healthi professionals trained and authorized to thierapeutically prescribe
humani blood, its components and derivatives, in accordance with the disease to be treated.
Paragraph ll. The iistitutionis of the National Health System shall ensure that their blood banks perform
mandatory testing of blood and its derivatives, according to the prevailing  interinationial regulationis of
WHO, as well as pre-transfusioni compatibility testing.  No product may be transfused without the
respective quality certification. SESPAS shall ensure compliance with this provision.
Paragraph Ill. A duly accredited staff member in terms of the nature of such banks and centers shall
direct blood banks and hemotherapy centers.



241
Paragraph IV. The technique of aphaeresis, as a means of fractionating to obtain blood derivatives, may
only be used by blood banks that are qualified and expressly authorized by authority of SESPAS. This
should correspond to a concrete program, associated with the country's needs, in accordance with the
regulation prepared by SESPAS, and in coordination with institutions specialized in this subject.
D. Related investments financed under the World Bank Provincial Health Systems Project in the
Dominican Republic
In 1999, SESPAS, requested that the Executive Commission for the Reforn of the Health Sector
(Comisi6n Ejecutiva para la Reforma del Sector Salud, or CERSS), through the WB-financed Provilcial
Health Systems Project and a parallel project financed by the IDB, support the provision of technology
for the treatment and final disposal of waste in the main health facilities around the country. As a result,
the Provincial Health Systems Development Project has invested nearly US$1 million in the DR to date,
to strengthen the medical waste management capacity of SESPAS' health care facilities. The vast
majority of the resources (apart from about US$50,000 devoted to civil works) has been used to helped
several hospitals purchase incinierators to treat medical waste and to support training of staff in the
operating of this equipment and the management of medical waste:
*      Purchase of incinerators by hospitals for the purpose of treating medical waste. Incinerators,
along with peripheral equipment (identified containers) and services related to training in the operation
and maintenance of equipment, have already been purchased and installed in several hospitals. They
include the San Vicente de Paul Hospital in Duarte Province, Luis Bogaert Hospital in Valverde
Province, Pascasio Toribio Piantini Hospital in Salcedo, Jaime Mota Hospital in Barahona, as well as
the Arned Forces Central Hospital, Nuestra Sefiora de la Altagracia Maternity Hospital, Los Minas
Maternity Hospital, Moscoso Puello Hospital, Robert Reid Cabral Children's Hospital, and the Luis E.
Aybar Complex in the city of Santo Domingo. Of the incinerators installed, however, only two are
operatinig at full capacity, and it is expected that the rest will be fully operational by June 2001. This
situation is due in part to the fact that the staff trained to operate the equipment at some hospitals have
left or taken on other functions.
*      Training. Training courses in the operation and maintenance of the medical waste incinierators
and in managing medical waste withini the hospital were carried out successfully in all hospitals:
Training in the operation and mainteniance of the medical waste incinerators was provided to at least
three people per hospital. It included training relate to the features of the equipment (e.g., electrical
installation, gas-oil connectioni, ash removal) and the operation of the equipment (e.g., startup,
shutdown of the installation, operating regulations, safety checks),
Training in the management of medical waste within the hospital was provided to hospital staff (20 per
establishment). This course was generally well accepted, both in terms of attendance and participation,
and it has raised expectations about improving the way in which medical waste is managed. At most
hospitals, attendance was complete, with between 25 and 30 people, including mid-level and higher
level staff, on average per course. The exception was Los Minas Hospital, where only about 10 people
(mostly maintenance staff) attended. At Luis E. Aybar Hospital, about 50 people attended, including
nursing students who were very interested in the subject. In some cases, techinical staff, especially from
central services departments attended the course at different hospitals.  At several hospitals, the
instructors were asked to repeat the talks at another time so that staff that was not able to attend the first
time could then do so.
A key challenge in the DR's health facilities is to devise mechanisms to keep the trained personnel who
work in the waste collection and storage process. Furthermore, it was confirmed during the training
process that the problem  of handling such waste in health facilities is considered a housekeeping
problem-so medical and paramedical staff does not participate in the waste management process.



242
Hospitals' Strong and Weak Points in Addressing the Problem of Medical Waste
The Provincial Health Systems Development Project assessment team reported prior to the installation of
the incinierators in 2001 that there is no management of medical waste by hospitals in the DR, with the
exception of Robert Reid Chlildren's Hospital, where waste selection is begininig to be performed and
some clear criteria exist. In general, hiospitals in the DR exihibit the same strengthis and weaknesses in
addressing thie problem of medical waste:
Weak points in addressing the problem:
*  All waste at the hospital is treated in the same way.
*  There is no differentiationi of medical waste by types, based on1 tlheir danger and/or the social alarm
produced, except for the separation of needles and sharp objects in some hospitals.
*  The only type of waste that is treated differently is a placenta, which) in some centers is washied
manually to keep fluids from dripping (La Altagracia Maternity Hospital) and in others ends up in
septic tanks (Pascasio Toribio Hospital).
*  Where bags are used for waste, they are only one color;
*  Where bags are used, they are not as thick as is advisable (>55 rn.), so they often break.
I In most cases, sufficient means for possible waste separation are lacking. There are no proper trash
containiers.
*  There are no special containiers for sharp or pointed objects.
*  The staffs that generate waste lack proper training in the elemenits of correct management. The bags
are so overfilled that they caninot be closed. Capped and uncapped needles are throwin in the bags. In
some emergency units, needles can be observed on the floor.
Waste collection personiel are unaware of minimum safety standards for waste managemenlt. In
some cases, they do not use gloves or they use inadequate ones, and they do not wear specific
clothing for the task.  Bags are not hanidled correctly (e.g., bags are sometimes carried on the
shoulders).
*  The transport of waste from thle unlits to the waste dump is sometimes done in vehicles, sometimes
inot.
*  In waste dumps, it is common to find a large quantity of waste that hias been tlhrown out witlhout use
of plastic bags.
*  With the exception of centers whose installations have a municipal storage container, waste storage
sites are in poor conditions. They lack doors and allow the access of children and animals. They lack
cleaninig hoses and/or fire extinguishiers.
Strong points in addressing the problem:
*  There is awareness in lhospitals of the issue of waste, both by personinel and manageinenit. Awareness
is not as strong among janitorial and trash collection staff, especially because they are unaware of the
risk.
*  There is an important potential among persons interested in participating in and doing somethilig
about waste managemenit.
*  There is external awareness about the current way in which waste is eliminated, both among the
public and autlhorities.



243
*  A  credible process has begun, aimed at improving waste management.  The installatioll of
incineration plants in the seven hospitals is a sign of this.
*  A draft plan for Hospital Hygiene Standards developed by SESPAS has been put in place.
Conclusions
The Provincial Health Systems Project assessment team concluded that implementatiol of a waste policy
for any hospital in the DR will coine Up against two essential difficulties: (i) material meanis, and (ii) the
awareness and preparation of staff. The assessment team made the following recoiimenidatiolns currently
under implemenitationi with respect to improving the preparation of staff:
*  Create a Waste Management Commission in each hospital.   Each hospital's Waste
Management Commission should include staff from different occupations whio participate in the
hospital's daily operations or in that environment-i.e., an epidemiologist, a nurse, a janitor, and an
engineer-and shotild be charged with preparing a Waste Plan for the hospital that establishes waste
generationi points, collection routes, storage points, and waste managemenit responsibilities for various
parties.
*  Offer hospital staff training in waste management. Staff should be offered a three to four
hours traininig course on waste management that is tailored to their particular needs. For example,
maintenanice and janitorial staff are at special risk in hanidlinig waste. Nursing staff and nursinig
students (very important) could benefit from training related to the generationi of medical waste.
=  Involve outside consultants. Outside consultanits should be involved in the presentation) of
training courses and subsequently to provide support to the Waste Managemenit Commission in: (i)
the establishinenit of an initial work plan, (ii) follow-up/correction, and (iii) final evaluation.
E. The Proposed HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project
As suggested earlier, public healthi problems generated by the managemenit of medical waste affect the
hospital population-that is, medical and paramedical staff, patients (and visitors), and service
employees-but also affect the population outside the hospital. One of the main concerns regardinig
mnedical waste in the DR is the possible transmission of diseases such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B through
wouLids caused by contaminated needles. Thie population groups at greatest risk from this are: (i) patients
and health personiel; (ii) staff of hospital support services (trash collectors, treatment plant operators,
etc.); and (iii) patients at high risk of contracting infections (e.g., people with diabetes, people with AIDS:
drug addicts).
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, building upon and complementinig the activities
supported under the Provincial Health Services Project, contemplates interventionis under Componienit 2 to
reduce HIV/AIDS transmission, aimed at protecting high-risk humani groups such as patients and healthi
staff within and outside hospitals, preserving the environmenit by establishing proper systems and
processes for the management and treatment of contaminated hospital waste. Specifically, it would
support: (i) an assessment of medical care waste handling and disposal related to HIV/AIDS programs
and activities under the project; (ii) the revision and updating by COPRESIDA  (the Presidential
Commission for HIV/AIDS), through the SESPAS' General Directorate of Sexually Transimitted
Infections and AIDS (DIGECITSS) and other specialized institutionis, of the existing manual for medical
waste hanidlinig and disposal; and (iii) the training of healthi personnel associated with HIV/AIDS
programs and activities under the project in the application of these standards to protect higih-risk human
groups such as patients as well as health staff in the participating facilities.
The manual would address procedures for health center staff with regard to the handling, transport,
treatment, and final disposal of medical waste, as well as the provision of required equipmenit and inputs.

with special attentioni to the hanidlinig of sharp and pointed objects (tlie main risk of viral contaminiatiofn
inside hospitals), beginning at the point where the waste is generated, through the use of receptacles for
the collection, storage, and disposal of sharp and pointed objects. The receptacles for sharp objects
shiould be synthetic fiber containiers, withi a hiermetically sealable translucenut cover to keep liquids from
spilling. They should hiave rounded edges to avoid cuts to staff involved in liandlinig and should be
identified with international coding for biohazard us waste. Differentiated routes withlin the lhealth
establishiment should be defined to transport the special containers, phiysical identificationi of routes, as
well as inputs and training for the staff responsible.
The above-mentionied activities should be complemented by the provision of hiospital waste treatment
equipment financed under the Provincial Healthi Services Project and the parallel IDB project, wlich
include the training of staff assigned to this work, with regard to the operation and maintenanice of such
equipment. Tlis treatment should ensure that the local governments of each locality could carry out the
final disposal of residual waste, without any risk to their staff or to the environimenit.

Dominicani Republic HIV/AIDS Preventioni and Coiitrol Project
Cost-Benefit or Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Summary
A. Preamble
The economic justification for some form  of public intervenitioni (finanicinig, provision, regulation or
mzanidates) in IIIV/AIDS preventioni derives from two maini considerationis: (i) the HIV/AIDS epidemic
generates negative externalities and, as such, is unlikely to provoke an adequate purely private response:
private agents invest less in HIV/AIDS prevention thani they would if they internialized those externalities
(thie market failure argument); (ii) HIV/AIDS inflicts significant costs (lost productivity and increased
ieed for Ilealth care) LupOn families. Paying for care out-of-pocket is liable to impoverish families and
Linilisured poor families simply cannot afford such care; the epidemic is therefore likely to increase the
discrepancy in healthi status between thle rich and the poor (the equity argument). A discussion of criteria
to guide public finanlciig decisions can be found in Musgrove (1999), Jack (2000) and Musgrove
('-000) ', Once it has been established that some forn of public intervenitioni is justified, a cost-benefit
analysis can be helpful in determininig the feasibility of the proposed investmenit aiid a cost-effectiveness
ana]ysis can help set priorities among the possible intervenitiolis.
B. Cost- Benefit Analysis
Sumiarv of Benefits and Costs
The cost of the program runis at about $30 million over a 5-year period and the proposed objective is to
reduce thie rate of newly reported HIV infectionis by 10% by the end ofthie project implementationi period.
Since the project will improve the reporting system, it is expected that the observed number of new cases
could actually increase in the first few years even while true incidenice, whichi is less readily observable, is
expected  to  decline. The  discrepancy  between  newly  reported  cases and  incidence  is due  to
uliderreportinig. As the reporting system  improves, the discrepancy is expected to decrease significanltly.
Siice the benefits of the project are liiked to a reduction in incidenice, the cost-benefit analysis was
conducted withi incidenice rather thani newly reported infectionis as the target parameter. The analysis was
fiamed to answer the following question: what is the minimum reduction in incidenice required to obtain
rates of return above 1 0%. By making various assumptions about the degree of underreporting, it is theni
possible to hypothesize how the unobservable reduction in incidetice translates into an observable
reductioni in newly reported infectionis.
Two hypothietical scenarios of the evolution of HIV/AIDS prevalence and incidenice were constructed.
The first (with-project scenario) assumes a decrease in HIV incidenice by 50%  over the lifetine of the
project. The second (without-project scenario) constanicy of the HIV  iicidenice rate. The difference
between these two scenarios theni yields the number of HIV infectionis averted due to the project. Table
Al 4.4-1 presents a scenario where the incidence rate decreases linearly to half its original value over a
five-year period. Table A 14. 4-2 shows what would have happenied if the incidence rate had stayed at its
initial level.
The following assumptions, some of wvhich are educated guesses, are made: (i) the 'natural' population
growth rate for the period is 1.6%; (ii) incidence is taken to be 5 1.5 per million in year 0: (iii) the number
of deaths due to AIDS in year I is calculated as 0.53%  of prevalence in year i-I: and (iv) prevalence in
Near t is equal to prevalence in year t-l + incidence in year I - AIDS deaths in year t.

From tables A14.4-1 and A14.4-2, the number of infections averted due to the project can be derived. In
turn, it is possible to obtain rough estimates of the productivity losses and cost of treatment thus averted
with the use of the following parameters: (i) on average, averting HIV infection 'buys' an individual ten
more years of productive life; (ii) average annual productivity is valued at 1999 GDP per capita
(US$1,910); (iii) a patient who gets infected will live for 10 years with adequate care; (iv) the average
aniual cost of care per patient is US$38420; (v) the consumption benefits of a lower HIV prevalence are
not factored in.

The valuation of productivity losses obviously is a lower bound on the value of lives lost to the disease.
The stream of benefits is supposed to last 12 years after project closing2". The rates of return associated
with the project were calculated using the assumptions discussed above.
20 This is calculated as $210 + 3 x current health spending per capita ($58), which mirrors the hypothesis made in the cost
estimation exercise for the Caribbean as a whole (see Caribbean HIV/AIDS Control APL PAD).
21 Because of discounting, the present value of the benefits tapers off rapidly over time.

Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
The objective of the analysis was to find what is the minimum reduction inl icidence needed to ensure a
rate of return above 10% (given all the other assumptions above hold). A switching value analysis was
conducted for this and other critical parameters. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table A
14.4-5 below.

Parameter              IBase case        Limit value of parameter that yields an IRR above

Annual cost of care for         $384           Even if the averted care costs are zero, the rate of
patient                                        return is 17% since the productivity losses averted
alone generate sufficient benefits.
Average number of              10 years        Idem: even if the averted cost of care goes to zero,
years patient needs care                       the rates of return is 17%

Productivity valuation     $1,910 per year     $1,000 per year
In addition, if the streain of costs stays the same but the stream of benefits is delayed by one year then the
rate of return drops to 18%, and if the stream of benefits is delayed by two years, the IRR drops to 15%.
The returns to the project are therefore robust to significant negative biases against project feasibility.
It was shown that if all the assumptions above hold true, then a minimum  reduction of 31%  in the
incidence rate is required to generate sufficient benefits to yield rates of return of at least 10%. It was
also indicated that there is significant underreporting in the DR and that newly reported HIV infections is,
initially at least, a poor proxy for incidence. It is therefore expected that the project monitoring indicators
will pick up the sum of the effects of better reporting (which will translate as an increase in the number of
newly reported cases) and of better prevention (which will translate as a decrease in the number of newly
reported cases). In other words, the reduction in the rate of newly reported cases will be substantially
lower thani that in the incidence rate.
The graph below depicts a situation where (i) the incidence rate decreases by 31 % (which corresponds to
the limit reduction to ensure rates of return of 10% or above); (ii) the ratio of reported cases to incidence
increases linearly from 1:2 in year I to 1:1.25 by the end of the project. The figure below indicates that,
given the above assumptions, an 1 1% increase in the rate of newly reported cases (measurable) is
compatible with a 31% decrease in the incidence rate.

The path of reported cases is naturally extremely sensitive to the assumptions about the degree of
underreporting and the degree to which the project is able to reduce the extent of underreportinig. The
table below summarizes different scenarios of beginning- and end-of-period underreporting ratios that are
compatible with a 3 1 % reduction in the incidenice rate (to ensure adequate returns) and a 10% reduction in
the rate of newly reported infections (stated project objectives).

Note that the smaller the correction in underreporting, the smaller the gap between the paths of incidenice
and reported new infections. In other words, if the project does not do a very good job in correcting for
underreporting (whatever the initial level is), then the reduction in observed new cases needs to be close
to 30% if the project is to yield adequate returns. If the project dramatically improves reporting, then
even an increase in the observe.d rate of new infections is quite compatible with adequate returns. The
implication for the project is the need to carry out occasional studies to assess the degree of
underreporting. This information will prove critical in determining project success.

C. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Once it is decided that a set of intervenitionis warrants public inter-venitioni in the form  of finanicilig,
provision, regulation or mandate, thien  informationi about cost-effectiveness is useful to determine to
prioritize among those intervenitiois.22.  The table below, adapted from  Jha et al. (2001)23 suImarizes
ranges of values from  the literature relatinig to the cost-effectiveness of some of the most fiequlent
initerventionis in HIV/AIDS preventioln.

The proposed project gives clear finanicing priority to those intervelitionls that are imost cost-effective
(especially intervenitions targeted at sex worker and other high-risk groups such as the military, the police,
prisoners aiid sugar-cane workers - see Annexes 14.1 and  14.2).  As sucIh, it is expected to achieve
maximum  impact in reducilng thle spread of the epidemic. The project priorities are also closely aligned
with tilose suggested by Ainsworthi et al. (2000)26.
Fifty-eighit percent of the project corresponds to the categories identified in thie above table.  Thl e rest
corresponds to initiatives whiose cost-effectiveness ratio remains to be established (support to orphians,
surveillanice, researchi, monitoriig and evaluation, safety of blood supply. etc). If the parameters27 in the
table above apply to the DR2V, then it can be shown that the cost-effectiveness of the components of the
project, which support intervenitionis of known cost-effectiveness ratios, is $87 per HIV infectioni averted.
The project will enable the collection  of relevant cost and effectiveness data to enable the periodic
calculationi of the cost-effectiveness of the interventionis being sLupported aiid allow  policymakers to
Lipdate the niational strategy to combat the spread of the epidemic.
22 There is an ongoinig debate about the use of cost-effectiveness to guide public ftianicing decisions. l'ublic fhialicing decisiotis
should be made on the basis of market failure arguments. Jack (see footnote I) suggests that the correct approach to public
finanicinig decisions would be to carry out a f'ull cost-benefit analysis to include thc external benefits and the costs ol raisiig
public revenues. Haminer (Ii .l Hamimler. ( 1997) 'Prices versus protocols in public hcalth care' Uokrl( Bank Economic Review+.
11 (3)) also argues against the use of cost-eff'ectiveness in guiding public tinance decisions on tbie grounds that if there is
private demand for an intervention. then publicly-subsidized provisioti substitutes for private demanid so that the net health
effect is typically smaller than in the absence of public demand. Cost-effectiveniess is not used here to guide public finianciig
decisions but to order the interventions once it has been decided that they should benefit from  some forim  ol' ptiblic
iiutervenitioni.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement Arrangements
Procurement for thie proposed project would be carried out in accordanice with World Bank "Guidelines:
Procurenment Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995 (revised January/August
1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selection and Emiploymnent of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised in September 1997 and January 1999), and
tihe provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
Procurement Responsibility
The Administrative-Finianicial Uiiit of the CERSS, responsible for managinig the implementation of the
Project Provincial Healthl Services Project, in coordination) withi COPRESIDA' s Project Coordination
Unit (PCU), will implement procurement activities for the project.  This arrangemenit will allow
COPRESIDA to take advantage of the already established capacity, accumulated experience, and good
staff performance in the CERSS' Unit. The CERSS' Unit, in coordinationi with the COPRESIDA' s PCU,
will be directly responsible for the overall procurement regulation and supervision activities assuring
compliance withi procedures agreed withi the WB.
Procurement Methods
A procurement plan will be prepared along withl the aninual work plan.  The annual action and
procurement plan for each year would be submitted by the Borrower to the WB for approval, nlot later
tihan October of the previous year and would use a pre-defined standard format wlich would list as a
minimum: (i) works, goods aiid services to be procured for the following calendar year; (ii) thieir value;
(iii) the method of procurement; and (iv) the timetable for carrying out the procurement. If needed, the
plan could be revised and re-submitted. A format for a typical plaii was agreed at the negotiationi of the
project. The procurement plan for tihe first year hias been approved.
The methods to be used for the procurement described below, and the estimated amounts for eachi
method, are summarized in Table A 14.6-1. The threshiold contract values for the use of each methiod are
fixed in Table 14.6-3. Bothi, methiods and threshiolds will be reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, every
year wheni the new plan is presented to the WB.

Procurement Plan.
d) Selection of Consultants. Consultling services will be contracted under this project in the following
areas of expertise: education-information-communicationi campaigns, social marketing of condoms,
training of healtlh personnel, prevention, care, support of HIV/AIDS. STis and TB patients, quality
assurance of blood banks and laboratories, HIV/AIDS and STI surveillance and researcil,
management informatioln systems, monitorinig and impact evaluation. These services are estimiated to
cost US$12.7 million equivalenit and would be procured using WB Standard Request for Proposals.
e) Firms.  Most contracts for consultant services including design and production of information
educational campaigns, social marketing of condomis, training of healtlh personnel, prevention, care
firms would be selected using Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). Other small and simple
contracts estimated to cost less thani US$100,000 equivalent that would be selected based on the Least

Review of Procurement Actions
Review of Procurement Plans.  Every year a detailed anilual action plan, which will include a
procurement plan, shall be furnished to the World Bank before October for its review and approval. This
plan will include: a firn list of contracts to be procured in the next fiscal year; estimated contract costs;
schiedule for bidding; and method of procurement or of selection of consultanits. The plan shall be
consistenit with the above provisions and procurement methods for goods, works and the selection of
consultanits. Once approved the plan is binding and chanlges will require review and approval by the
World Bank.
During the fiscal year, if chaniges are required in the procuremenit plan a revised versioni shiould be
submitted to the World Bank for its review and.
Prior-Review Thresholds
The proposed threshiolds for prior review are based on the procuremenlt capacity assessment of the project
implementation unit and are summarized in Table Al 4.6-2.
Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement
Presidential Decree 32-01 created COPRESIDA on January 8, 2001, to implement policies and strategies
to Prevent and Control HIV/AIDS. Several private and public institutions integrate the Council and it is
presided by the State Secretary of Public Health and Social Welfare. COPRESIDA also hias an Executive
Director who will be responsible for the Project Coordination Unit of the project. The PCU will be
comprised of a Techiical Unit responsible for the technaical implemenitationi of the project. The CERSS'
Administrative-Flianicial Unit will be responsible for the procurement of goods and services required for
the implementationi of the project.
The assessment reviewed the organizationlal structure of the proposed PCU and thle coordinationi
mechanisms between the COPRESIDA's PCU, CERSS's Administrative-Financial Unit, and othier
participating agencies.
The measures identified in the agreement to minimize risks include: (i) assurance of appointment of
additional qualified staff to support the procurement team of the CERSS' Unit; (ii) establishmenit of
separate control mechianisimis; (iii) development of coordinationi mechlanisms between the CERSS' Unit,
COPRESIDA's PCU, and participating institutions. The PCU will present a detailed plan to implement
these measures by April 2001. It should involve: (i) approval and number of qualified staff acceptable to
the World Bank to be assigned to the CERSS'Unit: (ii) detailed structure of control mechianisms and
coordinationi arrangements between the CERSS' Unit and the COPRESIDA's PCU; (iii) ann1ual
procurement plan; and (iv) description of procurement monitoring and filing system. The project's
Operations Manual will clearly specifv these procedures and operations flow.
The finanicial system in the CERSS' Unit is being converted at the presenit time to comply with PMR.
Once the system is converted, it will be expanded to cover the HIV/AIDS project. Consequenitly the
Program  is ineligible for PMR-based disbursements on procurement reporting grounds. The overall
project risk for procurement is AVERAGE considerinig the experience and good performance of the
CERSS' procurement team and assuming that additional support to this unit will be provided, both hiuma
resources and equipment.
Regional Procurement Advisor approved the Capacity Assessment on March 13, 2001.



255
Procurement Plan, Monitoring and Filing
The Borrower developed a draft procurement plan for the first year of program implementationl that
provided the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A 1 4.6-1). No later
thani October 3 1, the Borrower will prepare a procurement plan as part of the aniual implementationi plan
and, if necessary, the procurement methods and thresholds would be adjusted accordingly.
The project's Operations Manual describes the procurement monitoring and filing systems which should
be available to the WB supervision missions and auditors upon request.
Frequency of Procurement Supervision
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from WB offices, the capacity assessment of
the CERSS's Unit recommended one full supervision mission to visit the field to carry out post review of
procurement actioIns, six months after implementation and then one every 12 months. Based on the
overall risk assessment (AVERAGE) the post-review field analysis should cover a sample of not less than
one in five contracts signed.
Financial Management and Disbursement System
The CERSS' Unit, in coordination with the COPRESDIA'S PCU, will maintaini records and accounts
adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in
connection with the execution of the project. For the execution of the proposed project, the fhianicial and
accounting system installed in the CERSS's Unit for managinig the implementation of the ongoilig
Provincial Health Project would be used. Within the first year of implementation, the CERSS's Unit
would begin to prepare and submit to the World Bank, on a quarterly basis, consolidated Project
Management Reports (PMR), liiking project expenditures to key monitoring indicators of project
activities.
a) Financial Management Assessment For the proposed project, and to be in compliance with WB
requirements per OP/BP 10.02, a WB Financial Management Specialist carried out an assessment of
the project's financial management system. The work was based on applicable World Bank
guidelines, whicih included the "Project Financial Managemenit Manual" (World Bank, February
1999), and the WB's Toolkit for FM Assessments. The financial managemenit assessment reviewed
the project's accounting system, internal control, finanicial management staffing, planninig, budget and
financial reporting systems (includinig for the preparation of PMRs), and auditing arrangements. The
conclusion of this review was that the financial management system  meets the World Bank's
minimum requirements, but certain actions are required for the project to be fully prepared for
implementation. These actions mainly involve the establishment of specific procedures and accounts
for the HIV/AIDS project, as well as certain capacity enhanicemenits. It is important to emphasize that
CERSS' Unit is currently implementing the Provincial Health Services Project. COPRESIDA, as the
overall coordinator of the project, must ensure that current arrangements are customized for the
HIV/AIDS project and included in corresponding project's Operations Manual. The key items from
the Action Plan for the full establishment of the financial management (FM) system are detailed at the
end of this section.
b) Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting. The operations of the proposed project will be
recorded following cash basis accounting under International Accounting Standards (IASC, issued by
the IASC and adopted for the cash basis). For each fiscal year, these records and accounts, includling
those for the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
consistently applied (International Auditing Standards issued by IFAC), by independenit auditors
acceptable to the WB (an international private firm appointed in accordance with applicable World
Bank guidelines for the selection and appointment of auditors). Auditors will be appointed before
effectiveness and if possible, be contracted for the life of the project. The audit report will be sent to
the WB not later than four months after the end of each fiscal year. During the time that the



256
Provincial Health Project is still being implemented, it is expected thlat the same auditor will be
employed for both projects; however, a separate audit report will be required for each project. These
audits will include all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from both the Loan Account
and the Special Accounlt were made. The CERSS' Unit, in coordinationi with the COPRESIDA's
PCU, would ensure that records, accounts and supporting information are available for review by
World Baiik supervision missions and to the auditors as required.
c) Disbursements. Disbursemenits of loan proceeds would be via traditional World Bank disbursement
methods (especially, Statements of Expenditure - SOEs), until such time that the project is able to
create accurate and comprehenisive Project Management Reports (PMRs) on a timely basis. The
PMRs include financial, physical, and procurement monitoring informationi. As of March 2001, the
CERSS could not provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely inforimiation on the status
of the project as required by the WB under the Financial Management Initiative, in the forn of a
Project Managemenit Report (PMR). The CERSS's Unit, in coordilatioll with the COPRESIDA's
PCU would take actions to integrate the production of the quarterly PMRs into the new management
information system (MIS), in order to eventually allow for PMR-based disbursements. The accuracy
of informationi reported in SOEs or PMRs would be verified by the auditors, and by WB supervision
missions. Details on the operation of the above mechanlisms would be included in the project's
Operations Manual; its adoption by the Government would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
In order to facilitate disbursements the Borrower will open a Special Account at the Central Bank
with an authorized allocation of US$1 million covering four monithis of eligible expenditures. Upon
effectiveness, the Borrower will withidraw US$500,000 from the Loan account representing 50% of
the authorized al location. Wheni the aggregate amoLInt of funids withdrawni from the Loan account and
outstandinig Special Commitmienits reach a total amount of US$6 million the Borrower may
withdrawin the remaining balance of the authorized allocation amounting to US$ 500,000.
Replenishments will be submitted monthly and are supported by full documentation except for the
following expenditures that may be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs):
-  All civil works with the exception of first 2 contracts for works costing US$350,000 equivalent or
more costing less than US$350,000 and goods contracts costing less thani US$250,000 equivalent.
-  Consultinig services - firms: contracts costing less thani US$ 100,000 equivalent.
*  Consultling services - individuals: contracts costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent.
  Incremental operating costs and training (all contracts)
The Borrower for review by visiting Bank supervisioni missions and the project's external auditors
will retain all documentation.
d) Budgeting Process and Flow of Funds. An aninual budget would be prepared by the CERSS' Unit,
in coordinationi with the COPRESIDA's PCU, on the basis of annuLal investment plans. Local
finanicinig (counterpart funds) for the proposed project would be included under the governmenet
budget. Loan funds would be channeled directly (i) to project managemenit, via a Special Account,
whichi would be established in the Domiicani Republic Central Bank and jointly managed by
COPRESIDA and CERSS. For local expenditures, funds would be transferred periodically (for no
more than 30 days of expenditures) from the Central Bank to the project's bank account in the Banco
de Reservas de la Republica Dominicana (commercial bank). All disbursements to suppliers would
follow national procedures, whicih would have to be sufficiently well documented to meet World
Bank requirements. The CERSS' Unit would be responsible for budget consolidationi and funds
control to report In the dates and format established. Initial amount of the Special Account and
maximum use would be made of a country's existing practices and reporting formats, which in fact at
present are operational for the onl-goinig Provincial Health Services Project.



257
Additional Items from the Agreed Action Plan
The project will be required to have a complete, functioning financial management system in place before
loan effectiveness. This would include the finanicial section of the Operational Manual (including an
appropriate Chart of Accounts for the project), customization of CERSS' MIS to fit project reporting
requirements, staffing, and the contracting of auditors. In addition, the loan agreement would include a
clause specifying the date by which the project could begin to submit regular, quarterly PMRs.
