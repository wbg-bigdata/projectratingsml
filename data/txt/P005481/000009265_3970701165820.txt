KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(LOAN 3168-MOR)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Highway Sector Project in the
Kingdom of Morocco, for which Loan 3168-MOR in the amount of US$ 79.0 million was
approved on February 8, 1990, made effective on July 12, 199C, and had an original closing date
of December 31, 1994. The Loan was actually closed on June 30, 1996. Final disbursement took
place on September 12, 1996, and an undisbursed balance of lJS$ 816,877.27 was canceled on
the same date at the request of the Ministry of Finance.
This report was prepared by Claude Archambault, MN1PI, in conjunction with Jaffar Bentchikou,
MN1PI, and reviewed by Amir Al-Khafaji, Division Chief, MNIPI, and Rene Costa, Projects
Advisor, MN1DR. Preparation of the report began during the final supervision mission of
September 27 to October 8, 1995. Findings were discussed with the Borrower during the March
20 to April 3, 1996 ICR mission. Comments on the report have been received from Jacques
Tollie, the Task Manager who appraised the operation, and from other staff, and were
incorporated in the report.
The Borrower has prepared its own evaluation: it is included in an appendix to this ICR.



KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJ1ECT
(LOAN 3168-MOR)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSM[ENT
FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.   STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Objectives at Appraisal
1.    The main objective of the Highway Sector Project in Morocco as defined in the Staff
Appraisal Report of January 8, 1990 was to assist the Government in bringing sector investments
in line with economic priorities, primarily by: (i) concentrating resources on the preservation of
existing roads; (ii) strengthening the overall institutional framework by optimizing the use of
funds for road resurfacing and maintenance within a comprehensive PMP; (iii) pursuing efficiency
improvements in the road transport market through gradual deregulation of the trucking industry
and related adjustments in road user taxation; and (iv) pursuing efficiency improvements in the
construction industry, in line with the Bank's efforts in the Maghreb region.. Two ministries were
to be directly involved in the project implementation, the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and
the Ministry of Transport (MOT).
2.    Total project costs of US$ 553.6 million were to be financed by the Bank (US$ 6.6 million
under the then on-going Fourth Highway Project, and US$ 79.0 million under the proposed
Highway Sector Project), by AfDB (US$ 110.1 million), and by the Government (US$ 182.5
million from the general budget, and US$ 155.4 million from the Road Fund).
3.    The Highway Sector Project had two main components, an Investment component, and an
Adjustment and Institutional Development component. The Investment component comprised
civil works and the provision of equipment related to these works. The civil works program
included rehabilitation of about 1,000 km of roads, resurfacing of some 1,300 km of roads,
shoulder restoration on about 500 km of roads, pavement rmarking on some 5,000 km of roads,
reconstruction of seven bridges, construction of highway maintenance workshops facilities and of
the National Center for Vehicle Testing and Certification (CNEHA) in Casablanca. Equipment
for road maintenance, traffic counting, highway maintenance workshops, and road safety was to
be purchased.
4.    The Adjustment and Institutional Development component included studies and action
programs to: (i) define and implement a strategy to improve the organization and efficiency of the
road transport industry, based on the National Transport Master Plan Study (SDNT) initiated
during the Fourth Highway Project; (ii) reclassify the road network to properly allocate
responsibilities between the various governmental authorilties responsible for investment and
maintenance; (iii) strengthen the institutional capabilities of 'MPW through the development of a



-2 -
suitable PMP, the development of suitable strategies for road maintenance, and the strengthening
of technical and research capabilities; (iv) strengthen the institutional capabilities of MOT in the
fields of road transport planning and management, and traffic safety; (v) develop transport in rural
areas; and (vi) increase the efficiency of the construction sector. The Directorate of Highways
and Traffic (DRCR) personnel was to receive training in the fields of operation and maintenance
of heavy equipment for public works, and of road maintenance activities.
Evaluation of Objectives and Risks
5.    The Highway Sector Project was definitely warranted under the conditions prevailing at
the end of the 1980s. Road transport accounted for 90 percent of passenger travel, and 70
percent of freight transport, but the road sector had received only 33 percent of total transport
investment during the period 1980-1987. This ratio had climbed to 47 percent in 1990, but it was
still insufficient for the road network to accommodate growing traffic needs. There had been
minimal improvement in the condition of paved primary roads between 1983 and 1988, and barely
one fifth of the total paved road network was in good condition over that period. In spite of a
stagnant economy, road traffic was increasing at an annual rate of 4 to 5 percent, thus
exacerbating the problems caused by a shortage of investment in the sector. From an institutional
point of view, the sector was handicapped by the lack of planning tools and the counterproductive
transport regulations, especially concerning road freight transport: there was a potential to reduce
transport costs and to increase levels of service. Finally, after having experienced a boom in the
1970s, the construction industry had been curtailed by the budgetary constraints of the 1980s,
and its operations disrupted by the structural adjustment program.
6.    Actions to ease transport regulations had already been identified and discussed under the
Third Highway Project, closed in 1987. However, MOT requested more studies before they
would take the required actions. The consensus at appraisal was that: (i) the National Transport
Master Plan Study (SDNT) would be the last major transport study financed by the Bank, since
the course of action had been properly charted in previous projects; (ii) completion of SDNT had
been delayed during the Fourth Highway Project, and issuing its final report would have been
more a matter of editorial corrections than substance changes; and (iii) SDNT should be published
as early as possible in the Highway Sector Project, since it would need to be updated from time to
time, hence the dated covenants. It should be added that the SAR had properly identified the risk
of insufficient MOT's commitment to the project.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Sector Policy and Financial Objectives
7.    By and large, the project has achieved its stated objectives. However this assessment does
not apply uniformly across all the numerous components of the project: MPW has accomplished
most of its objectives, while the performance of MOT has been a disappointment. This outcome
reflects the respective shares of both Ministries in the project, with MPW claiming close to 95



-3 -
percent of the total budget, and MOT the balance. Four executing agencies' participated in the
project. The lack of coordination between the various executing agencies, and between those and
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), hampered the institutional development component, which did
not achieve its stated objectives.
Institutional Development
8.    Various studies contributed to the institutional development of MPW, and were highly
successful in that regard. Other studies were instrumental iin establishing a dialogue between
various governmental agencies concerned with the procurement of constiuction materials. The
operation of CNER has been strengthened with the help of technical assistance. This component
of the project was very successful, and CNER now supports M[PW's road maintenance program
through traffic counts, and pavement surface evaluation and structural analyses. However, the
rural transport study undertaken by MOT has drawn up an investment program in rural roads, but
it did not achieve its stated objectives of assessing the organization of rural transport services,
defining the needs of rural municipalities in terms of transport services, and making
recommendations on the appropriate institutional organization. Also SDNT was only published in
March 1995, after a delay of five years. Its major accomplishment has been to support changes in
the deregulation of road transport, but its data base was mostly out of date the day the report was
issued, and many of its conclusions and recommendations are Inow obsolete.
Physical Objectives
9.    Table 5 in Part Two of the Report illustrates Key Performance Indicators for various
components of the project. Civil works have achieved, and in some cases surpassed their initial
objectives, albeit in a time frame that was longer than originally anticipated: bridge reconstruction
was to be completed by July 1992, and road works by the end of 1993, while the actual works
extended through April 1996. Another achievement was the construction of CNEHJA, an
automotive test center built to control the work of the private motor vehicle test centers.
Equipment for traffic counting and road maintenance workshops have been purchased, but no
vehicles were purchased under the project. All the studies under the jurisdiction of MPW have
been completed, but only one major study under the jurisdiction of MOT has been initiated. No
Bank-financed overseas training has taken place, even if bothl MPW and MOT had expressed a
need for it, mainly because of lack of counterpart funds and a decision by the Directorate of
Highways and Traffic (DRCR) to favor local training.
10.   A major achievement of the Highway Sector Project was the improvement in the quality of
paved road surfaces. For the whole network, the percentage of paved roads in good condition
has increased from 20 to 44 percent between 1983 and 1994, while the percentage of roads in
average condition has decreased from 36 to 31 percent. All classes of roads have benefited from
The four executing agencies are the Directorate of Highways and Traffic (DRCR) and the Directorate of
Technical Affairs (DAT) at the Ministry of Public Works, and the Directorate of Transport Studies,
Planning, and Coordination (DEPCT) and the Directorate of Surface Transport (DTT) at the Ministry of
Transport. The Ministry of Transport Directorate of Air Bases (DBA) was responsible for the construction of
CNEHA.

the program2. Primary roads in particular have seen their percentage in good condition increased
from 33 to 51 percent between 1983 and 1994.
Impact on the Environment
11.   Civil works financed through the Highway Sector Project had minimal impact on the
environment, since there was no modification to the alignment, profile, or width of the roads that
were part of maintenance or rehabilitation contracts. Construction materials such as sand, gravel
and crushed stone came from existing quarries, without any incremental impact on the
environment. On the other hand, no effort was made to improve drainage facilities: future
projects should include provisions for rehabilitation or maintenance of all roadside features where
required.
Economic Evaluation
12.   Ex ante economic analyses calculated expected economic rates of return (ERR) for three
major components of the project. For pavement strengthening, the SAR proposed a three-year
program involving 1,067 km of roads divided into 49 sections, each one having an ERR equal to
or greater than 20 percent. For periodic maintenance, a three-year, 1,320 km program was
proposed, with a detailed economic evaluation of the first year program involving 208 km of
roads divided into 18 sections, each one having an ERR equal to or greater than 24 percent. Six
of the seven bridge rehabilitation projects were evaluated, each one having an ERR greater than
40 percent. The actual lengths of pavement strengthening or periodic maintenance, while not
much different from the appraised project, involve sections that are much different, so that only
half of the sections that were evaluated have actually been completed, and less than one third of
the periodic maintenance sections that were evaluated have actually been improved. The ex post
economic analyses show that all works have positive ERR, with only 2 percent of the pavement
strengthening sections and 7 percent of the periodic maintenance sections having an ERR inferior
to 12 percent. A comparison between the initial and the final analyses shows that traffic flows
were often overestimated in the case of periodic maintenance, while cost overruns are the main
reason for lower ERR in pavement strengthening. Of the five bridges for which an ex post
economic evaluation was performed, one showed an ERR of 24 percent, and the other four an
ERR greater than 40 percent.
C.    MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors not Generally Subject to Government Control
13.   The Borrower has taken advantage of the Gulf Assistance Program put in place by the
Bank to attenuate the effect of the Gulf Crisis of 1990, and the disbursement schedule was
accelerated from September 1, 1990 to December 31, 1991, with the percentage of Bank-financed
expenditures for works increased during that period from 64 to 80 percent.
2  This is partly due to the establishment in 1989 of a Road Fund that spends about half of its receipts for road
maintenance: in 1995, DH 560 million were used for such purposes, out of total receipts of DH one billion.



-5 -
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
14.   Two major factors have influenced the course of the project: the on-going budgetary
crisis, and cumbersome internal disbursement procedures. In its first years, the project was
hindered by the lack of counterpart funding. The GovernrrLent needed to reduce its budgetary
deficit, and chose to reduce its capital expenditures rather than its social expenses. However the
establishment in 1989 of a Road Fund was instrumental in accumulating much needed financial
resources for the construction and maintenance of the road network. The Road Fund now
contributes about one third of the total expenditures in the road sector, including infrastructure
(highways and local roads) and transport (carriers and other agencies).
15.   Internal disbursements followed a complex route, from the payment of an invoice by the
Provincial Treasurer, its reimbursement by the General Treasurer, who in turn was reimbursed the
Budget Directorate. The Budget Directorate drew funds from the Special Account set up by the
Bank, and made application for its replenishment. To add to the delays, surface mail was
generally used for communication within the country, and occasionally with the Bank.
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
16.   Identification of road sections. Projects were sel]ected by DRCR, which prepared a
three-year investment program, updated annually on the basis of studies performed by CNER on
pavement conditions and traffic flows. DRCR in turn informed the Provincial Directorates of
Public Works (DPTP) of the broad contents of this national program. DPTP were given the
amount of works to be financed through various sources (national budget, international financial
institutions) one year in advance, so that they could plan the various studies required to prepare
the work packages and tender documents. However DRC:R did not associate the DPTP in the
planning process itself Since the actual surface conditions of a road section could differ from
DRCR's modeled network, DPTP often needed to change the contents and/or limits of a project
between its identification and its execution, without informiing DRCR of those changes. Such a
practice, if it were extended to all works, would render the economic analyses meaningless and
would cast doubts on the efficiency of the works. There is a need for effective two-way
communication and feedback between DRCR and DPTP. A Project Coordinator was nominated
near the end of the project to improve the coordination between the various agencies, but he came
too late to be really effective.
17.   Project Contents. A few road rehabilitation or resealing projects were as short as 1.0
km3: at the planning stage, projects should be analyzed within the framework of a total itinerary
linking two towns or villages, as is now being done in the follow-up project. Another problem
stemmed from the fact that projects too often were limited to the rehabilitation or maintenance of
the pavement, to the exclusion of the roadside components: only occasionally were shoulders and
traffic markings improved as part of a larger project. Field observations have shown that drainage
problems in many locations should have been addressed at the design stage. In general, a
In some cases those short sections were part of a larger project involving several contracts. For instance road
rehabilitation on RP24 in Fes was financed by the Bank between PK6 and PK20. Resealing was financed by
the Bank between PK25 and PK26, and by other sources between, PK20 and PK25.

rehabilitation or a maintenance project should not be limited to the pavement, but should include
roadside components, lateral and transversal drainage, small bridges, and correction of black spots
that experienced a higher than usual number of accidents. To program all the works within a
single contract would have the additional advantage of minimizing total costs, disturbances to
motorists, and non productive investments.
18.   Studies and Technical Assistance. In spite of a number of successes, mainly for the
studies conducted under the aegis of MPW, this component of the Highway Sector Project has
experienced many failures, mostly because the implementation schedule was too optimistic: the
SAR assumed that most of the requests for proposals would be sent within five months from the
project inception date, which did not leave time enough to define the contents of the studies and
to prepare terms of reference that reflected the major governmental orientations4. The studies
should have been released in a sequential fashion, to help the Borrower managing them properly
and supervising their execution. However, delays by themselves do not explain failures, which
were due to the lack of interest shown by MOT for that component.
19.   Disbursement Procedures. Every supervision mission has commented on the slowness of
the disbursement procedures. Three major factors have been identified to explain the problem and
propose solutions: (i) MOF requires that the project directors prepare two payment requests for
each invoice from a contractor or a vendor, one for the portion of the works, goods acquisition or
consulting services5 that is financed by the Bank and one for the portion that is not, with as many
different payment requests as there are currencies involved; (ii) regional treasurers have no
interest in accelerating the transfer to the Central Treasurer of supporting documents that they
received from the regional DPTP; and (iii) regional treasurers, and for that matter MOF
personnel, have no idea of the actual works on the field, and there is barely any communication
between the regional DPTP and MOF Multilateral Financing Service.
20.   During the course of the project, actual disbursements lagged behind SAR projected
disbursement schedule by about one year, as shown on Table 4 in Part Two of this report. This
partly explains why the closing date had to be postponed twice, first from December 31, 1994 as
initially projected in the Loan Agreement to December 31, 1995, and then to June 30, 1996. This
last extension was requested by MOF because expense justification for US$ 3.2 million had not
been released by the provincial treasurers, sometimes more than a year after having been incurred,
preventing the central treasurer to claim those expenses to the Bank. In spite of these
postponements, the Ministry of Finance has requested the cancellation of about one percent (US$
0.8 million) of the original loan amount (US$ 79.0 million).
4  Preliminary terms of reference had been discussed during project appraisal but much work remained to
be done before they could be sent out to consultants as RFPs.
5  Consultants services were only financed for 80 percent of their total costs, rather than 100 percent as is the
case in other Bank-financed projects.



-7 -
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
21.   Project sustainability is likely for all works. Site visits made during the various supervision
missions and interviews with DPTP directors during the ICR mission confirmed the general
quality of the works and the adherence to sound construction and maintenance practices. The
Borrower and the Bank made a constant effort during the course of the project to ensure
systematic identification of required improvements and to seek proper solutions whenever a
problem was identified, and MPW is committed to ensure an adequate level of maintenance of its
road network. Construction of CNEHA and of maintenance shops was successfully completed
within budget, and in the former case, a program is in place to ensure its continuous operations
through MOT's annual operation budget.
22.   Project sustainability is also likely for MPW  adjustment and institutional development
program. Commitment by MPW personnel to transfer the recommendations of the various
studies it commissioned into its normal operations is a clear indication of the success of this
component. For instance, the development of a PMP at CNER led to the preparation by DRCR
of its annual road maintenance and rehabilitation program. T:he reverse is true of MOT, where the
objectives of some studies are far from having been achieved, and their outcome, in the case of
SDNT in particular, is of little value to guide future actions.
E.    BANK PERFORMAN[CE
Project Identification and Preparation
23.   The project was identified as a sequel to the Fourth Highway Project, and indeed the
financing plan showed on-going contributions of the Bank and AfDB. It also proposed a sectoral
approach, in line with the increasing competence of executing agencies to plan and implement
sector-wide investment programs, and with the need for emphasis on sectoral policy and
institutional issues, thus introducing a much broader approach to the development of the highway
sector. However, a more thorough preparation would have identified the major pitfalls in that
approach, namely that it requires a high level of coordination between executing agencies, and
that each agency is equally committed to the success of the project. The project should have been
identified as a Highway Project, not a Highway Sector Project, and collaboration of AfDB should
have been enlisted and confirmed at the on-set of the project
Project Appraisal
24.   At the appraisal stage, the respective shares of the cofinanciers were 21.7 percent for the
Aff)B and 16.0 percent for the Bank. However this financing plan did not work as intended, and
no record exists to support a comparison between the project as appraised and the actual project.
The Loan Agreement itself had to be modified twice at the inception of the project because the
AfDB own loan effective date was postponed twice.  Also the EBank overestimated the
Borrower's capacity to mobilize counterpart funds, especially in the first years of the project and
to initiate and manage complex studies.



-8 -
Project Implementation
25.   The SAR's financial plan showed that AfDB would contribute a major share of the
financing, but no attempt was made during the course of the project to evaluate its participation,
nor to coordinate its activities with the Bank.
26.   During supervision missions, the following issues were frequently raised: (i) procurement
issues, in particular pre- and post-qualification and bid evaluation procedures; (ii) disbursement
procedures and the mechanism of the Special Account; (iii) institutional and financial issues,
namely, who should manage the various road networks, and what should be the budget for
adequate maintenance; and (iv) MOT's failure to implement most components under its
jurisdiction. Disbursement procedures have been greatly improved, and most contractors and
vendors were paid in time during the second half of the project. However internal disbursement
problems have not been solved, in spite of the Bank's insistence on the need to simplify the
disbursement channels. With regards to MOT's performance in particular, the Bank could hardly
have been more compelling when asking MOT for a clear commitment regarding its participation
in the project, and for a detailed Action Plan: any suspension of disbursements would have been
counterproductive by unduly penalizing MPW, without having much impact on MOT.
F.    BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   The Borrower performance mirrored the successes and failures of the project. MPW
supported its share of the project with utmost attention to the results, while MOT was only
interested in a few components of the project, namely the construction of CNEHA and the study
on rural transport. In particular, MOT was to prepare an action program to introduce reforms in
the organization of the road transport sector based on the results and recommendations of SDNT.
This action program had not been drafted under the present project. However, it is now included
in a new law being discussed by the Government. Similarly a decree defining the new road
classification, in preparation since 1985, should have been published in June 1991, but it has
encountered major delays and is now scheduled to be finalized in 1997 for the rural sections. On
the other hand, audit reports and other financial data were submitted in a timely manner and
appropriate format.
28.   Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance was designed to assist the Borrower in
establishing a PMP system and a road maintenance investment program: both were successfully
implemented by DRCR, and are an important measure of the success of the Highway Sector
Project. However it was different for MOT, where an absence of proper focus can explain the
disappointing results of this component.
29.   Procurement. The Borrower delayed implementing Bank's procedures for procurement
of works, goods, and consultants services, in spite of a provision in the Loan Agreement to use
such methods. Unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement procedures, the need to protect the
local market, and existing detailed local procurement operations that had been in place for a long
time but were not compatible with the Bank's, were all cited as arguments to explain the
Borrower's reluctance. Many such difficulties would have been prevented had the Borrower
prepared a Project Implementation Manual, with one section detailing the proper procurement



- 9-
procedures to put in place in all regional DPTP that were involved in Bank--financed projects. It
should be added that procurement issues have been solved during the course of the project.
30.   Very few foreign contractors showed an interest in the projects, probably because the
contracts were too small to justify large set up expenses.
31.   Inadequacy of Financial Controls. The financial controls put in place by MOF were not
adapted to road maintenance projects. Once bids were opened, MOF needed one to two months
to examine the contract and give its approval, but this verification was not warranted, since MOF
had already approved the budget before DPTP called for tenders. And when a contractor sent an
invoice, MOF would take two to three months to process it and transfer funds to the contractor's
bank account. MOF should confine its involvement during the execution of a project to
exercising ex post controls, without interfering with its actual implementation.
32.   Dialogue with the Bank. Whilst invoices approved by the Borrower were reviewed for
eligibility by the Bank before being processed for disbursement, this review did not include an
appreciation on whether the works or services provided were satisfactory. This was of no
immediate consequence for works, since the Borrower was responsible for their supervision.
However, in the case of studies, there was a lack of continuous supervision by the executing
agencies and the Bank was not systematically sent the differeni: reports: this became an issue when
the Borrower was not satisfied with the performance of a consultant.
G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTC'OME
33.   In terms of physical realization, the results of the project are satisfactory, both in terms of
actual implementation and expected sustainability. The project achieved, and exceeded in certain
cases, its key physical objectives. In addition, main results of the project can be regarded as
sustainable, in view of the increased awareness of the importance of allocating adequate road
maintenance funds and the acquisition of the tools and know-how to earnark maintenance funds
to economically viable projects. On the other hand, the results of the adjustment and institutional
development components are unsatisfactory. The Borrower has not made use of technical
assistance as it should have, and it has missed an opportunity to improve the transport sector.
Many studies were not initiated, and when they were, their results were often not satisfactory, and
their reports of little use.
34.   Visits to several DPTP regional offices during the preparation of this ICR have confirmed
the importance of the Bank's contribution to the road miaintenance program. In the past,
decisions to implement projects were based on projections of future traffic, and greater emphasis
was put on new construction than on existing road rehabilitation or maintenance. More coherent
procedures have been put in place to take into account the quality of the pavement surface, traffic
safety, and operations costs.
H.   FUTURE OPERATION
35.   The Highway Sector Project lessons have already 'been applied to the Sixth Highway
Project that became effective in October 1995. DRCR mnust maintain its capability of using



- 10-
HDM-III software in programnming maintenance and rehabilitation works. DPTP should become
more familiar with the use of SIGER and other software packages to analyze and control projects.
All executing agencies have to pay closer attention to the definition and supervision of studies,
and to become involved in their execution. Accident data should be analyzed within the context
of project preparation. CNER has to update on a continuous basis its database on surface
condition and traffic on paved roads. It should consider a continuous traffic count and pavement
evaluation program, to replace the existing practice of evaluating traffic and road surface
conditions every other year and measuring deformation every three years.
36.   MOT needs to accelerate the liberalization of the transport sector, especially regarding
passenger transport. To that effect, they should commission the studies that had been appraised
as part of the Highway Sector Project, but never realized. SDNT must be updated. MPW should
put in place training programs on new construction and management techniques: aggregate/
bitumen emulsion, landslides protection, drainage, and works planning and programming.
L     KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Development Objectives
37.   Seek Borrower ownership at the appraisal stage and throughout the project. There is no
substitute to the Borrower's full commitment towards a project to ensure its success, and the
IIighway Sector Project has clearly demonstrated that all components taken in charge by the
Borrower experienced satisfactory outcome, whether they were civil works, equipment
procurement, or consultants services.
38.   Maintain dialogue with the Borrower.  Studies cannot replace sectoral dialogue.
Comprehensive transport studies such as SDNT create great expectations that can hardly be met
for a number of reasons: planning tools may not be sufficiently refined, all required data may not
be available to model a large network such as Morocco's, and the Borrower may have a hidden
agenda that prevents him from agreeing with the study's main conclusions and recommendations,
especially when they call for fundamental changes in policy, regulations, or procedures.
39.   Establish rational basis for project evaluation. Greater attention should be paid to traffic
flow projections and to the scope of projects. Smaller project components that do not have a
clear relation to the main thrust of the project should be eliminated at the appraisal stage.
Implementation
40.   Assess Borrower capability to implement the project. In scheduling major studies, it is
important to take into account the physical capacity of the Borrower to prepare requests for
proposals, including a clear definition of the mandate, to evaluate the proposals, and to supervise
the consultants' work. The Borrower has to participate actively in all phases of the studies, if
they are to be of any future use.
41.   Prepare comprehensive work packages. Contracts for road rehabilitation or maintenance
should not be limited to improving the pavement performance, but should consider roadside



components, drainage and erosion problems, soils stability, and correction of black spots. A
larger diffusion of the Bank's publications on economic analysis and on road rehabilitation and
maintenance procedures would help executing agencies in planning projects and preparing
contractual documents.
42.   Delineate responsibilities between various agencies, Overlapping responsibilities and
limited cooperation between MPW and MOT hindered the clevelopment of transport planning.
On the other hand, the decentralization of operations within DPTP was a major factor towards the
success of the civil works program.
43.   Streamline control procedures. MOF's cumbersome procedures delayed project
development, not to mention interventions by local financial comptrollers in the preparation of
tender documents and specifications. Disbursement procedures should be streamlined: it is of little
consolation that MOF states that the Highway Sector Project showed a much better performance
from that point of view than any other road project in the courntry.
44.   Establish two-way dialogue between central and provincial agencies. There is a need to
sharpen ex-ante economic analyses to ensure a direct relation between the projects that are
evaluated as the most economically feasible and the ones that get realized.

PROJET SECTORIEL ROUTI1ER
CINQUIEME PROJET ROUTI1ER
(Prit NO 3168-MOR)
RAPPORT DE FIN D'EXECUTION
PREFACE
Ce rapport d'achevement conceme le projet sectoriel routier. II a fait l'objet du pret No
3168-MOR , au profit du Royaume du Maroc, d'un montant (le U.S $ 79 millions. Ce pr& a et
conclu le 15 Mars 1990, et mis en vigueur le 12/07/1990.
La cl8ture du pret, prevue initialement le 31/12/1994, interviendra le 30/06/1996, apres avoir
&e prorogee successivement d'une annie et de six mois.
A ce jour, au titre des composantes du projet relevant de la ]DRCR, il reste a payer DH
5066095,37 correspondant a des depenses liquidees; leur paiement interviendra avant l'echeance de
la cl6ture du pret. Par ailleurs aucun reliquat ne se degage de ce pret.
Ce rapport a ete prepare par la Direction des routes et de laz circulation Routiere (DRCR), du
Minist6re des Travaux Publics.
L'6laboration de ce rapport s'est fondee en particulier sur:
- le rapport d'evaluation du projet
- les comptes-rendus de supervision
es correspondances entre la Banque et l'Emprunteur
- des prospections pour le recueil d'informations et de donn6es, aupres des diffirents services de la
DRCR tant ceux su siege que ceux d6concentr6s.

RESUME DE L'EVALUATION
OBJECTIFS PREPARATION ET DESCRIPTION DES COMPOSANTES
(i) Inscrit dans le prolongement de ceux finances par La Banque, II s'agit du premier projet adoptant
une approche sectorielle. n assure par ailleurs une integration et une mise en coherence des projets
en cours ou en gestation, a l'epoque de sa preparation. Cette derniere a beneficie du concours de la
Banque , et tout particulierement d'une partie des realisations du 4eme projet routier ( pret No2254-
MOR).
(ii) Le PSR s'est fonde des objectifs generaux de rationalisation et d'optimisation des
investissements, de satisfaction de la demande de transport au moindre couit, de renforcement
institutionnel des structures en charge du secteur routier et, du recouvrement des redevances et
d'une tarification de l'usage de la route, bases sur les coOts. Par ailleurs, les objectifs specifiques
ont e  fixes au projet, en particulier la concentration des ressources sur la maintenance des routes,
l'alignement des investissements sur les priorites economiques, la. promotion du secteur de la
construction, et la liberalisation du marche des transports (1.02).
(iii) La DRCR a ete le principal acteur et beneficiaire du PSR (plus de 95% des ressources affectes).
Le volet investissement a represente plus de 97% du PSR, dont 1'essentiel est destine aux travaux
maintenance des infrastructures (90% des ressources du projet). Ill repond aux retards accumules
dans la maintenance des routes a fort rendement economique. D'autre part la DRCR a beneficie de
plus de la moitie du volet du PSR relatif A l'appui institutionnel et a l'ajustement de la politique
sectorielle (3.07). Resultat d'une longue maturation, ce volet decoule de la politique generale de
liberalisation et d'ouverture de l'economie et, des imperatifs pre,alables de modemisation et de
rationalisation de la gestion du reseau routier (1.03).
EXECUTION DU PROJET
(iv) La DRCR assura l'ex6cution de plus de 130 contrats, largemient dissemines a travers le pays.
Pour ce faire elle s'est faite relayee par le LPEE, pour le contr6le qualitatif des travaux, et les
DPTP, dont la responsabilite est suffisamment etendue pour assurer le bon niveau de maltrise
constate.
(v) Faisant partie du PIC, le PSR a demarre dans de bonnes conditions. I1 a beneficie d'un suivi et
d'une regulation appropries, le long de son execution. En d6pit du retard d'un an sur le calendrier
initial, cette execution est satisfaisante. toutefois son evolution s'est faite de maniere contrastee:
Alors que la composante travaux etait bien maitrisee dans son ensemble, la composante
institutionnelle, plus complexe, F'etait moins.
(vi) L' adoption du deuxieme PAS avait genere une relative insufFisance des credits de contrepartie se
repercutant surtout sur delai de realisation du projet. Ce dernier iftait egalement affecte par la faible
mailtrise de la devolution des marches, accomplie du reste conformement aux dispositions convenues
avec La Banque(2-04).
(vii) Compares au 4eme projet routier (pret/2254_MOR) ou au projet PERST, 1'engagement des
depenses et le paiement des ordonnances se sont bien deroules. Les performances cibles ont et
depassees grace a la mise en oeuvre des mesures du PAS(2.05). :1 en est de meme des
decaissements, bien qu'ils etaient preoccupants au debut du projet, du fait de la complexit6 des
procedures associees. pendant la premiere partie de la periode de realisation(2.06). Cette situation
futt redressee par des mesures cons6quentes(2.06).



3
(viii) Les travaux routiers ont demarr6 selon les previsions, du fait d'une certaine anticipation des
services de la DRCR. Les travaux de ponts, requerant des etudes prealables et sounis a une
procedure plus lourde que les autres, ont connu un retard d'une annee environ par rapport au
calendrier. Les restrictions budgetaires sont a l'origine de la non acquisition de vehicules pour le
transport des equipes d'entretien(2.07). Lancees avec un an de retard les etudes sur les routes
etroites et sur les pistes rurales ont bien evolue par la suite, contrairement a celle sur le systeme de
gestion de chaussees qui a et affectee par les hesitations sur les modalites d'execution (2.08).
ACCOMPLISSEMENT DES OBJECTIFS
(ix) Eu egard aux objectifs du PSR, les resultats de l'execution des composantes de la DRCR,
accomplis sans generation d'effets sociales ou 6cologiques nefastes, peuvent etre consideres comme
satisfaisants. Cependant globalement les resultats des composantes institutionnelles et de politique
sectorielle sont moins affirmes que ceux relatifs aux travaux. Ces derniers ont en particulier conduit a
ameliorer l'etat general du reseau routier; L'etat de surface, bonne a tres bonne, a globalement
progresse de 53,0% a 61,8%, cette amelioration est plus prononcee sur le reseau a trafic eleve.
(x) Les composantes institutionnelles ont enregistre des r6sultats satisfaisants quoique moins
affirn6s. En effet, exceptes les stages A l'etranger non accomplis, seule l'etude sur les pistes rurales a
presente des resultats limites. La consolidation du dispositif d'entretien et de gestion routiers, la
dotation du CNER d'outils de gestion des chaussees, et la rationalisation des investissements ayant
trait a l'elargissement des routes 6troites et aux pistes rurales sont a relever parmi les principaux
resultats (3.02). Toutefois la planification des routes A vocation locale n'a pas pu disposer de
planification, indispensable pour donner de la coherence A une multitude de d6cisions
d'investissements diffus sur tout Ye territoire du pays(3.03).Sur le plan de la politique sectorielle la
DRCR a r6actualise l'etude sur la fiscalite routiere et fait progresser le processus de
reclassement(3.04).
BEALISATIONS PHYSIQUES
(xi) Exceptes travaux de bitiment, les objectifs physiques du programme routier ont subi des
remaniements importants, tout au long du deroulement du projet. Ces ecarts ont affiect6 le
rechargement d'accotements, les marquages, les revetements, les renforcements et les ponts ( ils
6taient de l'ordre de:+l 10%, -44%, +32%, -14% et -30% respectivement). ils s'expliquent par la
nature de la programmation de chaque categorie de travaux et, par des contingences(3.06).
LES COUTS DU PROJET
(xii) Le coOt total des differentes composantes relevant de la DRCR a connu un tres leger
depassement restant admissible (3.07). La composante travaux routiers, qui est la plus importante, a
connu l'cart de cout le plus faible, a rattacher a la phase de preparation. II en est de meme des
travaux de batiment. Les services de consultants constituent, de par leur nature, la composante la
plus difficile a maitriser, en termes de resultat et de cout. Le programrne d'equipement parait avoir
ete ambitieux. Par contre celui releve pour les ponts n'est qu'apparent (3.08).
PERENNITE DU PROJET
(xiii) Les ameliorations du reseau routier sont le resultat d'une approche a long terine des problemes
du secteur routier . D'importants projets y ont concourus en parallele avec le present, ainsi que de
nouveaux sont inities dans la meme perspective; c'est le cas du 6eme projet routier financ6 par La
Banque, dont la preparation a largement beneficie des resultats du present projet(4.01). La niise a
contribution des resultats de ce projet , pour l'identification des programmes confirnme la volonte du
Gouvernement de p6renniser les resultats du projet, et, en particulier, de poursuivre le processus de
rationalisation des investissements routiers et de reorganisation des structures de la gestion du
secteur routier (le reclassement du reseau routier) et de consolidation institutionnelle (4.02 et 4.03).



4
D] convient aussi d'insister sur ia perennisation des resultats obternus par le projet en matiere de
securite routiere, du fait des actions deja entamdes, et celles projetees (4.05).
INTERVENTION DE LA BANQUE
(xiv) Le PSR a bdneficie de l'experience des quatre projets routiers finances par La Banque, ainsi
que l'expertise qu'elle a capitalis6e dans le secteur routier (5.02). L'action de La Banque a et6
d6terminante tant au stade de la preparation que de la mise en oeuvre, ofi sa contribution dtait
d6terminante pour la regulation du projet , en particulier pour la maitrise des decaissements (5.03).
COORDINATION DU PROJET ET APPUI D'AUTRES SERVICES DE L'ETAT
(xv) Le PSR comporte plusieurs composantes relevant d'autres departements ( DAT , MT). La mise
en place d'une coordination globale n'etait pas formellement prevue par le projet ; ce qui explique les
carences de l'information, surtout au niveau des decaissements Partant de ce constat la DRCR
avait pris l'initiative de nomer un coordinateur de projet, bien que cette action a &6 accomplie en fin
de projet (6.02).
RELATIONS BANQUE-DRCR
(xvi) La qualit6 de la conduite de la realisation du projet a ete tributaire de cele, excellente, des
relations entre ia Banq.ie et la DRCR (7.01). La DRCR avait observ6 ]es dispositions du pr&t et pris
en considdrarian les avis de La Banque, qui itri: en permanence tenue informee de l'dvolution du
projet (7.02'.
CONCLUSIONS x,r ENSEIGNEMENTS
(xvii) Le financement de Il'entretien routier
La perennite des r6sultrts de ce projet pose i nouveau, et de maninre insistante , le problsne de
I'inad6quation des resscurces , par raprort aux besoins requis pour un entretien routier optimal
(8.01).
(xviii) L'identification des op6rations et leur allotissement
Les operations routieres retenues au PSR sont justifiees econorliquement . Elles ont et6
programmiee et regroup6es dans des lots importants pour 6viter Ia multiplication des march6s et
promouvoir aes offres interessantes. Toutefois 1'experience du PSR confinme la n6cessit6 d'articuler
les travaux de rehabiltation autour des renforcements de chaussees, auxquels doivent etre adjoints
un ensemble de travaux annexes (drainage longitudinal et transversal , elargissement des chaussees.
mise hors d'eau des chaussees, traitement des points noirs,...) (8.02).
(xix) Prdparation des projets
n convient d'anticiper et d'approfondir plus la preparation des premieres tranches des projets , et cc
avant la conclusion des prets (8.03).



(xx) La maitrise de la gestion de 1'execution
D'une maniere l'execution du projet etait satisfaisante, mise a part la lenteur dans les ddcaissements
enregistree, en particulier au debut de la realisation . Par ailleurs 1'execution du projet a mis en relief
le potentiel latent d'une amelioration accrue de la maitrise des delais, moyennant des actions d'appui
a la phase realisation (8.04).
(xxi) Coordination
L'execution du PSR a mis en exergue l'importance de la fonction coordination. La nomination d'un
coordinateur contribuera, pour les projets, futurs a s'affranchir de certaines difficultes ayant affecte
le PSR. (8.05).
(xxii) La procedure de decaissement
La procedure complexe de decaissement doit reorganisee de maniere permettre plus d'efficacite pour
les paiements et transferts de fonds Banque-Emprunteur (8.06).

I- OBJECTIFS PREPARATION ET DESCRIPTION DES COMPOSANTES
1.01 Le PSR s'inscrit dans le prolongement de ceux finances precedernment par La Banque, tout en
s'adjoignant de nouvelles dimensions se rattachant au developpement institutionnel et a la politique
sectorielle, et assurant le lien avec les orientations libdrales de la politique 6conomique du
Gouvernement. II s'agit du premier projet adoptant une approche sectorielle, assurant par ailleurs
une integration et une mise en coherence des projets en cours ou en gestation , a l'epoque de sa
preparation.
1.02 Le PSR a ete formule sur la base des objectifs generaux suivants, assignes au secteur lors de
P'identification:
-Satisfaction de la demande de transport au moindre coot;
- rationalisation des investissements et optimisation des ressources affectees a l'entretien routier;
-Promotion d'une politique rdaliste de recouvrement des redevamces des usagers de la route, ainsi
que d'une tanification basee sur les couxts;
-Renforcement du dispositif institutionnel des structures en charge du secteur routier . Par ailleurs,
les objectifs specifiques ci-apres ont egalement et6 fixes au projet:
- Alignement des investissements du secteur sur les prioTites economiques et, concentration des
ressources sur le maintien des routes existantes
-Renforcement du cadre institutionnel, en particulier de maniele a ameliorer l'optimisation des
investissements ewstants ( gestion des chaussees)
-Libdralisation du marchd des transports
-Promotion du secteur de la construction
1.03 L'identification et la pr6paration du projet ont largement beneficie du concours de la Banque
et tout particulierement d'une partie des realisations du 4eme projet routier ( pret No2254-MOR.),
Le volet investissement s'est fonde sur une approche valorisami les infrastructures routieres a for'.
rendement economique. quant-au volet relatifau d6veloppemeart institutionnel , a l'ajustement dela
politique sectorielle et i une partie des services de consultants, est le rdsultat d'une maturation. E
decoule de la politique gen6rale de liberalisation et d'ouverture de I'economie et, des imperatifs
pr6alables de modernisation et de rationalisation de la gestion dcu reseau routier.
1.04 En reponse aux retards accumules dans Ia maintenance des routes, en particulier celes i fort
rendement 6conomique, les travaux de rehabilitation-entretien et de reconstruction de ponts ont ete
preponderants. Outre l'engagement sur un programme d'actionis en rapport avec la strat6gie
sectorielle, le projet a aussi comporte des composantes d'appui institutionnel et de preparation de
mesures d'ajustement de la politique sectorielle . Les composantes du projet relevant de la DRCR
sont:
*VOLET INVESTISSEMENTS:
-Travaux de rehabilitation de routes, renouvellement de la coLiche de roulement, rechargement
d'accotements, marquage de chaussees et construction de ponts ( respectivement environ :1000 Km
, 1300 Km, 500 Km, 5000 Km, 7 ).
-Construction et equipement d'ateliers regionaux de matdriel routier.
-Fourniture d'equipements pour l'entretien routier et le compt;age du trafic
*VOLET APPUI INSTITUTIONNEL ET AJUSTEMENT D:E LA POLITIQUE SECTORIELLE:
-Le reclassernent du rdseau routier, de maniere , repartir la responsabilite, de l'investissement et de
l'entretien, entre les autorites centrales et d6centralis6es
-La realisation d'un certain nombre d'actions et d'un progranmme de developpement institutionnel (
systeme de gestion des chaussdes , developpement de strat6gies adaptees de maintenance,
d6veloppement d'une approche d'elargissement des routes, renforcement des capacit6s techniques et
de recherche, realisation d'un programme de formation en entretien routier et acquisition de moyens
de formation,...)

[I- EXECUTION DU PROJET
2.01 La DRCR avait la charge d'assurer l'execution d'une multitude de contrats (plus de 130
march6s) diss6mines sur la quasi-totalite du territoire du pays . Pour ce faire elle se faisait relayer
d'une part par le LPEE, pour assurer le contr6le qualitatif des travaux et, d'autre part, par ses
services territoriaux, dont la responsabilite est suffisamment etendue pour assurer le bon niveau de
maltrise constate.
2.02 Faisant partie du Programme d'Inve-stissements Ciblis du PAS , I'execution du projet dm6arr6
dans de bonnes conditions et a ben6ficie d'un suivi et d'une regulation particuliers. En depit du
retard d'un an sur le calendrier initial, la mise en oeuvre est globalement satisfaisante. Toutefois
1'evolution de la realisation s'est faite de maniere contrastee selon la nature des composantes : Alors
que la composante travaux etait bien maitrisde dans son ensemble, la composante insitutionnelle
l'etait moins. Cette situation est imputable a la complexite de certaines composantes ( cas de l'etude
sur les pistes rurales et du reclassement du reseau routier ).
2.03 Le projet avait subi une relative insuffisance des cradits de contrepartie , en particulier a la suite
de l'adoption du deuxieme projet d'ajustement structurel . Le Gouvemernent a en effet 6t6 conduit i
reduire les depenses d'investissement, pour financer en priorite les actions sociales et reduire le
d,ficit budgetaire .
2.04 La devolution des marches s'est op6r6e conform6ment aux dispositions convenues avec La
Banque. Les appeis d'offires intemnationaux n'ont pas attire beaucoup de soci6tds rang&res .
lesquclles ont intervonu principalement dcns les prestations de services. Le processus de d6volution
des march6s s'talah vsr une moyenne de 4 mois. L?engagement des depenses a dans l'ensemnble et6
mene dans des ddlais iaisonnables, grace txx iesures mise cr oeuvre au tire du PAS . Par contre
les DPTP n'ont pas binn wa?trist les der.is des diffirentes phases de 1'execution budghtaire des
opdrations, en particulier a i'awont et A I' vai de la procidure d'engagement des d6penses . Cette
derni6re n'etant pas sous leur contr6le irnte,ra' . Ainsi de lngs d6lais ont-ils etd relev6s entre la mise
en place des credits et le jugement des offres ( 2,5 mois en moyenne ), entre cele-ci et la
presentation des propositions de depenses ( I mois en moyenne ); et, entre 1'engagement des
ddpenses et l'approbation des marchds par les autorites compiterntas (1,5 mois en moyenne ) . Cette
faible maitrise explique en partie les retards de la realisation du projet. Les delais contractuels de la
rdalisation des operations etant eux respectds en general.
2.05 Les proc6dures d'engagement des depenses et de paiement des ordonnances se sont ben
deroulees, surtout si on compare leur ex.ecution avec celle du 4eme projet routier ou le projet
PERST. Les performances cibles fixdes au taux des paiements pour le projet ont etd d6passdes grice
a la rnise en oeuvre des mesures du PAS .
2.06 Quant-aux decaissements, quoiqu'en leger decalage par rapport aux realisations, etaient
globalement satisfaisants, surtout si on les compare avec ceux des precedents projets finances par La
Banque. Ce resultat est egalement a mettre en rapport avec 1'execution du PAS . Neannoins
l'Wvolution des decaissements dtait preoccupante pendant la preniere partie de la p6riode de
rdalisation . Cette situation etait due a la lourdeur du dispositif de procedures assocides aux
decaissements. Ainsi a-t-it fallu envisager quelques mesures rectificatives dont en particulier:
-La mobilisation du plafond du fond de roulement a partir du 09 juin 1992
-Le remaniement de la procedure de decaissement et du systeme d'infonration qui lui est lie
-Le remboursement direct par La Banque de La Trdsorerie gdnerale du Royaume , en dehors du
compte sp6cial qui sert de support au fonds de roulement . Ce compte, bien que fonctionnant
convenablement et limitant le delai de paiement, s'epuisait en permanence
-L' adoption d'un programme special d'acceleration des decaissements (PSAD) en relevant les taux
de financements de La Banque.



8
2.07 Du fait d'une certaine anticipation des services de la DRC:R, les operations de travaux, objet
d'une multitude de marches largement dissemines sur le territoire du pays, ont demarre selon les
previsions . Les travaux de ponts, requerant des etudes prealablies et sournis a une procedure plus
lourde que les autres travaux, ont connu un retard d'une ann6e environ par rapport au calendrier.
L'acquisition de vehicules pour le transport des equipes d'entrerien n'a pas eu lieu, en raison des
restrictions budgetaires ayant emp&Mhd la mobilisation des credits de contrepartie correspondants.
2.08 L'etude sur les routes etroites et celle sur-les pistes rurales ont &e lancees avec un an de retard
mais ont bien evolue par la suite, sauf pour la seconde. L'elaboration du systerne de gestion de
chauss6es quant a elle a ete bien menee, apres des hesitations sur ses modalites.
Im- RESULTATS DU PROJET
ACCOMPLISSEMENT DES OBJECTIFS
3.01 Le projet etait fonde sur des objectifs de rationalisation des investissements routiers,
d'optimisation de gestion de l'entretien routier, d'amelioration de 1'etat de 1'entretien des routes.
Les resultats du projet peuvent &tre consider6s comme satisfaisnts, du fait qu'ils aient atteint, sans
aleas majeurs, la plupart de ses objectifs principaux. Cependant les rdsultats des composantes
institutionnelles et de politique sectorielle sont moins satisfaisarnts que ceux du volet travaux.
3.02 Le volet travaux a permis en particulier d'amdliorer l'tat ,genral du reseau routier. L'etat de
surface, bonne a tres bome, a globalement progressed de 53,00%o a 61,8% , cette amelioration est
plus prononcede sur le rdseau a trafic elevd. Les composantes institutionnelles ont enregistre des
r6sultats satisfaisants quoique moins afflrmes. En effet a l'exception des stages a l'etranger qui n'ont
pas dte accomplis, seule l'etude sur les pistes rurales a presente des resultats limit6s. Les
composantes institutionnelles ont notamment penmis de:
-Consolider le dispositif d'entretien et de gestion routiers (construction de 2 parcs regionaux de
materiel, mise en oeuvre d'un programme important de formation et de perfectionnement en matibre
d'entretien routier)
-Doter le CNER d'outils pour la gestion des chaussees.
-Rationaliser les investissements ayant trait a l'elargissement des routes etroites et aux pistes rurales:
D'ors et deja les etudes realisees dans le cadre du projet ont permis d'elaborer des programmes
d'investissement, dont une partie a alimente le volet travaux dii 6eme projet routier.
3.03 Au niveau du volet institutionnel, a l'exception des stages a 1'etranger qui n'ont pas dtd
accomplis, seule 1'etude sur les pistes rurales a presente des r6sultats limites a la deterrrination d'un
programme d'investissements . L'etude aurait du etre orientee vers la formalisation d'un outil de
rationalisation des investissements au niveau des dessertes rurales. L'identification recente du volet
routier, du programme de lutte contre les effets de la secheresse' a mis en relief cette limitation.
3.04 Sur le plan de l'ajustement de la politique sectorielle, la D)RCR avait procdd a une
reactualisation de l'etude sur la fiscalite routiere , int6grant l'augmentation des ressources du fonds
routier mais pas I'analyse de l'impact du differentiel des prix de l'essence et du diesel . Cependant
l'augnentation de ce fonds, operee dans l'exercice budgetaire de 1995, n'a pas ete destin6e a
consolider les ressources exclusivement affectees a l'entretien , mais pour l'extension de
l'infrastructure routiere a vocation rurale. La DRCR a par aillesurs r6ussi a faire progresser le
processus de reclassement, en faisant reunir l'ensemble des commnissions provinciales en charge de
prononcer un avis prealable A la determination du reseau routier provincial , demiere composante du
reseau routier A la charge des services de l'Etat restant i configurer, Les routes provinciales seront
officialisees incessamment, apr&s leur validation, en cours par les services du MTP .
3.05 La DRCR avait satisfait a toutes les dispositions du projet . Elle a en particulier assur6 pour
l'entretien routier des ressources plus importantes que celles prevues dans le projet, et accusant une



9
bonne progression tout au long de son execution . Par rapport aux previsions , les seuls ecarts
constat6s ont trait:
-Au respect de la procedure convenue avec La Banque (3.17 du rapport No7983-MOR), stipulant
la soumission prealable des operations de rehabilitation a son approbation formelle . Or les services
de la DRCR se sont inmites a 1'examen informel de certaines operations par les missions de La
Banque
- Le non respect, pour quelques operations routieres, des dispositions prevues au projet devant
laisser aux soumissionnaires le choix entre la fourniture du bitume par la DRCR ou son acquisition
par leur propre moyens, sur le marche national ou en l'important . Les marches les concemant n'ont
pas dt* lnt6gres au projet . Dans les faits aucune entreprise n'a use de cette Iibert6 . En effet seule
l'impottation de liants presenterait un inter8t , mais le demantelement du monopole de la SAMIR, en
matiere de fourniture de produits petroliers et de liants hydrocarbon6s, n'a pas encore ete oper6.
Dans l'ordre actuel des choses, il n'y a pas d'alternative plus concurrentielle A la fourniture de Hiants
a travers la DRCR .
-Le retard ( d'environ une annee ) dans l'elaboration des etudes des pistes rurales et des routes
etroites, ainsi que des prestations de l'expert en gestion de chaussees qui ont souffert des longues
h6sitations quant a la forme et aux modalites de leur execution
DIPACT SUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT
3.06 Les travaux de bitiment, situes dans des sites amenages a cette fin, sont d'ampleur limitte
pour generer des effets nuisibles sur 1'environnement . Les autres travaux ont trait a la r6habilitation
et 1'entretien p6riodique, qui n'ont occasionn6 ni utilisation de terres supplementaires ni des effets
sociales ou ecologiques ndfastes.
REALJSATIONS PHYSIQUES
3.06 Les travaux de batiment ont 6te enti6remnent r6alis6s, conform6ment aux previsions . Par
contre, tout au long du d6roulement du projet, les objectifs physiques du programme routier ont
subi des remaniements synth6fis6s comme suit:

Ces dcarts moins marqu6s la composante ponts, dont les operations correspondantes, ideatifi(es de
longue date, 6taient imperatives . Elle s'explique par la nature de la programmation de chrique
cat6gorie de travaux routiers et , par des contingences . D'une part la prograimmation des op6rations
routieres danas le cadre du projet se faisait au fur et a mesure du d6roulement du projet , apres
avalisation par la Banque. Cette programmation integrait les ajustements cons6cutifs A l'evolution
effective de 1'6tat du reseau routier. Par ailleurs, prevenant des degradations tres coOteuses, ainsi
que des coCats d'entretien routier courant, des couts d'exploitation des v6hicules , et des couits de
scurit6 , elle privilegiait les operations de revetement .

LES COUTS DU PROJET
3.07 Le cout total des differentes composantes relevant de la DRCR a connu un leger d6passernent
restant cependant admissible. Les ecarts de coat, par rapport aux pr6visions, ne sont pas uniformes
pour toutes les composantes. La plus importante parrnu celles-ci, les travaux routiers et de ponts,
accusent l'ecart le plus faible, en termes relatifs et absolus. Les coa,ts partiels des op6rations htaient
globalement maitrises, compte tenu des engagements contractuels: Les dcarts releves, du reste
insigniflants, sont donc a rattacher a la phase de preparation.

3.08 Au sein des travaux routiers les remaniements importants des parts relatives des diffirents
6l4ments des travaux routiers ( renforcements, revetements, marquage ,...), se sont traduits par unw
modification consequente de leur couts relatifs. Les services de consultants ont permis d'elargir le
dispositif de rationalisation et de gestion des investissements routiers. Is ont cependant souftert de
retards dans leur lancement et, surtout, dans leur execution. ls constituent, de par leur natre, la
composante la plus difficile a malttriser en termes de resultat et de couit . La faible mnairise lors de la
pr6paration explique les ecarts releves pour les travaux de batiment .
Le programme d'dquipement parait avoir et6 ambitieux, dans la mesure oil la non.acquisition des
v6hicules pour le transport du personnel de l'entretien routier est loin d'expliquer linmportance de
l'ecart constate. Par contre celui releve pour les ponts n'est qu'apparent, du fait qu'il correspond
approximativement au cout de l'ouvrage non r6alis6.
REEVALUATION ECONOMIQUE
3.09 La quasi totalite des operations realisees s'averent rentable i posteriori, eu egard aux criteres
suivants, preetablis lors de la preparation du projet:
- TRI superieur a 20% pour les travaux de renforcements
- TRI superieur a 24%, pour les travaux de RCU des sections
- TRI superieur a 40% pour les travaux de ponts
(voir note en annexe les elements do detail relatifsa  l'evaluation A posteriori des operations
d'investissement realisees) .
IV- PERENNITE DU PROJET
4.01 Les amiliorations de l'etat du reseau routier sont le resultat d'une approche i long terme des
problemes du secteur routier . D'importants projets y ont concourus en parallele avec le present,
ainsi que de nouveaux sont inities dans la mnme perspective, dornt le 6eme projet routier financ6 par
La Banque.



11
4.02 La rationalisation des investissements routiers est poursuivie par le Gouvernement . La mise a
contribution des resultats de ce projet, pour l'identification des programmes de routes rurales et
d'elargissemnent de routes 6troites, en est la confirmation. Par ailleurs l'optimisation de l'entretien,
deja entamre depuis la mise en ex6cution des resultats de l'etude d'am6lioration de l'entretien routier
en 1984, sera poursuivie par l'execution des actions formalisees par l'etude sur le systeme de
gestion des chaussdes. En outre, a l'appui de ces rdsultats la DRCR a mis en place, avec I'EHTP
un cycle superieur routier, destine a developper le potentiel des ingenieurs exercant dans le secteur
routier . En plus des cessions de perfectionnement sont dispensees pour tous les intervenants dans la
realisation et 1'entretien des routes par 1'IFEER . Ce dernier vient d'etre realise dans le cadre de la
cooperation avec le Gouvernement Japonais .
4.03 Compte tenu des progres du projet de decentralisation -deconcentration au sein du MTP , la
deconcentration au niveau regional doit etre renforcee, ainsi que les competences en matiere de
planification et de coordination des investissements routiers
4.04 Les resultats obtenues par le projet en matiere de securite routiere sont confortes par un certain
nombre d'actions deja entamees ( programme d'amenagements de securite a faible ccut,
renforcement du dispositif coercitif de la prevention,...), et par celles projetees ( la composante
securite routiere du 6eme projet routier, ... ) .
V-INTERVENTION DE LA BANQUE
5.01 A I'am3nt de ce projet, I'appui de La Banque a contribue a l'identification des principales
difficultes entravant le secteur routier. Les etudes financ6es dans le cadre du 3eme et du 46ine projets
routiers, et le dialogue avec le Gouvernement, lors de l'execution des differents proiets, y ont
largement coatribu6e. 11 en est de meme de la promotion et de la mise en oeuvre de certaines action;
et projets ( cr6ation du fonds routier, modification de la taxe annuelle sur les vehicule, dont le taux
etait inddperdant de I'&ge; ... )
5.02 S'agissant d'un projet sectoriel, il a ben6ficie de 1'expertise capitalisee par La Banque dans le
secteur routier . L'experience des quatre projets routiers, r&alis6s au Maroc grAce A ses financements
, a 6t6 detenninante dans la preparation des composantes institutionnelles et de politique iectorielle.
La Banque avait reserve au projet une sollicitude particuGere tout au long de sa trajectoire. Sa
contribution a la regulation du projet, dont les dispositions ont ete formellement insciites a l'accord
de pret, a aide la DRCR a en assurer la maitrise. Par ailleurs son concours etait determinant dans
l'orientation des etudes et l'instruction des rapports preliminaires.
5.03 L'action de La Banque a et deterfninante lorsqu'il s'est agi de redresser la situation des
decaissements, ce qui a redynamise le projet ( relevement des taux de financements de certaines
composantes routiers entre le 1\09\1 990 et le 3 1\12\1991 , remboursements directs de la Tr6sorene
du R.oyaurne pour certains montants sans passer par le fonds de roulement ). Par contre La Banque a
surestime les projections des decaissements, fondees sur des anticipations, trop optimistes, de
l'amelioration du contexte budg6taire.
I- COORDINATION DU PROJET ET APPUI D'AUTRES SERVICES DE L'ETAT
6.01 L'intervention des services du Ministere des Finances etait satisfaisante, aussi bien au niveau
des activit6s d'engagement des d6penses du projet que celles de paiement des ordonnances . Par
contre, dans la premiere periode de l'execution du projet , les taux de decaissement ont ete faibles .
Us ont subi les effets d'une procedure complexe, faisant intervenir plusieurs acteurs et la
transmission de nombreux documents . Les delais pris dans l'elaboration l'instruction et la
transmission de ces documents se repercutaient negativement sur ces taux . Ces derniers ont pu
retrouver une progression normale a mi-parcours, apres la prise d'un certains nombre de mesures
(optimisation du circuit de cheminement des documents, relevement du montant du fonds de



12
roulement, renouvellement des appels de fonds des 1'epuisement clu compte sp6cial, remnboursements
directs de la Tr6sorerie G1ndrale du Royaume )
6.02 Le PSR comporte plusieurs composantes relevant d'autres departements ( DAT , Mf). La mise
en place d'une coordination globale n'6tait pas formellement prevue par le projet ; ce qui explique les
carences de l'information, surtout au niveau des decaissements . :Partant de ces constats la DRCR
avait mis en place une cellule de coordination, bien qu' Ila fin du projet
VII- RELATIONS BANQUE-DRCR
7.01 La qualitd de la conduite de la realisation du projet a 6te tributaire de celle, exceUlente, des
relations entre La Banque et la DRCR. Les missions de supervisikon du projet taient des moments
forts de leur collaboration, qui se prolongeait par des echanges die documents et les feed-backs qui
s'ensuivaient (avis ou accord proaables sur les versions provisoires des rapports des diffdrentes
missions d'etudes , projets de cahiers de charges, dossiers de fkisabilit6 technico-dconomique, ... ).
Pkiodiquement, comme pr6vu dans le projet, La Banque dtait tenue inform6e de l'6volution du
projet , et des projections de la DRCR .
7.02 LA DRCR avait observ6 les dispositions du pret et pris en considration les avis de La Banque
. P6riodiquement, comme pr6vu dans le projet, La Banque 6tait tenue inform6e de l'evolution du
projet , et les projections de la DRCR, ainsi qu'un certain nombre de documents du projet, hi
dtaient soumis pour avis ou accord pr6alables ( versions provisoires des rapports des dffdrentes
missions d'6tudes , projets de cahiers de charges , dossiers de faisabilite technico-6conomique, ...).
VJIJ-CONCLUSIONS ET ENSEIGNEMENTS
8.01 Le financement de 1'entretien routier
La p6rennit6 des resultats de ce projet est conditionn6e par le rel,&vement des ressources au mvoau
des besoins requis pour un entretien routier optimal
8.02 Pr6paratioc des projets
II convient d'anticiper et d'approfondir plus la pr6paration des premieres tranches des projets avant
la conclusion des pr&s . Les montants requis A cette fin sont d'ailleurs modestes , compards au
manque a gagner en termes de maitrise de la r6alisation du projelt et de son exploitation ult6rieure.
L'6valuation retrospectives sera en outre facilit6e.
8.03 La maitnise de la gestion de l'execution
La gestion de l'execution du projet a niis en relief le potentiel latent d'une ame6lioration accrue de la
maitrise des delais . L'etalement de la devolution des marches ent est une illustration . D'o& la
necessitd de consacrer a la phase realisation d'avantage de ressources d'appui .
8.04 La procedure do d6caissement
La procedure complexe de d6caissement doit etre remani6e pouI- les projets fiturs, n convient
d'laborer une procedure modulable, selon la nature du projet , I'itnportance doe son financement et
la consistance des flux ( annuels ou mensuels ) des transforts de La Banque vers l'Emprunteur et les
sp&cificitds institutionnelies et organisationneles en vigueur.

ANNEXE 1
ELEMENTS RELATIFS A LA REEVALUATION
RETROSPECTIVE DES TRAVAUX ROIUTIERS ET DE PONTS



REEVALUATION ECONOMIQUE
I - Renforcement et rev6tement
La reevaluation economique des operations de renforcement et de revetement a ete eff ctu&e i raide
du modele EVAL actualise et repris sur le tableur lotus.
les 61ements consideres dans la reevaluation sont  : le trafic ? rUNI Je cout dcononmique de
I'investissement, le couit d'exploitation des v6hicules et les couts d'entretien.
Ces elements rentremc dans le calcul des coits et des avantages dans les situations saus et avec projet .
Les avantages considdr6s sont les gains en coaut d'exploitation des vehicules procur6s par une
amrlioration de !'UN7.
1 - Trafic
Les trfics utilises sont des TMJA a la date de mise en service .PDur les sections ne disposant pas de
trafic a cette date , des comptages de trafi ont 6t6 effectuds puis ramends a la date de mise en sevice
en adoptant un taux de croissance annuel de 5%.
2 - UNI
Les va!eurs de I'UNI correspondent a l'aiune de realisation du projet .Quand cette valor n'est pas
disponJlale, on abeute i la section les vakeurs suivantes:
- 3000 mm/klm pocu les r ute3 en enrob6s.
- 3500 a2nl= pour les -. tvues en 'Dnduit superficiel.
Le mocdele F.VAL est base sur l'evolutioh de I'UN  pendant los 15 annees de la pdrWe d'analysw
.Cette dvolution txtli3ee indiffrenmient pcur les deu.c situations 1 avec et sans projet ) suppose une
variation de l'UNI BIt dens la fourchette surm ate:
- Valeur initiale BIto=2000 mm/nk  ou 2500 nm/km selon quo le revetement est en emobes ou en
enduit superficiel . Ces valeurs minimales correspondent i PUNI d'une chauss6e neuve ou qui vient
d'tre renforcde .
- Valeur finale egale A 6000 maooim
(i)- Cas de P'enrobd
BIt = 2000 + 4000*obtrl
avec r = taux de croissance anmuel du trafic
(i) - Cas de 1'enduit superfcied
Bit = 2500 + 3500 * e'r-
e -l
L'age de la chaussde est calcule par ce modale a partir de la loil d'6volution prdcit6e et de rumNT
mesurd sur place .Cet age est ensuite utilisW; crimme date de demarrage de la pdriode d'analyse (15 axis)
pour la solution sans projet.



3 - Co&t economique d'investissement
Les economiques utilises correspondent a des couats hors taxes .La part des taxes a etd esm6e & 24%
du couLt financier .
4 - Coflt d'exploitation des vehicules
La fofmule adoptee est CEV = k*trafic annuel*UNI
avec k= 0.14787*1.06d
C'est la valeur utilis6e lors de l' valuation ex- ante actualisee a l'ann6e de redisation du projet A un
taux annuel de 6 %.
( d designe le nombre d'anniees entre 1988 et l'annee de r&lisation du projet)
5 - Couts d'entretien
Les coats utilises sont calculs a partir de ceux adoptes lors de 1'6valuation ex -ante moyemant une
actulisation de 6 % par an.Les couts economiques sont:
- Entretien courant : 6040 * 1. 06d  ({DH/1t1)
- Ezmplois partiels  : 208.3 * 1. 06d  (DHIkn/ metre de largeur de chauss6e)
Ainsi, le co-at d'entretien est:
( 6040 + 208.3 * L ) * 1. 06
L etant a largeur de chauss6e
Le calcul du TRI a dtd developpe sur tableur pour les 4 cas rencontres a savoir:
Renforcement avec couche de roulement en enrob6s : Fichier RF- EB
Renforcement avec couche de roulement en enduit superficiel : Fichier RF- ES
Revetenent avec couche de roulement en enrobes: Fichier RCU- EB
Revetement avec couche de roulement en enduit superficiel : Fichier RCU- ES
Resultats de la re6valuation economique
La reevaluation economique a porte sur 740.55 km de renforcement ( 54 sections) et 1542 km de
rev&ement ( 146 sections ) .les sections analysees variaient en longueur de I A 50km pour le
programme de revetement et de 1 A 70 kn pour le programme de renforcement.
Sur-les 54 sections analysees en renforcement, 42 ont des TRI superieur i 35 %, 11 sections ont des
TRI compris entre 12 et 34 %, et une section seulement a un TRI de 9 %.
Sur les 146 sections analys6es en rev8tement, 89 ont des TRI superieur a 35 %, 46 sections ont des
TRI compris entre 12 et 34 %, et Il sections seulement ont un TRI compris entre 4 et 11 %.
Ces resultats montrent que dans 1'ensemble , la rentabilite 6conomique des op6rations r6alis6es est
elevee.

REEVALUATION ECONOMIQUE
II- Amenagement des ouvrages d'art
La reevaluation economique des ouvrages d'art a ete effectuee A l'aide du programme informatique
EVALOA elabore lors du quatrinme projet routier et inplantd sur le micro-ordinateur Burrough26 de la
DRCR..
La methodologie d'dvaluation est basee sur une comparaison economique des coats de l'amenagement d'un
ouvrage ( et dventuellement de ses voies d'acc6s) , avec les avantages au trafic qu'il procure par rapport a
la situation sans amenagement . Ces avantages sont de deux sortes:
- ceux provenant de l'amelioration de la largeur du pont et/ou des caractefistiques routieres des voies
d'acces.
- ceux provenant de I'augmentation de la portaxice de l'ouvrage.
Pour le calcul dos avantages Uies A I'augmentation de la porance. on suppose que It, v6hiculcs dont le
poids depasse la charge limite de l'ouvrage existant sont obliges d'emprunter un itin6raire de dbtourment.
L'amenagement permet a tous les vehicules de passer par l'itineraire pont (ouvrage et voies d'acces ). La
difference pour les vehicules detourns ,entre le cofit de circulation sur l'itineraire de detournement ct cc
coult sur l'itineraire pont, constitue un avantage a mettre a l'actif du projet.
Les v6hicules non-detournes empruntent l'itineraire pont dans les deux situations sans at avec projet. On
suppose qu'a l'approche d'un pont etroit , les conducteurs decelerent jusqu'a ce qu'ils atteignent une
vitesse de traversee qui depend de l'etroitesse du pont et de son niveau de trafic. Apres avoir franchi le
pont,les conducteurs accelerent jusqu'a ce qu'ils reatteignent la vitesse norrale de circulation sur les voies
d'acces. Ces manoeuvres entrainent une augmentation du cout de circulation. On suppose qua
l'amenagement de i'ouvrage permet d'eviter de tels manoeuvres,et de ce fait donne lieu a un avantage au
trafic.
Une amelioration des caracteristiques routieres des voies d'acces ( largeur, trace en plan, profil en long,
dtat de surface ) se traduit egalement par une rdduction des coats de circulation a inscrire a l'actif du projet.
La calcul des coats de circulation utilise hL viathode de HDM version 2 .modifiee pour tenir compte de
l'impact de la congestion sur la vitesse et le coat d'exploitation des vdhicules.
La comparaison entre les couits et les avantages se fait sur une p6riode de 20 ans en supposant une valeur
residuelle de 67% du cout initial de l'am6nagement. Cette valeur est inscrite a l'actif du projet dans le bilan
economique.
Donnees d'entree du modele
Le modele utilise comme donnees d'entree:
* un ensemble d'eldments utilisds par le sous-modele cout de circuladon (caracteristiques de la flotte des
vdhicules , couts unitaires des vehicules et pneuinatiques,coult de la main d'oeuvre,ect ....) . Ces coOts
ont ete mis a jour aux conditions economiques de 1995.
* Ie niveau, la composition et le taux de croissance du trafic empruntant le pont et l'itineraire de
d6tournement.Ces donn6es ont ete mises a jour compte tenu de la date de r6alisation du projet.
* Ies caracteristiques du pont dans la situation de r6f6rence-
-longueur
-largeur circulable
-nombre d'arcs sur l'itin6rairc pont



* les caracteristiques de 1'itin6raire pont et de detournement dans la situation de r6fdrence:
les caracteristiques de l'itineraire de d6tournement sont a introduire uniquement lorsque la charge maximale
admissible du pont est inferieure a 44 T et un itineraire de d6tournement existe.
Pour chacun des itineraires pont et de detournement , on introduit les valeurs des parametres suivants:
-longueur
-rugosite
-rampe
-sinuosite
-largeur
-altitude
Les caracteristiques de l'itineraire pont en situation projet peuvent ere differentes de celles de l'itin6raire
pont existant si des amrnagements de la voie d'acces font parties du projet envisag6. Dans ce cas on fournit
une nouvelle description des caracteristiques des arcs d'acc-s.
Le cofit dconomique du projet : le cout utilisd correspond au coat hors taxes.La part des taxes a et
estimne a 24% du coat financier.
Ex6cution du modele
Le fichiers des donnees est intitule DONOA , il a 6te pr6pard a l'aide de 1'6diteur Btexte du B26.
Les resultats du programmne sont envoy6s automatiquement vers un fic!iier texte denonrn  OAOUT.
Les OA ayant fait l'objet de la r6evaluation par le modele EVALOA figurent dans le tableau suivant:

Resultats de la reevaluation 6conomique
Les resultats des evaluation sont foumis en annexe pour chacun des ouvrages analyses.Ils montrent que
pour l'ensemble des ouvrages reevalues , les TRI restent superieurs a 40 % a l'exception de 1'OA situe
sur la RP 30 pour lequel le TRI est de 28 %. Ceci est probablement dii a la major tion du couit de
l'amenagement qui atteint 85 % du couat initial pr6vu .
Par ailleurs , on constate que pour la majoritd des OA analys6s , les trafics reels de nmise en service sont en
dessous de ceux prevus a cette date par l'evaluation initiale . Par contre , les couts effectifs restent voisins
des cofits initiaux prevus sauf pour 1'OA situe sur la RP 30 deja cita.
