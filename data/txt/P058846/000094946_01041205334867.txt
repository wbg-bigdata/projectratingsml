1. Project Introduction
1.1 A Survey of the Project and Its Significance
1.1.1 Scope of the Project Design
(1) Baoji Station (including K1244+600) to Lanzhou station (including K1744+000);
(2) Baoji Pivot Supplementary Project
(3) Lanzhou Pivot Supplementary Project
1.1.2 Significance of project & geographic location of the line
In Northwest China railways, which head eastward from Weiwu-South Station, through Lan-
Wu section of Lan-Xin rail-line and Baoji-Lanzhou section of Longhai rail-line and through
Gan-Wu and Bao-Zhong rail lines, meeting at Baoji and heading eastward from Xi'an, are
called East-heading railways of Northwest China. Of the East-heading railways, Bao-Zhong
railway and Baoji-Lanzhou section of Longhai railway are two single-track lines, which bear
72% of the outward-conveying goods and 90.2% passenger conveyance in northwest region.
They used for passenger and goods exchange with the east, the central and the southwest
regions of China, as a result, they have heavy transportation load. The railway-attracting area,
with its vast land, is an important base for energy and material supplies and a strategic rear
base of China. Since China's opening-up and reform, northwest region has experienced a
rapid development in economy and a rapid increase of materials conveyed to other regions.
During the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, Bao-Zhong rail-line was built, of which the total
conveyance weight has amounted to 9.4 million ton, though it has been in use for only three
years. To date, the east-heading railways are being fully used and their transportation capacity
is badly in need of further increase by means of rail-line reconstruction.
Northwest region's east-heading railways have a conveyance capacity as follows: Bao-Lan
section of Longhai railway operates 15 pairs of passenger trains and 10.79 million ton goods
conveyance, and Bao-Zhong railway operates 3 pairs of passenger trains and 14.2 million ton
goods conveyance. The total conveyance capacity amounts to 18 pairs of passenger trains and
24.99 million tons for goods conveyance. According to the analysis on the actual growth of
economy and rail-transportation in northwest region and State's capital investment in the
northwest regions, especially in exploitation of petroleum, chemical fertilizer, agriculture and
colored metal. It is
predicted that in the year 2005 the total volume of outward-conveying goods will be 33



million tons and that 30 pairs of passenger trains are needed. A further railway transporting
capacity of 8 million tons for goods conveyance and 12 pairs of passenger trains is to be
required. In 2010 the total volume of outward-conveying goods will be 41.5 million tons and
36 pairs of passenger trains are needed, so there is a shortage transporting capacity of 16.5
million tons for goods conveyance and 18 pairs of passenger trains. Therefore, one of the two
railways should be reconstructed into a two-lined railway with large transportation capacity to
meet the needs.
To build a two-lined railway with large capacity. two construction plans are proposed, either
to add a second line to Bao-Lan railway or to Bao-Zhong railway. After a feasibility study,
reasoning and comparison, the Railway Ministry find that adding a second line to Bao-Lan
railway corresponds with the main direction of passenger and goods transportation. This will
result in great flexibility and adaptability of the existing railway-net, which will benefit
economic development of Gansu Province, especially Lanzhou. one vital city in northwest
regions Therefore, the plan to add a second line to Baoji-Lanzhou Section of Longhai
Railway is adopted.
This railway section starts in the east from Baoji Station in Baoji City, Shaanxi Province,
which lies in the west end of Weihe Plain, then goes along Weihe River up to Longxi Station,
then it heads up Xian River, a branch of Wei River, to Mahe town, passes through
Dayingliang watershed and then via Dingxi Basin, along the upper reaches of Guanchuan
River, goes through Quercha watershed in Lijiaping and runs down along Wanchuan River,
enters the valley of Yellow River at Sangyuanzi and goes against Yellow River up to Lanzhou,
Capital of Gansu Province. The topography of the places the rail-line passes by is low in east
and high in west, which appears to be an unsymmetrical "M" shape.
1.2 Economic Outline within the second Bao-lan Railway Attracting Area
1.2.1 Large part of the second Bao-lan Railway lies in Gansu province. It's direct attracting
area covers 70,000 square kilometers, and the current population is about 9 million.
There are rich mine resources in northwest regions, over 100 kinds of minerals have been found
out, most of which are coal, petroleum, iron ore, salt, mirabilite, asbestos, cement rock, fire-
tightening materials, and rare metals such as copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, manganese,



chromium, etc. Nearly 40 kinds of minerals that have been found out have the largest reserves
all over China.
In the direct economic attracting area of this section, these are relatively many kinds of mineral
resources, among which colored metal-mine and non-metal minerals are relatively rich.
The reserves of lead and zinc mineral in the zone of Tianshui City and Cheng county and Xihe
County are over 115 million ton, currently are mined by Changba, Luoba and other county or
village factories. The biggest factory is Changba Lead-zinc Mineral of Chengxian County,
which mines 1,000 tons of mineral per day, and which can mine 3,500 ton daily at the
completion of the "Ninth Five-year Plan" extending project. And it is planned to carry the third
term of extending project after 2000, so Changba will mine 600 tons more ther.. After being
washed and chosen, Luoba lead and zinc minerals are loaded mainly at Tianshui Station, and
conveyed by means of railway to Northwest Smelter, while a small amount of fine minerals is
conveyed to the Northeast and Hubei.
Non-metal minerals include mainly limestone, dolomite, serpentine, silicon, etc. Limestone
distribute mainly in Wushan county and Yuzhong county, and the reserves is 102.32 million ton,
which has been exploited and availed; dolomites and silicones and other non-metal minerals are
all being exploited on small scale.
1.2.2 Current status of industry and agriculture and future development
Within the area of the railway section's direct economic attraction, the GNP of 1997 is 15.7
billion yuan (measured by contemporary price), the first industry occupies about 30%, the
second industry about 40%, and the third industry about 30%.
In northwest region the industry structure consists of coal, petroleum, electricity, chemistry,
smelter, mechanic, electronics, building materials, light textile and food companies. Among
these, heavy industry characterized by with exploitation of raw material and fuel and raw
processing is dominant, but has comparatively low economic interest. Currently, Such industries
as coal, petroleum, smelting, chemical fertilizer and building materials are more relative to the
volume of goods conveyance of this railway section.
. 3 -



Along this section the agriculture is characterized with crops planting, but it has small
developing potentiality, limited by natural condition. Within direct economic attraction area of
this section, the land is of poor quality and the natural condition is rather bad, the agricultural
foundation is poor. Available fields for planting cover about an area of 22 million mu, and total
crop production is about 2.3 million tons. mainly consisting of wheat, corn and peas; total
production of oil vegetable is about 90,000 ions. Currently food crop of the area can almost
meet the needs, some amount of oil crop wvill be transferred in or out as sample adjustment. The
Gross Agricultural Production in the area is about 8 billion yuan
1.2.3 Communication and Transportation
Currently within the area, transportation is conducted by means of railway or highway
Conveyance in regions along the Bao-Lan line is mainly by means of railway, highway
transportation facilities is comparatively poor.
Highway from Baoji to Tiashui is a part of National Highway Route 310, Which is now being
under an extension project according to standard of level 2 highway, Highway from Tianshui to
Longxi is a part of National Highway Route 316. Much of the Road from Longxi to Dingxi is of
poor quality, of which only 15 kilometers reaches the standard second class highway, and 20
kilometers reaches to that of the third class highway. Highway from Dingxi to Lanzhou carries
large vehicle flowage.
Along with gradual realization of roads extension project and building a second track to the
Bao-Lan line, conveyance transportation condition will be greatly improved.
1.3 Explanation about the change of design
Chinese government decided to implement strategy of western development. In order to
coordinate the strategy, the MOR decided to change the design. The aim of the changing is to
increase the speed. It can be divided to two section and take Tianshui city Gangu county
Weishuiyu station as the center. The Weishuiyu---Lanzhou is called west section, the aim of the
design changing is to cancel the little radius. The Weishuiyu-Baoji is called the east section,
the aim of the design changing is to increase bridges and railway tunnels. It also increases 5
stations in the section. Please refer 1.9 for detail information.
The amount of land acquisition increases 1790.38 mu, the amount of the land acquisition
affected persons increases 1247; the amount of housing demolition increases 98404.1m2,the
*1* 



amount of the housing demolition affected household increases 634 after the changing of
design.
1.4 budgetary estimate of capital investment of the second Bao-lan Rail-line
The total of capital investment in the second Bao-Lan rail-line project is 11,260.853 million
yuan with a technologic-economic index of 23.6433 million yuan per kilometer of main track
of the total. Budgetary estimate of static capital investigation is 9,017.868 million yuan with a
technical-economic index 18.9340 million yuan per kilometer of main track; capital put aside
for project price increasing is1,110.444 million yuan; Loan interest during construction is
848.0935 million yuan; money for purchasing locomotives is 284.449 million yuan.
50% of the total investment is railway construction capital, and the other 50% include 98
million dollars from the World Bank and the load from the National Development Bank.
1.5 Project Designing and Feasibility Verification
The First Surveying and Designing Institute of Railway Ministry undertake the designing
work of the Second Bao-Lan Rail-line.
(1) According to Railway Survey and Design Plan in 1993 of Railway Ministry, the First
Surveying and Designing Institute of Railway Ministry started the preliminary design in
March of 1994, and finished the project design in October, then reported to Railway
Ministry in the same year.
(2) According to Railway Survey and Design Plan in 1995 of Railway
Ministry, the First Surveying and Designing Institute of Railway Ministry
finished the report on feasibility research of the Second Bao-Lan Rail-line in June of 1995
(a version for review).
(3) According to Document [1998] No.66 Notif/cation on Adjustment of Railway Survey
and Design Plan of 1998, the First Surveying and Designing Institute of Railway Ministry
finished revised report on feasibility research of Bao-Lan second rail-line in December of
1998 (revised version after the review)
(4) On December 28h, 1998, the Planning Department of the Railway Ministry reported in
Document [1998] No.372 "Correspondence on reporting and sending item proposal of
adding a second track to railway from Baoji to Lanzhou section of Long-Hai Railway" to
the National Development Planning Comnmittee. China International Consulting Company
undertook an evaluation of the item proposal.
(5) Revision of preliminary design was finished in May of 1999 and sent to the Railway
* 5 .



Ministry. Technical design of the project was accomplished in October of 1999 and hand in
part of the working drawings. At the end of 1999 will be preparation before construction done,
and the project will be began in the winter of 2000; It is expected to finish the project in four
years, and the project be carried out in 2004
1.6 Proprietorship and Organization of the Project
The Second Bao-Lan Rail-line Project is one of the key state construction projects; the
proprietor of the project is the Railway Ministry. Zhenzhou Railway Railway Bureau and
Lanzhou Railway Bureau are the agents of the proprietor that will responsibility of
administrating the rail-line. The section from Baoji to Shetang is under the administration of
Xi'an Branch of Zhenzhou Railway Bureau; section from Tianshui to Lanzhou is under the
Administration of Lanzhou Branch of Lanzhou Railway. The dividing point of the two
bureau's administrations is between Shetang and Tianshui, and the mileage of the dividing
point is Zhenzhou Bureau K1392+530=Lanzhou Bureau K1398+137.6.
The land administration Bureaus of Shaanxi Province and Gansu Province had contracted
with the Railway Ministry to manage the implementation of land acquisition, housing
demolition and reallocation as well as population settlement.
1.7 Measures to be taken to reduce land acquisition and housing demolition
According to relevant directions of World Bank and the State policies practiced in China, and
in considering people affected by the project, large amount of land acquisition, housing
demolition and reallocation and population settlement should be reduced to possible extent by
means of adjusting design if it is possible. In case population reallocation and resettlement is
inevitable, best efforts mast be made to compensate property of the affected people and
enterprises to be resettled, to help out their removal, and to ensure that the living standard of
the affected remains no lower than that they have prior to their removal.
In order to reduce population tc be resettled, the project designers made careful choice of the
rail-line route in project feasibility research. In the project design, they tried their best to
avoid or reduce the amount of land to be acquired and houses to be demolished and
reallocated in addition to considering such factors as topography, geology and capital
investment, etc. The following section presents more information in this respect.
(1) All filling earth of railway roadbeds and station sites is to be taken from far-away earth-
mounds, river-bends or uncultivated land, so that less farmland and rich land will be used. The



earth abandoned from the bridge and culverts constructions is used for repairing river dams so
that less land will be used.
(2) The only additional engineering is the construction of the supplementary facilities of
water supply, drainpipes and other subsidiary structures at Baoji pivot and Lanzhou pivot
caused by the Second Bao-Lan Rail-line Project
(3) Train operation: According to the principle of one-time planning, construction by stages
and formation of capacity, the whole section is divided into two construction stages.
Because of relatively scattered distribution of the areas within the rail-line controlling
capacity throughout the whole section, construction by stages will increase engineering of
housing demolition, constructing housing for transition and temporary utility and housing
abundant. In order to solve these problems, especially large quantity of housing
demolition. The ISt Surveying and Designing Institute of Railway Ministry made a
research on construction plan at different stages according to section division. The
designers proposed to make Tianshui the dividing point and to implement the
construction at two stages. They suggest to construct Tianshui-Lanzhou double lines and
Baoji-Tianshui double lines by stages in a self-confined manner, so as to reduce housing
demolition and relocation, and to reduce constructing housing for transition and
temporary utility as well as engineering in housing abundant.
(4) Line route: In line route design, the now-existing building and equipment are used as
much as possible, and in principle, now-existing lines are not to be re-constructed. At the
same time, full consideration is given to issues related to land acquisition and housing
demolition & relocation in designing new lines. Examples as follows:
A: Comparison and choice between plans of drawing second lining into east part of Luomen
Station covering K1459+500-K1497+443
The main engineering of this section is Luomen Nan River bridge. In accordance with the
location of Luomen Station, the CIK plan adopts plane curve radius with R-400 two orbits, the
track goes through south side of provincial Light industry school, and part of the school will be
removed. Investment of this project is 15.09 million yuan. The advantage of this plan is to
increase plane-curve radius is conduce to speeding up. The weak point is too big the impact on
the school.
7 -



The CYK plan is to move station-heart westward and keep now-existing line on Luomen Nan
river bridge as out-pulling line, then newly build Luomen Nan river two-track big bridge.
Investment of this project is 17.25 million yuan. The advantages of this plan are a shorter line.
better line-mode, and avoiding passing through the school. The weak point is a comparatively
larger investment.
Through comparison, CYK plan is adopted.
C: Comparison on plans on the second line's passing through Mafengzui Tunnel (K1521+500---
K1526+700): In this section there is now-existing line 5.2 km, 4 tunnels with a total length
1270.4m. According to project situation of passing through Mafengzui tunnel and railway
situation of its two end, three plans: CK, CIK, CIIK are proposed to be compared.
CIIK Plan: The second line to be added will lie on the left of now-existing line and goes along
it to K1522+300, and enter the cave at 130m on the left of Tunnel 1 on the now-existing line,
and al.17km-long tunnel will be built through Mafengzui. The length of the second line is
4.142km, that is, 1.058 km shorter than the now-existing line and the correspondent investment
will be 69.79 million yuan.
3 The advantage of this plan is the shortest line length by passing through Mafengzui tunnel,
the expenditure on the main engineering will be comparatively less.
3 The weak points are
(1) the longest line, large railway base project, large volume of fence work, and big
interference on engineering in the section parallel to the now-existing line
(2) entrance to Mafengzui Tunnel will have to pass through 1 50m apple-orchard.
CIK Plan: The entrance to Mafengzui tunnel is different from that of CIIK plan, that is, it
avoids fruit-tree reallocation. The direction of pulling-out line is concordant with CIIK Plan.
The Mafengzui tunnel is 1.3 km long, the second line is 3.57km long, that is, 1.63 km shorter
than now-existing line, and the project investment is 71.15 million yuan according to this plan.
* The advantages is hat the plane-line mode is better than CIIK, for it need 1 curve less than
CIIK, the working condition of entrance to Mafengzui tunnel is nice, and it will not
involve fruit-trees removal.
* Weak points are
(1) Exit of Mafengzui tunnel is connected with with bridge-tunnle, so it is
difficult to work on the project and to rid waste-grounds;rock round the
cave opening is broken and collapses seriously.
* 8 -



(2) large interference on working if section parallel to now-existing line.
CK Plan: Entrance location of passing Mafengzui tunnel is the same as CIK, the exit is face-
to -face with Yuanyang town station and 200 m away from the newly-built road bridge.
Mafengzui tunnel is 1.67 km long; while that of the second line is 3.074 km long, 2.126 km
shorter than now-existing line. The investment is 69.29 million yuan according to this plan.
* The advantages are a short line, a nice line-model; small removal, little farmland use, no
fruit-tree removal,small project investment, wide topogrphyt at the entrance and exit of
the tunnel, nice working condition, available place for ridding waste-grounds.
* The weak points are a comparatively poor geology at the exit of Mafengzui tunnel and it is
close to disorderly objects.
Based on all the comparisons, the CK plan is adopted. Table 1-5 is a comparison of the
economic statistices of these three plan:

(4) Railway stations:
At Lanzhou station, a downward, out-circling main line will be built; two plans on evacuation
. 9 .



of traffic at the bottlenecks are proposed to this project. One is to build a downward, out-
circling main line; the other is to build a downward, elevated main line.
Plan I: The second line is pulled out at the 18th railroad switch, beyond the two bottlenecks at
the east and west ends of Lanzhou Station, from K1743+800. It goes along the southern side of
the now-existing rail-line, then travels through residential buildings and goes round the
mechanical work section, out-circles the Number 5 platform. Then it connects with west
bottleneck and ends at K1747+700.
* The advantages of the plan are as follows
(1) loosen crossing interference resulting from arrivals of down travelling
Passenger-goods trains and locomotives' entering or out-going; increase flexibility of
working.
(2) Improve technical standard of the station; increase speed of goods-trains'
Passing through the station.
0 The weak points are as follows
(I) The line goes through residential buildings and result in loud noise that is above the
standard set in the National Environmental Index.
(2) Four enterprises and two residential areas will be enclosed within the line;
goes on the ground close to the highway; there is no space for putting up a cloverleaf,
and therefore it is unsafe to set up a plane crossing road. .
(3) Many enterprises and houses will be removed, and it is difficult to arrange the
resettlement.
Plan II: second track is pulled out at line 18 from k1744+900, and heads westward paralleling
to main down-travelling track with a distance of 8 m, and ends at Kl 747+700.
* The advantages of Plan II are as follows.
(1) to loosen crossing interference resulting from down-travelling goods-trains'
passing-by and locomotives' entering and out-going.
(2) To improve technical standard of main track in the station; increase speed of cargo
trains passing through the station.
* The weak points are as follows.
(1) The distance between the second line and the now-existing line is small and the speed
of downward-travelling passenger and cargo trains will be slowed down during the
construction of the fences, the railway roadbed and the landing bridge.

1.8 Preparation for Land Acquisition Housing Demolition & Population
Resettlement
(1) Specification of scope of land acquisition and housing demolition
The institute in charge of the project design will survey the whole line during the stage of
technical design. measure and mark land to be collected and houses to be pulled down on spot,
then draw a cross section diagram of the line route and a house distribution map. The scope of
housing demolition uses the maximum controlling figure during technical design stage, and the
figure Xwill be gradually be made more accurate and it will decrease according to the demands of
construction design.
(2) Socioeconomic survey on regions along the line
In order to analyses impact on the regions alone the second Bao-Lan rail-line and to make a
feasible working plan, the Railway Ministry deputed the lIt Surveying and Designing Institute
to conduct a study on socioeconomic conditions of the regions along the whole line. With close
cooperation of the land administration departments of Gansu and Shaanxi provincial
govemrnents, an investigation was conducted in 1998 on the socioeconomic conditions of the
cities and counties affected by the project. The 1St Surveying and Designing Institute made
another detail investigation about social economy on Baoji-Weishuiyu in 2000 year for the
changing of the design. The main contents of the investigation are fannland resources, industry
structure, economy level, people's income and expenditure status, population, living styles,
cultural customs, traffic conditions, resources status and development prospect, etc. In this study,
a combination of various methods was adopted, such as collecting all the available statistic data,
interviewing people on spot, and surveying on samples.. Therefore, large amount of informnation
was obtained, which forms a solid foundation for making RAP.
(3) Object Index Investigation
Along with gradual accomplishment of the technical design, The I" Surveying and Designing
Institute of Railway Ministry had made a detailed study on all sub-items of the project with the
help of all local governments concemed in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. This study concerns
with land to be acquired, houses to be demolished and reallocated, and the number of people to
be affected, the labor force to be resettled, and the infrastructures and above-ground attachments
to be affected etc. This investigation will be conducted by means of investigating people family
by family, village by village, and building by building so as to get the details of the impact of
* 11 -



the project in respect of people's loss in objects
(4) Consultation between the Railway Ministry and the two provincial governments
Upon the completion of the technical design of the project, the Railway Ministry had reached an
agreement with the local governments on issues concerning standards of compensation for land
acquisition, housing demolition, and population resettlement. They had set up an organization
institutional network for the land acquisition and the housing demolition. The MOR reached an
agreement with the Gansu province in May 2000 year and with Shaanxi province in July 2000
year. The Gansu province and Shaanxi province had set up leading group about the building of
the Bao-lan the second railway to settle the matters about land acquisition and housing
demolition.
(5) Preparatory work on the RAP
The preparatory work has been doing by the Project Administration departments of Lanzhou
railway branch Bureau and Xi'an railway branch Bureau, the 1' Survey and Design Institute of
MOR together with the land administration departments under the governments of Gansu
province and Shaanxi Province. The project owner has also invited the resettlement experts
from the Institute of Foreign Capital Introduction and Utilization of Southwest Jiaotong
University as the project consultants.
All parties involved in the making the RAP for the Second Baoji-Lanzhou Rail-line Project
should work on the basis of the preliminary work that will be accomplished sooner or later. The
work includes setting up organizational institutions, specifying the scope of project impact,
investigating on the socioeconomic conditions of the regions to be affected, verifying loss in
objects to be caused by the land acquisition and housing demolition, studying the relevant
policies, laws and regulations, negotiating and making the resettlement plans, and specifying
compensation standards for resettlement. It is necessary to emphasize that the current report is
written on the basis of the technological design. The statistics regarding the loss in objects also
come from the technological design data provided by the I"t Survey and Design institute.
1.9 description and evaluation for the 5 new opened station
The following are the description and evaluation for each one of the 5 stations along the
Baoji-Weishuiyu section. The descriptions are detailed for this issue was not mentioned in the 5
before versions of the report. .

1.9.1 Chaoyu Station. Chaoyu station is located in Chaoyu village of Chaovu townnship of
Baoji City, Sa'anxi Province. The village is about 30 km away from downtown Baoji City and it
is within the scope of the suburbs of Baoji according to the city planning. Chaoyu township
consists of 8 villages with a population of 5300. of whom 2810 are laborers. T1he total cultivated
land area is 12352 mu. The total income of the township in 1999 was 5.67 million yuan, of whih
2.7033 million yuan was from agriculture sector, 0.6302 million yuan was from industry, and
2.3365 million yuan was from the third industry. In terms of ratios. incomes from the three
sectors accounted 47.7%, 11% and 43.3% respectively. The annual average pure income per
capita in 1999 was 880 yuan. There are 8 villagers groups, with a total population of 1444 from
340 households, of whom 780 are laborers. The total cultivated land area of the village is 2599.2
mu, 1.8 mu per capita and the annual average pure income of the farmers in 1999 was 1006
yuan.
144 mu cultivated land will be acquired from Chaoyu village, of which 74 is water irrigated and
70 mu is dry land. 19920 m2 residential housing and attachments will be demolished, of which
1920 m2 is brick-concrete structure building with multiple floors, 8600 rn2 is brick-tile structure
housing and 9400 m2 is simple structure attachments. In addition, 4010 non-economic trees will
be cut down. The land acquisition will affect 44 people and the housing demolition will affect
55 households.
Post the land acquisition for the new station, farmers in Chaoyu village will still possess
sufficient cultivated land, 1.7 mu per capita. Since the land resource is rich there, the village
decides to resettle the affected people by means of reallocating land within the village. In the
mean time, the township will build a large market near the new station, where many storefronts
will be built for rent, and the local farmers with a certain amnount of capital can rent the
storefronts to do their own business. Because of the large amount housing demolition, the
township government and the village council have decided to use 20 mu land as house sites and
a new villager residence zone will be unitarily planned and constructed. This provides the
affected households a good opportunity of renewing houses and to improve their living
conditions.
Construction of the new Chaoyu station is a good opportunity for the development of Chaoyu
*13



township for several reasons. First, there used to be no railway station at Chaoyu township but
now not only the railway station of Baoji-Lanzhou railway is built here but also, the secoad
track line of Baoji-Chendu railway will lead to Chaoyu, and thus Chaoyu will be at tLe
intersection joint of the two important railways. The state highway route 310 will be completed
and put in use soon and the township government will be moved to a place close to the new
railway station. The zone close to the railway station will become the political, economic aind
cultural center, as well as the trade and commercial center of the Chaoyu township. This vill
have an immeasurable impact on the overall development of the township. Second, it will be
more convenient to export the local products such as lumbers, pepper, fruits and vegetables an,d
the farrners' expense in this respect will be reduced. In the process of building station, the
construction unit will use a large amount of locally produced materials like high-quality stone
sheets and sand and the localities will get approximately 2 million yuan income from it, as is
expected. The consumption of the station construction workers will promote the local third
industry and the local laborers can get some income from their temporary jobs in the
construction project. All this will greatly improve the villagers' living.
The investigation panel visited Li fengxiang, the vice head of the township, Zhao Ami,
secretary of the village Party branch and some of the affected people.
1.9.2 Majiawan Station. Majiawan Station is located at Majiawan village of Hudian township
Baoji County. Hudian Township consists of 10 villages. The township has a population of 6324
from 1411 households, of whom 2878 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated land is 14464
mu, 2.28 mu per capita. Of the cultivated land, 1415 mu is water irrigated, and the rest is dry
land or slopes, the ratios of the two categories of land are 10% and 90% respectively. The
annual pure income of the township in 1999 was 829 yuan per capita, of which more than 50%
came from agriculture and the rest was from wages of the villagers who work elsewhere and
incomes from the second and the third industries. Majiawan village has 7 villagers groups.
There are 1137 people from 264 households, 385 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated
land in this village is 2524 mu, 2.22 mu per capita. Of the cultivated land, 210 mu is water
irrigated and the rest is dry land. The ratios of the two categories of land are 9% and 91%
respectively. The annul average pure income of the villagers in 1999 was 1100 yuan per capita,
of which more than 50% was from agriculture. The young and middle-aged laborers of
Majiawan village work elsewhere all the year round, of the 385 laborers, more than 200 work on
i 14



long term jobs in other places, accounting more than 55% of the laborers. Income from their
jobs is a very great component of the total family income.
To build the station, 29 mu dry land will be acquired from Majiawan village and 36 mu land
will be taken back from within the railway sector. 610 m2 housing will be demolished. The land
acquisition will affect 6 people and the housing demolition will affect 5 households. After the
land acquisition for the railway station project, people in Majiawan village will possess 2.19 mu
land per capita. Since the village's land resource is rich and the amount of land acquisition is
not big, the affected people can be well resettled by means of land reallocation within the village.
The measures of resettling the people affected by housing demolition are to disburse land as
house sites, to pay compensations to the individuals who will build new houses by themselves.
Construction of the new railway station will bring some new opportunities to Majiawan village
for its further development. First the local traffic conditions will be better and it will be more
convenient for people's communication and goods exchange. Second, a new commercial and
trade center will be established near the railway station, which will promote the local second
and the third industries. Third, the local construction material and labor force provided to the
station construction project will bring more incomes to the localities. Fourthly, consumption of
the construction workers will promote the development of the local second and third industries
and renewal of the local people's ideas.
The investigation panel interviewed Wang Jiali, head of Fudian township, Wang Dechong, Li
Zhanghua, head of the first village group and Yang Falin, head of the second villager group and
some of the affected people.
1.9.3 Xiatuoshi Station. Xiatuoshi Station is located at Xiatuoshi village of Baoji County,
about 500 meters away from the old railway station. There are 6524 people from 1664
households in Tuoshi Township, of whom 2892 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated land
is 13907 mu, 2.5 mu per capita. The total annual grain output was 1344 tons, 223 kg per capita.
The total income of the township was 9.3408 yuan, of which 6.48 yuan was from agriculture,
1.257 million yuan was from industry, and 1.6038 million yuan was from the third industry. In
1999, the average pure income of the villagers was 817 yuan per capita. The population of
Tuoshi village is 1610 from 380 households, of whom 871 are laborers. The total cultivated land
* 15-



area is 2456 mu, 1.5 mu per capita. In 1999, the total income of the village was 2.753 million
yuan, of which 1.144 million yuan is from agriculture, 609400 yuan was from industry, and
999600 yuan was from the third industry. The total grain output was 380 tons, 236 kg per capita.
The average pure income of the villagers in 1999 was 883 yuan per capita. The data cited above
reveal that both Tuoshi Township and Tuoshi village are traditional rural village(s) engaging in
agriculture production and the incomes from agriculture sector accounts about half of the total
income.
In order to construct the new Tuoshi station, it is necessary to acquire 50 mu dry land and 21 mu
orchard land from the village. 620 m2 simple structure housing built for people in guard of the
orchards will be demolished, 2230 fruit trees will be cut down and a water well will be filled up,
and 26 people will be affected. Since the housing to be demolished is simple structures for
people in guard of the orchards, no people need to be resettled for their residences. After the
land acquisition for the station, the villagers will still have 1.48 mu land per capita, the
acquisition has little impact on the villagers and surplus laborers can be well resettled by means
of land reallocation. The village council planned to disburse part of the land compensations to
the villagers and use part of the fund on developing 100 new land. Still some of the fund will be
invested in a sandstone processing mill and a food-processing factory so as to increase
economic incomes of the village collectives and to change the industry structure.
Construction of the new Tuoshi station is a new opportunity of development for both Tuoshi
Township and Tuoshi village. Firstly, the township will become larger in size, with its center
shifting to the west of the railway station, which will be a new influential political and culture
center. Secondly, the increase of the amount of passenger and goods transportation will
obviously stimulate the flowing of export of the local farm products and the export of goods
from other regions. Thirdly, the increase of population in mobility will promote the development
of the local second and the third industries so that the traditional industrial structure with
agriculture as the core will be changed. Fourthly, the township and the village can make an
income of 3 million yuan at least by means of providing the construction units sand, stone and
laborers, and thus the local people's income will be increased and their and living conditions
will be improved.
The investigation panel interviewed Gezhijun, head of the Tuoshi Township, Qin Heming,

the affected people.
1.9.4 Xiajianhe Station.  Xiajianhe station is located in Xiajianhe village of Fegeling
Township, Baoji County. It is only 300 m from the old Xiajianhe station. Fenggeling township is
at the far west end of Sa'anxi Province, and it is a poor mountainous township. There are
altogether 12 villages in this township, with a population of 11546 from 2413 households, of
whom 4018 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated land is 24060 mu, 2.08 mu per capita.
In 1999, the average pure income for the local people was 811 yuan per capita. Fenggeling is an
agriculture township with almost no industry enterprises. There are 2080 people in from 450
households in Xijianhe village, of whom 1347 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated land
is 2871 mu, 1.38 mu per capita, of which 907 mu is water irrigated land and the rest is dry land.
In 1999, the average pure income of the villagers was 1060 yuan per capita, of which more than
60% came from agriculture. Working elsewhere is the main source of the villagers' income and
there is almost no the second and the third industries in this village.
In order to build Xiajianhe station, it is necessary to acquire 117 mu land from the village, of
which 86 mu is water irrigated land, 31 mu is dry land. 3021 trees will be cut down and 5185
m2 residential housing of the local people will be demolished. Of the housing to be demolished,
1875 m.2 is of brick-tile structure, 3310 m2 is of brick-wood structure. The land acquisition will
affect 56 people and 22 households will be affected by the housing demolition. The housing
owned by an army unit is now in spare and therefore no one will be affected by its demolition.
After the land acquisition for the new railway station, the villagers will still possess 1.32 mu
land per capita and the affected people's production and living can be resettled by means of
reallocating land within the village. The village council plans to use the compensation fund in
three ways, They will disburse part of it (compensations to the attachments and standing crops)
to the affected individuals. They will spend most of it on building a market near the new railway
station. And they will use part of it on constructing water irrigation facilities so as to change the
dry land into water irrigated land and to increase the production output of the land. The
demolished housing will be restored in a way of unitary planning and unitary construction by the
village collectives on a concentrated residence zone.
The construction of the new Xiajianhe station will bring about various positive impacts on the
village. First of all, construction of the railway bridge and the new station will greatly improve
* 17



the living conditions of the local people by revolving the problem that the road conditions are
bad and the villager has to walk and carry their goods across the riversides, which has troubled
the villagers for a long time. Secondly, building of the roads in assesses to the construction
materials for the new railway station will improve the backward country road conditions.
Thirdly the development of restaurants and labor force export will promote the development of
local economy. The disadvantage of building Xiajianhe station is that the total amount of the
land acquisition is large and most of the land is water irrigated. This will have negative impact
on the local agriculture production and on the average income of the local people. Loss caused
by the negative impact can be made up by means of constructing water irrigation facilities,
improving the land quality or via developing the second and the third industries.
The investigation panel interviewed Wang Liner, head of the Fenggelin Township, Wang
Shubao, head of Xiajianhe village, Fan Janshe, head of the 5th villagers group, and some of the
affected people.
1.9.5 New Yuanlong Station. The new Yuanlong station is located on the edge between Sa'anxi
Province and Ganshu Province and it is at the intersection of Duping village and Shiguchuan
village of Yuanlong commune in the Beidao District of Tianshui City. There are 7 villages in
Yuan long commune and the total population is 19861 from 4298 households, of who 8296 are
laborers. The total cultivated land of the commune is 25055 mu, 1.26 mu per capita. In 1999,
the average income of the commune was 669 yuan since the local people depend all on
agriculture to make their incomes. The mountainous commune is still backward. In duping
village there are 989 people from 215 households and 500 of the people are laborers. The total
cultivated land there is 1579 mu, 1.6 mu per capita. In 1999, the average pure income of the
villagers was 600 yuan per capita. In Shiguchuan village, there are 868 people from 194
households, of whom 247 are laborers. The total amount of cultivated land is 1895 mu, 2.18 mu
per capita. In 1999, the average pure income of the people in this village was 620 yuan per
capita. Both villages are somewhat backward and the local people are all dependent on incomes
from agriculture for their living.
The new Yuanlong station is only I km away from the old one. In order to build the station, it is
necessary to acquire 56 mu water irrigated land from Duping village and 22 mu water irrigated
land from Shiguchuan village. Construction of the new railway station does not involve housing
* 18-



demolition, whose impact on the localities is the smallest as compared with others of the 5
stations to be built. The land acquisition will affect 19 people in Duping village and 4 people in
Shiguchuan village. Post the land acquisition. people in Duping village will possess 1.56 mu
cultivated land per capita and people in Shiguchuan village will still have 2.16 mu cultivated
land per capita. Since the amount of land acquired by the railway sector is small and the two
villages both have rich land resources, the surplus laborers can all be well resettled by means of
reallocating land within the village. Most of the fund in compensation to the land will be spent
mainly on developing production, building water irrigation facilities, improving quality of some
poor land to increase the land's unit output and in turn the local people's production and living
conditions will be improved.
Construction of the new Yuanlong station will bring some new opportunities to the local people.
For instance, the cost of exporting the local specialty products will decrease because of the
convenient traffic conditions. The local people will have more opportunities to develop the
second and the third industries, more incomes will be made from providing the station project
with construction materials and laborers. The local people's conservative ideas might be
changed via their interaction with the station construction personnel. All this will be helpful for
the local people to change the conditions of the backward mountainous area.
The investigation panel interviewed the accociate head of the Yuanlong Township, the heads of
Duping village and Shiguchuan village, as well as some affected people.

2. Project Impacts
In order to construct the second rail-line between Baoji and Lanzhou, it is enviable to displace
some people to live elsewvhere, although many measures have been taken to reduce the amount
of land acquisition and housing demolition to minimum by making use of the existing rail-line
and facilities. "Affected persons" means persons who, on account of any change in land or
water use due to works carried out or to be carried out under the project, would incur the
involuntary loss, temporarily or permanently. of shelter, productive asset or access to productive
assets, or of income or means of livelihood and, as a consequence, have their living standard or
production levels adversely affected.
2.1 Land Acquisition
The total amount of land acquired for the construction project of Baoji-Lanzhou Lline
isl6369.43 mu, of which 12143.65mu is used for rail track, 3866.78 mu for stations and yards,
107 mu for Lanzhou Pivot, 252 mu for Baoji Pivot. All the land acquired can be divided into
three kinds, such as: the I" kind is newly collective land acquired; the 2nd is the newly state land
transferred; the 3rd is the land regained from the railway. Please refer the following for detail:

Land regained from the Railway: 4852.1.Omu (for permanent use)
The Second rail-line between Baoji and Lanzhou is 466 km long, in average 35.12mu Land
need to be acquired for its construction. 7299.82 mu is cultivated land, accounting 44.60% of
the total land acquired, Land regained from within the railway sector is 4852.1 mu, accounting
29.64%, 2818.33 mu desert land needs to be acquired, accounting 17.21% of the total land
acquired. The others is 1399.18 mu, accounting 8.55% of the total land acquired. land for
temporary use is 5507.55 mu, accounting the total land using 33.65%; land for permanent use
is 10972.93 mu, accounting the total land using 66.35%.
The scope of land acquisition for the construction of Baoji-Lanzhou line covers two cities
- 20 -



and one prefecture, five counties, one district, Sf townships as well as 237 villages in Gansu
Province; one city and two districts, 9 townships as well as 29 villages in Shannxi Province. For

description of the socioeconomic conditions of the affected regions.
3.1 Gansu Province
3.1.1 Natural conditions of Gansu
Gansu Province is located along upriver of the Yellow River, with Shaanxi to the east, Ningxia to
the northeast, Sichuan to the south, Qinghai and Xinjiang to the west, and Inner Mongolia to the
north. The total area of Gansu province is 450,000 square kilometers, with 52.3237 million mu
cultivated land (7.68% of the total), 63.8537 million mu forest-covered land, 9.37% of the total,
16.4435 mu water-covered land 2.44% of the total, and 249.5929 million mu grassland, 36.62%
of the total. It is the fifth largest herding area.
Gansu is one of the bases of Chinese medicine production. It has 951 kinds of wild herbs, ranking
the second of all the provinces of China. More than 450 kinds of Chinese medicine herbs are in
production, mainly angelica, pie-plant, licorice, fritillary, ganrodoma, aweto, only for angelica,
the average amount of its sales more than 5 million kg.
Gansu is one of the provinces that is rich in mineral resources, especially in rare and precious
metals. Up to now, 145 kinds of useful minerals have been found in more than 2500 mine fields in
Gansu. 82 kinds of D-level minerals or above are in more than 470 mine field, 51 of which are big
in size and 128 are of medium size. The amounts of preservations of the 11 kinds of ores of nickel,
cobalt, platinum, selenium, mould clay soil, over-coating serpentine etc. are ranked the first
throughout China, and those of 15 kinds of ores of copper, zinc, chrome, antimony, barite and
magnesite etc. are ranked the 2nd to the 5th throughout the country, obviously superior in position.
In terms of possession per capita, 20 kinds of minerals such as fossil oil, chrome, vanadium,
nickel, copper, sibley alloy, cobalt, wolframium, antimony, gold, fluor, sulfur, cement limestone
etc. are more than 1 time above that of the national average.
Gansu is at the far inner land of China. Where the warm and humid sea wind can hardly reach and

the opportunity of the wind changes into rain are few and therefore most part of the province is

It is worthwhile to describe the resources of tourism in Tiansui City:
In Beidao District, there are 237 units of culture protection and the district is one of the 44 key
scenery sites throughout the country. The dais, where once Fuxi practiced the dividing the
divinatory symbols, is famous all over the world. The Meiji Grotto, one of the 4 largest in China,
has the fame of "the eastern sculpture museum", which is featured with its southern style of
beauty and northern style of majesty. With a forestry of more than 3 million mu winding through
its southeast border, forming a green belt, in average, 60.3 % of the district is covered by forest.
There are many famous springs in the district, Paoma Spring, Ganquan Spring, and Jieting Hot
Spring. The springs are connected one another and they al very well-known in Gansu.
There are 36 relics of the ancient Yangsao Culture, Majiaku culture along the Weihe River in
Wushan County. There are 6 culture protection units at the provincial level. They are
Shuliangdong Grotto built in latter Qing Kingdom during the East Jin Dynasty and the 16
* 43 -



Kingdom period (304-420 AC), the Mitishi Grotto cut in the Han Dynasty and rebuilt in the Ming
Dynasty, the Fuj iamen relic, Guanerxia relic, Xihanba relic and the Ancient Buddha Palace at
Gongshi Temple. Still there are 8 culture protection units at the county level.
Gangu County is an important business center on the Silk Route in the Chinese history. As early
as in the Ming Dynasty, Gangu County was regarded as the home of businessmen and travelers.
To the west of the county town is the Xiangshan Grotto, built in the Period of Northern Wei
Kingdom, in which there is a precious cultural relic, the Buddha's statue as tall as 23.7m and it is
a culture unit protected at the provincial level. There are 11 other ancient cultural relics of the
Neolithic era and 18 combs.
In Qing'an County, the Dadiwan Relic Site of 7800 years' historical range was found, and thus
brought forward more than 1000 years, its discovery brought the shock to
historiography field. The earliest fine arts, statues and colored crockery were all originated from
Dadiwan in Qing'an.
At present, every year 78000 domestic and 3000 foreign tourists visit Tianshui City who brought
2 million yuan income to Tianshu City, and 5% of the income is turned to the State.
The main factor restricting a further development of tourism is traffic. Under the current
condition, Tianshui is only a transfer station. It is easy for the tourists to get to Tianshu City but it
is difficult for them to get out. Construction of the second Bao-Lan Rail-line will make Tianshui
Station the starting station. It is estimated that upon the completion of the Second Bao-Lan Rail-
line, the flow of tourists will reach to foreign 60000 visitors and 3.9 million domestic visitors,
who will bring an income of 10 million yuan per year.
Tianshui City governs five counties and two districts., namely Qincheng District, Beidao District,
Gangu County, Wushan County, and the 15 townships under these counties and districts.. For

4 .Law Framework
In China, policies, laws and regulations concerning land acquisition and population resettlement
fall into a four-level hierarchy: at the top level are the fundamental polices, laws and regulations
stipulated and issued by the central government; at the second level are the detailed
implementation methods issued by provincial governments for the motional regulations; at the
third level are the specific policies and regulations by municipal and county governments feasible
in the localities and at the lowest level are the preferential policies specifically stipulated by local
governments for a certain project.
4.1 Policies, Laws and Regulations as the Basis
The following are the major policies, laws and regulations for the land acquisition and
resettlement of Construction of Baoji---Lanzhou line the Project to go by:
(I) "Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China" revised and approved by
the Fourth Standing Committee of the Ninth People's Congress and put into implementation
on January 1, 1999).
(2) "Implementation Methods for the 'Land Administration Law 'of the People's Republic
of China" (Decree No. 256 of the State Council of P. R. C.).
(3) "China Regulations for Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation" (Decree No. 78 of the
State Council of P. R. C.1991).
(4)"Shaanxi Provincial Detailed Implementation Methods for the 'Land Administration
Law of China"' (approved by at the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth People'
congress of Shaanxi Province, without implementation).
(5) "Shaanxi Provincial Detailed Implementation Regulations for the Administration of
Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation" (approved by at the 32nd Meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Seventh People' Congress of Shannxi Province and publicized and put into
implementation on March 6t", 1993)
(6) "Baoji city Regulations for Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation" (approved by at the
6c' Meeting of the Standing Committee of Baoji city on April 6', 1998).
(7) "Gansu Provincial Detailed Implementation Regulations for the Administration
of Urban Housing Demolition & Relocation" (approved by at the 111'h Meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth People' Congress of Gansu Province and publicized and put into
implementation on September 2nd, 1999)
* 61



(8) "Gansu Provincial Detailed Implementation Regulations for Urban Housing Demolition
& Relocation" (approved by at the 28th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Elighth People'
Congress of GansuProvince and publicized and put into implementation on July 3Oth, 1997)
4.2 Provisions of Policies and Laws
4.2.1 Relevant Regulations for Land Acquisition
(I) The urban land is owned by the state. The rural land is owned by the collective
Except for the portion owned by the state according to relevant legal provisions. The housing
ground site, household reserved plots and hills are owned by the collective.
(2) The land owned by farmers' collectives is managed and run by the collective
economic organizations or the village councils. If two or more collectives within one Village
shares the ownership of the land; it should be administrated and run by these collectives or the
villager groups. If the farmers' collectives of the township own the land, it should be
administrated by these collectives.
(3) In order to acquire land for state construction, the construction unit shall, after obtaining
relevant legal documents ratified by the responsible department of the State C'ouncil or local
governments at or above county level according to the relevant regulations of the state, put in an
application to the land administration departments at or above county level for procedure
handling for land acquisition.
(4) Compensations for cultivated land are implemented in China In case that cultivated land is
acquired for non-agriculture construction, the same amount of cultivated land should be
developed to replace the acquired. The land-utilizing unit shall develop land of the same
amount and quality for cultivation. If it is unable to develop land, or the land developed is
inadequate to the required quality, the land utilizing unit should, observing the regulations
issued by the provincial, and municipal governments, pay fees specially for the development.
Governments of the provinces and autonomy municipality, and the cities directly under the
Central Government should make plans for land development, supervise and urge the land-
utilizing unit to develop land or organize land development according to the plan. They should
also check and accept the results of the land development.
- 62 -



(5) W-hen the land for acquisition for state construction has gone through all the legal procedures
and been approved, the local goverrnents at the county level or above should publicize the
information and organize the implementation of the acquisition. Owners of the land to be
acquired should go, with their land ownership or land utility certificates, to the land
administration department of the local government before the deadline notified to register for
later compensation.
(6) The land-acquiring unit should pay compensation fees in accordance with the usage of the
land before the acquisition. The fees include compensation for the land, resettlement subsidy
and compensation for aboveground attachment and young crops. In the acquisition of
cultivated land, the compensation rate is 6 to 10 times the value of the annual average output
in the past three years prior to the land acquisition. The amount of resettlement subsidy is
calculated in accordance with the number of people of agriculture registration that need to be
resettled, which is the ratio of the amount of land posses per capita before the acquisition
divided by the total amount of land acquired. The amount of subsidy for each person to be
resettled is 4 to 6 times the acquired land's average annual output value three years before the
acquisition. The maximum of the resettlement subsidy should not be more than 15 times of
land's average annual output value three years before the acquisition.
The standards of compensation and resettlement subsidy for other types of land are made by the
governments of the provinces, autonomous municipalities and cities directly under the State
Government in reference to the standards of compensation for cultivated land. The governments
of the provinces, autonomous municipalities and cities directly under the State Government make
compensation standards for aboveground attachment and standing crops.
In case those vegetable fields in the city suburbs are acquired, the land-utilizing units should pay
fees used as funds for the development of new vegetable plots.
If the above-stated compensation rates are still insufficient for the affected villagers to maintain
their former living standards, more subsidies can be added with the approval of provincial
governments. But the sum of land compensation fee and resettlement subsidy shall not exceed the
maximum of 30 times the value of the annual average output of the land in the past three years
before the land acquisition.
The State Council will raise the standards for land compensation and resettlement subsidy under
special circumstances according to the level of social and economic development.
* 63 -



(7) When the land acquisition compensation and resettlement plan is made, the local government
should publicize it and consult with the local rural economic collectives and the farmers.
The rural economic collectives with land acquired should publicize to all the members
(8) the incomes and expenditures of the compensation fees and subsidies so as to receive
supervision from the farners.
It is forbidden to steal or appropriate land compensation fees and other related fees disbursed to
the land-acquired units.
(9) The local governments at all levels should support the local rural economic collectives with
land acquired and the affected farmers to engage in business and run enterprises.
4.3The Concord of the Resettlement Policies between the World Bank and China
(1) The General Policies and Goals Set Out by the World Bank
The major principles advocated by the Bank on population resettlement can be boiled down into
the following two: First, try the best to minimize the amount of land to be acquired, housing to be
demolished and the number of population to be affected by comparing and appraising alternative
resettlement action plans and adjusting the design plans; second, try the best to handle the
resettlement of the affected population if land acquisition and housing demolition is inevitable,
and at least to ensure the affected population a living standard not lower than that before the land
acquisition and further to enable them to enjoy a better living standard by benefiting from the
project.
Such principles of the Bank's can be expounded in the following ways:
A. All the alternative plans should be taken into consideration for the purpose of avoiding or
minimizing land acquisition, housing demolition and the number of affected population.
B. If population displacement is inevitable; resettlement action plans should be prepared at the
initial stage of engineering preparation.
C. The affected population should receive the compensation sufficient enough to make up for
their replacement lost before their actual removal.
D. The affected population should get help during their removal and transitional period.
E. The affected population should have means of life and chances of getting better-off. There
should be resettlement policies and plans whereby the production and livelihood of the
resettlers can be rehabilitated.
* 64 -



F. The affected population should be encouraged to take an active part in the whole process of
the planning and conducting of resettlement. Appropriate forms of mass participation should
be sought for and the conduit for grievance appealing established.
G. The immigrants should become identical economically and socially with the native residents
of the resettlement area.
H. Special concern should be shown to the vulnerable group by giving them more help.
I. Compensation will be paid to the affected collective or individual in full, without
depreciation or deduction of any kind.
(2)High Concord of China's Policies with the Requirements of the Bank:
There is a high degree of consistency between provincial land acquisition and resettlement
regulations and W'orld Bank resettlement policy. Where local regulations and Bank policy differ,
special arrangements have been made to ensure consistency with Bank policy requirements. In
general, resettlement objectives will be achieved through special measures adopted for the four
major categories of affected population in the project:
Type 1: urban or rural population affected in residential housing demolition
All the regulations concerning housing demolition issued by the provinces concerned are meant
to ensure the affected population at least a recovery of their former living standard. According to
such regulations: If the affected households accept the commodity house, the floorage of the
resettlement housing shall not be less than that of the former one; If the affected households
accept the money, the compensation to all sorts of housing shall be calculated according to the
reconstruction cost and compensation shall be disbursed before demolition; Favorable policies
shall be offered to the vulnerable group who are very poor and suffering from difficult housing
condition (if their floorage is below the lowest average urban floorage standard, the gap shall be
made up; the solitary old folks will be resettled at the same standard as the one for a couple)
Type 2: enterprises and their employees affected in industrial and commercial housing
demolition
All the regulations concerned are intended to protect the interests of industrial and commercial
enterprises from being impaired. According to such regulations, enterprises and shops shall be
compensated at reconstruction cost price. Compensation shall also be paid for the loss caused by
a cessation of production or business, the cost of moving out and business doing in other place.
* 65 -



No workers will permanently lose employment because of the project. All affected workers can
continue working in their present jobs, or will be reassigned to other work. Any workers who are
affected by temporary closing of enterprises will continue to receive their salary during the period
of disruption.
Type 3: villages and villagers affected in rural land acquisition
The detailed implementation methods of land administration by the provinces concerned
prescribe the minimal and maximal sums of compensation for land compensation. Whenever
possible, compensation should be made by land exchange in order to diminish resettlement risk.
(See Section 6.2 for additional details.)
Type 4: Proprietary right owner units and the residents along the line affected in the
demolition of infrastructure
Each province concemed has specific regulations for the infrastructure land acquisition.
According the regulations, infrastructure can be demolished only after it is reconstructed at the
same size elsewhere.
* 66



5. Compensation Standards and Calculation of Compensation Fees
The MOR (the project owner) shall disburse the fees of land acquisition, housing
demolition and resettlement caused by the project of the Second Baoji-Lanzhou Rail-
line, as part of the total budget of the project. The support from local governments is
manifested in the favorable policies to reduce or exempt various taxes.
5.1 Principles for Compensation
(1) Compensation for land acquisition and housing demolition will be paid in
accordance with "Land Administration Law", and "Housing Demolition
Regulations" issued by the state that are consistent with relevant terms of this RAP.
(2) Replacement cost is the criterion whereby to determine whether the compensation
standard is reasonable.
(3) Whether the affected people are ensured a recovery of their former living standard
in the shortest time is the criterion to judge the compensation standards in terms of
sufficiency.

(4) Compensation for infrastructures
A. Compensation for road removed
B. Compensation for water conservancy pipes
C. Compensation for telecommunication cables
D. Compensation for power supply lines
5.2.2 Compensation Standard for land acquisition, young crops:
Compensation rates for categories of land have been determined on a county or
district basis. The rates in tables 5-1 --- 5-8 below represent the minimum rates to be
paid within each county or district. Because some villages have relatively high
population densities or other particular disadvantageous factors, these villages will
receive land compensation rates (which include land compensation and resettlement
subsidies for rehabilitation purposes) higher than the minimum. (Please refer the Tables
6-2-1---6-2-5 for specific details regarding these villages.) But land compensation in all
rates will be consistent with Chinese land law and with the principle of replacement
cost.
In addition to land owned by collectives, the project also requires the retrieval of
4852.1 mu of railway -owned land. With the agreement that this land is railway-owned
will be vacated when required for railway use, villages have been permitted by the
.68.



railway to cultivate land within the right-of way. As all persons using railway land are
village members with regular allotments of village land, retrieval of the railway land
will not generate only need for relocation or land redistribution. Though land
compensation is not required, the railway will pay 3,000 yuan RMB/mu of railway land
retrieved to the villagers to cover crop losses and to assist them in developing
altemative sources of supplemental income.

3.Explanation about housing demolition:
(I) Project implementation plans have been formulated so that all persons requiring
relocation will have time to build or obtain replacement housing before their
existing housing is demolished. In case circumstances require some persons to
move in a more rapid manner, they will be provided with transitional housing or
will receive transitional assistance to pay for temporary housing rental.
(2) Those who are displaced from a better location to a worse location, the floorage of
resettlement housing should be increased and no structure price difference will be
accounted for the increased proportion of the housing floorage.
(3) When the non-residential housing is demolished and displaced, the floorage of the
resettlement housing is calculated by the floorage demolished, no deduction of the
publicly shared area will be made from the resettlement construction area.
When the non-apartment residential housing is demolished, the resettlement
housing floorage is calculated on the basis of the original floorage of the residential
housing. When the apartment residential housing is demolished, the resettlement
housing floorage is calculated on the basis of the utility floorage of the original
housing.
(4) The demolisher should take the responsibility of repairing, reconstructing,
.74.



exchanging and paying compensations to the housing users in case that the newly-
built resettlement housing is proved to be unqualified by checking and accepting
upon the completion of its construction

by the production and business halts owing to the non-residential housing
demolition. The demolisher should also take the responsibility of paying all the fees
in compensation for the demolition, installing, storing and transporting of the
communication cables, gas pipelines, TV cables, power supplies equipment's and
machinery.
(6) Displaced households will be paid removal subsidies to cover the cost of moving. In
the case that anyone must be resettled temporarily to transitional housing, they will
receive removal subsidies twice. The affected individuals who arrange transitional
housing for themselves the housing demolisher will pay them removal subsidies on
the basis of the utility floorage of the residential housing demolished.

housing provided by the demolisher.. The transitional housing floorage should be no
less than 70% that of the demolished and it should have the basic living conditions and
facilities needed for daily life.
(7) In case that the housing demolisher's fault resulted in extension of the transitional
period, the following resolutions are proposed.
For those who arranged their transitional residential housing, the demolisher should
pay more transitional assistance on the basis of the floorage of the housing demolished
starting with the month imnmediately post the preset schedule. The increase rate is 50%
within the first year and the rate will increase by 50% for each of the following year.

individuals who arrange the transitional housing by themselves. In case the
demolisher offers the transitional housing the rent should be waived during the
extended period. In addition the demolisher should also paid the affected 180% of
the transition subsidies.
5.3 Calculation of Compensation Rate for Land Acquisition
(I) The distribution of compensation for the project resettlement is compensation for
land acquisition accounting for 60% and subsidy for resettlement accounting for
40%.
(2) In accordance with the regulations on maximum and minimum limitation for
.79 .



compensation fees paid for different categories of land, and by calculations, it is
clear that the amount of land compensation fees has reached the requirements set in
the new version of Land Administration laws. According to the State Land
Administration Laws, the amount of compensation fees for land is 6 to 10 times that
of the land's average annual output and the resettlement fee mount to 4 to 6 times
that of the land's average annual output during the past three years.
(3) According to the published data of Gansu Provincial Statistical Bureau, the average
output of Irrigated land is 858 yuan/mu for the previous three years, that of dry land
is 530 yuan/mu for the previous three years.
(4) The maximum compensation for Irrigated land acquisition in Gansu is
20000yuan/mu, of which the land compensation fee is 12000 yuan/mu, that is, 14
X 858yuan/mu (the yearly output value of Irrigated land). The resettlement subsidy
is 8000 yuan, namely 9.3 X 858 yuan. (the annual output value of Irrigated land).
The minimum compensation for Irrigated land acquisition in Gansu is 12000
yuanlmu, of which the land compensation fee is 7200 yuan/mu, that is, 8.5 X 858
yuan/mu (the yearly output value of Irrigated land). . The resettlement subsidy is
4800 yuan, namely 5.6 X 858 yuan. (the annual output value of Irrigated land)
Obviously, compensation fees for the acquired paddy fields and resettlement in
Gansu Province reached the standards regulated in the newly enacted National
Land Law.
(5) The maximum compensation fees for the acquired dry land were no more than 9000.
yuan, of which 4500.yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land, 8.5 times
that of the annual output per mu (530yuan/mu) 4500.yuan was compensation fees
for resettlement, 8.5 times that of the annual output per mu.
The minimum compensation fees for the acquired dry land were no less than 6100
yuan, of which 3 700 yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land, 7 times that
s80 .



of the annual output per mu (530yuan/mu). 2400 yuan was compensation fees for
resettlement, 4.5 times that of the annual output.
Obviously, compensation fees for the acquired dry land and resettlement in Gansu
Province reached the standards regulated in the newly enacted National Land Law.
(6) According to the statistics of Shannxi Province, the average annual output of
Irrigated land in the recent 3 years is 916yuanlmu, and that of dry land is
550yuan/mu.
(7) Compensation fees for the acquired Irrigated land were made no more than 14500
yuan, of which8700 yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land, 9.5 times
that of the annual output per mu (916yuan/mu). 5800 yuan was compensation fees
for resettlement, 6.3 times that of the annual output per mu.
Compensation fees for the acquired Irrigated land were no less than 12500 yuan, of
which 7500 yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land,8.2 times that of the
annual output per mu (916yuan/mu)5000 yuan was compensation fees for
resettlement,5.5 times that of the annual output.
Obviously, compensation fees for the acquired paddy fields and resettlement in
Shannxi Province reached the standards regulated in the newly enacted National
Land Law.
(8) Compensation fees for the acquired dry land were made no more than 6800 yuan, of
which 4080 yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land, 7.4 times that of the
annual output per mu (550yuan/mu). 2720 yuan was compensation fees for
resettlement, 4.9 times that of the annual output per mu.
Compensation fees for the acquired dry land were no less than 6200yuan, of which
3720 yuan was compensation fees for the acquired land, 6.8 times that of the annual
output per mu (550yuan/mu). 2480 yuan was compensation fees for resettlement,
4.5 times that of the annual output.
Obviously, compensation fees for the acquired dry land and resettlement in Shannrxi
.81.



Province reached the standards regulated in the newly enacted National Land Law.
5.4 Calculation of Compensation Rate for Demolition and Relocation
(1) Replacement price shall be referred to in determining the standard of housing
compensation. The used material from the demolished housing shall not be
deducted from the compensation fee.
(2) The example of constructing of brick-concrete and brick-wood structure housing
can illustrate that the compensation fees for housing demolition and relocation is
sufficient for the affected units or individuals to restore their housing at the
corresponding repurchase price.
(3) A:Compensation for brick-concrete structure housing in Shannxi:
330 (420 for house for production )yuan/m2,
B: Compensation for brick-wood structured housing:
300 yuan/M2,
C:Wood and earth:212yuan / m2,
By calculation, the replacement prices per square meters of concrete-brick and
brick-wood housing are respectively:
The cost of farming housing in Shaannxi countryside:
brick-&-concrete farmer housing:
items        cost (yuan/each square meter of housing)
foundation         36.3
wall               132.0
roofing              71.2
door and window           28.1
ground               26.4
decoration on both wall sides  33.5
.82.



total cost of each square meter  327.5
brick-&-timber farmer housing:
items        cost (yuan/each square meter of housing)
foundation         28.6
wall               104.0
roofing              54.6
door and window          18.2
ground               20.8
decoration on both wall sides  29.1
total cost of each square meter    255.3
Wood and earth farmer housing:
items        cost (yuan/each square meter of housing)
foundation         28.6
wall               34.0
roofing              24.6
door and window          18.2
ground               10.8
decoration on both wall sides  199.1
total cost of each square meter    135.3
(4) Obviously, the compensation standard for housing demolition in Shannxi has met
the requirement of the replacement cost. The replacement prices per square meters
of concrete-brick and brick-wood housing in Gansu province is almost equal to that
in Shannxi province, which means that the compensation standard for housing
demolition in Gansu province (420yuan/m2 for housing of production, 330
yuan/m2 for brick-concrete structured housing, 300 yuan/m2 for brick-wood
structured housing, ) can also meet the requirement of the replacement cost.
.83 .



(5) These calculations demonstrate that the compensation for housing demolition is
sufficient enough to ensure that the affected groups or persons can reconstruct their
housing at the replacement prices.
5.5 Fund Budgeting and Investment Planning
(1) Expenses on resettlement are included in the total budget of the project. In project
implementation, funds needed for resettlement are included in the annual
investment plan of the project.
(2) Investment in resettlement of the project totals 249.533 million yuan, including
64.521million for land acquisition and land development; 3.82845 million yuan for
young crops; 4.0818 million yuan for attachment above-ground; 122.7541 million
for housing demolition; and 8.7463 rnillion yuan for infrastructure to be changed;
5.487 million yuan for temporary land using; the other fee is 25.56 million yuan.
All these capital is only a plan, the really numbers will be higher than that of it.
(3) Management fee is 3% of the sum of the compensations for land acquisition,
housing demolition, aboveground attachments (excluding infrastructure fee).
(4) Unforeseen fee is 10% of the sum of the compensations for land acquisition,
housing demolition, aboveground attachment (excluding infrastructure fee).
(S) If the compensations for the land acquisition and other properties are delayed above
one year, the compensation fees must be paid as the increasing rates of the price.
The breakdown of the fees can be referred to Table5.13-5.16:

5.6 Capital Flow and Management:
(1)  To manage the capital well, the Gansu provincial Land Bureau has held a
special seminar on the Management & Utilization of the Capital For Migrants,
demanding that its subordinates establish special capital accounts for migrants and
do not use them for other purposes. The responsibilities in recent management of
various levels of land departments have been made definite: the province is
.88.



responsible for allocating, the cities are responsible for checking, the counties for
directing, the towns for fulfilling.
(2)  The MOR, as the project owner, shall disburse the fund to the land bureaus of
the two provinces at the given time and the given sums prescribed in the RAP.
(3) Based on the agreement with the city/county governments, the provincial land
administration department should transfer timely the funds to the local governments
at the lower levels and the affected institutions and enterprises.
(4) All the compensations will be paid to the collective or individuals in full,
without depreciation or deduction of any kind. When the village councils get the
fund, they will disburse the compensation fees and resettle the affected people's
production in correspondent ways specified in the RAP according to types of
resettlement chosen by the affected people.
(5) Compensations for standing crops and removal fees will be done directly to
the affected people or enterprises with the participation and cooperation of the land
administration departments.
(6) The management fee and unforeseeable fee shall be at the disposal of the
provincial land bureau, which shall allot the fees to governments of different levels
in proper proportion according to their working.
(7) Governments at all levels will act strictly on relevant policies and regulations
and make sure no embezzlement of the funds in any form would happen so as to and
guarantee that the funds are spent on the affected individuals.
(8) The project owner and the governmental departments in charge will strengthen
administration of the resettlement funds, and forbid the deeds of using the special
funds for other purposes.
(9) Establish a strict fund allotment system. Fund can be disbursed only to the
.89 .



approved projects and in conformity with annual fund disbursement budget. No
abuse of fund is allowed.
(10) In accordance with the stipulations of the new land law, those rural collective
economic organizations whose lands have been acquired will publicize the inflowv
and outflow of the compensation to their members, and should be monitored.
(11) Establish a strict accounting system. The accounting shall be open to the
supervision and examination by the project owner, persons responsible and the
displaced population.
(12) Towards the end of each year, the government department responsible shall
have the financial and audit departments jointly examine the utilization of
compensation.
(13) Every year, the relevant information about the financial income and
expenditure shall be copied and forwarded by the resettlement managerial
department to the external monitoring institution.
.90.



6. Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans
6.1 Goals of Resettlement:
(1) The displaced population should be given the chance of benefiting from project
development;
(2) The displaced population will be able to raise, with the help from the government, their
income standards. or at least restore their formner income standards;
(3) The resettlement of aricultural population should depend on land as much as possible in
order to minimize resettlement risk.
(4) In the transference of jobs whenever necessary, the educational background of the affected
persons should be fullv taken into account and consideration should be given to the
willingness of the affected persons;
(5) The resettlement plan should be made jointly with the villager representatives through
consultation and mass participation should be encouraged throughout the whole process of
resettlement;
(6) Before the actual implementation of land acquisition and displacement, the affected
population should get their due compensation for all their loss at the standards stipulated in
the RAP;
6.2 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Rural PAPs:
6.2.1 Resettlement Plan for Rural PAPs in Land Acquisition:
6.2.1.1 Resettlement of farmers in distant suburbs along the railway line:
(l)compensation fee for developing the agriculture production:
The fact that the amount of land possessed per capita and per laborer along the Second Bao-Lan
Rail-line is relatively large, the land acquisition for this project will produce comparatively slight
impact on the per capita land possession in the affected villages. When first assigning land of
responsibility, each village reserved certain amount of land for incidental utility, and internal
land reallocation method, therefore, has been adopted for all of the affected rural villages along
.91 .



the line. Land redistribution will occur within several months following land acquisition. Land
compensation fee will be utilized mainly in the uTansformation of the low- and mediocre-
yielding field, in the introduction of proved scientific and technological achievements in order to
raise the output value, which will be realized mainly in.
----- Improvement of irrigation facilities:
----- Amelioration of the soil, leveling of the fields and more application of fertilizer;
- More funding in economic plants which are expected to bring more profit, for example,
vegetables grown in green houses.
----- Development of such sideline production as the breeding of pigs, cattle, chicken and
ducks;
-Sensible choice of 2 or 3 industries with potential to alter the rural production setup.
For instance, a vegetable seed-breeding base will be set up in Wushan County, where vegetable
production is one of the backbone industries. In 1998. the vegetable planting land area was
86800 mu, with a total output of 260.4 million tons and a total output value of 182 million yuan,
accounting 33% of the grand total agriculture output value. Over 85% of the vegetables were
sold out as commodities to more than 20 provinces such as Qinghai, Shaanxi, Guangdong,
Hunan, Liaoning, and Shandong. There, vegetable production is in large scale, and each village
has its own breed ascendancy.
Nevertheless, owing to lack of seeds and young plant base, the local breeds tend to degenerate
and this in turn inhibit the development of vegetable production both in terms of quantity and
quality. On the other hand, no effective means are available for examining seeds imported. The
seeds tend to be not so pure and the bud bursting rate is verv low. This in turn causes great
economic loss in production. In the mean time, each family nurses young vegetable plants
separately, appropriate conditions are hardly provided for young plants to grow because the
backward equipment owned by the individual households has very low capacity of resisting
natural disasters. Therefore, Wushan County plans to set up a base to evolve good vegetable
seeds. This is also a measure to raise the resettlers' income in the future.
(2) Developing land by making use of land resources preserved for cultivation:
.92.



According to the regulation of "maintaining balance between the amount of land occupied and
the newly developed" set in the new Land Administration Law of China, the railway sector
will pay compensation fees for the land acquired. Gansu Province and Shaanxi Province both
have some land reserved for cultivation in the regions along the railway line. In order to meet the
requirement of "maintaining balance between the amount of land occupied and the newly
developed" and to benefit the regions along the rail-line, especially the resettlers to develop
economy, the two provinces initiated a well-planned land development movement. If the spots of
land newly developed for cultivation are at suitable locations, will directly bring benefits to the
resettlers, if not, they can also help developing a good external environment for the development
of the resettlers' production so long as the they help the development of the local economy.
Dingxi Prefecture is an example:
Dingxi Prefecture has now given up cultivated land that is over 25 degree of slope and land
above the altitude suitable for plants' effective growth. 700000 hectares of basic farmland have
been preserved, accounting 35.6% of the total land area. 54.7 hectare cultivated land is used for
growing grain, with an annual output of 1230750 ton. According to the local population planning,
the amount of grain possessed per capita in the year 2000 will be over 400 kilograms. The
adjustmnent of land utility distribution follows the principles below:
( All kinds of construction non-agriculture purposes will take 3000 hectare land, of which 1000
hectare will be used for the expansion of downtown area of cities and townships.
@) 125000 hectare of land will not any more be used for cultivation, of which 60000 hectares
will be used for forestry, 40000 hectares for grassland, 20000 hectares for developing
orchards, and 5000 hectares for fishery.
( Another 7400 hectares of cultivated land will be lost, including land used for agriculture
infrastructure constructions and the land that has been destroyed by natural disasters but not
restored.
() New land will be developed by regulating watercourses, and 4000 hectares of the land
developed will be cultivated.
(5) 6000 hectares of abandoned land will be restored for cultivation.
.93 .



' 8000 hectares of land will be added for cultivation by other means of land development.
6.2.1.2 Production resettlement of the suburban farmers:
The land acquisition affected villages are in areas adjacent to prefectures or provincial cities.
They will try their best to allot land inside to resettle the affected persons if they have the
condition. Because the cultivated land is relatively scarce in areas adjacent to prefectural or
provincial cities, some villages can not allot land inside to settle the land problem. The affected
villages will obtain different ways to resettle the affected persons according their situation. The
main ways and resettlement information are as following:
(1) In areas adjacent to prefectural or provincial cities, land is relatively scarce and the
proportion of income derived from agricultural is relatively minor. With consultations
between the villages or groups and the affected individuals in such areas, it is decided that no
land reallocation will be conducted. Instead, land compensation and resettlement subsidy will
be directly paid to the affected individuals.The affected individuals will find jobs by
themselves and the villages and groups will pay resettlement subsidies to the self-employed
people so that their living standard will not fall below that prior to the land acquisition.
(2) The resettlers can work in the township and village enterprises. Many of the affected people
have been working in the township and village enterprises since prior to the land acquisition. In
these cases, land compensations and resettlement subsidies will be used to improve or enlarge
the original township or village enterprises. Take Dingxi Prefecture as an example:
Dingxi Prefecture is rich in a variety of mineral preserves and 162 mines have already been
discovered there. The mines can be divided into three general categories, namely metal mines,
non-metal mines and energy mines, of which 83 are metal mines, 68 are non-metal mines, and 11
are energy mines. Each county in the prefecture has found its valuable mines in some way. With
people's paying more and more attention to exploiting ores, 118 mines have been set up by the
end of 1998, of which 108 mines belong to township enterprises or individuals. The total annual
output of all kinds of ores is 2352250 ton and the total output value is 68 million yuan.
.94 .



At present, the government encourages people to exploit and use the mineral reserves at an
appropriate scale. The township and village enterprises have great potential of development in
this respect.
(3) New jobs can be created by means of making use of the newly built railway. For instance,
construction of the railway will promote the development of local construction material
manufacture industry, restaurant trade, tourism, as well as other service trades. Many
employment opportunities will be available for the resettlers in these trades.
For example, Tianshui City takes the opportunity of constructing the second Bao-Lan railway set
a goal for its development in tourism in accordance with the city's development planning. That is,
2000 people will directly work and 10000 people will work indirectly in tourism in the year of
2000. A tourism system that integrates enterprises and institutions of scenery spot administration,
hotel, restaurant, entertainment has come into being. Tourism development will keep up with the
global development in local economy. By the year 2010, 5000 people will work directly and
20000 people will work indirectly in tourism. Tourism will become the leading industry in the
city's domestic economic development and will approach to the development level of the cities
famous for tourism by the year of 2020. By then 10000 people will work directly and 50000
people will work indirectly in tourism. With the overall development in infrastructure
construction and tourism administration, a large scaled tourism industry has been formed. The
output value is much greater than the investment, and tourism has become the backbone industry
in the city's economy.
(4) The total land acquisition affected persons are 3203.including: allotting land inside persons
are 2866,accounting 89%; without allotting land inside persons are 337, accounting 11%.
In the without allotting land inside, including: finding jobs by themselves persons are 179,
accounting 6% of the total; taking part in the township enterprises persons are 29,accounting 1%
of the total; finding jobs because of the railway persons are 129, accounting 4% of the total.

Remarks  The obtain employment situation of the land acquisition affected persons without
reallotting land is only a plan action ,they have many ways to obtain employment. If the
resettlement fee of some villages pass the budget, the government can use the unforeseeable fee of
the total land acquisition & housing demolition fees to resettle the affected persons better. The
resettlement fees of some special persons (such as: vulnerable group and the persons whose
cultivated land is very little) must higher than that of the ordinary persons. The resttlement fees for
the affected persons who will take part in the township enterprises or get jobs through the railway
will be paid to the units where they work.
(5) Every earth kind in every county only has one compensation standard. But to the villages that
are near the cities and have many people and little cultivated land, the resttlement fees must be 6
or above 6 times of the production value of average mu per year. If some villages have difficult in
solving the resettlement problem, they will ask the superior government and the railway for help.
The government and the railway will use the unforeseeable fee from the total land acquisition &
housing demolition fees to settle these problems.
.96.



The compensation fees are above the 10 times of the production value of average mu per year in
the whole affected villages. The compensation fees get 14--28 times of the production value of
average mu in Gangu County that has many persons while little land. The compensation for
young crops is also higher than the production value of average mu per year. Please refer table
6-2-1 to table 6-2-5 for the detail information.
(All the affected villages that are not in the following tables will get the compensation fees
according the compensation standards in table 5-1 to table 5-8. Because they can rehabitate the
production and resttle the affected persons well by using the compensation fees.)

Fences have been put up in protection of the railway line. In order to meet the local people's
need of travel and transportation, production and daily life, overpasses and culverts have been
built by the railway section (through negotiation with the local governments) wherever there are
intersections of the railway and the high ways and country roads. They will increase culverts 825,
including passing persons culverts 345. And they will also increase overpasses 38. Some small
lanes in the fields are reallocated for the farmers' convenience in their production and
communication, if no overpasses or culverts X ill be put up there.
For example, off the Xianhe River Middle Bridge built in Longxi County, the left line that
circumambulates occupies a countrv road. The newlv built second line and the existing line
separate Laocheng Village completely. Meanwhile the two lines are 10 to 50 meters away from
one another. The road banks are high. There are large villages along both sides, and people from
Majiagou village and Dongyu village who go to Torganyi Township have to pass through the
railway lines. Taking the local people's production and living convenience and their safety into
consideration, Longxi County Traffic Bureau and the I ;t Survey and Design Institution of MOR
. 129-



has reached an agreement as the following:
Overpasses and culverts will be put up at K1590+016 and at 1589+970. The clear width of the
overpasses and culverts should be 4 meters. The clear height will be decided in accordance with
the actual conditions and pragmatic needs when the designs are carried out. The 1S' Survey and
Design Institution of MOR will take the responsibility of designing the overpasses and culverts
while the construction engineering will be accomplished by the railway sector, too.
(2) Reallocate the original village to township roads when interfere with the railway occurs.
For instance, the supplementary second rail line will enlarge the curve radius of the existing
line at Kl 540+450-K1541+050, and the rail line will be moved inward 14 meters, occupying the
existing highway. Longxi County Traffic Bureau and the railway sector have reached an
agreement that the highway will be removed and rebuilt with the quality of the third grade
highway. The 1 Survey and Design Institution of MOR will take the responsibility of designing
and the railway construction unit will implement the engineering.
(3) The project design department had taken into consideration the consequence of separating
residents on both sides of the line from each other because of the railway construction. In the
process of project construction, a panel will be sent to handle adjustment of the actual
engineering actions in consultation with the local people so that their reasonable suggestions and
ideas can be taken to make the pathways more practical, of better quality and with great potential
for further development, and thus, to minimize the impact of the project construction.
(4) Restoration of the water irrigation system at all the intersections of the railway and the
irrigation canals, bridges will be built. As for the branch canals covered b the railway line, the
railway sector has put up, through negotiation with the local governments, small culverts and
bridges in accordance with the canals' water carriage capacity to meet the needs of irrigation and
flood release. Generally speaking, the functions of the water irrigation systems can be
maintained owning to the construction of these culverts and bridges.
As far as the motor-driven wells covered by the railway line are concerned, they will be
compensated with fees equal to their repurchase price values.
. 130.



(5) The railway sector will acquire pieces of odd land that are located too close to the railway
track to be cultivated, and pay corresponding amount of compensation fees according to the RAP
compensation rates for them.
(6) The agriculture science & technology department of the local government should give the
farmers guidance regarding how to cultivate such land in terms of making right choice of plants
to grow and using advanced cultivating techniques.
(7) Making rational plans on engineering to create conditions for the development of agriculture
in the future. In order to help the rural population resettled to develop production in the future,
the railway sector follows closely the overall plans of fannland made by the local governments
in their deciding locations of earth-taken spots. The railway sector also makes rational plans on
engineering to create conditions for further development of agriculture in the future.
The railway construction units try their best to take earth from desert mountain and hill slopes
and flat the earth-taken spot so that a piece new land will be developed for cultivation. In plain
areas, earth taking is concentrated at certain spots and the spots should be made regular in shape
so that the localities can use them as fishponds or other later.
(8) Recovery of cultivated land of temporary utility:
While conducting the engineering design of the Second Bao-Lan Rail-line, The 1' Railwav
Survey and Design Institution designed the recovery of the cultivated land to be utilized
temporarily for the railway construction.
(D Principles of design on recovering land for cultivation
A: Do as much as possible to recover the land for temporary utility to its original state and use the
land for farming, forestry, herding, and fishing in accordance with the local conditions.
B. Based on the engineering situation, measures will be taken to fill the valley with abandon soil
to increase the area of cultivated land.
(9 Scope of recovering land for cultivation
A: Such land for temporary utility should be recovered as the desert land (valleys and slopes
without any specific utility, where soil or smear clinkers is taken or given up, whiich is impossible
13 1 .



to be recovered to the original state.
B: In terms of recovering land where discarded soil with stones is put, the land surface should be
leveled off and the land should be sued for planting trees.
 Measures of recovering land for cultivation
A: Whenever soil is taken from or abandoned to the existing cultivated land, the fertilized
surface soil of 30cm should first be taken and put aside and it should be put back, spreading onto
the surface after the land is leveled off. If the spot of soil taking is at apiece of slope land, it can
be made into terrace fields if it is possible.
B: If the through cutting work is soil mixed with stones, smear clinkers should first be used as fill.
If they are not usable, smear clinkers should be abandoned first and then to put abandoned soil on
the surface for the benefit of developing the land for cultivation later.
C: The abandoned soil should be piled on riversides and stream banks. Meanwhile measures like
building fences should be taken to stop water and soil loss and strand blocks caused by flood.

6.2.1.4 The beneficial impact of the railway profiting the locality
The railway construction has a lot of profiting impact on the localities such as the following:
A. Railway construction need a lot of human resources. Besides the personnel of the
construction units, mast of the laborers hired from among the local people, who can get
additional income by engaging in the railway construction engineering and material
transportation.
B. A large amount of materials such as concrete, bricks, sand and stones are purchased from the
local regions for the railway construction and this, will directly promote the increase and
development of the construction material enterprises.
C. In the process of railway construction, the amount of materials and people flowage will
increase many times and rich information and advanced marketing ideas will be brought to
the local regions. All this will help the local people to raise their awareness of commerce. The
expenditure of the construction units and the flowage of capital for construction will promote
the development of the local trades of finance, insurance, restaurant and service,
tr-ansportation, post and telecommunication, and hotel, and thus to provide many job
opportunities for the local people. Quite large a part of the 10 billion yuan construction founds
will flow through the local finance institutions and consequently the development of these
institutions will be promoted. The railway construction units' expenditure in the local places,
as a product effect, will provide a market several times that the expenditure of people from
other places before, and thus will bring times of profits to the development of the local
economy.
D. At the completions of the railway engineering and the subsidiary facilities and service
facilities, many employment opportunities will be provided and the urbanization along the
railway line will also speed up since the local rural odd labor force and people from other
place will be attracted to work in the cities.
E. The improvement of local conditions makes it easier to attract external investment and
external business enterprises. The construction of new projects will in tum create new job
opportunities. With the perfection of the railway and highway system network, the
convenient transportation will enhance the charming of the local tourist resources and more
visitors will bring more income to the local people.
. 1333.



After the implementation of the project construction, incomes of the rural resettlers can be
guaranteed by means of create different opportunities of increasing income from developing
agriculture and other industries.
6.2.2 Resettlement Plan for Displaced Population in Housing Demolition
The displaced population in housing demolition in rural will be resettled by allotted houing
ground by the village commission and rebuilding house nearby. The displaced population in
housing demolition near the cities will be resettled by three ways, such as: paying many,
rebuiding house and purchasing commodity house.
1.To resettle displaced population in housing demolition in the regions along the rail-line,
(1) the village commission will allot housing ground site for the affected villagers without charge
to set up new housing and demolish the old one on their own.
(2) Compensation standards and principle for the displaced households along the line:
---- The housing compensation standard has been determined by referring to its
reconstruction price. The used materials torn from the old housing belong to the household
and such materials shall not be deducted from the compensation.
*--- Compensation fees should be paid to the displaced people before they start constructing
their new housing. If the compensation fees are paid in installment, the last part should be
paid before the completion of the housing construction.
---- In rural areas, new housing shall be set up before the old one is torn down. If for some
special reason the old housing has to be demolished before the new one is set up, the railway
side shall pay transition fees according to relevant standard.
---- Such public infrastructures as roads, water and power supply shall be designed and
financed by the project owner and the construction shall be completed before the displaced
population move into the new housing.
---- Decisions on location housing ground sites should be congruent with the overall planning
of the townships. Under such a precondition, priority should be given to places with stable
geological structure, convenient for road construction and water and power supply. At the same
time, it should be as close to the original residential housing site of the displaced population as
possible in order to facilitate their production and life.
. 134 .



---- The displaced population should be notified of the date of removal at least four months in
advance in order that they can have sufficient time to set up new housing.
(3) The village commission will take effective measures (for example seeking labours, choosing
housing ground for housing reconstruction, buying materials and so on) to help the difficult
families of the old, weak, ailing and disabled and families without male laborers, by consulting
their opinions, to build new housing and move in. The poorest households will get help in funds
to ensure basic resettlement housing.
2.resettlement of housing demolition near the cities
(1) In the near suburbs of large cities where little land is left, different resettlement measures
will be taken. In case that only small amounts of housing are demolished here and there, the
railway construction units will purchase commercial residential housing downtown in the city. In
some districts housing sits right at the residential spots and the displaced people can build new
housing for themselves and by themselves. If any displaced people, who has two flats of
residential housing with one is demolished but sufficient living space with the remaining flat,
they can ask for compensation to their demolished flat in cash and once for all in case that they
want to do so.
(2) Compensation standards and principle for the displaced households in the suburbs of the big
cities:
The housing compensation standard shall be determined by referring to its reconstruction
price. The used materials torn from the old housing belong to the household and such
materials shall not be deducted from the compensation.
---- Compensation fees should be paid to the displaced people before they start constructing
their new housing. If the compensation fees are paid in installment, the last part should be
paid before the completion of the housing construction. All the compensation fees should be
paid to the displaced people. Who need to purchase commercial residential housing.
---- For those households who demolish their old housing and build the new one on their own,
new housing shall be set up before the old one is torn down. If for some special reason the old
housing has to be demolished before the new one is set up, the railway side shall pay
transition fee according to the standard.
---- The railway shall pay the cost for removal according to the standard.
. 135 .



---- Such public infrastructures as roads, water and power supply shall be designed and
financed by the project owner and the construction shall be completed before the displaced
population move into the new housing. The affected people can not pay for these
infrastructure fees.
---- ln locating housing ground sites, priority should be given to such place with stable
geological structure, convenient for road construction and water and power supply. At the
same time, it should be as close to the original housing site of the displaced population as
possible in order to facilitate their production and life.
---- The displaced population should be notified of the date of removal at least four months in
advance in order that they can have sufficient time to set up new housings.
(3) The village commission will take effective measures to help the vulnerable families, by fully
consulting their opinions, to build new housing and move in. Special concern shall be given
to those vulnerable families buying commodity housing or resettled in congregately built
housing flats. For instance, the old, ailing and disabled households will be arranged under 4th
floor. The poverty-stricken families, if possible, will be arranged on the ground floor so that
they may take the advantage to open small shops to earn their living. The poor households
will get financial help in funds so that they can have resettlement housing of basic floorage to
live in.
6.3 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Urban Displaced Population
6.3.1 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Urban Displaced Population
(1) The impact of Baoji-Lanzhou Project on urban residents is concentrated in Lanzhou and
Baoji only and most of the residents are living very close to the railway line or the railway
stations.
(2) For urban residents, they will have three ways to be rsettled, such as: getting many,
rebuilding house and purchasing commodity house nearby. The urban residents of western
line (Weishuiyu-lanzhou) will be resettled from D December 2000 year to February 2002
year; The urban residents of eastern line (Weishuiyu- Baoji) will be resettled from
March 2001 year to December 2001 year.
. 136.



(3) General regulations on resettlement of residential housing
---- Consultation with the displaced population on equal standing;
--- Depreciation of the demolished housing shall not be considered in the reconstruction
price;
---- If the former average floorage per capita of the displaced residents is lower than the
stipulated lowest standard for urban residents, the deficiency shall be made up in
resettlement without charging fee for the made up area;
---The government shall decide on the resettlement site to the demolition affected housholds
who will not purchase the commodity house . Two resettlement sites may be provided for the
residents to choose, whenever conditions permit;
----The displaced residents shall move into the resettlement housing directly without
transitional period. Whenever transition is absolutely necessary, a certain amount f
compensation fees shall be paid.
----The railway construction unit shall pay Removal fee.
---- Publicize the information and make announcement 120 days in advance so that the
affected population will have enough time to move out.
(4) Procedures for the housing demolition & relocation and resettlement:
----The governmental institutions responsible of resettlement shall send personnel to conduct
on-the-spot investigation and checking about the affected households on the household
number, the ownership, structure, area and other attachment of the housing;
----Publicize the resettlement plan, the policy for housing demolition & relocation, the
resettlement procedure, the resettlement compensation, the scope of demolition and the time
limit for removal, so as to have the mass participate in and supervise;
---- The govermmental institutions responsible of resettlement and the displaced households
shall sign agreement on compensation standard, compensation sum, the size and the location
of resettlement housing, etc.;
---- After the displaced households have made an on-the-spot survey, an additional
agreement shall be signed between the department responsible and the households on such
more detailed issues as the story, the disposition and the room number of the resettlement
housing;
. 1 37 .



---- The agreements on resettlement shall be signed and sealed by both parties and notarized
by the notary office;
---- The displaced population moves into the new housing.
6.3.2 Resettlement Plans for Enterprises
(1) Resettlement plan for enterprises
A. Most of the enterprises displaced are not prosperous at the moment. The relocation of
enterprises will not result in unemployment for their stuff members.
B. The compensation standard for the enterprises shall be made according to the reconstruction
price; no depreciation will be taken into account.
C. Compensation fees should be paid to the displaced enterprises before they start constructing
their new housing. If the compensation fees are paid in installment, the last part should be
paid before the completion of the housing construction.
D. The demolition and relocation of enterprises shall be done only after the new housing has
been set up. If for some special reasons demolition has to go before the construction of new
housing, the railway construction unit shall pay, according to the compensation standard, a
sum of compensation fees for the cessation of production or business. This will cover the
average monthly salary paid the year before of all the current employees as examined by the
governmental department in charge of labor and employment administration. Compensation
should be paid at certain ratio for its loss in profit because of the cessation of production or
business, which is calculated in accordance with the average yearly gross profit made by the
enterprises during the past two years.
E. The railway construction unit shall pay for the enterprise removal.
F. The new site for the enterprise should be as close to the old one as possible, in order to keep
the existing market environrnent of the enterprise intact. If the enterprise asks for a different
relocation, it could be allowed if conditions permit.
G. If the housing of the enterprise has been fitted up, and the fit-up standard confirmed is higher
than that of housing compensation, the gap can be compensated by the railway construction
unit.
H. The enterprise shall be inforned of the removal 120 days in advance so that it will have
* 138.



enough time to get prepared and avoid unnecessary loss.

6.4.1 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Railway Clerks
(1)  The affected railway clerks, like other affected residents outside the railway sector,
should also be compensated for their demolished housing by the same standard as that
outside the railway sector. As for the transition fee and removal fee, they should be the
same as those outside the railway sector.
(2)  The affected railway clerk shall be informed of the removal 60 days in advance in order
to have enough time to get prepared.
(3)  Two measures taken to resettle the displaced railway clerks
A. Lanzhou Railway Bureau and Zhenzhou Railway Bureau shall conduct old housing
demolition and new housing construction on railway-owned land for the displaced clerks,
whose living conditions will be greatly improved, strictly following the stipulation of
construction prior to demolition.
B. Following the methods applied external the railway, the compensation fees are disbursed to
the affected individuals who will purchase practical and economic residential housing by
themselves.
(4)  about housing demolition of illegal building:
The demolition of illegal building is inside the railway, they are all near the Lanzhou station.
The area of the housing demolition are 1730 m2 ; including brick-wood houses 1080 m2', simple
houses 650 m2. The numbers of demolition affected household are 9. The compensation
standard of the illegal building is the 50% of the same structure house. There are two ways to
resettle the affected households. One way is to be allotted workers rooms by the railway sector.
The other way is to be paid for money and they will buy commodity houses by themslves, they
will pay the surplus for the houses by themslves. The affected households will choose the way
that is to be allotted workers rooms by the railway sector.
6.4.2 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plans for Railway Enterprises

and equipment relevant to the railway stations or yards. The affected enterprises within
the railway sector enjoy the same rights like those external the railway. The measure taken
for resettling such enterprises is self-demolition and self-construction on the railway-

continue to be held during the land acquisition, substantially between the Land Acquisition &
Resettlement Sections of the Headquarters and the County Land Bureaus, detailed even on every
sub-project and every piece of land. The land acquisition and housing demolition & relocation
for each subproject is accomplished not without quite a number of or even several scores of
rounds of consultation.
(3) The consultation between the local land administrative departments and the land
expropriated townships, villages and production groups are usually held before land utilization
and housing demolition. According to the Land Administration Law, any other institutions
(including project owners) have no right to undertake land acquisition except county land
administration bureau, the only authorized department to acquire land from the rural areas on
behalf of the state. However, even entitled to conduct centralized land acquisition for state
. 156.



construction, the county land administration departments wvill have to consult with land
expropriated townships, villages and groups, mainly about the compensation standards (for land,
housing, attachment and population resettlement) and resettlement plans (for housing
reconstruction, conversion of residential registration, employment, self-employment, etc.). The
leaders of villages and groups will be at the consultation.
(4) The consultation between townships, villages and groups on the one hand and village
households on the other (or between the demolition institution and the demolished in cities) is
mainly about the distribution and utilization of compensation fees, the measures for housing
reconstruction, worker taking-in and land relocation. The affected households will express their
reasons for compensation and demands for compensation whatever at the consultation. Every
household will eventually sign agreements on land acquisition, compensation and resettlement
with the township, the village and the group. Such consultation is chiefly attended by household
heads and, in some consultation, by villager representatives.
7.2 Meetings on Displaced Population
During the negotiation on land acquisition and housing demolition, two kinds of meetings will
be held in each village or group on population to be displaced: (1) meetings of village
representatives and (2) all the villagers. The meetings mentioned in this section refers to the ones
attended by the affected persons at the village or group level, while those mentioned in the earlier
section refer to the ones held among institutions concerned at all levels.
(1) Meetings of village representatives are presided over by the county land bureau or the
township government. The purpose is to get across the significance of the project, the scope and
site of land acquisition, the time for acquisition, the relevant laws, policies and regulations. The
meetings are usually called at the same time as the consultation and negotiation before the land
acquisition for a certain subproject.
(2) Meetings for all villagers are called by the village commission, attended by all the villagers or
the household heads with the purpose of expounding the relevant land, policies and regulations,
informing the villagers of the scope and amount of land to be acquired, the compensation
standards, the measures for housing reconstruction and production resettlement. The meetings
are usually held during the implementation or land acquisition and the time limit for signing
. 157.



agreement.
In addition to the above two forms of meeting, the railway construction unit and the resettlement
institution will put up posters in residential quarters before they make a decision with the aim to
consult the opinions of the affected population and ask for their supervision and examination.
The affected rural collectives must make compensation standards known to the villagers so as to
receive their scrutiny.
7.3 Mass Participation
Mass participation will take place alongside: (1) during the preparatory stage of the
project ;(2)during the compiling the RAP;(3) during the implementation of the land acquisition
for the project.The contents involve: 01 consultation; ()meetings on population displacement;
) investigation on property loss and socioeconomic survey; (!)discussing about compensation
standard; ) choice of housing reconstruction site;  setting up new housing by the villagers
themselves; and (!)seeking job by oneself.
(1) During the preparatory state of the project, that is from 1999 to 2000, mass participation was
chiefly concerned with socioeconomic survey, investigation on property loss, consultation
meetings and the publicizing of land acquisition affairs. Consultation meeting is about the
discussion and conferring among institutions of all sorts at all levels on the issues concerning
land acquisition and compensation, with the purpose of getting the villagers to know about the
land acquisition for the project so that they will be able to get prepared for that. Investigation on
property loss and the socioeconomic survey by the engineering design institution and the RAP
compiling institution entail the participation of the masses in the affected areas.
(2) During the compiling of RAP, a typical investigation and a sample investigation were made
to the cities, prefectures, counties, townships, villages and households whose land is going to
be acquired, participated by households, village and group leaders, township heads, the land
administration departments, the planning departments and the statistical departments at
county level, and the relevant departments of municipal and prefecture level.
(3) During the implementation of the land acquisition for the project (2000-2004),
there will be an extensive mass participation on the part of the affected population in the
measuring and determining of property loss, the discussion about the compensation standards,
. 158.



the signing of agreements on the compensation for households, the choice of new housing
ground site, the demolition of the old housing by the villagers themselves in order to use the
material, the construction of new housing by the villagers themselves and self-employment.
Mass participation, judging from above facts and measures, is encouraged in China in order to
arouse the masses' enthusiasm and achieve a more desirable resettlement result.
At the same time, RAP and the Resettlement Handbooks will be delivered to the affected places.
The affected persons can copy and read them freely.
7.4 Open Administration System Regarding Rural Village Affairs
Each affected village (group along the rail-line has a finance monitoring panel and its finance
regulations. In some regions, the local governments have also established Open Administration
System Regarding Rural Village Affairs. A good illustration of the system comes from Thle
Tianshui Municipal Regulations on Open Admninistration of Rural H4llage Affairs [Document
No. 41 (1999) issued by the Tianshui Municipal Government Office].
(1) An open administration of rural village affairs leading panel and a monitoring panel be set up
in each villagers meeting or villager representatives meeting, whose members are elected by
the correspondent meetings respectively.
(2) Information should be open to all the villagers regarding the collective's finance situation,
such as finance planning, financial incomes and financial expenditures.
(3) Information about land acquisition and examination/approval of housing sites should be open.
The village council should first notice the villagers meeting or villager representatives
meeting the information regarding the amount of land to be acquire from the village by the
State Government and by the governments at all levels, the amount of fees for land
compensation, labor force resettlement prior to the land acquisition and publicize such
information to all the villagers afterwards. The village council should report to the township
government annual housing sites planning. The village council should decide and grant, in
accordance with the plan issued by the superior government, the area, standards, conditions
and the total number of housing site appellants. The village council should publicize all the
information to the villagers. In the process of housing sites granting, three procedures are
.159.



needed before the final decision is made. The first procedure is to publicize the name list of
households that make the applications, the reasons for their application and the area of
housing sites they already hold. The second procedure is to publicize the name list of the
households qualified as housing site applicants whose cases are examined discussed at the
village representatives meeting and to be reported to the superior government for approval.
The third procedure is to publicize the name list of the households permitted to construct new
housing, the locations, areas, and fees to be collected for their new housing sites, which is
approved by the people's government authorized to issue such permission.
(4) Publicize the information regarding management state of the contracted collective
economics projects. The income and expenditure of the village collective enterprises,
forestry centers, fishing ponds, orchards and so on should be publicized to the villagers by
the open administration of rural village affairs leading panel after the statistics are checked
by the secretary of the village council and re-examined by the village finance monitoring
panel. Public competitive bidding should be practiced when it is necessary to contract or rent
the collective economy projects. Whenever a new collective enterprises is to be set up or a
new project to be developed, it should be discussed at and approved by the villagers meeting
or the villager representatives and be publicized to all the villagers.
(5) The villagers' burdens should be publicized. In accordance with the annual fixed quotas for
purchasing and tax set by the governnent, and the preliminary plans on profit deduction and
reserving and overall finance approved by the superior government, the village Party
secretary will check the statistics regarding the amount of burden each household should bear
according to the number of population, the amount of land possession per person, as well as
other conditions of the village. The statistics should be submitted by the open administration
of village affairs leading panel to the villagers meeting or the villager representatives meeting
and in turn be discussed and approved by the latter, and finally the notices of finance burdens
are issued to each household.
(6) The annual work system of management by objectives practiced by the village cadres., which
include such elements as the post duties, term and annual management objectives, the
measures to be take for accomplishing the objectives and the publicity of the information
regarding the objective accomplishments.
. 160 ,



(7) Publicity of other information that is believed to be worth publicizing by the villagers
meeting or the villager representatives meeting.
(8) All the information to be publicized regarding village affairs should be submitted to.
discussed and approved by Party members meeting, the villagers meeting or the villagers
representatives meeting by the open administration of village affairs leading panel, with the
monitor of the monitoring panel. The resolutions made at the meetings will be signed by the
open administration of village affairs leading panel and publicized to all the villagers.
(9) The leading group does the implementation of open administration of the village affairs and
the person responsible for the work is specified and the information regarding village affairs
administration is publicized in a regular time interval. Within 10 days of the publication, the
monitoring panel should collect responses by different means from the villagers regarding
the information publicized, sort the responses and report them to the village council. The
village council should make explanations on the issues raised by the villagers. If the issues
are indeed mistakes made in their work, an other publication should be arranged following
the procedures as describe earlier.
(10) The timely principle must be followed in open administration of village affairs. The time
interval of financial incomes and expenditures publication is once a season and each
important financial activities should be publicized timely item by item, other affairs should
also be publicized in time, say no later than 6 months.
(I l)The villager query and regular feedback systems should be insisted. The village council
should ensure the validity of the information publicized and accept the villagers' queries. In
case that the villagers think that the information publicized is invalid or unclear, they are
authorized to make queries, and put forward opinions and suggestions to the village council
or the village affairs open administration leading panel and the monitoring panel. The
villagers are also authorized the right of reporting to the township and county/district
governments and the governmental departments at the correspondent levels.
7.5 Grievance Appealing Channel
During the actual implementation of the land acquisition and the resettlement of displaced
population, if the affected population have any problems, grievances and discontent regarding
* 161.



land acquisition, housing demolition, compensation payment and resettlement, they may appeal
to either (1) the project owner, (2) the extemal independent monitoring institution, (3) the
township and the county land administration department, (4) the county government or (5) legal
action.
(1) Appealing to the Project Owner Unit
The project owner is the eventual user of the land acquired, and has the duty to resolve problems
rising from land acquisition, housing demolition and resettlement. The project owner of this
project is the Railway Ministry with the Bao-Lan Special Rail-line Headquarters functioning in
its capacity during the project engineering, and LRB and ZRB executing the managerial duty
after the project engineering is completed. Therefore, appeals to the project owner may go to
either of
A. The Railway Ministry;
B. The Headquarters of the second Bao-Lan Railway
(2) Appealing to the External Monitoring Institution
The external monitoring institution conducts chasing-up investigation on the production of
affected villages several times in the year during the monitoring period, and evaluates the
resettlement consequences and submits its M&E reports to the project owner, the local
institutions conducting land acquisition and housing demolition and the World Bank. The
affected persons, therefore, may express their discontent and grievances to the external
monitoring institution, which is obligated to listen to and find out the dissentient and grievances.
(3) Appealing to the Township and the County Land Administration Department
According to the administrative procedure of the local government, the discontent and
grievances rising from acquisition and resettlement should first be handled by the land
administration department. In case the land administration department is unable to resolve the
grievances, the apparel may turn to other conduits. These are the conduits of the land
administration departments the apparel may go:
A. the municipal land administration bureau;
B. the county land administration bureau; and
C. the township land administration bureau.
. 162.



(4) Appealing to the County Government
If the discontent can not be resolved in the land administration department, it can be appealed to
the "correspondence and visitation department" of the local governments, set up by various
levels of government organs to handle letters and visits from the masses. The appealer may
express his discontent orally or in written form to the correspondence and visitation departments,
which may coordinate departments concerned to have the matter resolved. If again the
discontent can not be resolved in this way, the correspondence and visitation departments will
report the matter to the leaders of the local government.
(5) Legal Action
If discontent and grievances can not be resolved through the above 4 conduits, the appealer may
resort to legal action by bringing the case to court.
. 163.

(4) Land Acquisition & Resettlement Section of the Engineering Headquarters
As the subordinate standing institution of the headquarters, it is engaged in the actual work of
acquisition and resettlement and carries out all the tasks the headquarters assigns to it. Staff of
the section work almost the whole day at the construction site and keep a close contact with the
local governments especially governments at the gross-roots level and the affected population
and the construction units. It is a very important institution at the operational level for the ideas
and opinions of the local governments and the affected population will be notified to the
headquarters by this section and the mandates from the headquarters will be carried out by it.
(4) Staff from Construction Units in Charge of Land Acquisition & Resettlement
Railway construction projects have their particularity in that there are usually quite a number
of construction units simultaneously undertaking construction of the same or different type on
the same line or various lines. Therefore, the headquarter requires that each construction unit has
at least one staff member specialized in acquisition and resettlement. As a matter of fact, the head
of each construction unit often sees to acquisition and resettlement all by himself in spite that
there is already an official in charge of this matter to ensure that project constructions can be
carried out smoothly. Personnel at this level mainly take the responsibility of handling incidents
that occurs suddenly or unexpectedly in daily work of land acquisition and resettlement.
8.2.2 Responsibility of All the Resettlement Institutions of the Loca Governments
(1) Provincial Leading Groups for the 2 d Baoji-Lanzhou Rail-line Construction
As the work concerning land acquisition and resettlement is of heavily policy-relying nature,
the provincial governments have attached great importance to it. A leading body for aiding
railway construction has been formed in both of Ganshu Province and Shaanxi Province, headed
by a vice-governor responsible for State key project construction, the persons in command from
the provincial planning commission, land bureau, design office and other relevant department as
the group members
The main responsibilities of the leading group of each province are as the following:
*  :to carry out the policies by the state and the province about railway construction.

*  to ensure a smooth implementation of state key construction projects.
(2) The Provincial and Municipal Land Administration Bureaus
As institutions contracting the land acquisition, housing demolition & relocation and
resettlement for railway construction project in the capacity of their governments, the provincial
and municipal land bureaus have very important function in that they have the power to examine
and ratify and requests for land acquisition and resettlement, negotiation on behalf of the local
governments with project owners about compensation standards, formulate various policies and
supervise their execution, participate in the drawing-up of resettlement action plans, sign
contracts on acquisition, demolition and resettlement with project owners on behalf f local
governments, supervise the implementation of resettlement and the allocation and utilization of
acquisition and resettlement fund, cooperate project owners and local governments and handle
contingent disputes, problems and appeals.
(3) County Land Administration Bureaus
County land bureaus are the executive institutions of acquisition and resettlement. They are
. 168.



responsible of acquisition and resettlement in the counties in accordance with the overall
arrangement by the province and the city. They prepare the county-level resettlement plans.
based on the population statistics provided by the investigation department. They see to it that
the plans-are carried out in accordance with the resettlement policies formulated by the province

the-spot investigations and provide the M&E reports to the World Bank, the project owners
and the local governments,
*  to run training classes for the personnel involved in acquisition and resettlement from the
local governments and the project owner unit,
*  to offer technical consultation in data gathering and processing.
Refer to Chapter 8 for the detailed description about the external dependent monitoring
institutions
.Designing Institutions
The designing agency of this project is the 1 Surveying & Designing Institute of the Railway
Ministry, which also played a remarkable role in land acquisition and resettlement. The
institution tried by every effort to optimize the design and minimize the land acquisition and
housing demolition and worked out engineering drawings and promptly alter the design in order
that resettlement can come into action a early as possible.
8.3 Coordination and Liaison between the Institutions
The Second Baoji-Lanzhou Rail-line has involved many institutional systems, which
necessitate a good coordination and liaison, not only between the Railway ministry and the
involved provinces, bus also between the provinces. What is equally important is the
coordination between the headquarters and the construction units, the local governments,
. 170.



between the project owner and the supervision units and the designing units, and again bet-ween
the project owner, the construction units and the local governments. The land acquisition and
resettlement for the project will be undoubtedly hampered if there's no good coordination
between institutions.
The railway Ministry and Gansu and Shaanxi provinces all attach great importance to
coordination. They often hold joint meetings, exchanging information, conversing one another
and sending the memos to all institutions concerned. Some other measures such as information
announcing and revealing are also taken to strengthen the coordination.
8.4 Measure Taken to Enhance the Capacities of the Institutions
8.4.1 Strengthening the democratic supervision and legal system perfection

8.4.2 More capable personnel
Both the Railway Ministry and the local governments have carefully chosen persons experienced
in land acquisition and resettlement with managerial skills and dada processing skills to form the
* 172.



resettlement institutions of all levels.
8.4.3More training
At the preparation stage, both the Railway Ministry and the local governments demand that
their major staff members engaged in land acquisition and resettlement to learn and have a good
grasp of China's resettlement policies, the bank's requirements and the successful cases of other
administrative sectors in china and learn to master the skills of collecting and processing data.

9. Monitoring and Evaluation
9.1 Goals of Monitoring
Monitoring on resettlement refers to the collection and provision of data concerning the
resettlement activities and the resettlement consequences. Evaluation means the analysis and
appraisal of data gathered in monitoring by referring to the comparable indexes (such as the
plans, the former conditions before removal, and the conditions of non-displaced population).
The World Bank has warned that every project is bound to be faced with a lot of particular
problems in its execution. Some of these problems are unforeseeable. The purposes of
monitoring and examining are, firstly, to ensure a punctual execution of the plan as scheduled;
secondly, to find out problems and have them resolved then and there; and thirdly, to have the
collected data fed back to the designing, executing and managing work of the project.
The evaluation on displaced population resettlement is expected to examine and decide whether
the production and livelihood of displaced population are appropriately resettled in sociological
and anthropological perspectives. Monitoring and evaluation are not the ends in themselves; the
conclusions drawn from monitoring and evaluation are expected to feed back to the execution
and management of the project so that any inappropriateness can be redressed promptly, or some
alternation can be made to the executive plan, or the existing problems can be solved.
After the loan to the Bao-Lan Project enters into force, regular supervision will be organized
by the World Bank annually, with the relevant parties examining implementation progress. If it
appears that RAP terms themselves are inappropriate for effective implementation, a
resettlement mid-term review may be scheduled to allow the relevant parties to devise new
approaches or revise the RAP.
Resettlement monitoring falls into two kinds: internal and external monitoring. Internal
monitoring is carried out by the population resettlement office with the purpose of keeping the
institutions of the resettlement network in good operation following the schedule and the
. 175 -



principles of RAP. A report of internal monitoring is submitted every quarter of or half a year.
External independent monitoring is to be conducted by an independent social agency to
chasing-up investigation on the implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation and evaluate the whole process from an impartial, comprehensive and long-term
point of view so as to secure the benefit of the displaced population. The general task of external
independent monitoring is to provide all sorts of information and foresight, based on chasing-up
investigation and data collection, to the project resettlement office and the project administration
institution in order that any problems concerning population displacement and resettlement can
be solved promptly. Two reports on external monitoring will be submitted annually in the first
two years (in June and December); and beginning from the third year, one report annually (in
June).
9.2 Internal Monitoring
The Bao-Lan Project Engineering Headquarters conducts the internal monitoring on this project
and it is implemented by the Land Acquisition and Housing Demolition Section of the
Engineering Headquarters.
The following are the steps of the procedure for internal monitoring:
(1) The Land Acquisition and Housing Demolition Offices design and establish the
information flow patterns and data bank systems;
(2) The Land Acquisition and Housing Demolition Offices store up investigation data
and the socioeconomic data of the affected area;
(3) During the project implementation, the Acquisition and Demolition Offices copy
down the relevant background information of individuals, households and units from
the city, county and township according to the prescribed patterns;
(4) The Acquisition and Demolition Offices make periodic sampling on townships and
villages to check the copied data and progress.
Internal monitoring has its focus on:
(1)      the progress of land acquisition;
. 176.



(2)      the progress of housing demolition;
(3)      the progress of enterprises relocation;
(4)      the measures concerning housing reconstruction.
(5)      the resettlement measures for surplus labors;
(6)      the forms of mass participation;
(7)      the disbursement of compensation fees;
(8)   the choice and training of staff members for resettlement institutions
9.3 External Monitoring
The Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU has been invited to undertake the
external independent monitoring of this project. Southwest Jiaotong University. one of the key
universities in China, enjoys a high reputation both at home and abroad. Its Research Institute of
Foreign Capital Utilization, a professional research institute at the study of the resettlement of
displaced population, has a staff consisting of specialists and technical personnel in sociology,
anthropology, managerial science, economics, evaluation technology. information processing,
system analysis, etc. The institute has rich experience in monitoring population displacement
and resettlement and that under the Work Bank loaned projects. Listed in the following is only
part of the work it has done under either the Bank loaned projects or non-Bank loaned projects:
(1) The monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement of displaced population in the 6' World
Bank financed Chinese railway projects;
(2) The monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement of displaced population in the World
Bank Financed Yunnan Environmental Protection Projects;
(3) directing the drawing up of RAP for the World Bank financed Sichuan Electricity Power
Transmission Project;
(4) The making of the aid plan for the later stage of resettlement implementation for Sichuan
Tongjiezi Power Station.
The external monitoring of this project has the following four stages as its procedure:
(I) the preparatory stage, to decide on the target persons and scope of investigation and draw up
.177.



the outline and forms for the investigation;
(2) The investigation stage, to investigate on the target persons at all levels and gather
information and material;
(3) The information feedback stage, to feed the information collected in the investigation back
to the construction headquarters and the MOR and consult with them to have the problems
found out in the investigation resolved;
(4) the report drawing-up stage, to draw evaluation conclusions and work out M&E reports,
based on the sorting out and diagnosis of the collected data and material.
These are the norms for external independent M&E to go by:
(I) Operation Guide 4.30 of the World Bank's Operation Directive concerning involuntary
resettlement;
(2) Relevant polices and legal provisions regarding acquisition and resettlement of both the
state and localities;
(3)the action plan of acquisition and resettlement for this project.
(4) The security of a better or at least the maintenance of the former income and living standards
for the displaced population.
The investigation methods of the external M&E of this project involve sample investigation,
typical case investigation, focus investigation, group interviews, interviews with important
persons in the know, close-up interviews, observing and learning, looking up literature
documents, information checking in data bank, etc.
External M&E has its main interest in the consequences of resettlement, the economic income
and the living standards of the displaced population. The following are the main aspects for the
external M&E of this project:
(1) analysis of the impacts resulting from the land acquisition and housing demolition;
(2) appraisal of the compensation standards;
(3) supervision over the allocation and utilization of compensation fees, including collective
. 178.



land compensation;
(4) monitoring on the housing resettlement of the displaced population;
(5) monitoring on the production;
(6) monitoring on enterprises relocation;
(7) monitoring on the living standards of the displaced population;
(8) monitoring on the community rehabilitation;
(9) monitoring on the grievance appealing of the displaced population;
(10) monitoring on the operational efficiency of the resettlement network.
9.4 Report Submission
Monitoring reports for this project fall into reports of the implementation progress of
resettlement (internal monitoring reports) and external monitoring reports on resettlement.
The implementation progress reports are written and submitted by the Bao-Lan Project
Engineering Headquarters while the Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU
writes the external monitoring reports.
An implementation progress report will have to be written and submitted once every half a year
and an external monitoring report, once a year (or twice a year in the busiest period of land
acquisition).
The external monitoring reports, according to the procedure, will by submitted by the
Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilization of SWJU to the Land Acquisition Section of
Foreign Capital Utilization Office of the MOR who will forward them to the World Bank.
