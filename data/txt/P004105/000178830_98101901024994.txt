KOREA
INDUSTRIAL FINANCE PROJECT
I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
1.01      Contribution to Economic Growth.  In the space of only two decades,
Korea has transformed itself from an impoverished, largely agriculture-based
country into a middle-income industrializing nation. Per capita GNP (at 1980
prices) increased from US$477 in 1962 to US$1,627 in 1981. The manufacturing
sector has been the engine of Korea's economic growth with an annual growth
rate of 15.5% (in constant prices) between 1960 and 1981. The share of
manufacturing value added in GNP increased from 14% to 30% over this period
and created approximately 2.5 million new jobs, representing about 37% of
total incremental employment. In 1981, manufacturing employment totalled
2.9 million and accounted for 20% of the total employed population, compared
to 13% in 1970.
1.02      Export Orientation.  Korea-s success in economic development has
been largely based on a strategy of export promotion with emphasis on manu-
factured exports. Total commodity exports in 1962 amounted to only US$55
million, of which manufactured goods accounted for only about 27%. By 1981,
total commodity exports (in current prices) had increased to US$21.3 billion,
of which manufactured products accounted for 93%. The average annual growth
rate of manufactured exports declined in real terms from 33.8% during the
period 1972-76 to 11.2% over the period 1977-81, but remained significantly
above the average real growth in GNP of 5.7% p.a. over the latter period.
After an increase in manufactured exports of only 1% in real terms in 1979,
as the Won was becoming substantially overvalued, growth in 1980 and 1981
reached 13.4% and 18.8% respectively, ifollowing the continuing adjustments
in the parity of the Won in 1980-81. In 1982, manufactured exports
increased by only 3% in real terms, ref-lecting the stagnation in
international markets.
1.03      The composition of manufactured exports has changed significantly
over the last decade, reflecting changes in Korea's comparative advantage.
The share of machinery in total exports increased from 9% in 1970 to 29% in
1981, and basic metals from 2% to 9%. There has been some reduction in the
share of textiles and footwear exports, but these products still account for
around 35% of total exports. Wood and wood products declined more markedly
from 11% of total exports in 1970 to 2% in 1981.
1.04      Structural Change in Manufacturing.  During the early phase of
industrialization, spanning the 1960s and early 1970s, manufactured exports
were concentrated largely on light industrial goods (e.g., textiles,



-2-
apparel, and wood projects) in which Korea demonstrated a comparative
advantage based on low cost and efficient labor. Government policies
emphasized the promotion of exports through tariff exemptions on materials
and equipment to be used directly or indirectly for export production and
through financial incentives which provided exporters wit:h automatic access
to short-term export credits at subsidized interest rates., These subsidies
approximately compensated exporters for the relatively low average levels of
protection afforded to production for the domestic market./1
1.05      From the early 1970s, however, increased importance was attached
to industrial deepening and diversification, with emphasis on the development
of heavy and chemical industries. This shift in priorities reflected
recognition that Korea was gradually losing its comparative advantage in
export industries based on low cost labor and that it should begin to
develop more sophisticated products relying on a more skilled labor force
with higher technical capabilities. Niumerous special laws were implemented
for the promotion of priority industries. Preferential, low-cost financing
was made available, through the National Investment Fund (NIF) and other
special funds, and selected industries received generous tax exemptions and
concessions.
1.06      The composition of manufacturing showed a marked shift in favor of
heavy industry /2 whose share of total manufacturing value added increased
from 41.8% in 1970 to 51.6% in 1980. The most significant gains have been
registered by the machinery industries., which accounted for less than 10% of
manufacturing value added in 1970 but tnore than one quarter in 1980. The
share of chemical industries, however, declined from about 30% of manufac-
turing value added to 18.5% over this period. Light industries have
declined steadily since 1970, with the sharpest decline recorded in the food,
beverage and tobacco industries. Textiles have maintained a 15-20% share of
total manufacturing value added.
1.07      Recent Developments.  Korea has been affected, like most countries,
by the recent world-wide recession. The external problems caused by the
oil-price increase of 1979, the rapid increase in international interest
rates and the severe decline in growth of world trade in manufactures have
also been accompanied by adverse developments in the domestic environment.
By the late 1970s, Korea was already beginning to suffer From strains caused
by sustained rapid economic growth. The rate of increase of wholesale
prices accelerated from 12% in 1978 to 39% in 1980. There was also
/1  See for example, Industrial Policy and Development in Korea, IBRD Staff
Working Paper No. 263, August 1977.
/2 Includes basic metals, machinery and chemical industries.



-3-
increasing concern about the impact of the overly ambitious investment pro-
grams in heavy and chemical industries which helped to fuel the inflationary
spiral and led to a sharp rise in capital intensity of output and to
overcapacity. In addition, the unfavorable weather of 1980 led to a decline
in agricultural output of about 22%. Between mid-1979 and 1981, GNP was
stagnant, real per capita income, adjusted for terms of trade, declined by
about 10% and the rate of unemployment increased significantly.
1.08      Value added in the manufacturing declined in 1980 by 1% in real
terms before recovering somewhat in 1981 with a growth of 7.1%. The weak
international environment held the manufacturing sector growth rate at 4.3%
in 1982. Total manufacturing employment fell from 3.1 million in 1979 to
2.9 million in 1981 and improved to about 3 million in 1982.
1.09      Gross fixed capital formation in manufacturing, after increasing
in real terms by more than 60% in 1978 and almost 16% in 1979, fell by 36%
in 1980 and by a further 5% in 1981./1 Despite this slowdown in the last two
years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, manufacturing investment during the Plan
period (1977-81) reached W 10.58 trillion compared to a planned level of
W 8.92 trillion. Heavy and chemical industries, mainly primary metals and
machinery, accounted for almost all of the additional investment but, as
noted earlier, some of these investments led to severe problems of over-
capacity in industries such as heavy engineering and petrochemicals. Light
industries did not share equally in this investment boom. In fact,
investment in textile industries, where substantial investments are needed
to upgrade quality and to move into more technologically sophisticated areas
of production, fell more than 10% below plan targets. The combination of
high levels of investment in the latter half of the 1970s and the subsequent
economic recession resulted in a sharp fall in average capacity utilization
in the manufacturing sector, from a high of 88% in 1978 to 73% in 1980, with
no significant improvement in 1981 and 1982. For general machinery
industries, capacity utilization fell from 75% in 1979 to less than 50% in
1980 and 1981.
1.10      Financial Structure of Enterprises.  Profitability of the
non-financial corporate sector declined drastically in 1979-80, and recovered
only weakly in 1981. This decline was especially severe in manufacturing,
which experienced losses in 1980 and 1981, as shown in the table below.
Based on the income statements of stock exchange listed firms for the first
six months of 1982, the profitability of non-financial enterprises declined
significantly compared to the first half of 1981. Profitability has
apparently improved in the second half of the year, due to lower nominal
interest charges on both domestic and foreign debt and some recovery in
domestic demand.
/1 Preliminary estimates for the first three quarters of 1982 show an
annualized real growth of 7.5%.

Source: BOK
1.11       Corporate debt/equity ratios in the manufacturing sector dete-
riorated significantly during 1979-81 ('as shown in the above table), aggra-
vating already high levels of indebtedness. High corporate indebtedness
remained manageable during the period 1.970-79 when a rather low and stable
lending rate kept borrowing costs at about 5 to 6% of net sales. Indebted-
ness became a serious problem when interest rates rose sharplv (in 1979-80)
and inflation fell (in 1981-82).  This situation coincided with a fall in
profits due to the prolonged recession and a tight monetary policy initiated
by the Government. As a result, the ability of the corporate sector to
mobilize additional debt was curtailed at the same time as the burden of
financial charges increased. Firms were generally unable to meet rising
borrowing costs out of their cash operating profit. Additional borrowings
to meet interest payments further increased the cash flow deficits which
needed to be financed. The tight liquidity situation of the corporate
sector persisted until mid-1982 when lending rates were lowered by about 40%
compared to rates prevailing in 1981. This lowering of borrowing costs
improved corporate profitability and helped ease the tight liquidity
position of many firms. However, corporate indebtedness remains high in
Korea by international standards.
1.12       Proper revaluation of assets to adjust fully for inflation would
substantially improve the debt/equity structure of the corporate sector
although indebtedness would still be among the highest in the world./l
Similarly, profitability would be better than published accounts indicate,
though it would still be lower in 1979-81 than in prior years. In effect,
short maturities and high nominal interest rates have made corporations
inherently illiquid, even where, on an inflation-adjusted basis, they may
/1  Bank estimates indicate an inflatior-adjusted average debt/equity ratio
of around 1.5:1 compared with a reported average ratio of around 4:1.
In Japan, where debt/equity ratios are high by international standards,
adjusted debt/equity ratios average less than 1:1.

have had relatively low debt/equity ratios and reasonable profits. Although
corporate profitability may prove to have been worse in 1982 than in prior
years (on an inflation-adjusted basis), corporate liquidity and cash flows
are likely to have improved due to the dlecline in nominal interest rates.
1.13      Overall, Korean firms have suffered from a rather unique combination
of high indebtedness, declining profitability and severe illiquidity.
Nevertheless, financial distress appears to be highly concentrated in large
enterprises which invested in the priority sectors for which, in the past,
the Government has provided almost unlimited access to low cost domestic
funds and to guaranteed foreign credits. In general, small and medium
enterprises are less leveraged than larger enterprises and relatively less
affected by liquidity problems.
1.14      Policy Responses.  The increased emphasis placed by the Government
on the development of more sophisticated industrial activities during the
1970s reflected an awareness of Korea's declining comparative advantage in
traditional, labor-intensive industries. In retrospect, however, the
growth in manufacturing investment in large, capital-intensive industries
was too rapid, and paid inadequate attention to technical, engineering and
marketing considerations. The associated neglect of light industries
retarded their progress in updating prodluct quality and technological
sophistication and harmed the competitiveness of traditional exports.
1.15      The Government has recognized these problems and that its extensive
role in directing the course of industrial development (though selective
directed credit allocation, discriminatory fiscal incentives and protection
policies) is no longer appropriate given the increasing complexity and
sophistication of Korea's industrial sector. Consequently, it has instituted
a number of policy adjustments to increase efficiency of resource allocation
by placing greater emphasis on market forces. In the area of industrial and
trade policies, the Government, in 1981, outlined a number of important
measures and a medium-term structural adjustment program in a Letter of
Development Policy for 1982-86. The Letter provided the basis for the
Bank's first Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) of US$250 million which was
approved in December 1981./1 The main features of the structural adjustment
program relating to the manufacturing sector include import liberalization
and tariff reform; reform of industrial incentives; development of programs
for restructuring and consolidation of large industries currently suffering
from substantial excess capacity; and the strengthening of project appraisal
capacity in government agencies, especially for large scale projects
requiring government assistance. The Government has also initiated a reform
of the financial system which aims at improving resource allocation and
increasing the efficiency of financial intermediaries (paras. 2.16 to 2.18).

1.16      Prospects.  The Fifth Five-Year Plan projects an average annual GNP
growth rate of 7.5% in real terms over the period 1982-86 with investment
growing at an average rate of 9% p.a.  Over the same period, the industrial
sector is expected to grow at 11% p.a. The basic objective of the Fifth
Plan is to pursue the process of stru,ztural adjustment with greater reliance
on market forces.  The Government's strategy is sound, bul: the transition is
going to be difficult and the GNP growth target may not be achieved. In any
case, during the 1980s, Korea will have to adjust to a lower growth rate
than in the past two decades and find ways of increasing the employment
intensity of its growth to keep unempLoyment rates at acceptable levels.
The projected export growth of 11% does not appear unreasonable in term of
the country's past performance, but the near-term prospects are less
favorable than assumed in the Plan.  Also, as the leading edge of export
growth swings increasingly from tradii:ional, labor-intensive products to
higher quality and more technologicaLly advanced products, the need to focus
on the difficult task of upgrading technical, technological and marketing
capabilities becomes more urgent. Consequently, the realization of export
projections and, ultimately, of overall growth projections, will depend on
the success of policies to improve export competitiveness.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
2.01      The Korean financial system has grown rapidly iin the 1970s.
Average consolidated assets of the monetary system (whic'h comprises the
Central Bank and the deposit money banks) and other financial institutions
increased from 51.1% of GNP in 1972 to 62.8% in 1979.  Growth of the system
accelerated in 1980-81 despite the onset of a severe economic recession,
with average financial assets reaching 85.4% of GNP in 1981. The late 1970s
also saw a significant development of direct financing in the form of
commercial paper transactions and corporate debenture issues in the
securities market. These developments reflected the diversification of the
Korean economy and the increasing sophistication of the financial sector.
Institutional Sources of Funds
2.02      Deposit money banks (DMBs), comprising non-specialized and
specialized /1 commercial banks, form the core of the financial system with
about 57% of total assets, a ratio practically unchanged since 1975 (Annex 1,
/1  The six specialized banks were created by the Government to service
particular sectors of the economy such as small industries, exporters,
housing, etc. The specialized banks include the Korea Exchange Bank
(KEB), the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB), the 'Citizens National
Bank (CNB), the Housing Bank, the Agricultural Cooperatives and the
Fisheries Cooperatives.



Table 1). The share of the Central Bank (Bank of Korea) has declined from
23% in 1975 to 14.0% in 1981, while the assets of non-bank financial
intermediaries (NBFI) increased rapidly from 19.6% of total assets to 29.4%

2.03      The Banking System.  The group of non-specialized commercial banks
remains the most important within the financial system although its assets
have declined marginally from 37% of total financial assets in 1975 to 34% in
1981. It consists of five city banks /1 with a nationwide network of
branches, ten private local banks with regional operations, and branches of
foreign commercial banks. Foreign bank branches have had the most rapid
growth with aggregate assets growing at a rate of 27.6% in real terms over
the period 1975-81; however, they have limited capabilities in mobilizing
domestic savings and rely primarily on foreign resources. On the other
hand, domestic deposits are the major source of funds for the local and city
banks. In 1981, deposits accounted for 61% of their total liabilities and
equity. Other sources of funds for the local and city banks consist
primarily of Central Bank rediscounts and foreign borrowings.
/1 In addition, two new joint venture banks have been established in 1982-83.



-8-
2.04       As a group, specialized commercial banks have gained in importance
within the financial system, rising from 20% of total assets in 1975 to
23% in 1981.  Unlike the non-specialized banks, they are not established
under the General Banking Act and therefore remain outside the jurisdiction
of the Central Bank, except for their deposit taking act:Lvities. The
specialized banks were each establishetd under separate legislation and are
supervised directly by the Ministry of' Finance. Domestic currency deposits
accounted for 46% of the aggregate liability and equity resources of
specialized banks at year-end 1981. F'oreign borrowings are their next
largest source of funds followed by bcrrowings from the (Central Bank and
from the Government. The Korea Exchange Bank is the largest of the
specialized banks accounting for about 38% of their combined assets; it
specializes in foreign trade financing and supports its operations primarily
through overseas borrowings and deposits.
2.05       Commercial banks, non-specialized and specialized, jointly account
for approximately 70% of total lending to the manufacturinrg sector in Korea
(Annex 1, Table 2). Non-specialized commercial banks remain the most
important source despite a decline from 63.5% of the net increase in total
manufacturing sector credit in 1975-78 to 49.6% in 1979-81.. Over the same
period, the three specialized banks most active in the manufacturing sector
(i.e., SMIB, CNB and KEB) have increased their combined share of manufac-
turing sector lending from 16% to 19.7%. As of December 31, 1981, only 27%
of non-specialized commercial bank loans outstanding to manufacturing were
for equipment finance as the bulk of their lending was for working capital
finance. By contrast, the three specialized banks mentioned above channel
close to 40% of their manufacturing sector lending in the form of equipment
financing.
2.06       Nonbank Financial Intermediaries (NBFI).  Nonbank intermediaries
comprise (a) development banks; (b) trust accounts; (c) insurance companies;
(d) shortterm finance companies; (e) mutual savings and finance companies;
(f) postal savings; (g) securities companies; and (h) merchant banks. The
rapid growth of NBFI assets in recent years is due to the emergence of new
financial instruments whose supply is limited to specific institutions.
This is particularly so for trust accounts, insurance companies, investment
and finance companies, and mutual savings finance companies. While they had
an aggregate share of only 8.5% of total assets of the financial system in
1975, by year-end 1981, their share had risen to 16%. This growth was
primarily in response to the growing demand for savings instruments with
higher yields than those offered by banks.
2.07       Within the NBFIs, the three Korean development banks remain the
dominant group, with aggregate assets representing 11.1% of the financial
system in 1981. Two of these banks, t'he Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLB)
and the Korea Development Bank (KDB), have been active botrowers of the World
Bank since 1969 and 1975, respectively.  Both are important: sources of



-9-
equipment finance for the manufacturing sector with KDB and KLB accounting
for 18.6% and 5.3%, respectively, of outstanding equipment financing at
end-1981. The bulk of the Bank Group's industrial lending is channelled
through them. With total assets of $7.8 billion, KDB is the single largest
financial institution in Korea. It accounted for 8.3% of total financial
assets in 1981, down slightly from 8.8% in 1975. Despite a rapid real growth
of nearly 26% p.a. in 1975-81, KLB is a much smaller institution than KDB;
its assets represented 1% of total financial assets as of December 31, 1981.
The Korea Export Import Bank (Exim Bank), the third Korean development bank,
has experienced an extremely rapid growth of over 50% p.a. since its
establishment in 1976. Its development is linked to the expansion of Korean
exports of machinery and ships for which Exim Bank provides long-term
suppliers' credits. At end-December 1981, Exim Bank accounted for 14.2% of
all outstanding equipment loans to the manufacturing sector.
Other Sources of Funds
2.08      Curb-Market.  The curb market is a large source of noninstitutional
financing. Recent estimates of its size! range from W 1 to 1.5 trillion
($1.3 to $2 billion), approximately 6% of total domestic credit to the
private sector. Existence of the informal curb market as a source of short
term finance is largely in response to credit needs unmet by formal credit
institutions. To this extent, the curb market operates as a "safety valve"
providing relief from supply constraints in the formal credit sector where
rates and credit flows are government controlled. For this reason, attempts
to suppress the curb market have had little effect in the past. The most
recent attempt, in late 1982, caused serious liquidity problems in the
corporate sector which were partly compensated by an increase in the supply
of institutional credit. In practice, a significant proportion of curb
market transactions take place through institutions operating in the formal
market such as banks and short term finance companies. To this extent,
financial sector assets and liabilities overlap, in part, with curb market
transactions. Interest rates prevailing in the curb market have declined
substantially in recent months to about 1.5% per month in early 1983.
2.09      Overseas Borrowings.  Statistics on the net foreign currency fund
flows to the manufacturing sector are shown in Annex 1, Table 3.  Direct
overseas borrowings by Korean firms and foreign trade credits provided
substantial resources to the industrial sector in the period 1979-81 with a
net inflow equivalent to 26.5% of net outlays by domestic institutions.
However, this represented a significant slowdown compared to the period
1975-78, when net foreign capital inflows reached 81.7% of net institutional
outlays to manufacturing. Availability of these foreign credits is usually
dependent upon a guarantee issued by a domestic financial institution. The
ratio of outstanding guarantees to total financial sector assets has declined
from 32% in 1975 to 26% in 1981, reflecting, as mentioned above, a relative
decline in the reliance of Korean firms on direct overseas borrowings.



- 10 -
2.10       Capital Market.  Despite a t:emporary stagnation in 1980-81, the
Korean capital market has become an imiportant source of direct fund mobili-
zation for the corporate sector. Aggregate resources exceeding $1 billion
annually have been mobilized by the manufacturing sector in the securities
market over the period 1979-81. Annex 1, Table 3 shows that, in response to
the low profitability of firms, the stock market was very sluggish in
1980-81 with new issues by manufacturing enterprises averaging less than
$50 million per annum, less than 15% of the amounts raised during the period
of peak activity in 1979. On the other hand, the corporate bond market has
been booming. Bond issues by manufact:uring sector firms averaged $1 billion
per annum in 1979-81. Despite a slight decline in 1981, corporate bonds
issued by manufacturing firms reached about W 690 billion, equivalent to' 22%
of the net increase in manufacturing sector credit by the financial system.
The rapid growth of the corporate bond market is due both to the limited
availability of credit from financial institutions at the low rates legis-
lated by Government and to the high ylelds of corporate bonds compared to
the bank deposit rate./l
Government Controls and Intervention
2.11       The rapid development of the Korean economy over the past 20 years
was based on highly interventionist government policies. While industrial
growth was reliant on the private secl:or, investment priorities were deter-
mined by the Government. The Government also committed the resources
required for implementation of the priLority investments, including financing
on preferential terms, channelled through the development banks and the
specialized and non-specialized commercial banks.  Strict control over
resource allocation by the financial system was a major tool in the
Government's development strategy.
2.12       Government control of the f:Lnancial system was effected through
various means including restrictions on the establishment of new financial
institutions, virtual control of ownership over the entire banking sector
and the main development banks (excluding, however, the Korea Long-Term
Credit Bank), detailed regulation of bank management and staffing decisions,
determination of interest rates, and selective credit controls for allocating
resources. The latter two instruments of government control have proved to
be extremely constraining factors affecting the overall efficiency of
financial intermediaries in Korea.
2.13       Savings Mobilization.  Since 1965, government interest rate policy
has aimed at maintaining positive reaL deposit rates to encourage mobiliza-
tion of financial savings. This policy has been maintained to the present
/1  In January 1983, corporate bonds yielded 15-16% compared to a time
deposit rate of 8%.



- 11 S
date with the exception of the periods 1974-75 and 1980-81 when inflationary
outbursts following the two oil shocks brought deposit rates to a negative
level in real terms. The policy of maintaining positive real deposit rates
contributed to the rapid accumulation of financial assets described above
and to the high domestic savings performance of Korea during that period.
By 1981, the ratio of M2 and financial assets to GNP reached 32.7% and
85.4%, respectively. Even during the 1975-80 period characterized by a
high level of gross capital formation (30% of GNP), domestic savings
financed over 80% of investment. Although significant reliance on foreign
borrowings was necessitated by the high level of investment, the favorable
performance of domestic savings kept suclh borrowings within reasonable
limits.
2.14      Resource Allocation.  Government intervention in the process of
financial intermediation has been primarily in the area of resource
allocation. Recent policy measures to reform the financial system have
significantly altered what could, until now, be characterized as centralized
decision-making. Controls extended to the price (i.e., the lending rate),
the quantity and the terms (maturity and maximum individual loan amounts) of
credit available for specific activities. Subsidization of lending rates in
proportion to the assumed degree of priority of investments was widespread.
The fragmented lending rate structure created substantial price distortions
and, to the extent that some lending rates were fixed below deposit rates,
eroded the profitability of financial intermediaries. The large proportion
of subsidized credits and the narrow margins between deposit and lending
rates made the financial viability of intermediaries largely dependent upon
regular infusions of government subsidies which were channelled primarily
through the Central Bank. The two main programs of selective and subsidized
lending operated by the Government in the 1970's were the Central Bank's
rediscounting facility for short-term export credit and the National
Investment Fund (NIF) for long-term equipment financing. The interest rate
subsidies attached to these programs were removed with the interest rate
reform of June 1982. At end-1981, outstanding credits amounted to W 2.2
trillion for export credits and W 1.9 trillion for NIF, which represented an
aggregate share of 19.9% of total private sector domestic credit outstanding.
In practice, government controls over the process of resource allocation
extended not only to the selective programs it operated and funded directly
(such as export credit and NIF) /1 but also included the earmarking of
resources mobilized independently by financial institutions for allocation
to specific subsectors such as small industries and machinery manufacturing,
on terms and conditions specified by Government. In aggregate, the
Government controlled approximately 50% to 60% of total banking resources.
/1 Actually, NIF is funded primarily from annual contributions by banks,
equivalent to 13% of the annual increase in their deposits.



- 12 -
2.15      In the late 1970s, the Korean Government began to realize that its
controls over resource allocation 'n the real and in the financial sectors
were becoming increasingly difficult to manage in view oi' the growing
complexity of the Korean economy. While the total cred:it needs of the
economy were met by the formal and informal credit channels, individual
firms had uneven access to credit with differences in bor-rowing costs
reflecting the multiplicity of lending rates and the highly segmented nature
of the credit system rather than risk differentials. Subsidized lending
rates, which were usually negative in real terms, generated excessive demand
for debt financing in preference to a strengthening of the corporate equity
base and encouraged investment in capital intensive projects. Increasing
concern arose as to the inflationary impact of excessive credit expansion
which led to some tightening of the Government's credit policies in 1980.
An equally serious weakness of the government controls oni credit allocation
was that financial institutions were denied any meaningful role in the
screening and selection of investment projects. The financial system was
therefore unable to provide adequate safeguards against faulty investment
decisions and over-investment in certain activities through its normal credit
evaluation function. These factors, coupled with the geaneral economic
recession, account for the current excess capacity in industry.
Financial Sector Reform
2.16      In recognition of these deficiencies, the Bank had raised the issue
of financial sector liberalization with the Korean Government as early as
the 1977 Basic Economic Report./l The Government's initial reaction to the
Bank's recommendation was mixed, as the established practice of centralized
governmental direction of economic activities had, until then, resulted in
phenomenal economic growth and development. The Report of the Bank's
Financial Sector Review, which was irLitiated in 1979, reiterated the call
for financial sector reform but the internal consensus for reform remained
weak as long as the Korean economy remained vibrant, and the need for reform
was not immediately apparent. With the advent of a new economic management
team and as the effects of past over-investment in highly subsidized
subsectors and of the economic recession began to manifest themselves in
1979-80, the Government adopted the view that the degree of centralization
of the economic decision-making process should be reducied through greater
reliance on market mechanisms. Accordingly, the Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1982-86) provides for greater decentralization of investment decisions in
the real sector and liberalization of the process of resource mobilization
and allocation in the financial sector.

2.17      The Government took the first: steps towards financial sector
liberalization in 1981 with the partial liberalization of short-term interest
rates on commercial paper. In the following year, the Government proceeded
with a radical simplification of the detailed regulations imposed on the
day-to-day operations of commercial banks and the sale to private investors
of government holdings in the share capital of four of the five largest
commercial banks. Further steps were taken in June 1982, with the simplifi-
cation of the lending rate structure, the removal of subsidized lending
rates on selective lending programs andl a widening of interest spreads for
financial intermediation. Progress made towards liberalization of the
financial system is significant and government commitment to proceed further
has been reiterated both in official declarations and in discussions with
the Bank. However, the reform process is expected to take several years to
complete as action will be required on a broad front to reform the policies
and practices of the past.  The Government also needs to move cautiously in
shifting from the interventionist approach of the past to a more liberal
system as both financial institutions and the real sectors will need time to
adjust to the new policy environment.
2.18      To advise the Government on financial liberalization, a Financial
Reform Commission was assembled in late 1981 at the initiative of the
Minister of Finance. This commission, which comprises representatives of
government agencies concerned with finance, officials of financial
institutions and academics, prepares technical recommendations on specific
subjects/measures submitted to it for study and comments. The Bank's sector
work program for Korea has also been formulated to provide extensive support
in this area. Financial sector missions visited Korea in late 1979 and in
June 1982. Their findings have been discussed with government authorities
and have provided a strong base for furthering the policy dialogue on
financial matters.
Financial Sector Issues
2.19      As part of the dialogue on financial sector issues, the Government
has provided the Bank with a "Letter of Development Policy for the Financial
Sector" dated April 14, 1983 (Annex 1, Attachment 1). In the Policy Letter,
the Government outlined the major elements of its financial sector reforms
and the steps it proposes to take in the coming years. The Letter reaffirms
the Government's commitment to liberalizing the financial system by allowing
market forces to play a greater role in determining interest rates and by
deregulating the activities of the various classes of financial institutions
so that they can compete more freely. The objective of the reform is: (a)
to improve resource allocation by decentralizing investment decisions so
that both financial institutions and entrepreneurs can respond more rapidly
to market forces; and (b) to enhance efficiency in intermediation as finan-
cial institutions are subjected to greater competition through simplified
procedures for entry of new institutions and less legislated specialization.



- 14 -
The Policy Letter, however, makes it clear that the financial system can be
liberalized only gradually, as precipitous action could destabilize both the
financial system and the corporate sector. The Letter idLentifies five main
issues which are at the core of the financial reform program and require
government action over the next two years and, possibly, beyond. They are:
(a) determination of interest rate level and structure; (b) liberalization
of commercial banks; (c) supervision of financial institutJions; (d) selective
credit schemes; and (e) corporate indebtedness.
Interest Rate Reform.
2.20      The shortcomings of the past system of government controlled rates
have been recognized; they included: (a) a multiplicity of selective subsi-
dized financ'ng programs imposed by the Government over time, each with
different lending terms and conditions and with little consistency between the
various programs, substantial overlaps and, usually, negative real lending
rates; (b) a weighted average lending rate which, because of the large
proportion of subsidized loans, barely exceeded the cost of' mobilizing
deposits thus giving the handling banks an interest margin which was
insufficient to cover administrative expenses and to ensure their financial
independence; and (c) a substantial differential between legislated lending
rates and market rates which led to excessive demand for credit at the lower
legislated rates and a continued growt'h of the securities and curb markets
where rates were substantially higher.
2.21       In June 1982, the Government took actions to alleviate some of the
problems associated with administered rates. The June measures lowered
deposit rates to 8% and lending rates to 10% for all commercial banking
institutions. These rates are positive given the present and projected
inflation rate of less than 5%. The reduction in interest rates was made
possible by the rapid decline in the rate of inflation and was mainly
intended to lower the borrowing costs on existing debt of the corporate
sector.  Other measures were taken at the same time to remove some of the
distortions mentioned above and to create conditions more favorable for the
eventual full liberalization of intere:st rates. First, theb interest
subsidies and the wide dispersion in rates associated with directed lending
programs were removed by adjusting their lending rate to 10% so that there
was a unified lending rate for all commercial bank loans. Second, the
interest margin between the deposit rate and the lending rate was raised to
2% thus increasing the longer term prospects for a profitable,
self-sustaining banking sector.
2.22      Outside the commercial banking sector, the interest rate ceilings
have been less binding and financial markets are increasingly able to
respond to market forces within certain government gui'delines.  Interest
rates on 90-180 day commercial paper haive been liberalized since June 1981
and were about 14% p.a. in late 1982-early 1983.  Simi'larly, the yields on



- 15 -
primary issues of corporate bonds and bank debentures reached about 13-15%,
very close to the secondary market rate of 15-16% p.a. The Government has
also allowed the development banks, including KDB and KLB, to lend most of
their longer-term domestic currency funds at effective rates of 15% to 16%
p.a. In effect, the interest rate reform of June 1982 has instituted a dual
structure of lending rates with the lower 10% p.a. administered interest rate
applying primarily to earlier outstanding debt which can be rolled over and
most new borrowings carrying market rates of interest of 14 to 16% p.a.
Although the 4-6% differential between administered and market rates which
prevailed in early 1983 was still high, this differential has narrowed in
recent months as market rates declined by approximately one percentage point
between November 1982 and February 1983. Similarly, curb market rates are
reported to have dropped sharply from the previous high of 2-3% per month to
1.5% per month, partly in response to less regulated rates for non-bank
financial instrumcnts and lower inflationary expectations.
2.23      In the Five-Year Plan, and in the Policy Letter addressed to the
Bank, the Government confirms its objective to liberalize interest rates
fully and to allow market mechanisms to play a more important role in
determining the level and structure of interest rates. However, the
Government understandably believes that full interest rate liberalization
should take place after inflationary expectations have subsided further in
response to the low inflation which has prevailed over the past year or so
and after the differential between administered and market rates of interest
has narrowed further. The Government considers that an abrupt shift to
fully liberalized interest rates before market rates have fallen further
might lead to a sharp increase in interest rates which could stall economic
recovery and have a destabilizing effect on the financial health of a still
highly indebted corporate sector. The Government has therefore committed
itself to a thus far highly successful effort to reduce the rate of
inflation and keep it below 5%, thus reducing inflationary expectations and
interest rates in the secondary markets. Once this has occurred, interest
rates can be liberalized with much less concern for possible destabilizing
effects.
2.24      In the meantime, there are two issues which the Government will
address: first, the differentiation of interest rates to take into account
risk and maturity; and second, the potentially negative impact on bank
profitability of the present system of variable lending rates combined with
fixed rate deposit contracts. The eventual liberalization of interest rates
is expected to allow market forces to provide for an appropriate differential
in rates based on risk and maturity preferences. As the time-frame for
complete liberalization of interest rates is somewhat uncertain (para. 2.23),
the Government is also studying some possible interim options which include
(a) changes in legislated interest rates which would allow the banks to
mobilize longer term deposits and to charge higher rates for longer term,
higher risk loans and (b) the introduction of new types of long-term savings



- 16 -
instruments such as bank debentures and negotiable certificates of deposits
whose yields would be closely related to secondary market rates and whose
proceeds could be loaned at rates which ensure a positive spread.  With
respect to the second issue, the system of variable lending rates has had the
effect of immediately lowering commercial bank income as loan rates were
rapidly reduced in 1981 and 1982 whiles the cost of deposit: resources could
only come down gradually because of the fixed interest rates on time and
savings deposits. The problem has become less severe, as earlier, more
costly deposits have matured. The Government, however, realizes that the
present system has caused serious financial difficulties for commercial
banks as interest rates declined rapidly and will study this matter further
to determine whether adjustments are desirable in current banking practices.
The Government will inform the Bank of the progress made in reviewing the
interest rate issues discussed in this paragraph .by the end of 1983 and
periodically thereafter.
Liberalization of Commercial Banks
2.25      As indicated above, the non-specialized commercial banking system
remains, to date, the most important segment within the Korean financial
system, accounting for about one-third of total assets. Along with the
government-owned specialized commercial banks, the nonr-specialized banks and
particularly the five nationwide "city banks," have played an important role
in administering the directed credit system which prevailed until recently
(para. 2.11 and 2.12). The privatization and liberalization of the institu-
tions operating under the Commercial Banking Act is therefore an essential
element in the Government-s program of- financial reform. That element,
however, should be considered in the context of the much broader objective
of improving efficiency and competitiveness in the financial sector as a
whole.  It is therefore the Government's intention to continue the process
of liberalization with non-specialized commercial banks and to review th,e
need for reforming the role and functions of the specialized banks and other
institutions.
2.26      The tools at the disposal of the Government to improve the
efficiency and competitiveness of financial institutions consist primarily
of: (a) the licensing of new institutions in both the banking and nonbanking
sectors; and (b) deregulation of the activities cf existing financial
institutions to reduce legislated specialization and excessive segmentation
of credit markets. Significant progress has already been achieved by the
Government and more is expected in the coming months.
2.27      As stated in the Government's Policy letter, the measures taken so
far to liberalize the operations of the banking sector have been concentrated
in four areas: the privatization of the "city banks" ownership; the deregula-
tion of many of their activities; a broadened scope of activities open to
commercial banks; and the licensing of new banks. Full ;privatization of the



- 17 -
five nationwide city banks was initiated in June 1981 and completed in March
1983 with the sale to private investors of the Government's remaining equity
holdings. Privatization is expected to have a beneficial impact on services
to customers and on overall efficiency by encouraging increased competition.
Legislation has also been enacted which limits the degree of ownership by
any private group. In parallel with the privatization, significant measures
have been taken to reduce the role of the Government in the management and
operation of the commercial banks. Specifically, controls have been elimin-
ated to give the banks much greater autonomy in matters related to personnel
management, organization and budgeting. Finally, commercial banks have been
authorized to undertake new activities as a means of increasing the range of
their services in competition with the non-banking sector and to improve
their earnings.  These new activities include the sale of short-term commer-
cial paper and of Government securities. Finally, the recent licensing of
two new banks as joint ventures with foreign interests is expected to
increase competition, reduce the potential for oligopolistic control in the
banking sector and foster greater efficiency in financial intermediation.
2.28      In the coming months, the Gov,ernment intends to pursue the process
of liberalization of commercial banks and to initiate steps for deregulating
the activities of specialized banks and non-bank financial institutions.
Commercial banks will be authorized to tap new sources of funds including
mutual savings and investment trusts while credit activities will be expanded
to cover credit card operations and factoring. Increased competition in the
banking sector will be pursued further by lessening restrictions on the
establishment of branches of regional banks and by broadening the scope of
activities of the specialized commercial banks and of the development banks.
With respect to the latter, the Financial Review Commission will consider in
1983 proposals prepared by KDB and KLB which would help diversify their
sources of funds and improve their competitiveness with commercial banks.
With respect to other non-bank institutions, the Government has already
taken steps to increase competition by licensing new short-term finance
companies and mutual savings finance companies. Adlditional measures are
being considered which would increase the range of activities open to
short-term finance companies and would allow the establishment of branches.
To provide additional security in a more competitive financial system, the
Government has passed legislation to establish a deposit insurance system
covering the deposit substitutes of non-bank intermediaries.
2.29      It is clear that government plans as outlined in the Policy
Letter go beyond the more immediate objective of liberalizing commercial
bank operations. Great emphasis is being placed on increasing competition
among various classes of financial institutions and on dismantling the
system of legislated specialization to reduce segmentation and inefficiency.
Supporting measures are also being enforced to increase the administrative
efficiency of financial institutions and improve the skills of their staff.
A critical element in improving administrative efficiency will be the
ability of banks to earn revenues sufficient to cover administrative costs



- 18 -
and make profits without being dependent on government subsidies. In this
respect, the Government's decision in June 1982 to increase to two percent-
age points the spread between deposit and lending rates should provide a
more satisfactory basis for improving commercial bank profitability.
Ultimately, interest rate liberalization and greater competition in the
financial system would create an environment where the banks could freely
determine spreads in relation to market: conditions. In the area of skills
development, Korean financial institutions, with government support, are
strengthening their training programs to enhance the capability of their
staff to operate in a new, more competitive environment. A component of the
proposed project is designed to support this program as it relates to
overseas training (para. 4.65).
Supervision of Financial Institutions
2.30      In the past, supervision of the financial institutions was shared
between the Superintendent of Banks (of the Central Bank), acting on behalf
of the Monetary Board, for non-specialized commercial banlks established
under the General Banking Act and the Ministry of Finance for all other
financial institutions. In line with Government's active involvement in
credit allocation, supervision consisted primarily of issujing detailed
directives, regulations, orders and instructions which governed the opera-
tions, management and administration of financial institutions. The system
relied mostly on prior authorization and approval of business operations.
Compliance was strictly enforced and supervised.
2.31      The new philosophy underlying the Government-s lprogram of financial
sector reform has brought with it a change in the approach to financial
supervision. As indicated in para. 2.27, important steps have been taken in
1981-82 to deregulate banking practices and simplify the cumbersome regulatory
apparatus. All regulations governing internal management such as personnel,
organization and budgeting were abolished and regulations of business
operations have been simplified. The system of financial supervision is also
moving from the past reliance on prior authorization by supervisory agencies
to ex-post monitoring of actual performance in relation to a simplified set of
guidelines. Implementation of the new system has already been initiated but
its full introduction requires staff training to develop new skills. Overseas
training of some Central Bank examiners is included in the training component
of the proposed project. In its Policy Letter to the Bank, the Government
also envisages the possibility of consolidating the supervisory activities of
the Central Bank and of the Ministry of Finance which would appear to be a
logical corollary to the deregulation of financial activities and the
increasing overlap of functions between different classes of institutions.
Directed Credit
2.32      A central objective in the program of financial sector reform is to
reduce the role of Government in credit allocation as greaLter efficiency can



- 19 -
be achieved by relying increasingly on market forces and on a more appro-
priate system of investment incentives. Directed lending programs along
with the operational guidelines imposed on banks have been the main tools of
government intervention in credit allocation (para. 2.14). In parallel with
the relaxation of the guidelines imposed on bank operations, the Government
has adopted measures described in the following paragraphs to reform the
system of directed credit.
2.33      Important steps have already been taken by the Government to
alleviate some of the problems of ongoing selective credit programs and to
phase out some of the marginal ones. T'he most important measure was the
removal in June 1982, of all interest rate subsidies on selective credit
programs by bringing their lending rate to the same level as the general
lending rate of 10%.  To date, short-term export credits and NIF remain the
two main instruments of directed lending with 8.6% and 9.3%, respectively, of
total private domestic credit at end-1982. The short-term export credit
program operates as a rediscounting winidow of the BOK available to all
commercial banks, specialized and non-specialized. Although that program
has been criticized for some of the difficulties it imposes on the Central
Bank's credit management policies, it is generally acknowledged as providing
fair access to credit for qualifying exporters. Little change seems
required in its modus operandi except perhaps for the interest margin
accruing to handling banks which appears excessive.   As indicated in the
Policy Letter, this matter is under review by the Government.
2.34      The operation of the NIF program, however, has several shortcom-
ings related primarily to the degree oE government intervention in credit
allocation and to its funding which is tantamount to a tax on the deposits
of commercial banks. Problems related to the first issue have been allevi-
ated since 1982 as the Government agreed to approve NIF allocations on a
sectoral basis rather than enterprise 'by enterprise. This is expected to
increase considerably the autonomy of handling banks in allocating NIF
funds. The Government has also agreed to transfer entirely the responsi-
bility for handling NIF to the specialized commercial banks and to KDB by
the end of 1984. This would be consistent with the recent measures taken to
privatize the non-specialized commercial banks and to reduce the degree of
government intervention in their operations. Moreover, the specialized
commercial banks and KDB are more qualified, at the present time, to handle
the appraisal of long-term equipment loan applications such as NIF. With
respect to the funding of NIF, minor changes are expected in the near
future. The Government has agreed in the Policy Letter, with the principle
of controlling more tightly the growth of the NIF program so that it
continues to decline as a proportion of total private domestic credit and,
in line with this reduction, the Government will adjust downward the 13%
contribution made by banks out of their deposit resources. The Policy
Letter also reiterates the Government's commitment to continue to operate
the remaining directed credit programs on a non-subsidized basis in the
future.



- 20 -
Corporate Indebtedness
2.35      Cash earnings of the corporate sector should improve substantially
in 1982-83 following the reductions in both the cost of borrowings and the
corporate income tax.  These higher earnings coupled with some improvement
in the strength of the economy should provide the corporate sector with
resources sufficient to improve further the debt/equity struicture. To this
end, the Government must provide incentives for building up equity positions
and disincentives to acquiring new debt.
2.36      The elimination of interest rate subsidies on selective lending
programs is expected to be a key factor in discouraging excessive indebted-
ness in the future. With respect to strengthening corporate equity, the
Government has outlined in the Policy Letter the measures which have been
adopted to encourage retained earnings. These measures include the exemption
from personal income tax of compulsory legal reserves and alleviation of the
tax on assumed dividends for closed corporations. Other measures are being
considered to encourage the investment of long-term contractual savings in the
capital market. Higher corporate profits are also expected to improve market
values in the stock market and to encourage new stock issues. Finally, the
Government is determined to encourage bianks to foreclose loans made to
companies which remain chronically insolvent and whose future prospects are
doubtful.
Monitoring the Reform Process
2.37      The Bank has been monitoring ithe progress made by the Government
in its program of financial sector reform since the first measures were
adopted in 1981 (paras. 2.22 and 2.27). The monitoring of further progress
towards liberalization will be carried out :'hrough regular supervision of
the proposed project. Particular attention will be given to ensuring:
(a)  that the improvements thus far achieved through recent reforms
(i.e., positive real interest rates, adequate lending spread,
reduced augmentation of lending rates) are maintained; and
(b) that further progress towards liberalization is achieved over the
period 1983-85.
With regard to (b) above, the performance criteria reviewed by the Bank during
project implementation will include: (a)l continued pursuit by the government
of macro-policies which are instrumental in further lowering market rates of
interest such that the differential between legislated and market rates is
narrowed; (b) reduction in legislated specialization of financial institutions
by encouraging expansion in the range of activities undertaken by different
categories of financial institutions; (c) licensing of new financial institu-
tions, (d) introduction of new supervision procedures consistent with a
liberalized financial system; (e) reduction in the role of directed credit
by decreasing the share of NIF in total credit, removing its administration
from private commercial banks and lowering their contribut:Lon to its
funding; and (f) adopting incentives to encourage a broader capitalization
of the corporate sector. Further details on specific measures to be taken
over the period 1983-85 are available irL Annex 1, Table 4.

3. THE BANK'S INDUSTRIAL LENDING STRATEGY
3.01      Past Operations.  Historically, the Bank's industrial lending
strategy has been principally aimed at strengthening selected financial
intermediaries responsible for lending long-term resources, including those
from the Bank, to industry./l This type of lending was initiated in 1968 when
the Bank Group supported the establishment of the Korea Development Finance
Corporation (KDFC), which later became the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLB).
Later, the Bank established a solid relationship with three other develop-
ment institutions: the Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the Small- and
Mediumr-Industry Bank (SMIB) in 1975, and the Citizens National Bank (CNB) in
1980. The Bank has helped meet the financial needs of medium to large-scale
firms through its loans to KDB and KLB, and of smaller firms through loans
to SMIB and CNB. To date, the Bank has lent $1,027.5 million to the indus-
trial sector through these institutions./2 In general, project implementa-
tion has been excellent. Project Completion Reports (PCRs) for Loans 735-KO,
905-KO and 1145-KO to KLB, for Loan 1095-KO to KDB, and for Loan 1175-KO to
SMIB concluded that in all cases, the Bank s twin objectives of resource
transfer and institution building were achieved satisfactorily with rapid
institutional improvements ensuring the allocation of Bank resources to
industrial projects yielding substantial financial and economic benefits.
The PCRs also emphasized that these Bank loans were supportive of the
Governments priorities in the industrial sector. The Project Performance
Audit Reports (PPARs) for Loans 735-KO, 905-KO and 1145-KO /3 and for Loan
No. 1095-KO /4 supported the PCRs  conclusions and praised the high standard
of KDB and KLB's operations as well as their developmental record,
particularly in helping deepen the institutional base of the financial
sector.
3.02      The primary objectives of Bank loans to the Korean development
finance institutions have been: (a) transfer of foreign exchange resources
needed to strengthen industrial investment; (b) improvement in the institu-
tional efficiency of financial intermediaries; and (c) support of the indus-
trial investment priorities of the Government viz. export promotion, regional
development, employment generation and skill development. In the 1980s,
greater emphasis will be given to the overall policy environment for
industry and finance.
/1  Two exceptions are the Korea Machinery Loan (Loan 1466-KO) and the
Electronics Development Project (Loan 1676-KO).
/2 Eight Bank loans for $410 million has been made to KLB; four loans for
$352.5 million have gone to KDB; SMIB has received four loans totaling
$205 million; and two loans have been made to CNB for $60 million.

3.03      Lending Strategy in the 1980s.  The Bank's lending strategy in
the industrial sector has three main dimensions: (a) Structural Adjustment
Loans (SAL) which are heavily focussed on the industrial sector, giving
particular attention to trade and incentive policies (para. 1.15); (b) Indus-
trial Finance Projects which are increasingly focussed oni broader financial
policies; and (c) subsector projects wrhich aim at restructuring specific
industrial activities and at developing the country's technological
capabilities. Recent loans to the Korea Institute of Electronics Technology
(KIET),/l the Korea Technology Development Corporation (KTDC),/2 and the
Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC)/3 were all designed
to finance the transfer of technology and upgrade skills so that Korean
industry would remain competitive in international markets as its comparative
advantage shifts from labor intensive to more technology intensive indus-
tries.  A further loan to KTDC is planned for FY85.  A small industry
operation is also planned for FY85 which, in addition to providing credit to
CNB and SMIB, would support the consolidation of technical assistance
services by SMIPC.
3.04      The greater focus on financial sector policies in the Bank's
Industrial Finance Projects is made possible by the fact that the Korean
development finance institutions, to which the Bank has ]Lent, have become more
mature and now require relatively less institutional assistance from the Bank
than in the past. Starting with its latest loans to KDB /4 and KLB,/5 the
Bank has used the DFC lending approach to serve as a springboard for reaching
objectives broader than resource transfer and institution building. The
policy content of the previous lending operations to KDB and KLB was articu-
lated in the form of a program of policy measures and surveys which the
Government agreed to undertake over the period 1981-82. The Industrial
Finance Project outlined in the present report,, would support a program of
further financial sector reforms which builds upon the progress already
achieved through the 1980 operation. The policy reforms are described in
Chapter 2 of this report and in the Government's "Letter of Development
Policy for the Financial Sector" (Annex 1, Attachment 1). The next
Industrial Finance Project is likely to be broader in its scope as it might
include the participation of commercial banks following their privatization
and the strengthening of their staff capabilities in term Lending.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
4.01      The proposed project reflects the Banks new approach to indus-
trial lending in Korea. First it aims to support the ultimate objective of
financial liberalization and provides technical assistance in the implemenr-
tation of these reforms. Secona, it provides financing for high priority
projects in the industrial sector. The proposed project would have three
objectives:  (a) to help support the Government's financial sector policy
reform, particularly the specific measures and objectives which the
Government intends to implement or achieve over the two-year period 1983-85;
(b) to support high priority industrial investments through a credit compo-
nent by financing part of the foreign exchange requirements of KDB and KLB
in an amount of $130 million and $120 million, respectively; and (c) to
strengthen the financial system through a technical assistance component of
$5 million, of which $2.5 million would cover the foreign exchange require-
ments of an overseas training program geared to meeting the needs of finan-
cial supervisory agencies and of selected financial institutions, and
another $2.5 million would cover part of the costs of consultants to help in
establishing a system for computerizing data on financial transactions as a
basis for improving credit information and tax collection.
4.02      The following sections B and C summarize the characteristics of
the two financial institutions, KDB and IKLB, eligible for participation in
the credit component. Section D describes the technical assistance
component. A more detailed review of the institutional, operational and
financial aspects of KDB and KLB is available from the project file.
B. The Korea Development Bank
4.03      The main issue currently facing KDB is that of its future role in
a liberalized economic environment and financial system. As a government-
owned development bank it has tended, in the past, to rely extensively on
government funding /1 and to function both as a development bank appraising
and financing projects, and as the agency of government funded programs,
allocating funds to projects identified by the Government as having high
/1 Although foreign commercial borrowings have become a very important source
of funds for KDB since the late seventies, they reflect not only KDB's
own creditworthiness but also the implicit guarantee of the Korean
Government.



- 24 -
priority. However, the Government's F:Lfth Plan is based on a new approach
to economic management which aims at reducing both government intervention
in private economic activities and the share of preferential credits pro-
vided by the Government for which KDB is the principal agent. Retrenchment
of KDB's activities to operating exclusively as a government agent for
preferential credit would mean a decline in KDB's importance in the finan-
cial system and a loss of its clientelie to private sector financial insti-
tutions. Another option has been studLed by KDB which would: diversify its
sources of funds, particularly domestic currency resources, primarily
through acceptance of deposits; increase its competitiveness with other
institutions, including banks; and, more generally, give a greater commer-
cial orientation to its activities, including a greater concern for
profitability. The Bank has indicated to KDB and to the Government that it
would support a greater commercialization of KDB's operations as this could
provide additional momentum to the ongoing liberalization cf the financial
sector. Deregulation of KDB's operations would further reduce segmentation
in credit markets and would increase competition among financial intermedi-
aries. It would, however, be necessary to ensure that KDB competes fairly
with other financial institutions by removing some of the tax and other
privileges granted to KDB by the Government.
4.04      A task force has been assembLed within KDB to review its future
role and has issued a draft report to the MOF which encompasses the proposed
changes discussed above. The Bank has discussed with KDB its future role,
and will be further consulted prior to the introduction of any major
institutional changes.
KDB's Role in the Industrial and Financial Sectors
4.05      KDB was established in 1954 as a government-owned development bank.
It continues to operate primarily as the financing arm of the Government's
industrial investment policies. All the Government's major selective
lending schemes for industry are, at leaast in part, being administered by
KDB /1 with the exception of the short--term export credit program. In
addition to supporting industry, KDB iis called upon to finance major projects
/1 The National Investment Fund (NIF), the Tourist Development Fund,
the Energy Rationalization Fund, t]he Industrial Rationalization Fund,
the Shipping Promotion Fund, the Slpecial Industry Supporting Funds and
the Electronic Industry Promotion Fund.



-25 -
in the transportation and power sectors./l Only large-scale /2 enterprises
are eligible for financial assistance from KDB. KDB's financing, however,
is not confined to public sector projects; loans to the private sector have
increased as a share of KDB's outstanding loan portfolio from 38% at
end-1975 to 64.1% as of December 31, 1982. A major proportion of KDB's
lending to the private sector is absorbed by large industries involved in
priority activities encouraged by the Government.
4.06      As of year-end 1981, KDB was the single largest financial institu-
tion in Korea with total assets of W5.1 trillion (US$7.5 billion), or 8.3%
of the total assets of the financial sector. KDB is also the largest source
of term finance for industry with 13.1% of all loans outstanding to the
manufacturing sector as of December 31, 1981, and 18.6% of total long-term
equipment loans.
Institutional Aspects
4.07      Legal Framework and Ownership.  KDB was established in 1954 under
a special legislative act which governs its operations, policies, adminis-
tration and capitalization. The KDB Act was last amended in December 1981
to increase its authorized share capitaL to W 1 trillion ($1.3 billion).
4.08      Organization, Management and Staffing.  In addition to the Head
Office and 11 local branch offices outslde Seoul, KDB has 7 representative
offices and 2 subsidiaries in the major overseas financial centers to assist
in foreign currency resource mobilization (Annex 2, Chart 1). As of
December 31, 1982, KDB's total staff amounted to 1,993, of which 32% were
professional staff. The quality of KDB's senior and middle-level management
and staff is good.  While broad lending guidelines are established under KDB's
Policy Statement (Annex 2, Attachment 1), day-to-day operating policies are
determined by KDB's Board of Directors consisting of the Governor, Deputy
Governor and seven Executive Directors (Annex 2, Table 1). Mr. Chang Nak Choi
was appointed Governor of KDB in 1982 and has provided a major impetus to
KDB's search for alternatives in its future strategy.
4.09      Project Appraisal and Supervision.  The comprehensiveness with
which KDB appraises projects varies significantly depending on the source of
funding and the nature of the project under review. For projects funded
/1 At end-1982, the non-manufacturing sector accounted for 50.8% of KDB's
outstanding portfolio.
/2 I.e., enterprises employing more than 300 persons and with total assets
exceeding W 500 million. Smaller enterprises (employing less than 300
persons or with assets lower than W 500 million) receive financial
assistance from the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) or from the
Citizens National Bank (CNB) when employment is under 100 persons. Both
institutions are government-owned.



- 26 -
with official foreign exchange resources, KDB carries out a satisfactory
appraisal and undertakes FRR and ERR analyses for all projects in excess of
$750,000. For projects funded out of government resources or under selec-
tive lending schemes, the appraisal undertaken by KDB is Less thorough and
might occasionally be limited to a review of the feasibility study under-
taken by another agency. KDB does not have an independent unit to supervise
projects; project officers are in charge of both project: appraisal and
supervision. Clients are required to prepare quarterly operational reports
for KDB and to provide audited financial statements for the purpose of
project supervision. Overall, KDB-s appraisal and supervision standards are
good.
4.10      Procurement and Disbursement.  KDB's procurement procedures are
satisfactory and ensure a reasonable degree of competitiLon. Essentially
three procurement procedures are utilized: internationa]L competitive bidding
(ICB) for contracts equal to or exceeding $1 million; limited competitive
bidding when procurement is less than $1 million; and proprietary contracts
in qualifying cases. Under the latest Bank loan (Loan 1933-KO), ICB
accounted for 38% of total procurement contracts, limited competitive
bidding for 15% and proprietary contracts for 47%. KDB"s disbursement
procedures ensure that funds are made available in accordance with progress
in project implementation and are supported with proper documentation.
Resource Allocation
4.11      Scope, Volume and Characteristics of Operations.  KDB's operations
for the period 1978-82 are summarized below:

4.12      Lending Operations.  The volume of KDB's total loan commitments
increased sharply at an average annual rate of 49% over the period 1978-80,
fell by 2% in 1981, owing to the economic recession, but increased by 24% in
1982. Foreign currency loan commitments declined to about 15% of total loan
commitments in 1980-82 compared to about 21% in 1978-79 reflecting the
decreasing attractiveness of foreign currency borrowings as domestic lending
rates were lowered by the Government. Foreign currency loan commitments
actually declined by 16% in 1981 compared to 1980. Working capital loans
increased dramatically as a proportion of total domestic currency loans from
about 20% in 1978-79 to around 40% for 1980-82, reflecting the tight liquid-
ity situation of the corporate sector (Annex 2, Table 2). While equipment
loans have declined in relative importance, their average maturity has
remained relatively constant. For the period 1978-81 about 15% of all loans
had a maturity of over 10 years with a weighted average maturity of about
8.3 years for equipment loans. KDB's outstanding loan portfolio as of
year-end 1982 amounted to W 4.7 trillion, or $6.3 billion (Annex 2, Table 3).



-28 -
4.13      The sectoral allocation of loan commitments has remained largely
unchanged with the manufacturing sector accounting for about 57% in 1979-82.
Within manufacturing, capital goods industries are the most significant with
about 33% of 1982 loan commitments (Annex 2, Table 4).
4.14      Investment Operations.  As of December 31, 1982, KDB's outstanding
investment portfolio amounted to W 641 billion ($855 miLlion). Equity
investments accounted for 76% of the total portfolio as against 91% at
end-1978; bonds and debentures accounted for the balance (Annex 2, Table 5).
About 66% of KDB's equity holdings were invested in public sector companies
which provided KDB with very low returns (Annex 2, Table 6). The bond and
debenture portfolio has grown at an average rate of over 55% p.a. for the
period 1978-82 and has become substantially more profitable than the equity
portfolio.
4.15      Guarantee Operations.  As of December 31, 1982, KDB's outstanding
guarantee portfolio amounted to W 4.1 trillion ($5.5 biL:Lion) compared to an
outstanding loan portfolio of W 4.7 trillion ($6.3 billion). About 93% of
all outstanding guarantees were in foreign currency (Annex 2, Tables 7-8).
4.16      Directed Lending.  While mcst of KDB's loan operations can be
considered as directed by the Government, the extent of the direction in
resource allocation varies significan.tly depending on the source of funding.
For conceptual purposes, KDB's loan operations can be classified into three
categories.  First, KDB is used by the Government as a conduit to channel
budgetary appropriations to pre-identified public sector entities such as
the Korea Electric Company, Korea National Railroads and the Pohang Iron and
Steel Company. In the administration of these resources, KDB acts merely as
a conduit, undertaking no formal appraisal. This type of lending accounted
for about 13% of KDB's outstanding loans in 1981. Second, KDB administers a
number of selective lending schemes for the promotion oE specific industrial
subsectors./l Until recently, the degree of government intervention was
quite high in the allocation of resources to specific enterprises eligible
under the selective lending programs. Procedures for resource allocation
have been reassessed by the Government in the context of its financial
sector reforms with a view to giving a greater role to financial interme-
diaries, including KDB, in determining the eligibility of individual
companies within broad sectoral guidelines (para. 2.34). Special lending
programs administered by KDB accounted for 38% of total 'Loans over the
period 1978-81. The third category, representing about 50% of total loans,
consists of funds mobilized directly by KDB (i.e., deposits, debentures and
foreign borrowings) which are allocated more independently, within the
guidelines of the KDB Act. In aggregate, the proportion of KDB's loan
portfolio financed from government resources has decreased from 57% in 1978
to about 50% in 1981. The degree of direct government intervention in KDB's
resource allocation has declined proportionately (Annex 2, Table 9).
/1 KDB currently administers six such schemes of which the most important is
NIF.

Developmental Impact of KDB's Operations
4.17       Economic Impact of KDB's Lending.  In 1981, KDB approved 763 proj-
ects with a total cost of W 2.9 trillion (US$3.9 billion); these investments
are expected to generate an incremental annual output of W 4.9 trillion
(US$6.5 billion) and incremental annual value-added of W 873 billion
(US$1.2 billion). Expected incremental annual exports for these projects
totalled W 2.7 trillion (US$3.6 billion), about 55% of sales. The
incremental annual employment resulting from KDB's lending activities has
ranged from 71,000 in 1977 to 106,000 in 1981; the cost per job created
averaged $40,800 in 1981 (Annex 2, Table 10).
4.18       Utilization of Bank Loans No. 1574-KO and 1933-KO.  KDB has
received four loans from the Bank since 1975. Utilization of Bank resources
has been satisfactory from both a financial and developmental viewpoint.
As of year-end 1982, KDB had completed disbursement under Loan 1574-KO and
had disbursed $83 million under Loan 1933-KO. KDB financed 56 subprojects
under the third Bank Loan (1574-KO) for a total project cost of $411.3
million, 41.8% of which was financed by KDB. Subloans ranged in size from
$218,000 to $25.9 million. The projects are expected to generate about
$205 million in incremental annual exports and to employ 6,381 people at a
cost per job of $64,500. The weighted average ex ante FRR and ERR reached
22.3% and 29.8%, respectively. Details of the individual subprojects
financed under this loan are provided in Annex 2, Table 11.
4.19       As of year-end 1982, KDB had committed all but $2.0 million of the
latest IBRD Loan (No. 1933-KO) of $100 million; cumulative disbursements
amounted to $81.0 million. Thus far, 55 subprojects have been approved with
subloan sizes ranging from $110,000 to $19.1 million. The total project
cost of the subprojects amounted to $480.3 million, of whichKDB financed
$284.1 million or 59.1%. These projects would generate about $174.5 million
in incremental annual exports and employ 11,017 people at an estimated cost
per job of about $43,600. Weighted by project cost, the average ex ante FRR
and ERR reached 21.4% and 41.1%, respectively. Details of the individual
subprojects financed under the loan are provided in Annex 2, Table 12.
FiLaancial Condition and Performance
4.20       Financial Condition.  KDB's assets have grown at an average annual
rate of 31% over the period 1978-82 and amounted to W 5.9 trillion
($7.9 billion) as of December 31, 1982 (Annex 2, Table 13). As of December
1982, the current ratio stood at a satisfactory 1.5:1 as against 1.3:1 in
1978; the long-term debt-equity ratio of 8.0:1 was well within the contrac-
tual limit of 10:1 agreed with the Bank. KDB-s debt service cover ratio
declined from 1.4 in 1978 to a low of 1.0 in 1981 owing primarily to the
reduction of KDB's spread on lending operations. Significant improvement
occurred in 1982, however, as the debt service cover ratio recovered to 1.3.



- 30 -
4.21      Financial Performance.  KDB s profitability defined as net profit
to total assets, declined sharply from a satisfactory level of 1.8% in 1978
to 1.2% in 1980, 0.88% in 1981 and 0.3% for 1982 (Annex 2, Table 16). KDB's
gross operating spread narrowed from 3.65% of average total assets in 1978
to 1.8% in 1981, with a further decline to 1% in 1982. Until 1981, both
financial expenses and gross income increased as a percentage of average
total assets, but the growth in financial expenses was more rapid and lend-
ing spreads declined. In 1982, the upwqard trend was reversed with both
financial expenses and earnings declining as a percentage of assets. How-
ever, financial expenses declined less rapidly, thus further eroding
interest spreads. The reduction in KDI3's lending margins was particularly
significant for the funds lent from the proceeds of foreign commercial
borrowings converted into domestic currency (Annex 2, Table 17).
4.22      Spread on Foreign Commercial Borrowings.  Since the mid-seventies,
KDB has converted part of its foreign commercial borrowings; into domestic
currency in order to meet the demand for domestic currency financing which
exceeded available resources.  The lending rate applicable to converted
foreign funds is variable/i and is determined on a quarterly basis by
adding a 2% spread to the weighted average borrowing cost to KDB. Although
KDB requires that borrowers bear the foreign exchange risk, there was, until
recently, considerable demand for converted funds as their effective
borrowing cost, inclusive of a foreign exchange risk of about 6% p.a. was
less than the long-term interest rate on domestic currency loans./2 Suc-
cessive reductions in the domestic currency lending rate over the period
1980-82 have gradually eroded and eventually reversed the cost advantage of
converted foreign commercial funds over domestic currency loans. The 8-9%
differential which prevailed in 1980 was wiped out by year-end 1981 as the
nominal lending rate on converted funds was aligned on the domestic currency
rate with no allowance to cover potential foreign exchange losses.  The
situation further deteriorated in 1982 as the reduction to 10% in domestic
currency lending rates coincided with an increase in the weighted average
cost of KDBs converted funds from 13.84% in early 1982 to 14.84% in late
1982. To maintain some degree of competitiveness, KDB reduced its margin
from 2% in early 1982 to 0.157% in September 1982, a level clearly insuffi-
cient to cover administrative expenses.. Despite this adjustment, the
lending rate on converted funds was 15% In late 1982, compared to the
commercial bank lending rate of 10%. The recent lowering cf international
interest rates has brought down the weighted average cost of KDB's foreign
commercial borrowings to 12.67%, thus enabling KDB to reduce its onlending
rate in January 1983 to 14.2% for a nominal spread of 1.539% and an
effective spread
/1  Most foreign commercial borrowings are pegged to the six-month LIBOR rate.
/2  For example, in late 1980 the interest rate on domestic currency equip-
ment loans ranged from 20% to 23% while the interest rate on converted
loans ranged from 12% to 14.5%.



- 31 -
of 2.89%. At year-end 1982, KDB's effective lending rate of 15.56% was in
line with prevailing market rates, although substantially higher than the
10% bank rate.
4.23      In early 1983, KDB had an effective spread of 2.89% on converted
funds and 1.25% on otheir nonconverted foreign commercial borrowings
(para.4.30). The weighted average spread on foreign commercial funds of
2.36% appears to be sufficient to improve KDB's profitability. To ensure
that KDB continues to earn an adequate spread on its foreign commercial
resources,/l KDB agreed at negotiations to maintain a weighted average
effective spread of at least 2% on its lending operations out of foreign
commercial resources.
4.24      Quality of Portfolio.  Despite government intervention in its
lending operations, KDB has been generally able to select creditworthy
borrowers and has maintained a sound portfolio. Although satisfactory,
KDB's portfolio deteriorated in the period 1979-81, as the economic reces-
sion reduced corporate profitability and tightened liquidity. Arrears of
principal and interest increased from 0.3% of the outstanding portfolio in
1978, to 0.6% in 1979-80 and 0.5% in 1981. The arrears position improved
substantially in 1982 with total arrears amounting to only 0.2% of the
outstanding portfolio. Principal affected by arrears amounted to 1.2% of
total principal outstanding in 1982, compared to 5.8% in 1979, 5.3% in 1980
and 4.3% in 1981. In aggregate, arrears, reschedulings, foreclosures and
write-offs affected only 7.0% of the year-end 1982 portfolio compared to
10.1% and 11.0% in 1980 and 1981, respectively. KDB's collection
performance has been excellent; the collection rate for 1982 was 99.3%
compared to about 97% for the period 1979-81 (Annex 2, Table 18 and 19).
4.25      The system of directed/subsidized lending, however, has had a
negative impact on KDB's exposure in individual firms. Although KDB's
normal lendilng policy restricts its financial assistance to a maximum of
either 25% of its own equity or 65% of the total assets of a borrower, over
50% /2 of its aggregate loan, investment and guarantee portfolio exceeded
these limits in 1980-81. However, a system of guarantees and counter-
guarantees granted by the Government significantly reduces the potential
financial risks to KDB of such overexposure, such that as of December 31,
1982, only 9 firms representing 28% of KDB's aggregate portfolio, excluding
the portion covered by government guaraLntees, exceeded these limits. The
Government's effective encouragement of debt financing has also resulted in
some firms operating with excessive debt/equity ratios. Highly geared firms

required.
/2 56% in 1980 and 51% in 1981.



- 32 -
have found it difficult to meet their debt-service obligations in recent
times when profitability declined and borrowing costs were high. The number
of KDB clients with negative equity has risen from 7.1% in 1979 to 10.7% in
1981. Although re-evaluation of assets would substantially alter the
picture, the excessive reliance on debt financing is worrisome. To help
improve the financial structure of its subborrowers, KDB would continue its
present policy of encouraging project sponsors to increase their equity
contribution to project financing. To this end, KDB would, under the
proposed Bank loan, require that project sponsors contribute equity financing
sufficient to achieve a maximum 4.5:1 debt/equity ratio, including the
proposed sub-loan./l
4.26      Audit.  KDB's accounts for 1.981 have been audited in keeping with
international standards by San Kyong and Company, a firm associated with
Touche Ross International. KDB's accounts were certifieid without qualifi-
cation and the auditors stated that in their judgement, the level of
provisions set aside by KDB was adequate.
Resource Mobilization
4.27      As of December 31, 1982, KDI's total resources amounted to
W 5.6 trillion ($7.5 billion) of which 65% had been mobilized in domestic
currency and 35% in foreign currency (Annex 2, Table 20). On the asset
side, the currency mix of KDB-s loan and investment portfolio outstanding
was 85% in domestic currency and 15% in foreign currency. The significantly
greater share of domestic currency operations relative to resources mobil-
ized reflected the greater demand for domestic currency resources. The
difference is equivalent to $1.61 billion of which $1.46 billion represents
KDB's foreign exchange resources converted into domestic currency./2 As of
December 31, 1982, 19% of KDB's outstanding domestic currency loan portfolio
had been funded from converted foreign exchange resources.
4.28      Domestic Currency.  During the 1975-82 period, a net total of
W 4.8 trillion was mobilized by KDB, of which 61.6% was in domestic
currency./3 KDB-s principal source of domestic currency funds consisted
of budgetary allocations and borrowings under special financing schemes
which together represented 69% of the net increase in KDB's domestic
currency resources outstanding. Government contributions to KDB's equity
together with a relatively modest increase in reserves represented 14% of
the net increase in domestic resources. Including its equity, KDB-s aggre-
gate dependence on government funding amounted to 83% of total domestic

currency resources/I over the period 1975-82. Domestic currency resources
mobilized independently by KDB comprising deposits and industrial finance
debentures accounted for about 17% of the increase in KDB's domestic
currency resources (Annex 2, Table 21).
4.29      Direct mobilization of domestic financial savings by KDB (i.e.,
deposits and debentures) grew rapidly in 1980 reaching nearly 22% of
incremental domestic currency resources. However, this source of funding
declined to 11.3% during 1981, and, only 2.9% for the first nine months of
1982. This decline was largely due to the sluggish sale of KDB's industrial
finance debentures (IFDs) in the domestic market as yields were gradually
lowered and uncertainties prevailed about the Government's future interest
rate policy (Annex 2, Table 22). Sales of debentures during the last
quarter of 1982 increased substantially as investors' inflationary expecta-
tions fell, so that for 1982, direct mobilization of financial savings
accounted for a high 29.9% of incremental domestic currency resources. At
end-1982, domestic debentures outstanding accounted for about 18% of KDB's
long-term domestic currency resources outstanding. The fluctuations
experienced in debenture sales reflect some of the constraints faced by KDB
in relying on the debenture market for its domestic currency financing.
First, the fixed interest rate offered on KDB's debentures /2 can make the
selling of these instruments difficult during periods when inflationary
expectations are rising. Second, KDB has, in the past, used the proceeds
from its debenture issues to make loans at variable interest rates or to
purchase corporate debentures at fixed interest rates. For loans funded
with debenture proceeds, KDB has been incurring negative spreads when
interest rates declined. For example, during the last quarter of 1982, KDB
was issuing new debentures at an effective rate of 11.98% to 14.62%, but
the weighted average cost of outstanding debentures, including earlier
issues, was 17.6% due to the relatively high fixed interest cost of
debenture issues in 1980-81. However, loans made with debenture proceeds
carried interest rates of only 10% p.a. following the June 1982 interest
rate changes. The negative spread incurred on these loans has had an
adverse impact on KDB's profitability and has encouraged KDB to place an
increasing part of its debenture resources in the corporate bond market to
improve earnings. Finally, KDB's flexibility in issuing debentures is
impaired by the requirement that issues be approved by Parliament as a quid
pro quo for the government guarantees backing KDB's debentures.  This
requirement is now obsolete as KDB's credit standing in financial markets
is sufficiently established not to requtire further government guarantees.
KDB's performance in mobilizing domestic currency resources has been limited
/1  51.4% of total domestic and foreign resources.
/2 In 1982, KDB has issued, for the first time, floating rate coupon IFDs
with a 3 year maturity (about W 3 billion). The interest paid is fixed
in the first year and is computed at 1.3 times the prevailing one year
deposit rate for the second and third years.



- 34 -
and the degree of dependence on govermnent funding remains very high. As long
as the prospects for substantially increasing its direct mobilization of
domestic resources (including deposits) are limited, KDB will need to convert
some of its foreign commercial borrowings into domestic resources.
4.30      Foreign Currency.  With respect to the mobilization of foreign
currency resources, KDB's performance has been outstanding. Broadly speaking,
KDB mobilizes two types of foreign currency resources. The first type is
commercial funds, comprising syndicated commercial borrowings and private or
public placements of foreign currency dlebentures (Annex 2, Table 23). The
former carry a variable interest rate Linked to LIBOR while the debentures
have carried a fixed interest rate. The second type is foreign official
borrowings, principally from IBRD and ADB (Annex 2, Table 24). Next to
government funds, syndicated commercia:L borrowings have become the second
largest source of funding for KDB. KDI1's total annual borrowings have
increased from $25 million in 1970 to $847 million in 1980 followed by a
decline to $630 million in 1981 and $466.7 million in 1982. The substantial
decline in KDB's foreign commercial borrowings over the period 1981-82 was due
to the increasing tightness of international markets. By end-1982,
outstanding foreign commercial borrowings amounted to about $2.3 billion
including $249 million in foreign currency debentures. As indicated above
(para. 4.27) approximately 63% of these funds have been converted into
domestic currency and used to supplement KDB's domestic currency resources.
The difficulties faced by KDB in lending converted foreign commercial funds
have been outlined in paras. 4.22-4.23. KDB has also been obliged to lower
its spread on foreign commercial funds onlent in foreign currency to maintain
its competitiveness with foreign commercial banks operating in Korea. KDB-s
nominal interest spread on these funds has decreased from 1% in 1980 to 0.56%
in early 1983 which provides KDB with an effective spread of 1.25%./1 This
spread is adequate to cover administrat:ive costs.
4.31      KDB's success in mobilizing f-oreign commercial borrowings has
allowed a gradual reduction in its reliance on foreign official funds from
about 46% of total foreign borrowings in 1966-77 to 9.3% for the period
1978-82.  Foreign official funds carry a longer maturity than foreign
commercial borrowings and are therefore utilized by KDB primarily to finance
long gestation projects. While the weighted average maturity of its equip-
ment loans still exceeds 8 years, in the past two years the maximum maturity
of KDB's commercial borrowings has declined to 7-8 years as compared to the
10-year maturity of earlier borrowings. For this reason, KDB's reliance on
foreign official borrowings is expecteed to continue, albeit at a lower
relative level.
Operational Projections and Resource Retquirements
4.32      Historically, the volume of KDB's lending operations has been
limited by the availability of funds rather than loan demand. This situation
/1 Assuming a LIBOR rate of 9.0%.



- 35 -
has changed significantly in recent months as industrial investment was
sluggish and the cost of KDB's domestic currency lending rose above that of
the commercial banks. Both constraints, however, are expected to be tem-
porary and consequently, KDB's operational projections for the period
1983-86 have been primarily based on expected resource availability (Annex
2, Table 25). KDB expects its loan approvals to increase by 10% in 1983 and
by an average of 17% p.a. for the period 1983-86./i Compared to the
historical growth rate of loan approvals of about 20% p.a. over the period
1978-81, these projections appear appropriate. The slower growth in the
volume of loan operations results from the tight budgetary situation of the
Government which is expected to have a direct impact on the funding of the
special financing schemes administered by KDB. Loan demand by some of KDB's
major clients might also decline as their ability to borrow directly from
the domestic and international capital markets increases. Foreign currency
loans are projected to account for around 19% of total commitments compared
to about 16% over the period 1980-82.
4.33      As of December 31, 1982, KDB had total uncommitted long-term
resources amounting to W 588.8 billion ($785 million) compared to projected
loan commitments of about W 1,729 billiLon ($2.3 billion) in 1983, or nearly
three times the size of the resources available for commitment. To meet its
projected commitments, KDB plans to borrow approximately W 9,488 billion
($12.6 billion) between 1983-86 (Annex 2, Table 26). Domestic currency
resources, comprising government funds and domestic debentures, would amount
to 71% of total resources mobilized between 1983-86, as against 61% for the
period 1976-82. This would be closer to the currency mix of KDB's lending
operations and would reduce the need to rely on conversion of foreign
commercial funds to support domestic currency lending operations. But these
projections are based on the optimistic assumption that KDB will be able to
derive as much as 37% of its long-term domestic currency resources from
sales of debentures in the period 1983--86 compared to 21% since 1981-82.
Government funding, including budgetary allocations, equity contributions,
and NIF, would remain the principal source of domestic resources with
approximately 63% of total domestic resources compared to 95% in 1981-82.
Foreign currency borrowings are projected to reach $3.2 billion over the
period 1983-86 with 16.7% ($530 million) coming from official sources and
the balance (83.3% or $2.7 billion) from the international capital market.
Overall, KDB's reliance on foreign currency resources would decliue from 44%
for the period 1981-82 to 28.9% for 1983-86. While, in the past, KDB has
been extremely successful in mobilizing foreign commercial funds, its
continued ability to do so will depend on several factors independent of KDB,
such as the volume of resources the Government would permit KDB to raise in a
given year within the framework of overall capital inflows, the health and
/1  Based on the projected 1983 allocation of funds, the sectors expected
to benefit from KDB financing include heavy and chemical industries
(22%), overseas marine and air transportation and semiconductors (14%),
and working capital finance (27%).

viability of the international financial system and the financial community's
perception of country risk. During the period in which the Bank loan is ex-
pected to be committed (last quarter 1983 to year-end 1985), KDB would commit
$1.3 billion in foreign currency loans., The proposed Bank loan of $130 mil-
lion would represent about 10% of KDBs projected foreign currency commitments
and would be used primarily to finance longer maturity loans. In the past
two years, loans with a maturity exceeding 10 years accounted for about
15% of KDB's total equipment financing   At negotiations, KDB reported on its
plans regarding co-financing with foreiLgn commercial resources for the 1983-85
period. This plan will be updated quarterly to show KDB-s progress in
reaching its borrowing targets.
4.34      Due largely to improving spreads, KDB's net profit is expected to
increase from W 23.0 billion in 1983 to W 43.2 billion in 1986 (Annex 2, Table
28) for an annual average increase of 23%.  Consequently, net profit as a
percentage of average net worth would steadily increase from 3.3% in 1983 to
5.1% in 1986 (Annex 2, Table 30). At negotiations, KDB agreed to amend its
Development Strategy Statement (Annex 2., Attachment 2) to reflect the
objective that its future profitability, as measured by return on average
equity, should be sufficient to maintain the value of its equity in real
terms. During the projection period, KDB-s debt-service cover ratio
fluctuates between 1.3:1 and 1.2:1, which is satisfactory. The long-term
debt/equity ratio remains within the contractual limit of 10:1 through 1984,
but reaches 10.8:1 in 1985. KDB's share capital would therefore need to be
increased in 1985.
C. Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLB)
4.35      The main issue facing KLB is that of further diversifying its
domestic sources of funds and expanding the scope of its operations. From
its establishment in 1967 as the Korean Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC) to its conversion into the Korea. Long-Term Credit ]Bank (KLB) in 1980,
KDFC was dependent on foreign currency resources, primarily from the Bank,
for close to 90% of its operations. Although KDFC's performance was
outstanding with total assets growing at 43.5% p.a. in 1968-79 and reaching
about $430 million by end-1979, its management felt that growth prospects
were adversely affected by a charter which precluded the mobilization of any
domestic currency resources./l Demand for domestic currency financing was
bound to increase more rapidly as Korea became less dependent on foreign
savings and the domestic machinery industry developed. In addition, the
market for foreign currency lending was becoming extremely competitive with
an increasing number of foreign bank branches operating in Korea and the
most mature industrial firms increasingly able to mobilize overseas funding
directly. iHowever, mobilization of domestic currency resources could only
be achieved by changing KDFC's legal status from a corporation operating
under the General Commercial Code to a long-term credit banrk established
/1 Except for equity resources.



- 37 -
under the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB) Act of 1979. In June 1980, KLB
became the first institution to operate under the new law with authority to
issue long-term domestic currency debentures and to accept deposits from its
corporate borrowers.
4.36      KLB-s domestic currency borrowing and lending operations expanded
rapidly and its total assets grew by over 55% p.a./l in the three-year
period 1980-82. However, KLB experienced very serious difficulties in
issuing debentures in the latter part of 1982 as investors were unwilling to
purchase long-term, fixed rate savings instruments (para. 4.58).  This
problem highlighted KLB's excessive dependence on a single type of savings
instrument to cover its domestic resource requirements. Moreover, the LTCB
Act imposes a number of restrictions on KLB's credit operations (e.g. pro-
portion of working capital financing, deposit taking, etc.) which reduce its
flexibility and competitiveness vis-a-vis other financial institutions whose
operations are being deregulated in the context of the Government's finan-
cial sector reform. To alleviate these problems, KLB is seeking a revision
of the LTCB Act which would give it access to other types of domestic
currency resources (e.g., investment trust accounts and general deposits)
and would allow a diversification of its financial services (e.g. consumer
financing, greater working capital financing authority, etc.)
4.37      The Bank supports KLB's request to amend the LTCB Act so as to
increase its competitiveness in a liberalized financial system. The LTCB
Act as it presently stands is in many respects a reflection of the past
system of specialization and financial segmentation. Amendment of its most
binding limitations would be in line with the mainstream of the Government's
program of financial sector reform. KLB is currently discussing the reform
of the LTCB Act with MOF and legislation is expected to be submitted prior
to year-end 1983. The Bank has discussed possible reforms with KLB and will
be consulted prior to the introduction of any major institutional changes.
KLB's Role in the Industrial and Financial Sectors
4.38      Background.  KLB remains, to date, the only privately owned
development finance institution in Korea, providing essentially medium and
long-term foreign currency financing to private enterprise./2 Over the
1971-81 period, KLB has achieved an impressive record of operational growth
while steadily developing its institutional strength. Despite its
impressive growth, KLB remains a relatively small institution with total
/1 From W 209 billion at end-1979 to W 803 billon at end-1982.
/2 KLB's short-term financing is limited to the small deposit base
mobilized from corporate clients.



- 38 -
assets of W 804 billion ($1.1 billion'l at year-end 1982, approximately 1% of
the total assets of the Korean financiial system. KLB, however, is an
important source of credit, particularly long-term, for industry. As of
year-end 1981, KLB accounted for 5.3% of all outstanding equipment financing
to the manufacturing sector.
Institutional Aspects
4.39      Management, Organization and Staffing.  KLB's broad lending guide-
lines are established in its Policy Statement (Annex 3, Attachment 1).
Overall policies and operational guidelines are laid down by the Board of
Directors, while investment decisions are delegated to t'he Executive
Committee (Annex 3, Table 1). KLB's P'resident is assisted by a Deputy
President and three Managing Directors. The current President, Mr. T.Y.
Hahm, was appointed in February 1982. He has been with KLB since its early
years and operated as Deputy President for the last few years. KLB's staff
has increased considerably over the last few years in reisponse to the
growing volume of operations. Total staff have increased from 163 (84
professionals) in 1979 to 284 in 1982 (161 professionals'). KLB currently
operates five branch/subbranch offices /1 and expects to expand its branch
network gradually (Annex 3, Chart 1).  Overall, KLB is an extremely well
managed and well organized institution.. The high caliber of its staff has
been maintained in recent years in spite of rapid growth.
4.40      Project Appraisal and Supervision.  KLB's project appraisal work
continues to be quite good with thorough coverage of financial, marketing
and technical aspects. The FRR is routinely calculated Eor projects seeking
financing in excess of US$1 million while the ERR is calculated for foreign
exchange loans in excess of US$ 1 million equivalent. KLBs project
supervision is, for the most part, based on reviewing the periodic reports and
annual audited financial statements provided by the borrowers. More intensive
supervision, including visits to project sites, is exerciised whenever these
reports or repayment difficulties indicate problems. Overall, KLB's appraisal
and supervision standards are excellent and have largely contributed to the
high quality of its portfolio.
4.41      Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Procurement of equip-
ment is closely supervised by KLB and may involve one of three methods: (a)
international competitive bidding (ICB); (b) limited competitive bidding
where at least three competitive quotations are required; and (c) the
proprietary method where compatibility with existing equipment dictates
procurement from a specific supplier. Since 1981, 92.9% of the procurement
contracts financed by KLB were based on limited competitive bidding, 7.0%
required proprietary procurement and only 1 project (0.1%) used international
competitive bidding. KLB amended its 'Policy Statement irn 1981 to reflect
/1 Branches/subbranches are located in Central Seoul City, Busan, Daegu,
Youngdong (suburb of Seoul) and Myungdong (center of Seoul).



- 39 -
its standard requirement that competitive procedures, including ICB, be
applied whenever justified by the size and nature of procurement. KLB's
disbursements are authorized in accordance with progress in project imple-
mentation and against proper documentatiLon. Overall, KLB's procurement and
disbursement procedures are in line with the Bankls requirements and are
sound.
Resource Allocation
4.42      Overall Operations.  Prior to its conversion into a long-term
credit bank, KLBs operations had been growing at an average annual rate of
about 30% over the period 1975-79. In 1980, however, total approvals
reached W 169.6 billion (US$256.1 million), an increase of 163% over 1979.
Total approvals grew by about 50% in 1981, but declined by 32.4% in 1982 due
to the poor investment climate and general business recession coupled with
the difficulty KLB experienced in mobilizing domestic currency resources
(Annex 3, Table 2). The following table summarizes KLB's credit operations
over the period 1978-82.

/a  On an approval basis.
7T  Including revolving funds.
7c  For 1981 and 1982 foreign currency loans are on a net of cancellation
basis.
The spectacular increase in approvals during 1980-81 was spurred by the
rapid growth of KLB's domestic currency lending operations following its
conversion into a long-term credit bank. While domestic currency lending
accounted for about 5% of total credit approvals for the period 1975-79, the
proportion reached 60% for the period 1980-82.
4.43      Foreign Currency Lending Operations.  Foreign currency approvals
net of cancellations increased from $94.9 million in 1978 to $131.0 million
in 1980, for an average annual growth rate of about 17.5%, prior to declin-
ing to $101.1 million in 1981.  Net approvals declined in 1981 due to



- 40 -
cancellations of $40.2 million. /1  In 1982, net approval of foreign
currency loans improved to $117.7 million.
4.44      Domestic Currency Lending Operations.  Domestic currency loan
approvals increased from a low of W 3.2 billion in 1979 to W 68.9 billion in
1980 and W 128.9 billion in 1981. While demand for domestic currency loans
remained quite high in 1982, for part of the year KLB was unable to meet
this demand due to a lack of domestic currency resources as sales of deben-
tures declined substantially in the period July-November 1982 to a total of
W 16 billion compared to W 102.5 billion for the first six months of 1982./2
As a result, domestic currency loan approvals reached only W 112.8 billion,
a 12.5% decrease over 1981.  KLB's domestic currency medium-term working
capital financing accounts for the bulk of its lending with 70% of domestic
currency approvals in 1980-81 and 81% in 1982./3 The large proportion of
working capital financing in 1982 reflects the tight liquidity position of
the corporate sector and declining investment in fixed assets.
4.45      Characteristics of KLB's Lerding Operations.  The major character-
istics of loans approved by KLB in the period 1968-82 are provided in Annex
3, Tables 3 and 4. For the period 1968-77, manufacturing accounted for
59.8% of KLB's total loan approvals. Except for 1981 /4 the share of
manufacturing has been generally increasing and reached 70.4% as of 1982.
Shipping is the next most important se!ctor with 16.7% of total cumulative
approvals over the period 1968-82. Average loan size tends to be large /5
as KLB's clientele belongs to the medium to large size group of industries.
Very large companies, however, require more resources than KLB is able to
provide and are clients of KDB and/or large commercial banks. The average
maturity of loans which was 10.7 years for the period 1978-79, declined
marginally to 8.2 years in 1982 as the! emphasis shifted from large capital
intensive projects. Lending to projects in Seoul and Kyunggi province,
which surrounds Seoul, accounted for 41.2% of approvals over 1978-82.
/1  Several shipping projects were cancelled due to worsening economic
and business conditions.
/2  In December 1982 and early 1983, monthly sales improved to W 12-15
billion.
/3  For the 1975-79 period, working capital loans accounted for 20% of
domestic currency loans.
/4  Manufacturing projects accounted for only 56.0% of approvals in 1981
because a large proportion (28%) of approvals went to shipping projects.
/5 Loans exceeding W 1.0 billion (about US$1.3 million at the current
exchange rate) have declined from 66% of total approvals in 1978-79, to
52.6% for the period 1980-82 due t:o the growing importance of working
capital loans.



- 41 -
4.46       Investment Operations.  Over ithe period 1968-82, equity investments
have accounted for 3.0% of KLB's domestic currency operations with approvals
reaching W 1.5 billion (US$2 million) in 1982 (Annex 3, Table 2). Purchases
of bonds and convertible debentures have increased substantially since KLB's
conversion into a long-term credit bank, although annual approvals decreased
to W 11.6 billion ($15.5 million) in 1982 compared to W 21.9 billion ($31.2
million) in 1981 due to KLB's domestic currency constraint (para. 4.58). At
year-end 1982, KLB's outstanding equity and debenture portfolios amounted to
W 7.6 billion ($10.1 million) and W 27.3 billion ($36.4 million), respectively
(Annex 3, Table 5).
Economic Impact and Promotional ActivitiLes
4.47       The economic indicators of the 741 projects financed by KLB since
its establishment in 1968 are summarized in Annex 3, Table 6. The aggregate
investment cost of these projects is estimated at W 1.3 trillion of which KLB
financed W 530.2 billion, or 39.8%. Export sales are estimated at US$1.6 bil-
lion, or 33% of annual incremental sales. The investments financed by KLB are
expected to create 54,068 jobs. The annual average cost per job of projects
financed by KLB, however, has been steadily increasing from an average of W
7.8 million ($20,400) for 1968-74 to W 73.9 million ($98,500) in 1982
reflecting both the greater capital-intensity of the manufacturing sector in
recent years and general inflation. In line with government priorities, and
with the requirements of the LTCB Act, KLB has actively tried to promote small
and medium enterprises/i through direct loans and, indirectly, through
collaboration with some regional commercial banks (RCBs). Collaboration with
the RCB's has been reduced in recent years as KLB's branch network developed
and its domestic currency resource availability increased. However, the
proportion of assistance to small- and medium-scale industries in KLB's total
approvals has increased from 19.8% for 1975-79 to 26.6% in 1980-82 (Annex 3,
Table 7).
4.48       Promotional Activities.  KLB has been instrumental in promoting
the establishment of new specialized financial institutions to increase the
range of services available to Korean industries. Three non-bank financial
institutions have been established in close collaboration with IFC: (a)
the Korea Investment and Finance Corporastion (KIFC) established in 1971 to
assist in the development of private money and capital markets in Korea;
(b) the Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC) established in 1975
and geared in particular towards servicing smaller entrepreneurs who lack
the capital and/or collateral needed for outright equipment purchases; and
(c) the Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (KTAC) established in 1974
to promote new technologies based on patents and processes developed by
domestic research agencies. KLB's management has also played an important
role in developing and broadening the legal framework for the Korean

include firms employing not more than 300 full-time employees, or not
more than 500 employees for machinery manufacturing.

financial system. The LTCB Act was enacted in 1979 at the strong urging of
KLB. The President of KLB is also an influential member of the Financial
Reform Commission estabished in 1982 to advise the Government on matters
related to financial reform.
4.49      Utilization of Bank Loans 1635-K0 and 1932-KO.  The Bank's seventh
loan to KLB (Loan 1635-KO) for $100 million has been fully committed and
as of December 31, 1982, $99.6 million had been disbursecd. A total of
92 projects were financed whose total investment cost of $411.9 million
helped create 7,769 new jobs at a cost per job of about $53,000. Calcula-
tions of the FRR and ERR for these projects provided weighted averages of
24.1% and 27.6%, respectively (Annex 3, Table 8). As of December 31, 1982,
52 projects had been financed under Loan 1932-K0 at a total project cost of
$295.1 million; disbursements under the Bank loan reached $55.8 million.
Total financing provided by KLB amounted to $134.0 million, including
$12.2 million equivalent in domestic currency financing, for an average loan
size of $2.6 million. Foreign currency financing provided by KLB comprised
$67.0 million from the proceeds of the Bank loan of the $90 million and
$54.8 million cofinanced with ADB and commercial resources.  Some 4,131
additional jobs would be created by these projects at a cost per job of
$71,400. Total incremental sales are expected to reach $620 million with
39% export sales. The weighted average ERR and FRR are estimated at 22.5%
and 22.0%, respectively (Annex 3, Table 9).
Financial Condition and Performance
4.50       Financial Condition.  As of December 31, 1982, KLB's total assets
amounted to W 803.8 billion ($1.1 billion). From 1980-82, KLB's assets grew
at an average annual rate of 59% compared to 41% for 1975-79. Asset growth
prior to 1980 was based largely on the expansion of the foreign loan
portfolio. Starting in 1980, however, KLB was able to raise Won currency
resources, and its domestic currency portfolio /1 increased from of
W 7.6 billion ($15.6 million) in 1979 to W 256.4 billion ($341.8 million) in
1982. As of December 31, 1982, 83.5% of KLB's total assets were financed by
long-term liabilities, 7.3% by current: liabilities and 9.2% by equity.
Foreign currency borrowings accounted for 60.3% of long-term liabilities
compared to 99.0% in 1979, reflecting KLB's increasing reliance on the
debenture market. KLB began issuing debentures in 1980 and as of year-end
1982, outstanding debentures accounted for 39.7% of total long-term
liabilities. In 1980, KLB increased its share capital from W 10 billion to
W 50 billion. Largely due to this increase, KLB's total net worth has
increased from W 19.8 billion in 1979 to W 72.7 billion in 1982 (Annex 3,
Table 10).
/1 Loans, debenture purchases and equity investments.



- 43 -
4.51      Debt/Equity Position.  As of December 31, 1982, KLB's long-term
debt/equity ratio reached 9.0:1; this raLtio is projected to exceed the 10:1
contractual limit early in 1984. KLB originally intended to increase its
paid-in capital in 1983. Due to a depressed stock market and a significant
decline in KLB's profitability in the wake of successive lending rate
reductions starting in 1980, these plans have had to be postponed. KLB now
plans to build up its reserves before issuing new shares so as to be able to
command a better price for its next isstue. The Bank is willing to support
this strategy and has agreed to raise KLB's long-term debt/equity limit to
12:1. This unusually high limit has been previously accepted by the Bank in
cases where the institution concerned wais both financially strong and
well-managed. Such is the case for KLB whose loan portfolio is excellent as
demonstrated by a collection ratio which has not fallen below 98% over the
last 10 years./l Arrearage ratios are even more favorable (para. 4.54).
Furthermore, since its conversion into aL long-term credit bank, KLB has
evolved from being primarily reliant on foreign exchange funding to raising
substantial amounts of long-term domestic currency resources. As should be
expected from an institution increasingly involved in working capital
financing, its aggregate debt/equity ratio should become increasingly
comparable to that of a commercial bank. However, KLB's character remains
quite different from that of a regular commercial bank since by law the
minimum maturity of its loans is one yeaLr, even in the case of working
capital loans. Unlike commercial banks whose long-term indebtedness is
relatively small, the proportion of long-term debt to total liabilities is
close to 100% for KLB and the long-term debt/equity ratio is relatively
high. KLB's debt service and interest coverage ratios are adequate as is
the current ratio (Annex 3, Tables 13 and 14).
4.52      Financial Performance.  KLB's interest spread /2 has been declin-
ing significantly from its high of 3.3% in 1980 to 1.1% in 1981 and 0.27% in
1982. This decline is largely attributa,ble to the declining spread on KLB's
loans made with debenture resources: while lending rates on these loans fell
by 10.2 percentage points between June 1980 and June 1982, the weighted
average cost of its debentures declined by only 6.3 percentage points./3 The
slow decline in the average cost of outstanding debentures is due to: (a)
the fixed interest cost attached to all KLB debentures issued through
September 1982,/4 and (b) the high nominal and real interest rates which
/1 The lowest level was 98.2% in 1974; in 1981 and 1982, it reached 99.5%
and 99.4%, respectively, despite the prolonged business recession.
/2 Income from loans as % of average lc,an portfolio less the cost of term
debt as % of average term debt.
/3 Lending rates fell from 34.0% to 23.9% while the weiglhted average cost
of KLB's debentures declined from 30.5% to 24.3%.
/4 In September 1982 KLB proceeded withL its first issue of variable rate
debentures.



- 44 -
still prevail in the bond market. At year-end 1982, the three- and five-
year debentures issued by KLB in 1980 were still outstanding at a cost of
27-30% while new debentures were being issued at a cost of 11.98% to 14.62%.
In the meantime, KLB's lending rate had been lowered not only for new loans
but also for existing balances outstanding, /1 in order to maintain KLB's
competitiveness, and avoid its loans being refinanced with less costly
resources from other lenders, and to support government objectives to ease
the burden of debt on the corporate sector. As a consequence, KLB's
weighted average effective spread on 'Loans funded with debentures declined
from 3.52% in June 1980 to 2.08% by June 1981 and -0.37% in June 1982.
Overall, KLB's spread on domestic currency loans was substantially negative
in 1982. This was compensated for, however, by earnings on foreign currency
loans, so that KLB was able to remain profitable in 1982. KLB expects the
spreads on loans funded from debenture resources to improve /2 as the
earlier and more expensive debenture Lssues are redeemed. Greater reliance
on variable rate debentures (para. 4.58) and a greater stability of interest
rates would help avoid a recurrence of this situation in the future.
4.53      Despite the decline in spreads, KLB's net earnings before tax
increased from W 15.6 billion in 1980 to W 19.7 billion in 1981; in 1982
however, net earnings before tax came to only W 12.1 billion (Annex 3,
Table 11). KLB-s administrative and general expenses have been maintained
at very low levels since 1979, amount:Lng to no more than 1% of average total
assets. Net profit after tax increased as a percentage of average total
assets from 1.9% in 1979 to 3.5% in 19380, but fell to 2.6% in 1981 and 1.4%
in 1982.  KLB's return on equity increased from 17.1% in 1978, to 28.2% in
1980 but declined to 20.4% in 1981 and 14.0% in 1982. The lower return on
equity has depressed the market value of KLB-s shares in 1982, making it:
difficult for KLB to consider issuing more shares until profitability
improves.
4.54      Quality of Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1982, 15 loans were in
arrears out of a total portfolio of 1,229 loans outstanding (1.2%). Tot:al
arrears of principal and interest amoanted to W 1.4 billion,/3 or 0.2% of
the outstanding portfolio. The portfolio affected by arrears represented
only 0.7% of the total portfolio outstanding with provisions for possible
losses of W 6.9 billion, or approximately 1% of the portfolio, which is

from about 30% to 20%.

more than adequate. KLB's collection performance, as indicated by the
arrears ratios, remains excellent. Despite a prolonged business recession,
KLB-s overall collection of principal and interest was 99.4% of the amounts
due in 1982 (Annex 3, Tables 15, 16 and 17).
Resource Mobilization

There was little change in the composition of KLB-s resources between 1975
and 1979. During the period 1976-79, KLB mobilized a net total of
W 147.9 billion from two sources only: equity resources (paid-in capital
and retained earnings) accounted for about 9% of the total and foreign
borrowings for 91%. Profound changes occurred in the currency mix of KLB-s
resources following its conversion into a long-term credit bank in 1980.
Foreign currency borrowings declined from 89.1% of total resources in 1979
to 54.8% by the end of 1982. During the period 1980-82, the net increase in
KLB's total resources reached W540 billion with net foreign currency
borrowings accounting for only 36% of the total increase in KLB's resources
over 1980-82.
4.56      Foreign Currency Resource Mobilization.  Until 1975, KLB was
entirely dependent on official sources of funds such as ADB and IBRD
for its foreign borrowings. KLB's first syndicated commercial borrowing
was mobilized in 1976 with IFC's assistance. Foreign commercial borrowings
increased rapidly from $17.8 million in 1976 to a high of $110 million in



- 415 -
1981. Since 1976, KLB has mobilized julst over $300 million from commercial
sources. Three foreign loans were mob:Llized in 1981 for a total of $110
million. This heavy borrowing program was in support of gross foreign
currency loan approvals which reached ';141.3 million during that year.
However, cancellation of some of these 1981 approvals reached over $40
million due to the depressed economy and KLB's borrowing program was
severely trimmed in 1982 to two Yen denominated commercial borrowings for
$45 million (Annex 3, Table 18).
4.57      KLB's success in mobilizing :Eoreign currency resources from
commercial sources has allowed a substantial reduction in its reliance on
official sources of funds. The ratio of official to commercial borrowings
has declined from 65:35 in 1978-79 to 44:56 in 1980-82. The World Bank has
made eight loans totalling $410 million to KLB since its establishment in
1968. ADB is the second largest source of official funding to KLB with four
loans totalling $180 million. The max:Lmum maturity of the foreign
commercial funds mobilized by KLB has declined in recent years from 10
years in the late 1970s to about 7 years.  KLB has had to rely extensively
on foreign official borrowings to fund the longer maturity equipment loans
although the average maturity of KLB's equipment loans hais declined to
approximately 8 years.  Official sources of funds will therefore remain an
important element in KLB's foreign currency mobilizations although they
will account for a declining proportion of foreign currency resources.
4.58      Domestic Currency Resources.  Over the period 1980-82, equity
resources accounted for about 17% of KLB's incremental domestic currency
resources. Deposits from corporate cl:Lents have remained small with a share
of about 5%. Since its conversion into a long-term credit bank, KLB has
relied primarily on the issuance of debentures for its domestic currency
requirements.  Debentures provided about 78% of KLB's total domestic
currency resources in 1980-82.  Net proceeds of debenture Issues increased
from W 41.6 billion in 1980 to W 86.3 billion in 1981 and W 99.4 billion in
1982 (Annex 3, Table 19). However, during the third quarter of 1982, KLB
had difficulty issuing new debentures due to: (a) the relatively low yield
imposed by the Government on KLB's new issues compared to secondary market
rates, and (b) a strong preference of savers for short-term instruments in
anticipation of an increase in interest rates which depressed the sale of
long-term fixed interest rate instruments. A first issue of variable rate
debentures in September 1982 was desiglned to alleviate the latter con-
straint. The Government also allowed sales at a discount which increased
effective yields. During the last quarter of 1982, debenture sales
increased dramatically as investors' inflationary expectations fell.
4.59      Lending Rates.  KLB's onlendLng rates for foreign official borrow-
ings are fixed at 2% above borrowing cost for lending rates of 9.35% to
12.1% in 1982 compared to a lending rate of 15-16% on other domestic
currency KLB loans.   Considering that borrowers have to bear the foreign
exchange risk on all foreign currency loans, the differential in nominal



- 47 -
interest rates is considered small between foreign and domestic currency
loans by potential borrowers as the Won has depreciated by an average of
6% p.a. against the US dollar over the period 1967-82. However, KLB expects
that borrower reluctance to accept foreign currency liabilities will decline
as it is realized that low levels of inflation in Korea should reduce the
magnitude of the adjustments in the parity of the Won. In 1982, KLB's
foreign commercial loans denominated in dollars were onr-lent at LIBOR + 2%
and Yen-denominated loans carried a lending rate of 1.4% above the Japanese
prime lending rate.
4.60      Audit.  KLB's accounts have been audited in keeping with inter-
national accounting standards by the Samil Accounting Corporation, which is
associated with the Coopers and Lybrand Group. The accounts have always
been certified without qualification and the reports have met with the Bank
Grcup's requirements. However, an understanding was reached at negotiations
that future audit reports would provide an opinion as to the adequacy of
provisions for losses.
Operational Projections and Resource Requirements
4.61      KLB's operational projections for the period 1983-87 are primarily
based on expected demand (Annex 3, Table 21), but are conservative in that
they do not take into account the possible expansion of KLB's business scope
(outlined in KLB's Development Strategy Statement 1983-84 presented in Annex
3, Attachment 2). Over the 1983-87 period, KLB projects commitments on its
lending operations (loans, debenture and equity investments) to grow at an
average annual rate of about 25%; domestic currency commitments would
increase at a rate of 29% and foreign currency commitments by about 18%
p.a./1 KLB expects that out of total commitments of $2.9 billion, 66% would
be for domestic currency operations and the remaining 34% for foreign
currency loans. As of year-end 1982, KLB had $101.1 million available for
further foreign currency commitments, compared to a projected foreign
currency resource requirement uf $990 million for 1983-87. Domestic
currency resources available for commitment amounted to W 81.2 billion while
projected commitments for the 1983-87 period amount to W1.4 trillion
(Annex 3, Table 20).
4.62      To meet its projected level of operations, KLB plans to mobilize
W 2.3 trillion ($3.1 billion) over the 1983-87 period, of which 67.5% would
be in domestic currency and 32.5% in foreign currency (Annex 3, Table 22).
/1 With regard to projected sectoral allocation, KLB would follow the
Government guidelines on priority industries as established in the
Five Year Plan, although it is expected that industries producing
semiconductors will account for a significant proportion of KLB s
assistance.



- 48 -
Nearly all of KLB's domestic currency resources (89%) would be derived from
the sale of debentures, the balance comiing from deposits. KLB expects its
sale of debentures to increase from W 130.8 billion in 1982 to W 180 billion
in 1983 and to further increase by W 60 billion each year through 1987. Of
the W 810 billion (US$1.1 billion) KLB plans to raise in foreign currency,
52.8% ($570 million) would be from comiercial sources and the remaining
47.2% ($510 million) from foreign official sources.  During the period in
which the Bank loan is expected to be committed (last quarter 1983 to
year-end 1985), KLB would commit $415 tnillion in foreign currency loans.
The proposed Bank loan of $120 million would be used primarily to finance
longer maturity foreign currency loans and would represent about 30% of
KLB's projected foreign currency commil:ments. In the past two years, loans
with maturities exceeding 9 years accounted for about 40% of KLB's equipment
financing.  KLB provided at negotiations its plan for cofinancing with
foreign commercial resources over the 1983-85 period. Progress made in
reaching these borrowing targets will be monitored on a qluaLrterly basis ELS
part of KLB's regular reporting requirements.
4.63      KLB's net income is expected to gradually increase over the
projection period from W 9.0 billion in 1983 to W 13.8 billion in 1987 dcue
largely to improving spreads (Annex 3, Table 24). Consequently, return on
equity would increase from 12.0% in 1983 to 13.6% in 1987 (Annex 3, Table
26). Throughout the projection period, KLB's debt-service cover ratio
would remain at about 1.1:1, which is satisfactory. The long-term debt-
equity ratio of 12:1 proposed under th:Ls loan would be adequate through
1985, after which KLB would need to consider raising additional share
capital. If, however, the nature of KLB's operations and its funding
sources change significantly in response to the proposed amendments of the
LTCB Act (para. 4.35-37), the 12:1 debt/equity ratio could adequately cover
KLB's operations for a longer time period.
D. Technical AssLstance Component
4.64      The financial sector reform will necessitate a considerable
upgrading of both the supervisory institutions and financial intermediaries
to adapt to the new requirements of a financial system relying increasingly
on market signals rather than government direction. The technical assist-
ance component of the project would consist of (i) overseas training of
selected staff from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Bank of Korea (BO0K),
the conmiercial banks and other financial institutions, tco help introduce
advanced management practices to the financial sector and fEoster greater
efficiency in financial institutions in Korea; and (ii) ccmputerization of
data on financial transactions to modernize the fiscal management of the
economy, to improve tax collection on interest and dividejnd income and to
help improve the credit information system of commercial banks and other
financial intermediaries.



- 49 -
Training
4.65      Staff of MOF responsible for formulating policies for the
financial sector would be trained abroad to improve their understanding of
the policies and techniques associated with a 'iberalized financial system.
Staff from the BOK would be trained in new skills and methods of
supervision of financial institutions emphasizing ex post evaluation of
financial performance rather than more detailed day-to-day involvement in
operations of individual institutions. Management staff f-rom the commercial
banks would be trained in modern commercial banking practices in areas such as
international banking, credit analysis and lending practices, project analysis
and the use of modern banking technology.  Staff of the non-bank financial
intermediaries would be trained to acquire relevant skills in similar insti-
tutions in advanced countries. Staff from the Korea Banking Institute (KBI),
who will administer the training program, would receive training in order to
improve their capabilities in organizing domestic training programs. The
training program to be financed under this loan would encompass: (a) seminar
training lasting five-six weeks to be held at various institutes in the US,
Japan and Europe; (b) on-the-job training at commercial banks, non-bank
financial intermediaries, international organizations and government
institutions in North America, Europe and Asia for periods lasting about six
months; and (c) limited funding for graduate level studies in finance and
economics.
4.66      The Government wishes to strengthen the training program of Korean
financial intermediaries in order to upgrade their capacity to operate
effectively in a more competitive environment. Particular emphasis is being
placed on overseas training of senior management as this is the group which
has been neglected in the past by formal training programs and which would
best be able to implement new skills learned through such training. The
proposed technical assistance component would strengthen the acquisition of
banking know-how by higher working-level staff and exrose senior bank
management to advanced financial and managerial techniques.
4.67      The program included in the proposed project would train about
350 people over the 1983-85 period. Wiith the total cost of overseas training
estimated at $2.5 million equivalent, the average cost per trainee would be
about $7,000. The actual number of people trained would be adjusted to
accommodate changes in unit training costs.
4.68      Implementation of the traininig component would be coordinated and
supervised by the Korea Banking Instituite (KBI). KBI was established in
1976 by 11 banks, including BOK, to develop and administer training programs
for Korean financial institutions. Over the years, it has acquired extenr-
sive experience in this field. KBI has prepared, with the assistance of
local training experts, a pre-implementation study which was reviewed during



- 5) -
negotiations. The study tentatively identifies the training targets and
requirements for the principal training beneficiaries. KBI has set up a
Coordinating Board, consisting of a representative of the MOF and the
training managers of the BOK and the national city banks, which will devise
eligibility criteria for participants. KBI has also prepared a list of
prospective overseas training institutiLons and will provide for the Bank's
review, annual training programs based on its consultations with these
institutions and the actual training demand of participating institutions.
4.69       The signing of an agency agreement between the Ministry of Finance
and KBI, setting out KBI's responsibiliLties in executing the training
component, t;ould be a condition of disbursement for this portion of the
project. The cost of the training would be borne by the participating
financial institutions. For this purpose, the Government would make loans
available to these institutions at the same interest rate as applicable to
the Bank loan, with a maximum repayment: period of 15 years, including a
maximum grace period of 3 years. The ioreign exchange risk would be borne
by the participating institutions or agencies. The Government would enter
into a standard subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to the Bank, for the
training program of each of the financial institutions. Bank approval of
the standard subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of disbursement
for this component of the project.
Computerization Program
4.70       The computerization program would entail the analysis, design and
testing of a system for comprehensive data processing of information
supplied by the commercial banks and ot:her financial institutions. Develop-
ment of an effective data processing system would provide an orderly flow of
financial information as required for more effective tax administration and
improved fiscal management. The system would be designed by the Software
Development Center (SDC), an affiliate of the Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST).  In addition to the system design, SDC would
develop the necessary data base to implement the system and the multipurpose
software of a management information system for institutilons without compu-
ters. SDC would also develop, in consultation with the institutions
concerned, a software package generatirLg financial data for monetary
authorities as well as for the institut:ions' own internal management.
4.71       The SDC was established within KAIST in 1967 under the direction
of Dr. Ki Soo Sung, an internationally reputed computer scientist. The SDC
is engaged in basic and applied researc:h of software and information
systems. Its staff comprises 400 highly competent computer scientists,
divided into 14 major research groups, including the group responsible for
implementing the computer component of the proposed project.  The SDC has
acquired the experience required in deesigning very large computer systems
through a variety of software development projects for universities, medical
institutions, industry and the Government as well as for institutions in
Japan and the United States. The Center has two general



- 51 -
purpose computers and over 20 mini-micro computer systems with a nationwide
network of on-line and batch terminals.
4.72      A design team of 40 computer and data system specialists has been
assembled by Dr. Ki Soo Sung to implement the project whose basic design is
at an advanced stage, with a manual procedure already in place. The project
is being implemented under the overall gdidance of a Computerization
Committee chaired by the Vice Minister of Finance. A Bank computer expert
visited Korea in April 1983 to advise SDC on the overall system design and
particularly, on the strategy for data collection from financial institu-
tions and on the minimum input requirements of the system. Further visits
will be arranged as necessary to supervise the testing and the implemen-
tation of the entire computerization program. The Government has signed a
contract with KAIST for the design and implementation of the system.
Signature of a revised contract, including a more detailed scheduling of
tasks and financing arrangements, would be a condition of disbursement for
this component of the project.
4.73      The full implementation of the computerization program is expected
to be completed by the end of 1984 at a total cost of aboul: $6 million,
comprising expenditures of $0.5 million in 1982, $4 million in 1983 and
$1.5 million in 1984. The Government has been able to meet its $0.5 million
payment obligations to KAIST for initial design and development of the sys-
tem in 1982. However, due to the tight budgetary situation of MOF for 1983,
the Government expects to be able to appropriate only $1.5 million of the
$4 million required under the contract for 1983 and has requested the Bank
to finance the $2.5 million balance.
5. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Benefits and Risks
5.01      Expected Benefits.  The main benefits expected from the proposed
loan are (a) the continuation of the Bank's support for the process of
financial sector reform in Korea; (b) support of financially and economically
viable industrial projects; and (c) a build up of institutional capabilities
and skills in the financial system through technical assistance and
training.



- 52 -
5.02      An important benefit of the :Loan is that it wouldE facilitate a
close and effective dialogue with the Government on financial sector
policies. The impact of the reforms a:Lready implemented and the adoption of
new policy measures would be monitored closely during supervision of the
loan. This analysis would serve as the basis for further discussions
between the Bank and the Government on the next steps towards financial
sector reform which would provide the underpinnings of the Bank's subsequent
financial sector loans.
5.03      The $250 million credit component would serve to support deserving
investment projects selected by KDB and KLB. Recent experience with
projects financed by KDB and KLB suggests that approximately 160 subprojects
would be financed under the credit component. Sample FRR and ERR
computations for recent projects financed by these institutions with Bank
funds show a weighted average of 22% anid 32%, respectively. The projects to
be financed under the proposed loan are expected to yield similar financial
and economic returns.
5.04      The institution-building impact of the proposed loan is expected
to benefit not only KDB and KLB, whose maturity and efficiiency are already
quite high, but also other financial institutions which would participate in
the program of technical assistance. The greater skills and exposure to a
different financial environment which t:he overseas training program would
provide, would assist in the process of' financial sector reform in Korea and
would help lay the basis for a possible future participation of commercial
banks in the next Bank-supported Industrial Finance Project. Finally, the
program of computerization of financial sector transactions is expected to
strengthen the Government-s tax collect:ion efforts while helping the
financial sector set up a reliable credit information system.
5.05      Risks.  The institutional risks involved in the proposed project
are minimal. Both KDB and KLB have a Jong and excellent record showing
their ability to administer satisfactorily the credit component. Similarly,
KBI has developed extensive experience in the organization and supervision
of overseas training courses. With appropriate staff strengthening, KBI
should be in a position to handle satisfactorily the additional workload
imposed by the training component. As for the computerization program, the
introduction of a more effective credit: and tax information system is a
large and complex task which will need to be monitored carefully.
5.06      The main risks associated wit:h the proposed loan relate to the
program of financial sector reform and particularly the speed with which it
is implemented. Too rapid a liberalization of the financial system could
have a destabilizing effect on both the corporate and financial sectors
which might jeopardize the existing consensus for reform. Conversely, a
higher than expected rate of inflation or excessively slow liberalization of
interest rates could maintain the differential between market rates and
legislated rates and thus thwart some of the major objectives of the



- 53 -
financial sector reform. The Government is aware of these possible pitfalls
and remains strongly committed to the rieform process with the highest
priority attached to maintaining inflation at a low level and bringing down
inflationary expectations. Overall, the cautious and consistent approach to
liberalization followed by the Government is reasonable and is likely to
prove successful, facilitated, in part, by the expected economic recovery.
Features of the Proposed Loan
5.07      Relending Arrangements.  The proposed Bank loan of $255 million
would be made to the Government at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.  The 0.25% front-end fee will be paid to the Bank prior to the
effectiveness of the proposed loan. Th,e Government would relend $130 mil-
lion of the proceeds of the credit component to KDB and $120 million to KLB
on the same terms as the Bank's loan but with an additional administrative
fee of 0.05%. The signature of subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to
the Bank, between the Government and the two participating financial
institutions would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Relending arrangements and terms for the training subcomponent have been
described in para. 4.69.
5.08      Relending Terms.  Under the credit component, the foreign exchange
risk would be passed on by the lending institutions to the final subborrow-
ers. The participating financial institutions (KDB and KLEi) would reler.d
the proceeds of the credit component of the proposed loan at a variable
interest rate of 2% above the effective borrowing cost inclusive of the
front-end fee and the standard 0.05% admninistrative fee imposed by the
Government. The 2% interest spread is in line with the general practice of
Korean development banks when onlending foreign official borrowings and is
adequate to cover the administrative costs involved. Based on the current
Bank lending rate of 10.97% the final lending rate to subborrowers would be
about 13% p.a.
5.09      Assuming that Korea's inflation rate remains comparable with that
of its major trading partners, foreign exchange risks would be reduced
substantially in coming years so that the effective cost of Bank funds would
be in line with current market rates of interest in Korea and with the rates
charged by KDB and KLB on long term loans (paras. 4.22 and 4.59). Given an
expected rate of domestic inflation of less than 5% p.a. during the Fifth
Plan period, these rates are highly positive in real terms. The variability
of the lending rates applicable to Bank funds is not expected to cause any
durable misalignment with domestic market rates as, historically, market



5 54 _
rates of interest in Korea have generaLlly moved in line wwith international
interest rates adjusted for the foreign exchange risk.
5.10      Amortization Schedule.  The technical assistance component
(training and computerization) would hlave a fixed amortization schedule and
would be repaid by the Government in accordance with the standard terms
applicable to Korea i.e. a 15-year maturity including a :3-year grace period.
The credit component would have two separate adjustable composite amortiza-
tion schedules, one for KDB and one for KLB, reflecting the aggregate
amortization schedules of the subloans made by KDB and KLB, respectively.
Individual subloans would have a maximum maturity of 13 rears, including a
normal grace period of three years. H[owever, the Bank w:Lshes to encourage
the cofinancing of subprojects with foreign commercial borrowings mobilized
independently by KDB and KLB. Some of' these borrowings (e.g. floating rate
notes) may have maturities of less than five years, substantially shorter
than the 15-year maturity of Bank funds, thus making cofiLnancing more
difficult. In such instances, the Bank would agree to fiLt the amortization
of its funding around the shorter maturity of commercial funds by picking up
the later maturities. The earlier principal repayments on cofinanced
subloans would be assigned to the amortization of commercial borrowings and
repayments to the Bank would start thereafter. For cofinanced subloans, an
exception would be made to the normal grace period of three years by
extending it to five years.  The maximum maturity of 13 years would be
unchanged. A similar facility was accorded to both KDB and KLB under the
previous Bank loans (1932-K0 and 1933-KO). The proposed loan is expected to
be fully committed in approximately two years and fully clisbursed by end--
1986. The estimated commitment and disbursement schedule of the proposed
loan is provided in Annex 4, Table 1. The schedule for the credit component
is based on the historical profile of KDB and KLB's disbursements.
5.11      Procurement.  Procurement under the credit component would be made
on the basis of the standard procurement procedures of KDB and KLB as
described in paras. 4.10 and 4.41. These procedures have been reviewed and
were found to ensure a satisfactory degree of competition while minimizing
delays in procurement. Under the training component, the Bank would review
and approve in advance, on a regular annual basis, the content, organization
and costs of the training program. Contracts in excess of $75,000 would be
subject to the prior approval of the Bank. However, all training contracts
would be subject to ex-post review. The selection of KAIST as the firm
providing the software requirements under the computerization component has
already been made by the Government. The Bank has reviewed the credentials
and experience of KAIST and concluded that this institute! has the competency
needed to implement the program at a cost which appears reasonable by
international standards. The signature of a revised contract between the
Government and KAIST would be a condition of disbursement: (para. 4.72).

5.12      Disbursements.  Withdrawal and/or reimbursement requests would be
presented to the Bank by the Government (i.e. MOF) under the training/
computerization component for technical assistance. The technical
assistance component would be disbursed against 100% of the cost of overseas
training for the staff of supervisory agencies and eligible financial
institutions. Expenditures financed under the training program would be
reimbursed according to a statement of expenditure in cases where the amount
involved is less than $20,000. All related supporting doctments including
copies of contracts and evidence of payment would be retained in one
central location and made available on request for review by Bank staff
during supervision missions and would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. For expenditures of $20,000 or more, and for
graduate studies, payments would be made directly to the institutions
concerned. Under the computerization component, disbursements would be made
against 100% of the 3 installments due to KAIST on or by September 9, 1983,
October 21, 1983, and December 30, 1983 under the terms of the revised
contract. The first payment to KAIST of $0.5 million would not be tied to
the completion of any specific task; the second and third payments of $1
million each would be tied to the completion of specific products as set
forth in the revised contract between KYLIST and the Governrment. Under the
credit component, withdrawal requests would be submitted directly by KDB and
KLB.  As with previous Bank loans to KDB and KLB, the proposed loan would be
used to finance (a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of goods and services
imported directly by subborrowers; and (b) 60% of the cost in domestic
currency (representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of locally
manufactured or of locally procured imported goods and equipment.
5.13      Eligibility Criteria.  The credit component of the proposed loan
would be available for financing industrial projects selected and appraised
by KDB and KLB. The bulk of the funds is expected to be allocated to the
manufacturing sector although sectors such as agroprocessin,g, construction,
mining, transportation and utilities would be eligible. The project is
intended to finance mainly medium- and larger scale enterprises. Access to
Bank funds would be limited to firms having a sound financial structure
including a degree of indebtedness which is not excessive. To this.end, the
previous loans to KDB and KLB (1932-KO and 1933-KO), established a maximum
debt/equity ratio of 5:1, inclusive of the proposed subloan, for eligible
subborrowers. Under the proposed loan, this maximum ratio has been further
reduced to 4.5:1. The objective of this requirement is to get project
sponsors to make a satisfactory equity contribution to project financing.
5.14      Subloan Ceiling.  To ensure that the proceeds of the proposed
credit component are spread over a relatively large number of projects, the
$10 million ceiling imposed under the previous Bank loans to KDB and KLB
would remain unchanged.
5.15      Free Limit.  It is recommendede that the free limit above which
subproject appraisals are reviewed in detail by the Bank prior to approval
remain unchanged at $5 million for both KDB and KLB. With this limit, it is
estimated that the Bank would review in detail about 15% of the total number
of subprojects, accounting for approximately 25% of the proposed credit
component.

Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
5.16      During loan negotiations, the following agreements were reached
with the Korean Government:
(a)  Conditions of Effectiveness:
(i) the signature of two subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and KDB/KLB under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan (para. 5. 07);
(b) Conditions of Disbursement:
(i)  the signature of an agreement acceptable to the Bank
between KBI and the Government which would define the responsi-
bilities of the implementing agency for the training component
would be a condition of disbursement for this component of the
proposed loan (para. 5.07). Approval by the Bank of a standard
subsidiary loan agreement between the Goverrnment and the
institutions participal:ing in the training program would also
be a condition of disbursement (para. 4.69); and
(ii)  the signature of a reviLsed contract, acceptable to the Bank,
between KAIST and the Government defining the activities and
costs covered by the computerization component would be a
condition of disbursement of the proposed lcan (para. 5.07).
(c) Other Agreements:
(i)  The Bank and the Government would exchange views from time
to time on the progress achieved in carrying out the programs
of financial sector reiform (para. 2.24);
(ii) The specifics of KBI's annual training program would be
submitted in advance to the Bank for its review (para. 4.68);
(iii) Individual contracts for training in an amount exceeding
$75,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior approval (para.
5.11).
5.17      During negotiations, the Bank reached the following agreements
with KDB and KLB which were recorded iin the loan documents:
(a) the maximum debt/equity ratiLo of eligible subborrowers, including
the proposed subloan, would be 4.5:1 (para. 5.13);



- 57 -
(b) the free limit on subloans, :Lncluding other outstanding
balances financed from prior Bank loans, would be $5 million
(para. 5.15);
(c)  the ceiling on individual subloans would be $10 million
(para. 5.14);
(d)  a long-term debt/equity ratio of 10:1 would be maintained by
KDB (para. 4.34);
(e) a long-term debt/equity ratio of 12:1 would be maintained by
KLB (para. 4.51); and
(f) KDB would maintain an average effective interest spread of at
least 2% when onlending the proceeds of the foreign currency
resources mobilized from comaercial sources (para. 4.23).
5.18      The following understandings were reached at negotiations and
recorded in the agreed minutes:
(a) in support of the greater comamercial orientation of its opera-
tions, KDB would maintain a spread on its credit operations
which is sufficient to ensure a satisfactory level of profi-
tability. At the minimum, KDB's return on equity should be
equal to the rate of inflation in order to prevent an erosion of
its equity base in real terms. This objective will be incor-
porated in KDB's Strategy Statement for 1983-85 (para. 4.34);
(b)  KDB has discussed with the Bank its 1983-85 plan for cofinancing
with foreign commercial resources. KDB will report to the Bank
on a quarterly basis on the progress made towards reaching its
borrowing targets as part of the regular reporting requirements
(para. 4.33);
(d) KLB's cofinancing plans have also been discussetl at the time of
negotiations and it was agreed that progress reports will be
submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis (para. 4.62);
(d) KLB has agreed to require its auditors to expreiss an opinion
as to the adequacy of provisions for bad debts (para. 4.60).
Recommendation
5.19      A Bank loan of $255 million with a maturity of 15 years including
3 years of grace is recommended.

INDUSTRIAL F:[NANCE PROJECT
Letter of Development Policy for the Financial Sector
Dear Mr. Clausen:
1.        I am writing in connection with the proposed loan. for the Industrial
F'inance Project to inform the InternatiLonal Bank for Reconstruction and
Development of the status of our financial policy reform andl. the actions the
Government has already taken or proposes to take to reform Korea's financial
system.  The ultimate goal is to liberalize the financial system which would
promote the national economy by increasing resource mobiliz.ation and alloca-
ting credit in a more efficient manner., Central to these objectives woluld be
allowing market forces to determine inl:erest rates, deregulating the act:ivi-
ties of financial institutions and redtucing the role of Government in credit
allocation.
2.        The reform is expected to (a) improve resource allocation by dlecen-
tralizing decision making so that both financial institnltioeis and entrepre-
neurs can respond more easily to market: forces; and (b) enhance efficiency in
financial intermediation as banking institutions are subjected to greater
competition through freer entry and less legislated specialization.  While
the liberalization process must be effected gradually as too precipitous
action could have destabilizing effects for both the finaLncial system and the
corporate sector, the Government remains firmly committed to realizing the
objectives of full financial. liberalization as rapidly as possible.
3.        In this letter, I will describe in more detail the Government,s
objectives and planned course of action in five major areas of policy reform:
(a)  Interest Rates;
(h)  Liberalization of Comnmercial Bnlc-,
(e)  Bank Supervision;
(d)  Directed Credit; and
(e)  Corporate Debt.
Interest Rates
4.        The Government's longer-term objective as outlined in the fifth
Five-Year Plan (1982-86) is to allow market forces to determine the level
and structure of interest rates.  However, there are a number of constrnints
which Tniap it diffiCult to move 4mAi_[tely tn full liber2         t     of

:interest rates including the volatility of international interest rates, the
heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector and the persistence of the gap
between administered and market rates of 7% as measured by the differential
between bank desposit rates and Llhe secondary market yields on bonds and
(iebentures.  ConsequeLILly, Littl GoUveriiitei   ll pursuc a pragnatic, step by
step approach which will involve incremental adjustments of selective rates
to bring them more closely in line with market rates as economic conditions
permit and will concentrate on creating the economic conditions which will
permit the eventual full liberalization of interest rates.
5.        In June 1982, the Government introduced a new interest rate
structure for banking institutions providing for a lending rate of 1'07 an/ a
Aer^4i- vrnta of RT. These rates are positive in real terms given the
current inflation rate of less than 5% and take into account the need to
stimulate economic growth and keep the debt burden to the corporate sector
lower than in the past. The new rates greatly simplifed the previous mulltiple
rate structure by eliminating a number of specialized, subsidized rates and
provided a wider spread betwfeen the deposit and lending rates.
6.        The Government is committed to maintaining positive real rates that
provide for a deposit rate higher than the rate of inflation (as measured by
the consumer price index) and a spread between deposit and lending rates
sufficient to ensure the profitability of the commercial banLks. In setl:ing
interest rates, the Government will also take into account trends in the
domestic economy, the balance of payments position and interest rate move-
ments in international financial markets.  The Government: will also seek to
narrow the differential between the administered and secondary market rates
by making strong efforts to hold down the rate of inflation and thus lower
inflationary expectations. Once this has occurred, the Government wouldl be
in a position to liberalize interest rates so that they are determined by
market forces.
7.        In the meantime, there are two issues which the Government will
address (a) differentiation of rates to take into accoutiL r[sk and tiaturity;
and (b) ...e pu6siT'le weas u. dVoiuJiiig Lie klegdLive consequences for DarLk
profits of fixed rate deposit contracts and variable lending rates.  With
respect to more differentiation in the rate structure, this would ideally be
achieved with the liberalization of interest rates which would allow market
forces to create an appropriate interest differential. Fowever, the
Government is studying some possible interim options which include; (a)
changes in legislated interest rates which would allow the banks to mobilize
longer-term deposits and to charge higher rates for longer-term or high risk
loans; and (b) as a further step towards liberalization, Lthe introdiuction or
new iongerterm savings instruments by commercial banks which would allow them
to raise funds at higher rates with the understanding that these could be lent
with a positive spread or used to buy corporate bonds. Possible instruments
might include large denomination, long-term negotiable certificates of deposit
and bank debentures. In both cases, and: in setting the effective yields on

ANNEX 1

Page 3
pirimary issues on corporate bonds and finance debentures, rates would be
closely related to rates in the secondary markets.
S,.       With respect to the negative effects on bank prof.itability of
variable lending rates and f-ixed deposit contracts, we recognize that the
present system can cause serious financial problems for the commercial banks
and will study this matter further to see whether adjustments in current
banking practice are desirable.
9.        I would be happy to inform the World Bank of the progress in our
study of the issues in paras. 7 and 8 by the end of 1983 aLncl periodically
thereafter.
Liberalization of Commercial Banks
10.       The longer-term policy objective of the Government is to enharnce
Korea-s economic growth prospects by improving efficiency and competitiveness
of the financial sector, and particularly of its most important component, the
commercial banking sector.  These objectives will be achieved by the privati-
zation of bank's ownership, the licensing of new banks, greater autonomy of
management and a broadened scope of activities in order tc, reduce specializa-
tion and increase competition.
11.       With respect to privatization of ownership, four of the five rLation-
wide commercial banks have already been denationalized. Government ownership
in the fifth one will be sold in March 1983. In order to prevent ownershi'p
control by a single interest group, restrictions were place on maximum equity
holdings and voting rights. Two new jo.int venture banks have been authorized
and established in 1982 and the Government is committed to encouraging further
new entries to the commercial banking system. Competition in the financial
sector will also be encouraged by the licensing of 43 new mutual savings and
finance companies and 10 short-term finance companies in 1982. In order to
increase management efficiency and entrepreneurship in the- banking sector, the
Government has greatly reduced its controls over bank organization, budget: and
staffing.  The Korea Bankers  Association agreement has also been revised to
eliminate restrictions of competition such as prescribed charges and .Rqrvuijce
f P,C q
12,       To fiirther qtrenorlen their canital hase, the commercial banks are
planning to increase their equity by 30% in 1983. To furthe!r strengthen the
earning potential of the banlcs and foster competition within the financial
system, the Government will authorize banks to undertake new activities
including trust activities, rautual savings deposits, short-term commercial
paper, credit cards, factoring and underwriting of governrenit securities.
Additional measures will also be introdu-ced to increase competition among
banks by permitting an expansion in the geographical coverage of regional
banks and broadening the activities of the specialized banks. The Financial
Review Committee, as a matter of priority, will during 1983 c.onsider possible
adjustments in the role of specialized banks to give them greater latitude in

raising and lending resources. I will be happy to keep the World Bank
informed of developments, particularly since several of these institutions are
clients of the World Bank. With respect to the possible future role of KDB,
the Government recognizes that if KDB is authorized to expand substantially
its commercial activities, it will be essential to segregate its funding, and
accounts as a commercial entity from those as a government agent and ensure
that KDB in its commercial role does not compete with the private sector
relying on preferential treatment from the Government.
13.       As noted earlier, the profitability of the commercial banks in 1982,
was low. However, this is expected to be a temporary phenomenon as the recent
increase in the banks interest spread to 2% is expected to improve profits.
the Government plans to adjust interest: rates and spreads to eliminate
subsidies on the Central Bank rediscounts when the profitability of banks has
improved to a satisfactory level. Recognizing the need to improve skills in
the banking sector, the Government will play an active role in assisting
the banks to develop effective training programs for their staff.
Bank Supervision
14.       The privatization and deregulation of the commercial banks has
brought with it the need to revise the system of bank supervision. The
Government is moving from a system of ex ante involvement in the operations of
commercial banks to a system of supervision involving ex post review of
performance based on standards established by the Government. This new system
will be put into effect during 1983. The Monetary Board and the Superinten-
dant of Banks are in the process of training staff to develop the skills
needed for effective bank supervision in the new system.  The Government is
also considering the possibility of unifying supervisory functions for banks
and nonbank financial intermediaries as a response to the decreasing speciali-
zation of financial institutions which is a central feature of the financial
sector reform.
Directed Credit
15.       The longer-term objective oE the financial sector liberalization is
to ensure that efficient resource allocation is taking place on the basis of
market prices.  The Government will therefore gradually reduce the proportion
of directed credit in total domestic credit.
115.      Major steps have already beeni taken by the Government towards
reducing the importance of directed credit. The number of existing directed
credit programs has been reduced and the creation of new types of selective
lending will be discouraged. The interest rate subsidies associated with the
directed credit programs have been elirninated by bringing their lending rate
to the same level as the general lending rate of 10%.  In addition, the
a:Llocation of funds under the directed credit programs is now done on a broad
sectoral basis rather than enterprise by enterprise as a means of increasing
the autonomy of resource allocation by handling banks.

17.       In the future, the NIF program, which amounted to q.4% of total
domestic credit to the private sector in 1981 and 9.3% in 1982 will be
gradually reduced.  In line with this reduction, the Government will adjust
downward the contribution made by banks to NIF from their deposit resources.
In accordance with the policy of liberalizing the activities of the commercial
banks, responsibility for handling the NIF program will be fully transferred
to th^p    l2ized banks by the end of 19Q4.  Moreover, it is the Government's
intention that directed credit programs, including NIF, will continue tc,
operate on a non-subsidized basis in the future.
Corporate Indebtedness
18.       The package of policy measures adopted by the Government in JtLne
1982 to stimulate the economy has had a favorable impact on the profitability
of the corporate sector. The lower int:erest rates which reduced borrowing
costs and the reduction of the corporate tax rates have combined to improve
the financial position of firms. Efforts have also been made to improve! the
incentive to retain earnings and improve the equity position of enterprises
through a tax exemption on reserves andL alleviation of the tax on assumed
dividends for closed corporations.
19.       In the future, the Government: will continue to help reduce the debt
burden of the corporate sector by maintaining optimum growth and restraining
inflation. The prime bank system will be strengthened so that it can perform
an increasing role in improving the financial management and structure of
enterprises. The prime banks will be encouraged to liquidate outstanding
loans to enterprises which are insolvent and unpromising. The Government
will also consider measures to foster t:he development of the equity market by
encouraging long-term contractual savers such as insurance companies and
pension funds to invest in stocks.

Korea Long-Term Credit Bank
Development Strategy 1983-1984
In line with the Governmental policy to liberalize the financial
sector, the competition among financial institutions in Korea is expected to
grow substantially in the future. In specific, such Governmental measures as
(a)the gradual eclipse of controls on financial sector, (b)  privatization of
commercial banks, (c) licensing of new commercial banks, and (d) expansion of
non-bank financial institutions are expected to enhance the competition.
Accordingly, KLB's Development Strategy for 1983-84 is focused on equipping
itself with the capability to effectively cope with the increasing
competition.
1. Expansion of Business Scope
The Bank will continue its efforts to diversify its services
through expansion of business scope.  To this end, KLB will pay particular
attention to the following aspects:
(a)  expansion of services through its existing business lines,
especially those newly developed ones such as:
(i) mortgage bond trust business
(ii) securities lending business
(b)  expansion of business lines through development of new
financial products under the present legal framework, such
as debenture installment savings scheme.
(c)  expansion of legal base as a full-fledged bank through revision
of the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB) Act.
I[I. Resource Mobilization
a. Issuance of debentures
KLB will endeavor to expand its local currency resources by conti-
nuously increasing the issuance of debentures. Also, the Bank will conl:inue
:Lts efforts to develop new financial instruments such as the pre-redeemable
debentures, floating rate debentures, and installment purchase debentures.
KLB plans to issue W 180 billion in face value in 1983 and W 240 billion in
1984.

b. Inducement of short-term savings
The Bank will continue to expand its short-term local currency
resources by actively inducing deposits, for which KLB plans to mobilize
W 25 billion by the end of 1984 on an outstanding balance basis.
c. Mobilization of foreign exchange resources
The Bank plans to raise a total of US$420 million during the
strategy period. KLB will continuously expand tapping commercial capital
market to supplement its foreign exchange resources in addition to its
official resources.
d. Providing longer-term loans
KLB will endeavor to develop attractive longer term instruments
through continously study on the Korean capital market. In line with the
mobilization of longer-term local currency resorces, KLB will continue its
efforts to lengthen the maturity of its local currency loans so as to meet the
increasing demand for longer term local currency loans.
III. Resource Allocation
a. Integrated financial services
KLB will endeavor to provide integrated financial services to its
clients. So far, KLB's financial assistance to its clients has been rather
simple; however, in line with the expansion of its business scope, the bank
will provide integrated financial services to its clinets so as to expand
further the width and depth of its clientele.
b. Reinforcement of developmental role
KLB will continue to pursue its developmental roles by enlarging
strategic investment in private industries which are conducive to deepening of
industrial structure, enhancing of comrpetitiveness in export markets, and to
technology development.
c.  Assistance to small and medium industry
KLB will continue to give due attention to the fostering of small
and medium industry (SMI).  To this erid, the Bank will maintain its polizy to
provide, in principle, more than 20% of its total incremental financing to
SMI.

IV. Branch Network
a. Basic direction
KLB will continue to pursue wholesale banking and accordingly it
would not increase branches as fast as commercial banks do. Nonetheless, KLB
plans to have a nationwide branch network by establishing one branch in each
of the nation's major cities. In addition, the Bank will continue to open new
subbranches in relation to its promotion of debenture sales.
b. Expansion plan for 1983-84
KLB plans to establish additional subbranches in Seoul area in 1983
and a branch in local city in 1984 so as to effectively serve its clients
through a wider geographical coverage. The Bank will expand branch network in
coming years as its business expands and its staff accumulate relavant
expertise.
V. Organizational Development
a. Business Promotion Center
In an attempt to inject vitality into its business activities, the
Bank established the Business Promotion Center in October 1982. As the Center
proved to be conducive to marketing of both debentures and loans, KLB plans to
embody the Center into its organization.
b. Personnel management
KLB will make best efforts not only to recruit high quality staff,
but also to train its personnel, through implementation of effective personnel
training. Especially, KLB will endeavor to enhance the role of the middle
management and their professionalism including female junior officers, through
adequate training.
c. Computerization
The Bank is now in the process of computerization of its operational
data with the goal of eventually attaining a management information system
(MIS) in the future. During the strategy period, the Bank will be equipped
with the on-line system for its debenture operations.
VI. Public Relations
KLB will continue to enhance its image as a private development
bank, which recognizes its social responsibility. In this vein, KLB will:
