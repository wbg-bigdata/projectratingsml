Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:            Kingdom of Nepal
Amount:              SDR 44.7 million (US$47.5 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard
Project              The project would provide a means to integrate the far
DescriDtion:       western part of Nepal with the rest of the country
through completion of an all-weather East-West Highway;
to improve traffic conditions between Kathmandu and
Birganj at the Indian border through selective
rehabilitation of bridges and road pavements; and to
strengthen the construction and maiatenance capability
of the Borrower. It would construct about 204 km of
the East-West Righway including a bridge over Karnali
(Chisapani) River and feeder roads, rehabilitate about
82 km of the Mugling-Naubise road, provide maintenance
equipment, technical assistance and training. The major
project benefits would be (a) the integration of the
far western part of Nepal with the country's economy;
(b) increased realization of benefits from investments
in agricultural production in the western region; and
Cc) reduced cost of road maintenance and operation of
vehicles through road rehabilitation on the major road
link with India. Risks related to construction delays
would be minimized through provision for construction
supervision during all stages.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDRs 44.7 million (US$47.5
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highway
Project. The cofinanciers of the project are the Saudi Fund for Development
(SFD) with a loan of USS30.8 million equivalent and the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) with a grant of US$19.7 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The most recent economic report, Nepal:  Recent Develcpments and
Selected Is6ues in Trade Promotion (Report No. 4663-NEP), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on October 19, 1983. The principal features and
recent performance of the economy are described below. Country data are
shown in Annex I.
3.      Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world.  Per
capita income is estimated at US$157 (1982/83) and health and education
gtandards are below the average for South Asia: life expectancy at birth
is only about 45 years; infant mortality, about 148 per thousand; and adult
literacy, only 19 percent. The population, estimated to be 15.8 million
(1982/83), grew at a rate of about 2.6 percent per year during 1971 and 1981.
About 95 percent of the population live in rural areas.
4.      Population density with respect to arable land (356 per sq km) has
reached very high levels, and cultivation has been extended on to marginal
lands and forests. Forests have been further denuded to meet the growing
demand for fuelwood, on which Nepal depends for over 90 percent of its energy
consumption, mostly for household cooking and heating. On account of
deforestation and excessive grazing on the hills and mountains, with high
rainfall, there is accelerated soil erosion leading to silting of rivers,
downstream flooding and loss of agricultural productivity all along.
5.      Agriculture, largely rainfed, still accounts for nearly 60 percent of
Nepal's GDP and 80 percent of merchandise exports, and provides the main
source of livelihood to over 90 percent of the population. Crop production
accounts for about 60 percent of agricultural output, livestock for 30
1/  Substantially unchanged from the Karnali Preparation Project Phase I
(Report No. P-3737-NEP) of March 1, 1984.



percent, and forestry for 10 percent. Paddy is the principal food crop
(planted on about half of the total cropped area), followed by maize, wheat,
millet and barley. Cash crops (oilseeds, jute, sugarcane and tobacco) are
grown on about 10 percent of the cropped area. About 15 percent of total
rural incomes rise from non-agricultural activities, of which the cottage
industry subsector is one of the more important generating employment for
over one million people on a part-cime basis.
6.      Apart frm= agricultural land, Nepal's only other important
exploitable resources are hydropower and tourist attractions. The exploita-
tion of the vast hydropower resources beyond that required to satisfy the
country's own power demand, however, will depend crucially orn Nepal's ability
to enter complex financial, exploitation and export agreements with neighbor-
ing countries.  The tourism sector, based on Nepal's mountain environment and
its rich cultural heritage, has been dynamic, though it accounts for only
about 1 percent of GDP. Tourism now provides about 20 percent of the
country's foreign excharge earnings.  About 60 percent of earnings from
tourism are retained in Nepal.
7.      Following centuries of self-imposed isolation, efforts to develop the
economy of Nepal began in the mid-1950s against extremely heavy odds. The
country had virtually no physical infrastructure, an ancient administrative
system, and very limited educational and health services. The resource base
is relatively narrow and its development hindered by the difficult topography
and landlocked position. Against this background, Nepal's primary develop-
ment objective for 20 years, between 1955 and 1975, was to build basic
infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future economic growth. The
country has made good progress in pursuit of that objective. It now has a
basic road network linking many economic centers. Kathmandu and a few other
tow-ns have basic utilities and public transport. Schools have been built for
almost half of the primary school age children and there are a number of high
schools and a national university. A rudimentary hospital system, including
rural health posts, has been built. Some progress has also been made in
establishing the institutional framework for agricultural ard industrial
development, including extension and research activities, financial institu-
tions and industrial enterprises. Yet in all these areas, the country has a
long way to go to achieve a level of development comparable to other develop-
ing countries; for example, the public and private 'nst'tutions in Nepal must
continue to expand and upgrade essential physical facilities, acquire the
necessary expertise in handling economic and financial affairs, build up
adequate technical and managerial cadres, and establish merit-based systems
of personnel management.
8.      The Fifth Plan (1975/76-1979/80) marked a shift in development
objectives, with increased emphasis being placed on acceleration of economic
growth, employment creation, and raising the living standards of the
population. These objectives have been reiterated in the Sixth Plan
(1980/81-1984/85). Moreover, the stated strategy of the Sixth Plan quite
appropriately (a) accords high priority to developing agriculture, small-
scale industries and Nepal's abundant water resources; (b) stresses soil
conservation and population control; and (c) emphasizes full utilization of
existing infrastructure and alleviation of absorptive capacity constraints,
including human resource development.  The development strategy also calls
for increased involvement of the private sector in agriculture,
manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction and transport operations.



-3-
Investment expenditures, supported by growing foreign assistance, have
increased rapidly over the last two Plans, from USS146 million (9 percent of
GDP) in 1974/75 to about US$390 million (15 percent of GDP) in 1981/82, and
there have been substantial shifts in the composition of spending away from
transport to agriculture, power and social services. GDP growth, however,
has barely kept up with that of population.
9.      Part of the explanation for this stagnation lies in factors beyond
Nepal's control such as the difficult topography and the poor resource base.
But factors within Nepal's control have also contributed.  Severe project
implementation problems have been encountered by Government and donors alike
in most sectors of the economy, thereby lowering the rate of growth of capi-
tal formation. In addition, the expected returns on those investments which
took place often did not materialize largely because necessary complementary
investments or current spending were lacking, and because of managerial
deficiencies. A good example is the agriculture sector. In the past, insuf-
ficient attention was paid to bringing water down to the farm level and this
was compounded by inadequate support services such as extension and research,
by the lack of timely supplies of improved seed, fertilizer and other inputs
such as credit, by the lack of farm-to-market roads, and by very low producer
margins. Future development of irrigation and agriculture would therefore
need to emphasize complementary investments, improvements in agricultural
input supplies and adequate producer margins.
10.     The shortage of funds for current spending needs to be addressed by
further efforts at domestic resource mobilization. In recent years, Nepal's
efforts to mobilize resources have focussed on tightening income tax assess-
ment and collection; on discretionary measures largely in the area of
indirect taxes; and on reducing subsidies to public enterprises. While there
has, as a result, been a steady increase in revenues, the tax structure
remain inelastic. Some scope exists for increasing Nepal's tax elasticity
by shifting items on the indirect tax schedules from a specific to an ad
valorem basis. There also seems to be scope for increasing yields from the
land tax, urban property taxes and income taxes.
11.     Over the past two years, several positive steps have been taken to
strengthen public sector management. These steps have included increases in
the traditionally low civil service salaries, establishment of public service
training facilities, simDlification of budgetary procedures accompanied by
stricter enforcement of expenditure ac^ounting, and granting of more autonomy
to public enterprises in matters concerning personnel and pricing policies.
The implementation of these administrative reforms would have to be pursued
by a high-level monitoring of important administrative issues such as
appointment of competent staff, job security and decision-making authority.
Also, public enterprise reform needs to be pursued by measures aimed at
reducing costs and increasing efficiency. In this regard, the Government has
taken initial steps, subjecting public enterprises to increased competition
from the private sector through l-beralization of licensing in industry,
transport and small-scale hydropower generation. At the same time, the
Government has involved the private sector in the ownership and control of
public enterprises through the sale of shares to private investors.
12.     Because of slow economic growth, Nepal's balance of payments has been
characterized by widening trade deficits, partly offset by surpluses from
invisibles. The current account deficit (averaging USS100 million annually



-4-
during 1979/80-1981/82) has traditionally been more than macched by inflows
of official grants and concessional loans (averaging US$128 million annually
during 1979/80-1981/82), leading to surpluses in the overall balance of
payments in most years. Nevertheless, foreign exchange reserves have
declined from being equivalent to about one year of imports in the early
1970s to six months in 1982, and four moaths in mid-1983.
13.     To sustain and further develop its economy, Nepal must mobilize
additional free foreign exchange through export promotion and efficient
i=port substitution. Improving agricultural production, rural incomes and
food distribution within the country is a major way of doing so, if only to
avoid the need to import and distribute large quantities of foodgrains in the
future. Agricultural development also remains the key to a gradual expansion
of Nepal's traditional merchandise exports. In addition, development of
energy resources is a major means to strengthening the balance of payments by
reducing the need to import fuel and opening up an export potential.
Recently, Nepal has legislated a wide range of fiscal and administrative
incentives for industrial investors and exporters, particularly in the
private sector. The implementation of these incentives, and the alleviation
of the severe transport and transit constraints facing the country's trade
sector, must constitute essential elements of a trade promotion strategy for
Nepal.
14.     Nepal is faced with highly challenging prospects and tasks in
addressing its multiple long-term development problems. While it attempts
to mobilize domestic resource to finance about 40-50 percent of development
expenditures, external assistance, at concessional terms, will continue to be
a vital factor in financing investment and effecting economic growth. In
the last three years, aid commitments to Nepal have averaged about USS250
million per year, almost entirely in the form of grants and concessional
credits with grant elements in excess of 70 percent.  Aid disbursements have
grown from about USS110 million in 1979/80 to an estimated USS175 million in
1982/83. Nearly 70 percent of total aid disbursements have come from members
of the Nepal Aid Group, formed in 1976 and aow comprising eight DAC countries
and four multilateral agencies.
15.     At the end of fiscal year 1983, Nepal's official foreign debt out-
standing will have been expected to amount to US$340 million. As virtually
all loans have been concessional, debt service payments, including payments
to the IMF, have remained small in relation to exports of goods and services.
In 1983/84, debt service payments will amount to about USS18 million, equiv-
alent to 6 percent of exports of goods and services. Over the medium term,
these payments are projected to remain at less than 10 percent of Nepal's
exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANM GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
16.     3ank Group operations in Nepal began in 1969 with an IDA credit of
USS1.7 million equivalent for a telecommunications project. Since then, 35
additional credits have been approved, bringing total IDA assistance to Nepal
to USS500.3 million equivalent, net of cancellations.  In view of Nepal's
many develoDment needs, this assistance has been for projects in a wide
variety of sectors. Six of these sectors account for about 87 percent of



-5-
IDA credits by original amount: irrigation/agriculture (US$173.0 million
for 14 projects); water supply and sewerage (US$46.8 million for 3 projects);
power and energy (US$168.0 million for a projects); telecommunications
(US$21.7 million for 3 projects); highways (US$19.5 million for 2 projects);
and rural development (US$19.0 million for 2 projects). The- proposed credit
would be the first in FY85.  No Bank loans have been made to Nepal.  IFC made
its first investment in Nepal (US$3.1 million) in a hotel project in
Kathmandu in 1975. In addition, IFC approved a loan of US$5.6 million equiv-
alent to Nepal Orind Magnesite (Private) Limited (a private company) in March
1982. The loan has helped finance a US$24.9 million project to mine and
process magnesite ore. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC operations as of March 31, 1984.
17.     Bank Group lending to Nepal so far has been modest compared to the
country's need for external assistance. The international community has
shown considerable interest in Nepal's economic development and, to date, the
shortage of funds has not been a major bottleneck. The main constraint on
the utilization of increased aid has been Nepal's limited absorptive
capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation and implementation. The
Bank Group has provided assistance to the Government in project preparation
through two Technical Assistance Credits (Credit Nos. 659-NEP and 1379-NEP)
and by acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance
projects financed by UNDP. Furthermore, the present Resident Representative
ia Kathmandu has had a significant impact in improving project implementation
performance. As a result, the rate of disbursements is improving: during
FY82, FY83, and FY84, USS28.5, US$37.4, US$26.0 million equivalent,
respectively, was disbursed compared to an annual average disbursement of
about US$17 million during the previous five fiscal years. Project comple-
tion reports have been prepared for six projects: First Telecommunications
(Credit No. 156-NEP), First Highways (Credit No. 223-NEP), Tourism (Credit
No. 291-NEP), Birganj Irrigation (Credit No. 373-NEP), Settlement Project
(Credit No. 505-NEP), and Bhairawa-Lumbini (Credit No. 654).
18.     The Bank Group's current lending strategy places emphasis on assist-
ing the Government in its efforts to contain the high level of population
growth, address major constraints in the country's development of human
resources and promote agricultural development. Selected infrastructure
investments, mostly in transport, telecommunications and power, will also
be undertaken to alleviate serious development constraints. In population, a
project is being prepared by the Government and there is donor interest to
cofinance various components. For the development of human resources, IDA
has recently financed a primary education project. Other IDA-supported
activities under preparation include agricultural manpower, engineering
education, vocational and secondary education projects. For agriculture, the
basic objective is to assist Nepal maintain overall foodgrain self-
sufficiency and, where possible, promote exports of agricultural products and
encourage aff-orestation efforts. Projects under preparation would extend the
assistance provided so far by building irrigation infrastructure mainly in
the Terai to increase paddy production and help reduce the food deficits in
the Hills. Both would be accomplished through irrigation and rural develop-
ment projects which would emphasize increased food production and through
specific Hill food projects.



-6-
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.     Historically, transport in Nepal has been by porters and, to a lesser
extent, by pack animals. Although these means of transportation are still
important, a road network began to develop in the country in the 1950s, with
the Government's emphasis on building infrastructure. In the Terai, it
started with an east-west connection, and in the Kathmandu Valley with access
to the Indian border in the south and the Chinese border in the north. To
complement this developing network, numerous alrports and short-takeoff-and-
landing airfields have been built in various parts of the country.
20.     In the past, transport demand has been local in nature, limited to
commerce between adjacent villages and rural areas in the hills. Growth of
settlement in the Terai with the consequent increase of trade with India has
resulted in an Increase in the transport demand in a north-south direction.
While exports to India cross the border at many points, most imports from
India and other places enter Nepal through Birganj/Raxaul, and shipments
destined for Kathmandu are increasing. The transport demand is now growing
in an east-west direction because of recent emphasis the Government has
placed on integration of the country and development of the east-west highway
system.
21.     Transport by railroad, ropeway and waterway is insignificant in
Nepal. There are three separate narrow gauge railway lines with a total
length of 89 km; two of which are connected to the Indian Railways. The
third is used seasonally to transport materials to maintain the Kosi Barrage.
The only ropeway, between Kathmandu and Retauda, has a length of 42 km, and
hand-les about 30,000 tons of goods annually. Because of mountainous terrain,
high fluctuations of seasonal flows of the rivers and their draft conditions,
use of waterways in Nepal is negligible.
Coordination
22.     All modern modes of transport are regulated and/or operated by the
Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT). In the 1970s, some assistance in
transport planning was provided by a transport economist financed by the
UNDP.  Because of the relative infancy of the transport system and the
dominant position of roads, problems of intermodal competition are minimal.
Proposed investment plans are reviewed by the Planning Commission and final
approval for implementation rests with the Ninistry of Finance.
Transport Regulation
23.     Licensing restrictions on trucks and buses are few.  The government-
owned National Transport Corporation (NTC) sets passenger fares, which are
periodically reviewed and revised upward, but does not regulate road freight
rates. Regulations governing vehicle weights and dimensions presently do not
exist; however, ADB is financing a brief survey of the system of road user
charges and the findings will be reviewed by the Bank with a view to design-
ing a follow-up study on appropriate charges (para. 32). NTC operates a
popular and financially viable trolley bus service in the Kathmandu Valley.
NTC also, in direct competition with the private sector, provides extensive



-7-
trucking services for government cargo carried between Kathmandu and the
major transport crossings from India. In the past, NTC's truck operations
have been impaired by neglect and poor management. Under a UNDP-financed
Road Transport Development Project, efforts are being made to bring about
improvements and reduce financial losses. There has already been some
progress in this area. The Association believes there is further room for
improvement and has asked NTC to collect detailed operating statistics in
order to help pinpoint specific problem areas. Some of these issues will be
examined in a containerization study scheduled to commence in the fall of
1984. Among other objectives, this study will also define NTC's role,
propose how to improve its financial/operational performance and suggest ways
to strengthen the staff.
The Highway Subsector
24.     Although road transport dominates the sector, the total road network
is still very small relative to the size of the country. The road network
currently consists of a total of 5,546 km of which 2,484 are paved, 830 are
gravel, and 2,232 are unimproved earth roads. The surfaced roads and a large
portion of the earth roads are managed by the Department of Roads (DOR) under
the Ministry of Works and Transport; the remainder of the earth roads are
managed by the local panchayats. The three main national highways are: (a)
the north-south road from Kathmandu to the Indian border at Birganj (Raxaul)
and north to the Chinese border; (b) the north-south road connecting Bhairawa
near the Indian border with Pokhara which is connected with Kathmandu to its
east; and (c) the East-West Highway in the Terai which, when completed, would
traverse the entire breadth of the country.  A number of roads in the Terai
are not connected to the basic system and vast areas of the hills and moun-
tains are not served by roads at all.
25.     Road traffic in Nepal has been growing at the rate of about 5 to 8
percent annually during the past years, with the rate varying on different
roads. The average daily traffic (ADT) on the most heavily used road,
Birganj-Hetauda (north-south), is 500 vehicles; for rural roads ADT is about
100-150 vehicles. Available vehicle registration statistics indicate the
presence of about 36,000 vehicles in Nepal, of which 50 percent are trucks
and buses. With no information on scrapping being available, it is probable
that about two-thirds of the registered vehicles are operating.
Institutional Aspects
26.     DOR is responsible for the construction, maintenance and planning of
all national roads. DOR has recently been decentralized in order to better
enable it to administer and oversee bilateral and multilateral projects
scattered throughout the country with a phased expansion plan to match the
growth of the network. However, staff performance has sufferred because of
low compensation and frequent reassignments.
27.     There is a need for a greater number of qualified professional staff
as well as trained personnel at the lower levels to plan, program and manage
road development projects and maintain them properly. UNDP has a project to
train mechanics which is being implemented by ILO, and IDA is financing the
equipment required for this training under the Second Highway Credit. ODA,
after financing construction of two sections of the East-West Highway, has
agreed with DIG to establish and finance for a three-year period a road



-8-
remedial works unit to undertake major repair of those sections.  Consultants
will implement the project and their services will be complemented by coun-
terpart st3ff from DOR. This project will be a valuable venue for practical
in-service training in maintenance procedures for DOR staff at operational
levels.
Planning and Finance
28.     Planning in the highway sector (excluding panchayat roads) is the
responsibilicy of DOR, the National Planning Commission, and the Xinistry of
Finance. Priorities are to integrate the eastern and western parts of the
country into t'ne national economy (i.e., complecion of the East-West
Highway), and to provide access to the hill areas. DOR's budget is based on
an annual allocation under the five-year plan. For FY83 (che latest figures
available), the budget was XRs 910 million (USS58.0 million equivalent)
including funds from muLtilateral and bilateral agencies; it included NRs 25
million for routine road maintenance and NRs 141.2 million for periodic and
emergency maintenance. Revenues are derived mainly from custom duties on
vehicles and fuel, vehicle taxes, licenses and road cess.
Design and Construction
29.     The Design Section of DOR is generally well-equipped to handle hill
road programs and minor projects; major projects are handled by foreign
consultants. Large projects, which attract foreign contracting firms, are
also usually implemented through them. There has been limited development of
the local contracting industry. The largest domestic construction firm,
-National Construction Company of Nepal, is a parastatal organization which
dominates the local market for civil works. However, despite its advantages
of being one of the largest construction firms in the country and government
linanced, its performance, particularly in road construction, has not been
satisfactory. An assessment of Nepal's construction industry was made by the
Bank in 1977/78 and updated in 1983. The principal recommendations for
development of the construction industry made in the report were:
appropriately packaged contracts, easier lending requirement for guarantees,
easier credit facilities for contractors, and availability of equipment
rental pool. DOR's ability to implement these recommendations has been
constrained by limited resources. However, HMG has recently approached the
German Government for assistance in strengthening the construction industry.
Maintenance
30.     Extremes of topography and climatic conditions make maintenance of
the road network in Nepal very difficult. As a consequence of the increasing
workload and DOR's past inability to cope with it effectively, some sections
of the key roads in Nepal cannot be restored to good condition without exten-
sive rehabilitation or reconstruction as proposed in this project.
Additionally, with decentralization, DOR is also facing critical shortages of
equipment and skilled manpower. Both of these problems are addressed by the
oroposed project.
31.     In spite of recent increases in the road maintenance budget
(para. 28), the latter is still inadequate. The present condition of the
network and anticipated wear and tear of the road due to movement of heavily-
laden traffic from India, indicate an urgent need to increase the current



allocatioa for Maintenance. For fiscal year 1983, the Government allocated
NI.s 25 million =or routine maintenance along with NRs 141.2 million for
periodic and emergency maintenance. HIG agreed to set aside NRs 40 million
nore in FY35 for routine maintenance.  To enscure a reasonable share of main-
.enance in the general budget in the future and to bring annual allocations
more in line -with actual needs, -'G has agreed that by each March 31, begin-
ning on 1arch 31, 1985, it- will estabLish, in consultation with the
Association, a satisfactory level of annual allocation for road maiatenance
(Section 4.03(a), Develoeant Credit Agreement).
32.    'With operation of more vehicles in the highway system there would be
Treater need for its maintenance and opportunity should be taken now to
retrieve from the operators a proportion of the cost of maintenance.  To this
end, a policy of annually taxing heavy vehicles according to their unladen
zwe`ghts should be considered for all Nepalese operators, with suitable
arrangements made to capture revenues from foreign truckers.  The Asian
Development Bank is currently financing a review of road user charges, col-
lection methods, payments for different vehicle types in relation to axle
weights, and t;he relationships between road revenues and expenditures.  When
the findings of the IflB-financed study are available, a tripartite review
will be undertaken by HNG, ADB and IDA to determine how best to carry out a
follow-up study on appropriate levels and structure of charges, as well as
improved collection methods.
Bank ZxDerience in the Sector
33.     The proposed credit would be the third IDA operation for transport in
Nepal, the previous two also being for roads. The first, Credit No. 223-NIEP
(USS2.5 million), effective in February 1971, financed the replacement of
five narrow, understrength road bridges, the construction of five pedestrian
suspension bridges for porter traffic, a four-year road maintenance program
and consulting services and technical assistance. The project was satisfac-
torily completed in June 1977 but not without considerable delays due to
shortages oc materials and inefficiencies in administration.
34.     The second, Credit 730-NNE? (USS17.0 aillion), still in progress, is
anticipated to close in December 1984. It comprises the upgrading of about
18 km of a mountainous section of the main road from India to Kathmandu, the
construction of about 50 k= of feeder roads, the procurement of construction
equipment for use by the feeder road contractars, consultancy services for
technical and ecoaomic studies of further roads and a training program for
mechanics.  The civil works component is almost completed.  Ull the equipment
has been procured and is in use, and the consultants' studies have been made,
sone of which form the basis of the presently proposed project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.     Engineeriag of the East-West iighway component of the project was
carried out by Norconsulz (Norway) in the basis of their feasibility study.
Design of the 46 Km of highway to the east uas prepared by McDonald and
Partners (UK) in oarallel with their design of the Babai Irrigation Project,
which is under consi-deration for possible IDA financing. This arrangement
was so made as it was felt at the rime of appraisal that the 3abai scheme



-10-
would be implemented coasiderablY in advance of the proposed Third Highway
Project and par: of the highway would be needed to provide access to the
irrigation canal works as they both share a common right of way.  The design
of the Karnali Bridge has been prepared by Steinmani, Boynton, Groncuist and
3irdsall (USA). The preliminary engineering and economic studies of the road
rehabilitation component were carried out by N.D. Lea (Canada), who is also
expected to prepare the final engineering and render documents.  A report
entitled Nezal - Third Highwav Project: Staff Anoraisal Reoort (Nc.
4763-REP) is beiag distributed separately.  Techaical discussions were held
in Washington, D.C. from April 12-16, and the negotiations on April 17. 1984.
MLr. K. D. AdhLikary, Secretary. Ministrv of Finance. reoresented His
MaJesty's Govern-ent ac the technical discussions; and Xr. I.B. Shrestha,
Special Secretary, NIinisrry of Law and justice headed the delegation for the
negotiations.
Project Objectives
36.     The main objectives of the project are:
(a)  to provide a dependable means of integrating the far west of
the country into the national economy, through the completion
of an all-w-eather East-West Highway and feeder roads;
(b)  to improve traffic conditions betweea Kathmandu and Birganj
near the Indiaa border by the selective rehabilitation of
bridges and roads; and
Cc)  to strengthen the operations and administration of DOR; in
particular, to improve its capability to implement and monitor
both road maiatenance and the project coaponents by providing
it with technical assistance, equipment and training.
Project DescriDtion
37.     The project consists of the following:
(a)  completion of Nepal's East-West Highway through the construction
of' approximately 204 km of the final western section from Kohalpur
to the border with india at the Mahakali River, including a
major bridge over the Karnali River at Chisapani.
(b)  construction of about 60 km of feeder roads linking the main
areas of agricultural production in the influence areas of the
Karnali River northwards to the project road;
(c)  rehabilitation/=aintenance of about 82 km of the Lsthmandu-3irganj
road, including selected bridges;
(d)  procurement of equipment for road saintenance and a materials
laboratory, off-ice equipment and inspection vehicles; and
(e)  technical assistance and training.
38.     The Sast-West Highway when completed, with a length of about 1,040
km, will span the -whole breadth of Nepal.  About 850 km of this road nas



-11-
alreadv been built with assistance from India, the Soviet Union, UK and the
US. In a section of this length, a major bridge over the Rapti River was
seriously damaged bv flooding during construction. EHG has confirmed that
work for reconstruction of the bridge is under way.  HNG agreed that the
reconstruction of the bridge would be completed prior to the completion of
construction of the portion of the East-West Highway under the proposed
project (Section 3.03, Development Credit Agreement). Completion of the last
204 km between Kohalpur and Mahakali will open the far western pact of the
country to all-weather access from Kathmandu. Presently, such access is only
in the dry season through limited air transport and jeeps or through India.
The road alignment skirts north of the Terai and following the Siwalik
foothills crosses the Karnali River at the Chisapani gorge, where a major
bridge -would be built. The alignment would cross the Xarnali Wild Life
Reserve for about 15 km to the east of the Karnali River. An adequate action
plan involving such controls as entry and exit posts, limitations on night-
travel, monitoring of road traffic, provision of unierpasses, etc. has been
agreed between DOR and the Department of Wild Life. Enactment of appropriate
legislation by HEG to implement the conservancy measures under the plan would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 6.01'd),
Development Credit Agreement). The project also provides for construction of
a network of gravel surfaced feeder roads west of the Karnali River to
provide access to the highway from the more populated areas to the south.
39.     Nepal's principal land link with the south runs from its border with
India near Birganj northwards to the junction with the East-West Righway at
Hetauda, west along that route to Narayangarh, north to Xugling and then east
to Kathmandu via Naubise and Thankot.  While some sections of the road are in
fairly good condition, others are nor.  The surface of Birganj-Hetauda road
is broken and deformed; five bridges on this road are more than fifty years
old and need replacement. The project will rehabilitate this section of the
road and reconstruct the bridges. It will rehabilitate and improve the road
seccion between Naubise and Mugling whose pavement is structurally deficient
and has insufficient width.  It will also rehabilitate two bridges on the
Thankot-Naubise road which are structurally deficient and have inadequate
access for larger vehicles.
40.     The project provides for the purchase of equipment for road main-
tenance and repair. A list of equipment needed for effective execution of
road rehabilitation and maintenance work has been agreed with DOR. Equipment
would also be provided for several materials testing laboratories (one
already existing and several more to be established). For handling of
routine tasks, like recording and updating of road inventory, instant iden-
tification of remedial works, inventories of materials and spare parts, the
project would $inance a computer for DOR. Acquisition of the computer would
help DOR with its staffing shortage problems and would be very useful to its
design office.
41.     With an increasing workload and inadequacy of staff to cope with it,
DOR is in need of expert assistance. The project, therefore, provides for 36
months of expert services for assisting DOR in the management of the road
subsector. The project also provides for six months of services of an expert
to assist HMG in determining how best to implement a policy of taxing heavy
vehicles according to load capacity. In addition to such technical
assistance, the project will also provide training to the younger profession-
als of DOR in: (a) the planning, evaluation and programming of projects; (b)



-12-
design and construction of projects; and (c) modern workshop practices and
equipment operation, for a total of 265 months.  The project would also
continue the training of mechanics initiated under the Second Highway
Project. The scope of the tralning would be broadened to include maintenance
oa equipment and maintenance practices and techniques for supervisory
personnel.
Project Cost and FinancinR
42.     The total cost of the project is estimated at about USSl16 million
equivalent (including taxes and duties of aboutUSS13.1 million equivalent) of
-which about US$86.9 million or approximately 75 percent would be in foreign
exchange. The proposed MDA credit of USS47.5 million equivalent would
afinance about 44 percent of the total cost exclusive of taxes and duties.
The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) has entered into an agreement with HMG
to provide a loan of about USS30.8 million equivalent to finance two of the
four contracts for the East-West Highway construction and construction
supervision. The effectiveness of the SFD loan would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 6.01(c)(d), Development Credit
Agreement). -IRX would obtain by December 31, 1985, loans or grants for
bridge reconstruction, road rehabilitation, and some technical assistance
(Section 4.06, Development Credit Agreement). ODA has already agreed in
principle to provide this support with a grant of about US$19.7 million
equivalent to meet the cost of road rehabilitation. MEG will finance the
remainder of the cost which would be about USS18.0 million equivalent or
about 13 percent of total project cost. The project cost provides price
contingencies for local costs at the rate of 9 percent in 1984, 8 percent in
1985, 7 percent in 1986, and 6 percent in 1987/88; and for foreign costs at
the rate of 7.7 percent in 1984, 7.2 percent in 1985, 6.5 percent in 1986,
and 6 percent in 1987/88. A 10 percent physical contingency is also included
in the project costs.
Project Execution
43.     DOR would be responsible for project implementation.  Supervision of
the East-West Highway construction will be undertaken by consultants selected
under the procurement policies of SFD fron a number of prequalified firms.
For the overall supervx4sion of this component, ENG has constituted a board
comprising the Secretary of the Ministry of Works and Transport, the Chief
Engineer of DOR, the Project Manager, one representative each from the
Ministry of FInance, Ministry of Law and Justice, and the Office of the
Auditor-General. Supervision of the construction of the Karnali Bridge will
be carried out by the consultants responsible for its design. Supervision of
the ODA-financed road and bridge rehabilitation work will be carried out by
the consultants selected on the teras and conditions of ODA agreement with
iSG.  DOR would assign key personnel to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
by Wall 1984. PIU together with the consultants would manage and implement
the entire project, as well as prepare bimonthly reports on the progress of
the project for the Government, SFD and IDA. tdministrative steps to create
the PIU, the assignment of the Project Manager and other key personnel to
PI-U, and the appointment of the consultants for supervision of the East-West
Highway construction were made conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
credit (Sections 3.10 and 6.01(a)(b), Development Credit Agreement). kll
foregoing conditions have already been met since negotiations, except the
creation of the PIU.

45.     There would be four contracts for the East-West Highway.  Contracts
for the two western most sections (about US$30.8 million equivalent) would
be awarded under SFD procurement guidelines. The Saudi Fund would contribute
about US$25.6 million towards financing of these sections. Contracts for the
remaining portion of the East-West Highway (US$31.27 million equivalent), the
Karnali (Chisapani) bridge (US$14.44 million equivalent), and the feeder
roads (US$2.29 million equivalent) would be awarded according to IDA
guidelines. Consultants for supervision of the East-West Highway coastruc-
tion (US$5.22 million equivalent) to be financed by SFD would be procured
under Saudi Fund guidelines. ODA would finance the cost of road rehabilita-
tion (US$21.7 million equivalent) according to conditions of its agreement
with HMG. Equipment for road maintenance (US$4.26 million equivalent), and
goods and services for Technical Assistance and Training (fUS$2.51 million
equivalent) would be procured under IDA guidelines. Ull contracts for civil
works, consultant services and equipment being financed by IDA would be



-14-
subject to IDA review prior to award. A preference of 7.5 percent for domes-
tic contractors would be given in respect of civil works contracts.
46.     Disbursements from the proceeds of the IDA credit would be made on
the followi3g basis:
(a) 77 percent of total expenditures for the construction of the
East-West Highway, the feeder roads and the bridge over tl.. Karnali
River at Chisapani, and the five bridges of the Birganj-Retauda
road;
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the road maintenance
equipment, spare parts, and other equipment and naterials for DOR;
or 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for locally
manufactured goods; and 90 percent of local expenditures for goods
procured locally (off-the-shelf); and
(c) 100 percent of expenditures for consultant's services, technical
assistance and training of DOR staff.
The disbursement would be completed over a four and a half year period. The
estimated closing date is June 30, 1990.
ProJect Benefits and Risks
47.     The completion of the East-West Highway would provide the only direct
surface link between the far western region of Nepal and the rest of the
country. The network would provide all-weather access to the fertile plains
known as the Terai which has Nepal's greatest agricultural potential and to
the hill people who would be able to trade in market towns which are expected
to spring up along the East-West Highway. The road would benefit about one
million people in the area and would assist in the growth of commodity trade
between the Terai and the Hills, and movement of agricultural produce between
the regions. The Government has initiated several agricultural, rural
development and power projects in the far western region; their progress has
been hampered due to lack of road connections. The road would provide the
much needed service for transportation of goods to the area besides spreading
of benefits from the investments made in the region to the neighboring areas.
Major quantifiable benefits of this component of the project are increased
agricultural production due to easy access to the irrigated areas, facilita-
tion of development projects in the area deferred through lack of all-weather
access, avoidance of the cost of airlift of goods to the area, and earnings
potential from tourism.
48.     The objectives of rehabilitation of roads and bridges on the
Kathmandu-Birganj Highway, the principal trade route of Nepal, are to reduce
vehicle operating costs and accidents, and restore a smooth running surface
through rehabilitation so that routine maintenance can be performed by DOR.
Major quantifiable benefits from this component are: (a) avoidance of costs
for temporary bridge crossing or disruption after a collapse; (b) reduced
operating costs of vehicles; and (c) reduced cost of road maintenance.
49.     The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the East-West Highway component
along with interdependent investments is 14 percent; on the road rehabilita-
tion component CKathmandu-Birganj) it ranges between 14 percent and 23



-15-
percent. The overall weighted average ERR of the East-West highway construc-
tion and the road/bridge rehabilitation component is 16 percent. There are
ao major risks ia this project. Possibilities of construction delays have
been minimized by adequate provision for construction supervision. The risk
analysis which takes into account the possibility of delays, as well as
simultaneous variations in costs and benefits, yields an average ERR of 12
percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
50.    The Draft Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal and the
Association and the recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1 (d), of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
51.     Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III.
52.     1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Asso& ation.
PARI VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
