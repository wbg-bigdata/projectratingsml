MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO LATVA
FOR JELGAVA DISTRICTE HEATING REHABI11TATION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Latvia for the equivalent of US$ 14.0 million to help finance a project
for the rehabilitation of the district heating system in the City of Jelgava. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace. The
proceeds cf the loan would be onlent to the City of Jelgava in US dollars (USS) for 17 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at the IBRD rate plus a 10 percent mark-up to cover cross-currency risk
and loan administrative costs. Cofinancing in the amount of USS 0.5 million equivalent would be
provided by the Government of Sweden on a grant basis to support the implementation of the proposed
project.
2.           Country Context. Since regaining its independence in September 1991, Latvia has taken
major steps to reform its economy and to transform it from a central planning to a market system. An
IMF-supported stabilization program launched by the Government of Latvia (GOL) in July, 1992
effectively uncoupled the Latvian currency from the ruble zone. A permanent Latvian currency, the Lat
(Ls), was introduced in 1993. Successful implementation of the stabilization program enabled the country
to pursue an independent monetary policy and reap the benefits of a prudent fiscal policy. As a result,
inflation has declined sharply from over 900 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1994. Structural adjustment
in key areas has progressed significantly: (i) most prices have been liberalized; (ii) an open trade regime
has been introduced and privatization of small businesses, agricultural land and banking institutions is well
advanced; and (iii) the Government is reforming the social safety net through better means-testing to focus
on social benefits specifically aimed at lower income groups. Banking and industrial sector reforms,
however, have been slower than initially anticipated. Latvia's aspiration to re-integrate itself into Europe
hinges on further development toward long-term political and macro-economic stability, including a
deepening of structural reforms.
3.           Sector Background. The energy sector plays a vital role in the Latvian economy through
its impact on the balance of payments and because energy is a major input to other sectors of the
economy, especially industry and agriculture. Latvia's energy sector is heavily dependent on imports since
the country produces only 15 percent of its primary energy requirements. In 1992, Latvia spent the
equivalent of 21 percent of its GDP for energy imports and the figure for 1993 is 19 percent of GDP.
About half of all imported fuel is used in the production of electricity and heat. As part of the Soviet
Union, Latvia had access to petroleum products and natural gas from Russia at below world market
prices. This easy access to energy resources led to systematic under-pricing of energy that, in turn, led
tq usage per unit of output substantially higher than in market economies. Fortunately, however, it did
not saddle Latvia with a lot of energy-intensive heavy industry, the structue of Latvian industry being
oriented to lighter and technologically advanced industries that made use of an educated labor force. Out
of date and often inappropriate technologies still result in large amounts of energy wastage. Price
distortions and the absence of private property rights created a bias against investments in energy
efficiency, pollution abatement, and adequate maintenance of plants.



2
4.           The Latvian Government has taken steps to restructure the sector to respond better to the
needs of a market economy by decentralizing district heating services, privatizing the oil sub-sector,
commercializing the electricity and natural gas monopolies and introducing targeted subsidies directed
to low-income consumers and not energy enterprises. However, the sector still suffers from a number
of institutional difficulties and a deep financial weakness. The inability of energy consumers to make
timely payment for services has led to accumulated arrears to sector enterprises and created a rather
complicated inter-enterprise debt situation.  Also, sectoral restructuring and the ensuing shift in
.esponsibilities between the various institutions in the sector has led to a lack of clarity in institutional
boundaries.
5.           The energy sector has been identified as one of the priority sectors to be rehabilitated
during the transition period. The Government has recently issued an energy policy which is based on
the strategic objective of providing long-term reliable energy services at the lowest economic cost with
due regard to environmental concerns and security of supply. The specific objectives of the policy are:
(i) optimal economic utilization of energy resources; (ii) increased use of renewable indigenous energy
resources; (iii) efficient perfornance and maintenance of existing facilities; and (iv) diversification of fuel
choice and supply.
6.           In line with these objectives, the Government has undertaken a number of projects and
studies, supported by a number of multilateral and bilateral agencies (European Union (EU-PHARE),
EBRD, BITS, USAID, etc) to: (i) improve efficiency and reliability of eisting energy systems through
improved operations and rehabilitation of existing facilities; (ii) improve the diversity of fuel choice
through the development of indigenous energy resources - mainly hydropower, wood products, and peat -
in order to reduce the high cost of fuel imports; and (iii) introduce public awareness campaigns to inform
and educate citizens on the sectoral issues.
7.           District Heating Subsector. Latvia has an extensive district heating system dating from
the early 1950s. Heat production facilities supply industries with hot water and steam and households
with heating and hot water. Overall, about 60 percent of all Latvian households use d;strict heating,
primarily in urban areas. District heating is used extensively in urban areas and to a lesser extent in rural
areas. The DH systems are owned and operated primarily by the municipalities, although Latvenergo,
the electricity monopoly, owns parts of the system in Riga, Olaine and Liepaja.
8.           The DH systems in Latvia, as in most of the FSU, are recognized as inefficient converters
of fuel to heat and hot water. The inefficiency stems from several factors: (i) reliance upon heat-only
boilers (HOB) for heat production as opposed to more cost effective combined heat and power (CHP)
bpilers; (ii) use of boilers with very low conversion efficiency compared to boilers in use in western
countries; (iii) transmission and distribution network technology with very short life expectancy and large
annual maintenance and replacement expenditures, without whicb heat and water losses would be
extremely high; and (iv) lack of metering and control devices which prevent optization of heat supply
and demand. While low energy prices in the past masked the degree of inefficiency in the system, the
rapid growth in energy prices over the past few years has increased the incentives for developing a
technically efficient and affordable heating system in Latvia. Given the high cost of gas and heavy fuel
oil, the two major fuels used in heat production, both the central and municipal governments in Latvia
recognize that improvements in the operating efficiency of the DH system are essential to ensure efficient
delivery of heating services in a cost effective manner.

9.           Within the energy sector strategy, a high priority is accorded to the rehabilitation of
district heating systems which are a major energy user and provide a basic human need given Latvia's
climatic conditions. It is estimated that 30 percent of Latvia's energy resources are used for the provision
of space heating and hot water for households and public buildings.
10.          Heat Tariffs. The growth in heat tariffs has been astronomical since the onset of the
energy crisis in 1991 but has not been matched by corresponding growth in household incomes. Between
1991 and 1993, real wages declined about 30 percent while fuel prices increased about 400-fold. During
the 1992/93 heating season, heat tariffs were adjusted monthly to keep pace with the escalating fuel costs
and inflation, and it was not uncommon for heat bills to represent 60-90 percent of total monthly
h,usehold income, and in some cases even exceed it, especially for pensioners and other low-income
households. Thus, many consumers were unable to pay their district heating bills in a timely fashion,
and in turn, the district heating enterprises were unable to pay their creditors. This has led to a rather
complex inter-enterprise debt situation in the energy sector. However, the positive trend in real wage
growth in 1994 (estimated at 12 percent), is expected to continue making energy more affordable in the
future and a reversal in the trend in debt accumulation has been possible in 1994.
11.          The Government's policy in the district heating subsector is aimed at full cost recovery
with targeted social safety net assistance to low-income households. In line with this policy, direct
subsidies to heat producers were eliminated in October 1993. In recognition of the non-affordability of
energy supplies to a segment of the population, the Government created a program for social assistance
to low-income households to meet housing rent and utility bills, The program is jointly funded from the
central and municipal budgets on a 51 percent/49 percent basis. Prior to October 1994, funds from the
central budget were released to match municipal contributions to the program. As a consequence, the
program was grossly under-funded during the 1993/94 heating season since most municipalities were
unable to release funds for the program and thus did not receive promised central funds. The Govermnent
has taken a number of steps to make the program more efficient. These include the release of central
funds regularly without waiting for matching municipal contributions, greater public awareness through
mass media campaigns, and better means-testing mechanisms.
12.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to extend the life,
and increase the operating efficiency, of the Jelgava District Heating System through rehabilitation and
introduction of modern technologies and materials; (b) to improve environmental conditions in affected
areas by improving the efficiency of fuel use, facilitating the elimination of low-stack coal-fired boilers
in residential areas, reducing wastage of water in DH systems; (c) to support the strengthening and
restructuring of the Jelgava District Heating Company (JDHC) and development of the eiergy sector
through consultancy and advisory services, training and provision of equipment and software; and
(d) to act as a pilot project for DH system rehabilitation from soviet to western technology, for other
locations within Latvia.
13.          Project Rationale. Given its limited financial resources, the Latvian Government has
attempted to develop pilot projects in the energy sector in order to better understand new technologies
before embarking on large scale investments. A number of municipalities were approached as possible
sites to be included in a DH rehabilitation program under the EU-PHARE financed 'Energy Sector
Savings Strategy" study. The City of Jelgava was one of the sites selected and proposed by the



4
Government to the World Bank energy identification mission that visited Latvia in December 1992. The
clear institutional and ownership structure for the provision of DH services in Jelgava, made it a good
candidate as a pilot project. A pilot project requires, for speed of implementation, that there are no
fundamental problems of decision-taking and ownership, and Jelgava has been able to satisfy these
requirements.  Added to this, both the municipal government and the DH company have shown
themselves willing to cooperate with both the Bank and the central Govermnment and to pursue an
improvement strategy that meets sectoral development objectives.
14.          The Jelgava project will demonstrate possible solutions to a variety of problems that are
endemic to DH systems in Latvia. These include the need to: (i) rationalize heat generation; (ii)
rehabilitate existing DH networks; (iii) introduce modern technology in DH systems; (iv) ameliorate water
loss; (v) improve DH water treatment systems; (vi) introduce production and end-user metering; (vii)
improve the maintenance function; (viii) modernize enterprise commercial systems; and (ix) improve
enterprise internal organization. In addition, the project should demonstrate that it can be replicated in
municipalities whose district heating systems are relatively similar both in size and environmental
conditions. Finally, the project will be a good testing ground for other aspects such as the exercise of
the municipalities' regulatory functions over the district heating enterprise, financial discipline in bill
collection and imposition of hard budget constraint for energy, and the targeting of subsidies to the lowest
income groups.
15.          Project Description. The proposed project consists of two components:
(a) rehabilitation of the Jelgava District Heating (DH) system, through a program to
upgrade the system to a variable flow regime; increase boiler efficiency; abate
leakage; install heat meters; eliminate enviromnentally unsound, low-stack coal-fired
boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function; and
(b) institutional support for project implementation and enterprise restructuring for
project agencies.
16.          Project Cost and Financng. The proposed World Bank loan of US$14.0 million
equivalent would cover about 79 percent of the total financing requirement, including US$2.2 million of
interest during construction but excluding taxes and duties. The Government of Sweden, through BITS,
would provide grants of US$0.5 million equivalent, and the Borrower would finance US$3.7 million
equivalent. Financing arrangements are shown in Schedule A. The funds from BITS would finance the
provision of detailed engineering design and implementation supervision under the institutional support
component. Local counterpart financing would be covered by JDHC internal cash generation, with the
City of Jelgava retaining the residual obligation for counterpart funds. The relatively high proportion of
the Bank's contribution to project financing is justified because JDHC has had no opportunity to build
up cash reserves given lack of full cost recovery tariffs in pre-independent Latvia combined with the
energy price shocks during the transition period. In order to alleviate the company's weak cash position,
the project is designed to gradually phase-in full cost recovery tariffs, and thus enable JDHC build up
financial reserves. A provision for retroactive financing up to a total of US$1.17 million has been made
for expenditures incurred after appraisal but before loan signing. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown at Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.



5
17.          Project Implenentation. The project would be implemented by JDHC with assistance
in project administration and coordination from the City of Jelgava. Additional support for project
management, procurement and disbursement would be provided through the institutional support package
financed under the project. A Coordinator in the Energy Division of the Ministry of Economy has been
appointed to liaise with the various ministries, donors, the City of Jelgava and JDHC. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Latvia are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached (No. IBRD 26475). The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 13793-LV, dated April 25. 1995, is being distributed separately.
18.          Environmental Aspects. Preparation of the proposed project has included enviromnental
studies consistent with the requirements of the Latvian law on 'State Environmental Impact Assessments"
(1990) and the provisions of the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment."
In accordance with these procedures an environmental review was prepared, consistent with the
requirements for a category "B" project, for the district heat rehabilitation program in Jelgava. The
institutional support program was placed in category "C" and did not require enviromental analysis.
The findings of these environmental studies have been used to support design of the specific programs,
and mitigation and monitoring activities have been identified.
19.          Implementation of the proposed project is anticipated to have positive envirommental
benefits through improved efficiency in the use of fuels, by contributing to a reduced level of air pollution
in Jelgava, and by reducing the wastage of water used in the district heating systems. The program would
yield environmental improvements through increasing the energy efficiency of the DH system, both by
better integration of the heating system, and by major rehabilitation activities which would reduce fuel
use and create economic incentives for users to reduce heatlenergy consumption by adopting appropriate
tariffs and through the installation of heat meters. Key interventions include: closing four small coal
fired boiler plants and replacing them with block substations, which would reduce local air pollution and
eliminate the requirement for coal and ash storage, as well as ash disposal; and rehabilitation of the
distribution network which would reduce the wastage of water and increase the energy efficiency of the
heating system. Support will be provided to the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development for
the preparation of asbestos management guidelines, and a project - specific asbestos removal and disposal
plan will be prepared by JDHC and submitted for approval by the environmental authorities.
20.          Program Objective Categories. By rebabilitating and upgrading districtheating facilities
to improve efficiency in the use of fuels and reduce water wastage, the project is consistent with the
objective of environmentally sustainable development.
21.          Participatory Approach. The project used various participatory approaches in project
preparation. These included meetings with the Jelgava City Council to discuss the project concept and
answer questions, and visits to various users to find out their perspective on district heating tariffs and
the proposed investment maintenance priorities.
22.          Lessons Learned from Past Bank Experience. Past experience in implementation of
other Bank-supported DH projects is limited to an on-going project in Poland, a component of an
environment project in China, a project in Estonia approved in May 1994, and a new project in Poland
approved in November 1994; the latter two have recently become effective. Some lessons learned to-date



6
include: (a) decentralized project management arrangements work far better than centralized
arrangements; and (b) it is important to ensure that future investments in rehabilitating and/or expanding
the DH systems are properly justified and therefore long-term pianning for cost effective development
of heat supply, including DH systems should be undertaken during the project period. These lessons have
been considered in thc design of the proposed project.
23.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's
overall country assistance strategy in Latvia, as discussed by the Board of Directors during the
presentation of the Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project (12977-LV) on September 20,
1994, which assigns emphasis to the energy sector and seeks to support Latvia's efforts to improve energy
efficiency by replacing or rehabilitating existing production facilities. The strategy also calls for greater
efforts in energy conservation, pricing and transfer of ownership. The project is also fully consistent with
the Government's energy policy, which supports energy conservation, improvement of the efficiency of
energy facilities, reduction of envirommental impact, and rehabilitation of existing plants. The efficiency
gains and reduced import bill would lead to lower costs of heat production and operation, thereby
resulting in more affordable heat tariffs and lower requirements for heat subsidies. Most importantly,
the quality and reliability of heating services would be improved. At the same time, institutional
development programs for concerned energy agencies would help strengthen their management and
operations.
24.          Actions agreed at Negotiations. The Bank sought and obtained agreement regarding:
(i) registration of JDHC as a joint stock company by March 31, 1996; (ii) the City of Jelgava to adopt
a Decision by March 31, 1996, vesting in JDHC the ownership of all district heating equipment,
wherever located; (iii) the Borrower and the City of Jelgava to retain the residual obligation for
counterpart funding; (iv) key project performance indicators; (v) the Borrower, acting through its
Ministry of Environment and Regional Development, to prepare an environmental mitigation and
monitoring plan satisfactory to the Bank by June 30, 1996; (vi) the City of Jelgava, and ultimately the
Borrower, to continue to approve regular tariff increases, based on a formula agreed at negotiations,
sufficient to allow the JDHC to cover the costs of operations, maintenance, interest and make a
contribution to reserves; (vii) the City of Jelgava to require its DH company to maintain a debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.3 during the project period; (viii) the City of Jelgava to require its DH
company to prepare a report annually containing 5-year financial projections beginning FY96 to be
reviewed by the Bank on an annual basis.
25.          Project Benefits. The proposed project would have significant economic benefits related
to: (a) enhancement of district heating system life; (b) reduction of fuel and other operational costs; (c)
improvement of environmental conditions through saved fuel and a cleaner fuel base; and (d) various non-
quantifiable benefits related to institutional and management improvements. The expected economic rate
of return is 24 percent.
(a) Energy Savings. Energy savings would come from four sources: reduced network
heat losses; better dispatching and lower water supply temperature through the
introduction of variable flow and heat metering; boiler automation; and elimination
of inefficient small boilers.



7
(b) System  life extension.  Given the high ground water conditions in Jelgava,
replacement of highly corroded sections of the existing network with pre-insulated
pipes is expected to increase the average lifetime of the replaced network sections
from less than six years to at least 30 years. Installation of hydraulic separation heat
exchangers and improvement in water quality are expected to extend the average life
of the boilers from the current 5 years to at least 10 years.
(c) Reduction in water losses. Replacement of old pipes and other leaky network
components would reduce water losses from the present level of 2 percent of the total
water outflow from the main heat sources to I percent.
(d) Air Pollution Abatement. Elimination of four small coal-fired boilers under the
project would help reduce emissions of particulates and SO2 in the City of Jelgava.
26.          Project Risks. Being the first project of its kind for Latvia and JDHC, the project has
a number of risks. The implementation capacity of the Company in carrying out an investment project
of this order of magnitude is untested, and may result in a longer implementation period than expected.
To reduce this risk, detailed implementation arrangements have been fully identified and agreed with both
JDHC and the City of Jelgava. Adequate staffing, training and implementation support arrangements
were agreed at negotiations and are expected to be in place prior to project start-up. In addition,
intemational and local engineering consultants would assist JDHC with technical implementation of the
project.
27.          There is a risk of heat tariff increases not being implemented for political or other
reasons. Given the demonstrated commitment by the Govemment, the City of Jelgava and its DH
Company to adjusting heat tariffs frequently during the recent period of energy price shocks, this risk is
expected to be relatively small. Monitoring performance in this area would be a major focus of attention
during Bank supervision. Further uncertainty exists concerning the collection of revenues from
consumers. The rapid improvement in collection rates of all consumer categories, the upward trend in
real wage growth, and the introduction of social safety net assistance for low income households, all
indicate that the risk of a renewed build-up of consumer receivables is relatively small.
28.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
