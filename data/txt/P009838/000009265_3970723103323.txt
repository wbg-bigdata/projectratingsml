KERALA STATE POWER PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
Commercial Energy Resources
1.01    India's commercially exploitable energy resources consist of coal,
oil, gas, hydro, uranium and thorium. Of the nonrenewable resources, coal
is the most abundant. Reserves of thermal coal have been estimated at
slightly more than 100 billion tons, of which 25 billion tons are proven.
Although reserves are ample, the quality of coal produced is generally low
and is deteriorating. Proven and probable petroleum reserves comprise
approximately 530 million tons of oil and 390 million toe of natural gas.
Despite recent increases in domestic production, India still imports about
one third of its oil requirements, which in 1983/84 cost the equivalent of
40% of its merchandise exports. The Government has therefore given high
priority to oil and gas exploration and, at the same time, has implemented
measures to restrain the rapidly growing demand for oil products, in
particular middle distillates; the Government has also generally limited the
use of gas to premium markets, such as petrochemicals and fertilizer.
However, delays in the construction of infrastructure for gas transport have
resulted in substantial volumes of associated gas being flared. India's
hydroelectric potential is about 100,000 MW. At present, only 13,000 MW have
been developed, 4,700 MW are under construction, and a further 23,000 MW are
being studied for future development. The country's uranium reserves could
support a modest nuclear program (8,000-10,000 NW), and its thorium reserves
are enough for a large breeder program. India's nuclear power generating
capacity is currently 3,000 MW.
1.02    Planning the best use of India's indigenous energy resources for
power generation raises a number of issues. First, the high ash content of
coal, which can reach 50%, increases transport costs, as well as power
station capital and operating costs. The development of pithead stations,
which is constrained by pollution limitations and the availability of cooling
water, only helps to alleviate the transport problem. Thus, priority is
being given in Bank lending to the coal sector to more selective mining and
improved coal preparation. Two studies included in the Dudhichua Coal
Project (Loan 2393-IN) are designed to address problems of coal transport:
one study will examine ways of improving the linkages between the sources of
supply and demand, and the other will concentrate on improvements in handling
and transportation facilities. Second, there is a need for a coherent policy
on the utilization of gas, and this has become more urgent with the recent
increases in estimated reserves. A Bank study planned for 1985 will focus
on, among other things, the potential for the economic use of gas in power
generation. Third, the prominent role of hydro in regional least-cost
development plans prepared in 1982 has led GOI to emphasize the need to
accelerate its development; however, progress has been slow owing to the time
required to resolve water rights and environmental issues, the limited
technical resources available for the simultaneous preparation of a large



-2-
number of schemes, and the lack of financial resources of States with the
greatest hydro potential.
Supply and Demand of Electricity - India
1.03    Approximately 50% of India's electricity is generated from coal, 40X
from hydro, and the rest from oil, nuclear power, and natural gas. Although
a number of large thermal projects are planned for the short term, the share
of hydro is expected to increase in the long run. Electricity losses have
risen slowly but steadily over the last few years and now exceed 26% of gross
generation. The deteriorating quality of coal has been at least partly
responsible for this trend, with coal stations' own consumption now
approaching 10% of gross generation against a desirable 5. Distribution
losses are also higher than is desirable owing to inadequate planning and
insufficient investment. Although system losses are lower than in several
cozntries in the region, they need to be reduced. Under its lending program,
the Bank has supported measures designed to reduce losses and will continue
to do so. However, such measures need to be State specific, reflecting the
particular circumstances of each State.
1.04    Over the past two decades, the consumption of electricity has grown
approximately twice as fast as total commercial energy consumption and now
accounts for more than 30X of the latter. However, supply has not kept pace
with demand and shortages have been prevalent throughout the country. During
the last five years, shortages have on average been equivalent to about 13%
of electricity requirements. The principal sectoral shares of total
electricity consumption are: industrial, 56%; agricultural, 191; and
domestic, 12%. Agriculture's share has grown steadily owing to increased
electrical irrigation pumping made possible by rural electrification and
encouraged by heavy subsidies. Total consumption has grown at an average
rate of 10% per annum during the past two decades, and the Central
Electricity Authority (CEA) has forecast growth of 9% per annum between
1984/85 and 1989/90. Actual growth will depend on the allocation to power in
the Seventh Plan and the performance of utilities in fulfilling the Plan.
Supply and Demand of Electricity - Southern Region
1.05    The Southern Region comprises the States of Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, and the Union Territories of Pondicherry
and Lakshadweep Islands. As of July 1984, the installed capacity in the
Region was 9,685 MW, consisting of 3,407 MW (351) of thermal power, 6,043 MW
(62%) of hydropower, and 235 MW (3%) of nuclear power. Installed capacity is
expected to reach 25,100 MW by 1994/95, representing an average increase of
10% per year. In the period 1980/81 through 1984/85, electricity consumption
grew at an average rate of about 9% per year, reaching an estimated 39,700
GWh in 1984/85; peak demand grew by about 7% per year, to 6,420 MW, in the
same ,eriod. However, these rates of growth underestimate real demand growth
because of the progressive severity of supply constraints. These constraints
are expected to prevail into the coming decade despite the planned growth in
installed capacity. Over the period 1984/85 to 1994/95, energy requirements
are expected to increase at an average rate of about 10% per year to 101,840
CWh, and peak demand to increase by about 11% per year to 18,200 MW.
Kerala's present installed capacity of 1,011 MW, which consists entirely of



-3-
hydropower, is adequate only in years with average or above-average rainfall.
During recent dry years, KSEB has had to introduce selective power cuts and
load staggering. Electricity losses in Kerala are estimated at 20% of total
generation, and although losses are relatively low compared with other States
in India, further reductions are possible and desirable. The proposed
project is expected to result in a reduction in system losses of between 3%
and 5X in 1989/90.
Organization of the Power Subsector
1.06    Responsibility for the supply of electricity is shared between the
Central and State Governments. The State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and the
Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) are controlled by States; the Central
Electricity Authority, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the
National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation (NHPC), and the Rural
Electrification Corporation (REC) are controlled by the Central Government.
SEBs were instituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 (the Act), to
promote the development of the power subsector and to regulate private
licensees. Although SEBs are supposed to be autonomous in managing their
day-to-day operations, in practice they are under the control of State
Governments in such matters as capital investment, tariffs, borrowings, pay,
and personnel policies. As a first step towards national integrati'Jn, the
SEBs have been grouped into five regional systems, each coordinated by an
REB. Coordination responsibilities include overhaul and maintenance
programs, generation schedules, inter-State power transfers and concomitant
tariffs. CEA was created in 1950 to develop national power policy and to
coordinate the various agencies involved in supplying electricity. It is
responsible for the formulation of countrywide investment plans for approval
by the Central Government, development of integrated system operation,
training of personnel, and research and development. It maintains
operational, economic, and financial data at both the Central and State
levels, and provides consulting support to SEBs. NTPC and NHPC were
incorporated in 1975 by COI to construct and operate large power stations and
associated transmission facilities. They sell bulk power to the SEBs for
distribution. NTPC has had marked success and has grown rapidly. In
contrast, NHPC is still struggling to establish a role for itself. The
States own most hydro sites and are reluctant to relinquish these sources of
comparatively inexpensive energy to the Central Government. REC was
established in 1969 to coordinate rural electrification and provide financial
and technical expertise for SEB schemes. At present, REC finances more than
half of total rural electrification investment.
Pricing and Resource Mobilization
1.07    Through the 1983 amendments to the Act, GOI has set a financial
objective for the SEBs in which they are required to produce an annual return
of at least 3% on their historically valued net fixed assets, after meeting
operating expenses, taxes, depreciation and interest. The 3% return would
represent, in terms of the Bank's conventional method of calculation, a rate
of return on historically valued assets in the range of 10% to 13%. The Bank
considers this objective to be a reasonable minimum but the investment
requirements of a number of SEBs are such that higher returns would be
desirable in order to achieve reasonable cash generation. Although, in some



-4-
cases, higher returns may be possible through reclassification of consumers,
substantial improvements will only be achievable through tariff increases.
SEB tariffs do nor adequately reflect marginal costs. An analysis of 1981
tariffs indicated that they were on average only 52Z of long run marginal
cost (LRMC); industrial tariffs were almost 90%, domestic 36Z, and
agricultural only 27%. While there may have been improvements since 1981 and
adherence to the stipulated rate of return will further improve the overall
level of the tariff, the structure is still distorted. State-specific
financial programs are needed to provide both a higher return on investment
and a simpler, efficient and affordable tariff structure. Such programs will
be addressed t4rough the Bank's lending to individual SEBs. In contrast,
NTPC's tariff Is approximately equal to its LRMC.
Power Subsector Planning
1.08    Due to rapid demand growth, GOI at present allocates about 20Z of
public in%estment to power development. In order that the subsector should
be developed in the most economic manner, the Bank encouraged GOI to prepare
a least-cost National Power Plan (NPP), which was completed in September
1982. Although this plan, which is actually a collection of five regional
plans, represents substantial progress, further refinement is needed. In
particular, there is a need for integration of the regional plans and greater
coordination between planning in power and other sectors. Since it will not
he possible to achieve full national integration immediately, the Bank will
continue to ensure that each Bank-tinanced project forms a part of an
up-to-date regional least-cost development plan. In due course, the sources
of supply considered should be widened to include the option of importing
from neighboring regions. This approach would eventually lead to integrated
planning at a national level. To facilitate integration, GOI has agreed,
under the Rihand Power Transmission Project, to undertake a study on the
long-term development of a national transmission system. A problem has
arisen in the coordination of the long-term NPP with the national five-year
plan and shortcr-term budgets. Owing to the lack of resources, fewer
projects have been included in the five-year plan than in the NPP and, as a
result (if underestimation of project costs and delays in project
implemertat.ion, still fewer have been executed.  Consequently, the shortage
of power has become more and more acute and, over the next decade, India
expects its power deficit to increase severalfold. In the past this deficit
has undermined rational pLanning by encouraging emphasis on the rapid
expansion of supply rather than on least-cost development. Furthermore, it
has prompted overinvestment in captive plant, leading to excessive use of
high-value petroleum products in power generation. In addition to supporting
COI's etforts Lo increase the supply of power, the Bank will continue to
stress to GO! the role of pricing in eliminating the deficit and the
importance of integrating planning and pricing.
Management and Operations
1.09    SEEs' organization and management practices have not kept pace with
the expansion of supply. Quality of service, reliability, and financial
performance are the principal areas of concern. In general, SEBs have high
quaLity engineering staff, but lack experienced personnel in the areas of
financial planning and control. The relatively poor status and pay of these



-5-
personnel exacerbate the already significant pay differential between the
public and private sectors and makes it difficult to recruit competent staff.
Management practices are generally outmoded and inadequate. The SEBs'
inefficient accounting systems are an example. At present, accounts are
maintained principally to track cash receipts and expenditures, and there is
little use of accounting information for managerial purposes. GOI has
decided that a new and uniform accounting system should be installed in all
SEBs. After initial delays, implementation is now proceeding.
1.10    In the area of operations, one of the main concerns has been the poor
performance of thermal plant. Factors that have contributed to this
situation are inadequate maintenance (due to capacity shortages),
deficiencies in plant manufacture, lack of spqres, and the poor quality of
coal; in general, these problems have been recognized by the relevant
authorities and corrective steps are being t=ken. GOI is currently preparing
a rehabilitation program for thermal plant. Until this program is compiled,
the Bank will, whenever appropriate, include a thermal rehabilitation
component under each of the loans made to the SEBs.
Bank Group Participation in the Past
1.11    The Bank has made 18 loans for Indian power projects amounting to
US$1,983 million, and 17 IDA credits totaling US$2,409 million. Seventeen
projects financed under the following loans and credits have been completed:
ten generating projects, the Beas Project (Credit 98-IN), the first four
transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN, 377-IN and 604-IN), and
the First and Second Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and
911-IN). The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) was completed in
1983, and the Second Rural Electrification Project in 1984. The Singrauli
(Credit 685-IN), Korba (Credit 793-IN), and Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and
Loan 1648-IN) Thermal Power Projects are in advanced stages of
implementation. The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1027-IN) and the credit/loan for the first stage of the Farakka
Thermal Power Project (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May
and June 1980. Korba II (Credit 1172-IN) was approved in July 1981,
RAmagundam II (Loan 2076-IN) in December 1981, and the Third Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN) in June 1982. The Upper Indravati
Hydro Project (Credit 1356-IN and Loan 2278-IN) and the Central Power
Transmission Project (Loan 2283-IN) were approved in May 1983, and the Indira
Sarovar Hydroelectric Power Project in May 1984. The Second Farakka Thermal
Power Project (Loan 2442-IN) was approved in June 1984, and the Trombay IV
Thermal Power Project (Loan 2452-IN) in June of the same year'. The Third
Rural Electrifica_ion Project is about a year behind schedule. The first
five units of the Singrauli Project and the first two units of the Korba
project were commissioned on schedule. The Farakka and RamAgundam projects
are proceeding satisfactorily, the first unit at Ramagundam having been
commissioned four months ahead of schedule. The Third Trombay Project
(Unit 5) (Loan 1549-IN) was first synchronized in January 1984, about a year
behind schedule; time was lost mainly because parts for the boiler were not
delivered on time, and because of delay:. in its construction.
1.12    A performance audit conducted in 1980 for the Second Power
Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN) concluded that the project has succeeded



-6-
in helping the nine beneficiary SEBs extend their transmission systems and
meet their growing power requirements. Utilization of generating capacity in
these SEBs has exceeded the appraisal forecast. The upgrading of the SEBs'
financial management practices that began under this project will continue
under subsequent projects. The audit highlighted the difficulties of
supervising a project consisting of many widely scattered subprojects, and of
effecting institutional improvements in the absence of a close working
relationship between the Bank Group and the beneficiary SEBs.
Bank Group Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.13    Over the last ten years the Bank Group has assisted GOI in
substantially expanding its centrally owned generation capacity. In the past
two years, however, Bank Group lending has been broadened to encompass
SEB-implemented projects in order to support GOI's policy of accelerating
hydro development and improving project implementation, operational
efficiency and financial performance in the SEBs. Specific objectives of
Bank Group assistance include:
(a)  the better use of existing facilities--through transmission
projects improving regional interconnections and through
rehabilitation of plant, particularly of thermal power stations
and distribution networks: these measures will improve the
efficiency of energy use and reduce system losses, thereby
helping to minimize system capital and operating costs;
(b)  institution building--although the Bank will continue to
maintain an interest in Central institutions, its efforts will
be broadened, as noted above, to encompass individual SEBs,
where substantial efforts are needed to strengthen management,
operations, and finances and to ensure the successful
implementation of commercial accounting;
(c)  improved planning-particularly by extending the scope of
planning from the State through the regional to the national
level and through greater integration of planning with other
sectors in the economy, both those that consume electricity and
those that supply other forms of energy; and
(d)  improved resource mobilization from electricity consumers- the
principal vehicle for this has been and will continue to be
financial covenants in relation to beneficiaries; however, the
Bank will also continue to stress the importance of relating
tariffs to the economic costs of supply.

II. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization
2.01    The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) was organized in 1957
according to provisions of the Electricity Supply Act. It serves as the
principal producer, distributor and retailer of electricity within the State
of Kerala. Legally, KSEB is an autonomous organization reporting to the
Water and Power Department of the Government of Kerala (GOK).  In fact, while
KSEB enjoys considerable independence in managing its day-to-day affairs,
GOK strongly influences decisions relating to pricing, staffing, and
planning.
2.02    KSEB's Board is responsible for establishing its internal policies
and for ensuring that management conducts day-to-day affairs in accordance
with those policies. The Board consists of seven members, four of whom serve
as full-time senior managers (the Chairman, Technical Member, Vigilance
Member, and Accounts Member) while the remaining three, who are appointed for
one year at a time by GOK, serve as ex-officio members. Normally, the
ex-officio members are distinguished members of the community at large who
are charged with representing the consumer, including industry, commerce and
the public. The Board is an effective working body. The Members are
assisted by a Board Secretariat.
2.03    KSEB's organization structure is shown in Annex 4.  This structure is
characterized by broad delegation of functional responsibilties to numerous
local offices spread across a wide geographic area. KSEB has met the demands
of its substantial growth either by overlaying new organizational units atop
a basic structure or by expanding existing units. To date it has not
conducted a major review of either its organization structure or its
managerial procedures and practices, to evaluate whether these are
appropriate and responsive to KSEB's present or expected future needs. KSEB's
rules sometimes limit the authority of local managers to Fulfill their
responsibilities; also, the autonomy that local managers must exercise
requires greater capabilities and qualifications than originally envisioned.
Anomalies of this sort should be corrected through regular organization and
management reviews. Accordingly, the proposed Project contains a provision
for consultants to conduct a comprehensive Organization and Management Study
and assist with implementing its acceptable recommendations, according to
terms of reference and a schedule agreeable to the Bank (para 3.10 and Annex
7). At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that, by December 31,
1985, it will retain consultants acceptable to the Bank to conduct a
comprehensive Organization and Management Study, and assist with implementing
its recommendations.
Personnel and Staffing
2.04    Since 1982, COK has maintained a hiring freeze at KSEB.  New
personnel can be recruited from without only if KSEB has a vacancy, and can
prove that no present employee possesses the requisite skills. Otherwise,
vacancies must be filled through redeployment. Consequently, during the past
two years, KSEB's number of sanctioned posts has changed only nominally, and
its vacancy rate has been negligible. Table 2.1 shows KSEB's staffing as of
March 31, 1984, distributed according to skill.

2.05    The activities of KSEB's employees are specified in job descriptions
and are conducted according to specified procedures and policies. These
administrative devices have been developed over many years specifically for
KSEB and are not tied to personnel practices which govern COK civil servants.
As KSEB's activity is expanding rapidly, a review and update of these
practices would be one of the objectives of the proposed Organization and
Management Study (para 2.03).
Operation and Maintenance
2.06    Operation and maintenance of the system are generally satisfactory.
Preventive maintenance and inspection for generation, transmission and
substation facilities have been conducted regularly according to standard
practice. Due both to cash flow limitations and the network's size, periodic
inspections and preventive maintenance of the distribution system is
conducted on a selective basis with corrective maintenance being provided as
needed. KSEB expects to regularize its periodic inspections and preventive
maintenance of the distribution system as cash flow constraints are relaxed.
Planning
2.07    Since decisions concerning major systems expansions are made by GOI
based on regional considerations, KSEB's own planning activities are limited
to (i) preparation of load forecasts for the State, to be furnished to CEA
for integration into its forecasts for the region; (ii) identification and
preparation of feasibility reports on future power generation schemes; and
(iii) planning of the high tension transmission and substation facilities.
Distribution works have so far been executed piecemeal as needed, and
systematic long-term planning of major distribution systems will be
introduced only in the context of the proposed Project. KSEB's planning
function needs to be strengthened by (a) developing a more accurate and
detailed eata base, (b) integrating physical, financial and organizational
considerations into its expansion planning; and (c) using modern tools of
analysis, such as data processing facilities. These needs are being
addressed by the proposed Project.



-9-
Training
2.08    Due to severely constrained cash flow, KSEB has had to curtail its
training (para 4.16). It has expressed an eagerness to revive these
activities in conjunction with the proposed project. Consequently, funds
have been included in the cost of the proposed project for training, based on
a preliminary assessment of needs prepared by KSEB. At negotiations, GOK
agreed that KSEB would develop a detailed training program acceptable to the
Bank not later than June 30, 1986.



-10-
III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    The proposed Project will be located in the State of Kerala
(Map 18738), whose power system is interconnected through a 220 kV line to
the rest of the Southern Region Power System (SRPS). The SRPS comprises the
states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and Lhe Union
Territories of Pondicherry and the Lakshadweep Islands. A second
interconnection, at 400 kV, is planned for 1990 under a Bank financed
project, the Second Ramagundam Thermal Power Project. As of July 1984 the
SRPS had a total capacity of 9,685 MW, of which 3,407 MW were coal-fired
steam plants, 6,043 MW were hydro and 235 nuclear. Peak demand in the SRPS
grew between 1980/81 and 1984/85 at an annual rate of about 6Z; however, this
rate of growth underestimates real demand growth due to the progressive
severity of supply constraints. These constraints are expected to prevail
into the coming decade despite the rapid planned growth in instaLled
capacity, estimated to reach 25,100 NW by 1994/95. Annex 2 shows the power
supply position for the Southern Region. The integrated operation of the SRPS
is controlled by the Southern Regional Electricity Board which is responsible
for: (i) daily, weekly and seasonal scheduling of the generation of the
individual power stations; (ii) scheduling their maintenance; and
(iii) preparing the power exchange tariffs, for approval by the member SEBs.
The role of the Board is however constrained by the lack of sufficient
capacity of the interstate lines and by the prevailing regional shortages of
capacity which impede optimal integrated operation. The completion of the
ongoing Ramagundam Thermal Power Project and its associated 400 kV
transmission lines is expected to partially remove these constraints.
Kerala's system is entirely hydro and has an installed capacity of 1,011 MW,
which is sufficient only in average or above average hydrological years.
However, KSEB has had to introduce selective power cuts and staggering during
recent dry years. Annex 3 shows the projected supply and demand for
electricity in Kerala to 1994/95. Due to the lack of adequate stand-by
reserve, not to mention spinning reserve, to the configuration of the system
and to the nature of the loads, voltage regulation of Kerala is poor.
Furthermore, the observed power factor is only 0.82. KSEB, as other SEBs,
has traditionally given low priority to distribution works, and the
construction or upgrading of networks is undertaken only when there are
resources left after funding generation and high tension transmission or when
pressure from consumers becomes politically unacceptable. Electricity losses
in Kerala are estimated at 20% of the total generation and, although they are
relatively low when compared to other States in India, further reductions are
possible and desirable. It is expected that through the works contemplated
under the project, losses will be reduced by 3% to 5% by 1989/90. The
general objectives of the Project have been evolved to address these
problems. Specific project objectives are developed below.
Project Objectives
3.02    In addition to the primary objective of increasing the installed
capacity in Kerala and the SRPS, the Project will help to: (a) make more
intensive use of India's hydropower potential; (b) improve the performance



-11-
and efficiency of the existing system; and (c) strengthen managerial,
commercial and financial practices of KSEB.
Project Description
3.03    The proposed Project will include the following components:
(a) construction of a run-of-the-river 180 MW hydropower station
consisting of a diversion dam, intake, head race tunnel, penstocks
and a powerhouse equipp2d with three Francis-type units of 60 MW
each;
(b) construction of 413 km of 220 kV double circuit transmission
lines and the associated substations (1180 MVA) to feed the
load centers of Cannanore, Kozhikode and Cochin;
(c) installation of 760 MVAR of reactive compensation to improve the
system's power factor;
(d) reinforcement of the secondary transmission and distribution
networks (110 kV to 11 kY) in the three major cities of Kozhikode,
Cochin and Trivandrum, including the installation of about 270 MVA
of additional distribution substations and the associated
distribution cables and lines, switching stations, and distribution
transformers;
(e) provision of training, technical assistance, and consulting services
to implement parts (a) to (d) of the project; and
(f)  implementation of an institutional development program, including
acquisition of data processing facilities and consulting and training
services to KSEB for:
(i) design and implementation of an information system, including
a commercial accounting system, for management and planning;
(ii) an organization and management review, together with subsequent
implementation of its recommendations;
(iii) preparation of a comprehensive fixed asset inventory; and
(iv) preparation of a study leading to a simpler and more efficient
tariff schedule for the Board.
Annex 5 gives a more detailed description of the works contemplated in the
Project.
Project Costs
3.04    Table 3.1 shows a summary of project costs.  The total cost of the
Project including physical and price contingencies (but excluding about
US$59.1 million equivalent of taxes and duties) is US$274.2 million



-12-
equivalent, of which US$95.0 million (352) represents the foreign exchange
costs. Interest during construction adds another US$66.5 million to the
financing required. The Project costs are based on May 1985 forecast prices
level and are derived from actual December 1984 prices for similar works,
adjusted for estimated inflation. Physical contingencies of 10% on civil
works and 5% on mechanical and electrical equipment have been allowed,
amounting to about 7% of the base cost. Physical contingencies for civil
works are in line with the advanced status of design, the degree of knowledge
of the site geology and the relatively simple nature of the works to be
executed. The excavations for the head race tunnel, already under
construction, have confirmed the excellent regional geology revealed during
the execution of the neighbouring Idukky underground scheme. Price
contingencies for the local cost, amounting to about 24Z of the base cost,
are based on an expected annual inflation rate of 8.5% between 1985 and 1990.
Price contingencies for foreign costs were assumed to be 8% for 1985, 9% for
1986-87, 7.5% for 1989, and 6% thereafter. Quantities were obtained from
designs at tender level. Unit prices for civil works are based on recent
quotations received in Kerala for similar works and or. actual tender prices
for the headrace tunnel of the Lower Periyar Station. The cost of major
electrical and mechanical equipment has been obtained from proforma
quotations furnished by manufacturers while that of miscellaneous equipment
is based on recent purchases of similar elements by KSEB. The cost of
consulting services is based on an estimated total of 450 man-months, of
which about 300 man-months will be local and 150 man-months will be
expatriate experts, and includes fees, overheads, travel, and subsistence
expenses. An amount of 10% of the base cost net of duties and taxes has been
assumed for engineering and administration. Interest during construction has
been added at an annual rate of 10.75Z for all Government loans. It has been
assumed that no front-end fee will be charged. Annex 5 presents a project
cost estimate by nature of expenditure, and a detailed project cost estimate.

Project Financing
3.05    The proposed Bank financing for the Project amounts to US$176.0
million equivalent, representing about 52% of the total project financing
requirements, net of duties and taxes. The Bank loan will finance
US$95.0 million of the foreign exchange cost and US$81.0 million of local
costs. KSEB will finance US$107 million equivalent out of its internally
generated funds, or 27% of the total financing required. GOK will provide
US$76.6 million equivalent and GOI will finance about US$40.2 million of
foreign currency representing interest and other charges on the Bank's loan.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI is prepared to seek
financing through suppliers' or export credits or commercial banks of about
US$30 million, representing 85Z of the cost of the reactive power
compensation equipment, the 66 kV gas insulated switchgear and the 110/66 kV
cables for the distribution works. If this financing materializes, the Bank
funds no longer needed for these items would be reallocated to other elements
of the project. The Bank loan to GOI will be at the prevailing variable rate
of interest and will be repaid over 20 years, including 5 year grace period.
OI will make the Bank loan and other external cofinancing funds available to
G0K as part of central assistance to States for development projects on terms
and conditions applicable at the time. GOK will onlend the funds provided by
COI, together with its own resources, to KSEB in accordance with the terms
outlined in para 4.31. GOI will bear the exchange and interest risk and will
finance any eventual cost overruns. Table 3.2 shows the proposed financing
plan.

Project Engineering
3.06    Project engineering is generally at the bidding level.  The
distribution and the reactive power compensation components need further
detailing for tendering which will be done with the assistance of consultants
(para 3.08). KSEB, with the assistance of the Central Water Comission (CWC)
for the civil works and of CEA for the electro-mechancial aspects, have been
developing the detailed engineering for the Project since 1982. Field
investigations for the Lower Periyar station, however, began in 1971. In
June 1984, KSEB appointed an independent Panel of Experts under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank to oversee the technical aspects of project
design and construction. The Panel of Experts, met in August 1984 and
approved the proposed power station layout with minor modifications which



-14-
have been accommodated as the design work progressed. The Panel will be
retained until the completion of the Project.
Project Implementation and Construction Schedule
3.07    KSEB will be the implementing agency for the Project.  The Project
will be executed over a period of about 7 years. The construction of the
head race tunnel for the Lower Periyar Station began in August 1984. The
three units are expected to be commissioned in May 1989, October 1989 and
February 1990. The transmission lines, associated substations, and
distribution works proposed under the project are scheduled to be completed
around the first quarter of 1990. However, the lines Idukky-Lower Periyar
(35 km) and Lower Periyar-Trichur (100 km) as well as the expansion of the
220 kV bays at Trichur need to be completed not later than June 1986 to
enable the evacuation of power from Idukky Power Plant-Phase II. To achieve
these targets, the contracts for major civil works and for supply of major
equipment for the power station must be awarded during the first half of
1986. Materials and equipment for the transmission and distribution
components should be ordered in January 1986. The proposed Project
construction schedule is shown in Annex 6.
3.08    CEA and CWC will provide general engineering and consulting services
to KSEB. In addition, independent consultants will assist KSEB in the
preparation of detailed engineering for particular components as described
below. The responsibilities of CEA and CWC will include, but will not be
limited to, the preparation or review of tender documents, the preparation of
technical specifications of major electro-mechanical equipment and of
drawings for construction of the civil works, and the provision of general
technical assistance during project construction. Both CEA and CWC have
experience in similar projects as they have served as the engineers for most
of the hydropower and irrigation schemes in India for several decades. KSEB
has a cadre of well experienced construction and supervision engineers for
the civil works who have been responsible for the construction of far more
complex projects, for instance the Idukky scheme (780 MW), involving an
underground power station and a variety of major dams. KSEB has appointed a
Chief Engineer, Construction, for the Lower Periyar Station and a
satisfactory organization for the implementation of this part of the project
has been established. Another position of Chief Engineer has been created to
coordinate and supervise the associated transmission and distribution works,
for most of which KSEB also has extensive experience. However, KSEB has no
substantial prior experience in selection, procurement or installation of
reactive power compensation equipment, underground transmission and gas
insulated switchgear. Consequently, KSEB has retained consultants to assist
in: (i) refining the engineering of the proposed distribution and reactive
power compensation elements of the Project; (ii) preparing their final
technical specifications; (iii) evaluating tenders; (iv) supervising their
construction and installation; and (v) providing general advice to KSEB as
needed on other project related matters. It is estimated that about 100
man-months of consulting services will be required for this purpose.
3.09    Due to the involvement of several KSEB's organizational units and to
the number of contracts to be executed under this Project, KSEB confirmed at



-15-
negotiations that it will create, before September 30, 1985, a Project Cell
under the Chief Engineer (Planning) to: (a) coordinate project
implementation; (b) serve as liaison with COI, CEA, CWC and the Bank;
(c) monitor project execution; (d) prepare the necessary periodic reports for
the Project authorities and the Bank; and (e) process disbursement
applications.
3.10    KSEB will retain consultants under terms satisfactory to the Bank
for the implementation of the institutional development program. It has been
estimated that KSEB will need about 350 man-months of consulting and training
services for the fixed assets inventory (100 man-months), management and
organization review (50 man-months), implementation of commercial accounting
and management information system (120 man-months), data processing
implementation (30 man-months), and tariffs study (50 man-months). Annex 7
presents the suggested terms of reference for the services mentioned above.
In vies of the interrelationship of these consulting services, KSEB agreed
during negotiations for an undertaking to create a Steering Committee for the
Institutional Development Program including key members of KSEB's staff to
coordinate all technical assistance and training activities. The consultants
would participate as needed in the Committee. KSEB agreed at negotiations
for an undertaking that it will retain these consultants no later than
December 31, 1985, with the exception of the consultants assisting with
implementation of commercial accounting and those conducting the fixed-asset
inventory, and valuation both of whom will be appointed not later than August
31, 1985.

All civil works contracts with an estimated cost of US$5 million equivalent
or more and all contracts for suppLy of goods with an estimated cost of US$1
million equivalent or more will be subject to ICB, and the balance to LCB
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Major local firms are expected to be
competitive in the civil works and most of the equipment supply tenders.
Foreign suppliers will not be precluded from participating in LCB. About
80% of works and services for the Project will be procured under ICB. Local
contractors, competing under ICB will have 7.5% of preference margin for
civil works and local manufacturers a 15% preference or the applicable duty
whichever is less, for supply of goods. Consultants will be selected in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. All civil work contracts with an
estimated cost of US$5 million or more equivalent will be subject to the
Bank's prior review. All equipment contracts with an estimated cost of US$1
million or more equivalent will also be subject to Bank's prior review.
Prior review will apply to about 90Z of the estimated cost of Bank financed
elements. Other contracts will be subject to selective post-award review.
Disbursements
3.12    Disbursements of Bank funds will be made against:  (a) 100% of CIF
price of imported goods; (b) 1002 of the ex-facr?ry cost of locally
manufactured goods; (c) 50% of local expenditure for other items procured
locally; {d) 100Z of consultants' services; and (f) 60Z of the civil works.
Disbursements will be fully documented except for (a) payments under civil
works contracts for one or more progress payments not exceeding Rs600,000
each, and (b) payments for locally procured items of equipment not exceeding
Rs300,000 each. Such disbursements will be made against statements of
expenditures (SOEs), the documentation of which will not be submitted to the
Bank Group but retained for inspection by the supervision missions. The
standard procedure for auditing SOEs will apply. Annex 8 shows the estimated
disbursements schedule as derived from the construction program, considering
the normal commercial payment term.s for the types of contracts envisaged for
this project. The proposed Project contains a provision of up to US$i00,000
to finance retroactively certain consulting activities (paras 3.08 and 3.10)
which will begin during the spring and summer of 1985. Since there is no
information available on typical disbursement profiles for similar power
projects in India (power station combined with transmission and
distribution), no meaningful comparison can be made in that respect.
However, the Project's disbursement profile fits closely a Bankwide blended
profile for generation, transmission and distribution projects. The closing
date will be September 30, 1991.
Water Rights
3.13    The Periyar river is within the State of Kerala in its entire length.
There are no pending water rights disputes or claims that can affect the
Project's construction or operation. Furthermore, being a run-of-the-river
scheme, the present flow regime of the river will not be materially altered.



-18-
Land Acquisition and Resettlement
3.14    The pondage created by the intake dam of the Lower Periyar Station
covers, at full level, only 44 ha, which KSEB already owns. The land for the
powerhouse and the associated switchyard is also in KSEB's possession. The
expansion of most of the existing transmission substations will be feasible
on land which KSEB already owns and, where this is not the case, the
necessary land is being acquired. In order to minimize the space needs for
the new distribution substations in the crowded and expensive centers of
Cochin, Trivandrum and Kozhikode, gas insulated switchgear is being proposed.
The properties for these distribution substations, planned to start *n 1988,
is presently being identified and valued. No land acquisition is il olved
for the transmission lines, since the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 does
not require that KSEB acquire the land for the erection of the transmission
towers. Compensation is only provided for trees cut; cultivation is
permitted under the line and towers. No major resettlement of population is
involved in the Project. Seventeen families displaced from the power station
site, who KSEB claims were illegal settlers, have vacated the site but took
their cases to court, a commission of enquiry was appointed and the Kerala
High Court took up the issue on appeal. Although a decision on the amount of
compensation to be paid is still pending, the amounts involved compared to
project costs are considered negligible.
Environmental Aspects
3.15    The Project has been cleared by the Department of Environment (COI).
The proposed diversion dam will raise the water level permanently to the
seasonal high flow level of the Periyar river up to the existing
Neriamangalam power station some 4 km upstream.  Since no reservoir will be
created, water quality is not at issue, neither is fish migration in view
of the existing dams upstream. Malaria and filaria have been eradicated from
the entire State of Kerala for more than a decade and the risk of
schistosomiasis is considered low due to the distances to potentially
contaminating places (Tamil Nadu). The Project will pose almost no harm to
forest land. Only some 40 ha as a narrow (few meters wide) strip will be
affected on the right bank of the pondage for the Lower Periyar Station. For
the power house, operation camp, adits, dumps, etc. a total of 127 ha will
be deforested. As a compensatory measure, KSEB will finance the Kerala State
Forestry Department to plant 127 ha of forest near Munar Village. KSEB
reports that no rare or endangered biota will be affected. Jeep access roads
to an average of every six towers will be built for construction of the
transmission lines, this will be allowed to revert to forest and will be
rendered unusable to avoid forest encroachment. Line maintenance (twice a
year) is to be completed on foot.
Project Operation
3.16    Th2 catchment area of the Periyar River at the proposed power station
is 1053 km representing about 20Z of the total basin area. The river falls
rapidly from its origin at elevation 1830 m to elevation 200 m at the power
station site. The station will be located in the low land of the basin where
the river enters the Lower Periyar Valley. The Periyar river is regulated



-19-
upstream of the station at the Idukky reservoir (1460 Mm3 live storage) and
their waters are diverted into a neighboring basin through the Idukky power
plant, leaving about 400 km of catchment area for Lower Periyar station. The
inflows to Lower Periyar consist of the yield from the catchment downstream
of Idukky reservoir plus the tail race regulated releases Ind spills of the
Neriamangalam power station with a catchment area of 73 km . The average
annual flow at Lower Periyar is 1,400 Mm of which about 802 occurs between
June and September. Since there is daily regulation at Lower Periyar
station, it will operate as a peaking plant in the dry season but as a
run-of-river plant in the wet season. The average annual output is 604 GWh
and the 90% dependable generation is 493 GWh.
Proje:t Monitoring
3.17    KSEB agreed at negotiations to furnish quarterly progress reports
covering physical works, consultants work, costs, disbursements, and
administrative aspects of the Project. In addition there will be annual
reports on the financial position and management situation of the Board,
which will be monitored on the basis of targets agreed during negotiations
(Table 4.3). Finally, assurances were obtained during negotiatioris that KSEB
will arrange, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, for periodic inspections
of the works to be constructed under the Project in order to ensure their
safe operation and proper maintenance.
Project Risks
3.18    There are no extraordinary technical risks associated with the
Project. The power station scheme does not involve any engineering
technology beyond the limits of well known practices. Geological
investigations and initial excavation of the headrace tunnel have confirmed
the expected excellent rock formation prevalent throughout the area.
Consequently, no special difficulties are expected for the tunneling works.
KSEB has sufficient staff experienced in supervising and executing most of
the works similar to those proposed in the Project and appropriate
consultants support will be provided for those areas in which KSEB's
experience is limited, to minimize any undue risks in this regard.

IV. FINANCE
Introduction
4.01    The financial operations of the SEBs are regulated by the Act.  In
June 1978 and August 1983, the Act was amended to enable the SEBs to
reorganize their finances along commercial lines. However, the SEBs continue
to maintain extremely poor accounts, with inadequate financial staff
implementing different accounting systems, most of which are fraught with ad
hoc rules and procedures. Most SEB senior financial managers possess
excellent qualifications; however, given the poor quality of raw data
developed at field offices, they lack the resources to compile timely and
reliable accounts.
4.02    Though more independent than many SEBs, KSEB's financial and
commercial practices fit the typical profile. KSEB believes it should
strengthen its accounting, financial, and commercial operations by increasing
the number of financial managers while improving the qualifications and
skills of staff responsible for maintaining accounts at KSEB's field offices;
the Bank has made provisions in the proposed project to support these
institutional development objectives (paras 4.07-4.08).
4.03    In developing the proposed project, KSEB invested considerable effort
and retained consultants to assist with the financial preparations. Thus,
KSEB was able to provide considerable details regarding the contents of
accounts, based on professionally sound approaches to mitigating the
questionable quality of raw data. Thus, even though the accounts contain
some inaccuracies, the information is adequate for the Bank to draw sound
conclusions from its financial analysis. KSEB needs to correct certain poor
financial practices. The recommended corrective measures and financial
targets comprise an integrated financial recovery program (para 4.36). The
program is designed to encourage financial discipline and ensure sufficient
liquidity for operational and investment requirements.
A. Financial Management
Financial Organization
4.04    KSEB's finance and accounting functions are headed by an Accounts
Member, who is a qualified chartered accountant. He serves as a member of
KSEB's Board and, de facto, as a chief financial officer. KSEB has decided
that the fulfillment of those two roles requires another full-time incumbent
and is currently recruiting another qualified chartered accountant to serve
in the vacant post of Chief Accounts Officer (para 4.07).
4.05    At headquarters, KSEB has one Deputy Chief Accounts Officer and four
Senior Accounts Officers. The Senior Accounts Officers are responsible for
producing accounts and managing various accounting services. Most of KSEB's
accounting data is compiled in the field in 145 account-rendering units, each
of which is managed by one of 97 divisional accountants. The divisional
accountants report to either the superintending engineer or the executive
engineer who heads that particular office. Under KSEB's existing
organization structure, accounting managers at headquarters have functional



-21-
responsibility for the output of the divisional accountants in the field but
lack direct authority over, or direct communications with, them.
4.06    KSEB does not have enough accounting managers to verify the accuracy
and comprehensiveness of accounting data compiled in the field. Moreover,
the degree of autonomy that divisional accountants must exercise often
requires higher qualifications and broader authority than is specified in
their job descriptions. KSEB must strengthen its accounts and finance
function by adding senior managers and upgrading the qualifications of its
field personnel.
4.07    At appraisal, KSEB indicated that it would reorganize its finance
department (Annex 9). As a first step, it would increase to four the number
of Deputy Chief Accounts Officers and to ten the number of Senior Accounts
Officers. Some of the new posts would be filled by internal promotion of
staff possessing the necessary qualifications; the remainder would be filled
by external recruitment. Forty-eight of the existing 97 divisional
accountants are considered to have adequate qualifications, the remainder
will be offered the opportunity to acquire specialized training or be
replaced through natural attrition. This proposed reorganization is
considered satisfactory as an interim measure, prior to the comprehensive
organization and Management Study (para 2.03). At negotiations, KSEB
provided an undertaking that it will conduct an interim reorganization of its
finance department in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 9), and fill
new senior financial managerial posts with adequately qualified people not
later than December 31, 1985.
Accounting System
4.08    Under the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN), GOI
agreed that the SEBs would implement a uniform system of commercial
accounting by April 1, 1984. Because of delays in developing the new system,
the Bank agreed that its implementation could begin on April 1, 1985. A new
system was circulated to the SEBs and to the Controller and Auditor General
(C&AG) for comments in the spring of 1984. At that time, GOI indicated its
intention to notify the new system in the Official Gazette before April 1,
1985, after receiving the C&AG's comments. These comments were received only
in January 1985 and were circulated to the SEBs in preparation for
notification of the new system. The late receipt of the C&A.G's comments left
GOI with insufficient time to translate the system into Hindi by April 1,
1985 (Indian Law requires that new regulations be notified in both English
and Hindi); at negot_ations, GOI agreed that the new accounting system would
be notified by Julyv 5, 1985. Even though the new system will be notified
by July 15, 1985, KSEB will need more time than is being provided between
notification and introduction to assure correct implementation of the new
system; therefore, at negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that it will
take all preparatory steps necessary to ensure that, by the beginning of the
financial year 1986/87 (April 1, 1986), it will implement correctly
commercial accounting according to the system to be notified by GOI.
4.09    Although the introduction of commercial accounting is expected to
be delayed by one more year, KSEB needs to use that time to prepare for the



-22-
new system. Suspense accounts will need to be cleared (para 4.21); and fixed
assets will need to be inventoried (para 4.22). In addition, KSEB's
divisional accountants and their staffs will need extensive on-the-job and
classroom training. New ledgers, code books and forms will need to be
designed, printed and distributed. KSEB has asked that technical assistance
be provided under the proposed Project to prepare for implementation of
commercial accounting in the year before introduction and provide ongoing
training and support during the first two years after introduction. Draft
terms of reference for this technical assistance have been discussed at
appraisal (Annex 7). At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that by
August 31, 1985, it will retain consultants to provide technical assistance,
according to terms of reference and a schedule agreeable to the Bank, to
prepare for and implement commercial accounting. The Bank is satisfied that,
even before introduction of the new accounting system and implementation of
this technical assistance, KSEB can maintain project accounts adequately.
Audit of Accounts
4.10    KSEB's accounts are audited by the C&AG, who has satisfactorily
completed the audit report for 1982/83. At negotiations, COK agreed that
KSEB would furnish to the Bank its unaudited annual financial statements not
later than nine months after the close of each financial year; and, not later
than twelve months after the end of such year, its annual financial
statements certified by the C&AG or an acceptable alternate, together with
the auditor's report. KSEB currently has an an internal audit unit. In the
past, the questionable quality of raw accounting data negated the potential
benefits from having that internal audit unit. Nevertheless, KSEB recognizes
the importance of this activity and will ensure that the Organization and
Management Study (para 2.03) makes specific recommendations for strengthening
it. At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that would reorganize its
internal audit unit, in accordance with acceptable recommendations of the
Organization and Management Study, not later than December 31, 1986.
Data Processing
4.11    KSEB's management believes that, to cope with its rapidly growing
data base and information required for operations, it must computerize the
handling of data, which until now has been collected and processed manually.
Consequently, it is proposing to introduce comprehensive computerization,
based on a consulting study. The Bank has reviewed the study's proposals and
considers that it recommends a satisfactory beginning to the needed
comprehensive computerization program which would be developed in parallel
with the Organization and Management Study.
Billings and Collections
4.12    In 1982/83 and 1983/84, KSEB's accounts receivable increased
unsatisfactorily (para 4.24). KSEB believes this resulted, inter alia, from
slow payment of the larger bills generated because meter reading became
irregular as the number of consumers connected to the system grew.
Therefore, the tariff notified in September 1982 was designed to accommodate
a limited use of self-billing. Under KSEB's system, a consumer is assigned



-23-
to a billing category based on historical levels of demand and consumption.
The consumer is furnished with billing cards to enable hini to remit paymnents
monthly to one of KSEB's 500 section offices. Meter readers would then make
readings and corrective billings on a regular basis. Many corrective
readings are taken quarterly; all meters are required to be read
semiannually. This system applies to all but high tension (HT) and extra
high tension (EHT) consumers, whose meters are read every month by the
Assistant Engineer in charge of the section office. KSEB believes that this
system has been working satisfactorily and that collection of receivables has
improved substantially since it was introduced. Until the Organization and
Management Study is completed, the existing billing and collection systems do
not need modification.
Insurance
4.13    KSEB follows standard practices for insuring against partial or total
loss of goods and equipment being procured under ongoing projects. For
permanent installations, KSEB holds policies which conform, in terms of the
nature and amount of coverage, to accepted utility practices in India.
Income Taxes
4.14    SEBs are liable for income tax; however, KSEB has not incurred any
income tax obligation, primarily because of the high proportion of debt in
its capital structure and the allowances generated by its large investment
program. Since it is projecting intensive capital expenditure between
1985/86 and 1994/95, KSEB is not likely to incur any income tax liability
in the intermediate term future.
B. Financial Performance
Past and Present Financial Performance
4.15    KSEB provided audited accounts for the years 1981/82 and 1982/83.
Additionally, it provided budget figures for 1983/84 and 1984/85. This
summary of its past and present financial performance is displayed in
Annex 10. Key financial indicators are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.16    KSEB self-financed a significant portion of its investment program in
1982/83 and 1983/84 and projects doing so again in 1984(85. However, KSEB
arranged this self-financing by (a) ignoring its interest obligations on its
extensive borrowings from GOK (para 4.18); (b) ignoring substantial taxes to
GOK (para 4.19); (c) extending excessively its accounts payable (para 4.23);
(d) postponing some maintenance expenditures; and (e) substantially cutting
its training activities. In part, these measures were necessitated by the
severe drought conditions that prevailed in 1982/83 and 1983/84, which
reduced the amount of power available for sale. In order to limit the
revenue shortfall, KSEB rationed power to HT and EHT consumers, who pay much
less per kWh than LT consumers. Thus, in 1982/83 and 1983/84, KSEB's average
revenue per kWh increased substantially more than its tariff. In contrast,
assuming average hydrology for 1984/85, KSEB's average revenue per kWh would
decrease by about 10% while its tariff has been increased by about 8%. As a
consequence of both its commitment to self-financing and the negative impact
of hydrology on revenues, KSEB's working capital decreased dramatically
during the 1981/82-1983/84 period. Its debt/equity ratio for the same period
of about 96/4 was computed without adjusting for suspense accounts; had
proper adjustments been made, the debt/equity ratio wouli have been 98/2
during that period. Several provisions of the financial recovery plan are
intended to eliminate the negative effects of KSEB's past reliance on
financial expedients.
4.17    GOK Loans.  GOK, like all other State Governments, follows a policy
that whatever investment in the power sector is not financed from internal
cash generation must be financed from loans. KSEB has borrowed significantly
from a variety of Indian financial institutions; the balance of its
borrowings has been obtained from GOK. While meeting its debt service
obligations to all other lenders, KSEB has ignored responsibilities



-25-
associated with loans from GOK; meanwhile, GOK has not pressed KSEB for
payment of these obligations.
4.18    GOK has financed KSEB primarily with "perpetual" loans.  KSEB is not
in default on repayment obligations; however, it is more than five years in
arrears in paying interest on these loans. As of March 31, 1984, KSEB
recorded arrears in interest to GOK of about Rs. 380 million, which are
classified as current liabilities. KSEB cannot meet these arrears within the
next year without jeopardizing its liquidity. Furthermore, because a
maturity period or lack thereof is not specified in the notification of the
"perpetual" loans, they may be called in whole or in part at the sole
discretion of COK. The 1983 amendment to the Act specifies that a call on
either the arrears in interest or the principal (or a portion thereof) of
these "perpetual" loans, while subordinate to operating expenses and interest
accrued during the current period, has priority over expenditures for
investment. At negotiations, GOK provided an undertaking that it would
subordinate repayment of both arrears in interest and principal repayments on
all existing and anticipated "perpetual" loans to funds needed to implement
Plan approved projects. Effectively, this undertaking endows the "perpetual"
loans with the same characteristics as cumulative preferred stock. Thus,
while GOK may consider capital provided in this manner as loans, the Bank may
reclassify this capital as equity for the purposes of financial analysis.
4.19    Arrears for Taxes.  During the past several years, KSEB has not
remitted to GOK its taxes on operations.l/ In September 1984, these arrears
in taxation amounted to Rs. 428 million. This obligation has been carried
as a current liability and GOK had indicated that it expected KSEB to make
payments against this amount as and when cash became available. In addition,
GOK has cited these arrears as a reason for trimming the amount of its
project loans to KSEB. KSEB cannot meet these obligations on a current basis
and retain adequate liquidity. At negotiations, GOK provided an undertaking
that it will subordinate repayment of these obligations to funds needed to
implement Plan approved projects. As with "perpetual" loans,this undertaking
enables the Bank to reclassify these obligations as equity for the purposes
of financial analysis (para 4.18).
4.20    Intangible Assets.  KSEB is carrying about Rs. 270 million on its
balance sheet in an account entitled "Intangible Assets." These assets
represent engineering work and some initial site preparation for projects
which GOK has dropped from KSEB's investment program. The Act makes no
specific provision for expensing such assets and, at present, KSEB does not
expense them. At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that it will
expense extraordinarily the full amount of intangible assets in a manner
acceptable to the Bank in a period of not more than eight years.

tion to KSEB's tariff and which are deposited to GOK at the time of
collection.

associated with loans from COK; meanwhile, COK has not pressed KSEB for
payment of these obligations.
4.18    COK has financed KSEB primarily with "perpetual" loans.  KSEB is not
in default on repayment obligations; however, it is more than five years in
arrears in paying interest on these loans. As of March 31, 1984, KSEB
recorded arrears in interest to COK of about Rs. 380 million, which are
classified as current iiabilities. KSEB cannot meet these arrears within the
next year without jeopardizing its liquidity. Furthermore, because a
maturity period or lack thereof is not specified in the notification of the
"perpetual" loans, they may be called in whole or in part at the sole
discretion of COK. The 1983 amendment to the Act specifies that a call on
either the arrears in interest or the principal (or a portion thereof) of
these "perpetual" loans, while subordinate to operating expenses and interest
accrued during the current period, has priority over expenditures for
investment. At negotiations, GOK provided an undertaking that it would
subordinate repayment of both arrears in interest and principal repayments on
all existing and anticipated "perpetual" loans to funds needed to implement
Plan approved projects. Effectively, this representation endows the
"perpetual" loans with the same characteristics as preferred stock. Thus,
while GOK may consider capital provided in this manner as loans, the Bank may
reclassify this capital as equity for the purposes of financial analysis.
4.19    Arrears for Taxes.  During the past several years, KSEB has not
remitted to GOK its taxes on operations.l/ In September 1984, these arrears
in taxation amounted to Rs. 428 million. This obligation has been carried
as a current liability and GOK had indicated that it expected KSEB to make
payments against this amount as and when cash became available. In addition,
COK has cited these arrears as a reason for trimming the amount of its
project loans to KSEB. KSEB cannot meet these obligations on a current basis
and retain adequate liquidity. At negotiations, COK provided an undertaking
that it will subordinate repayment of these obligations to funds needed to
implement Plan approved projects. This representation protects KSEB's
liquidity and enables the Bank to treat these obligations as equity for the
pu-poses of financial analysis, based on considerations similar to those used
in relation to "perpetual" loans (para 4.18).
4.20    Intangible Assets.  KSEB is carrying about Rs. 270 million on its
balance sheet in an account entitled "Intangible Assets." These assets
represent engineering work and some initial site preparation for projects
which GOK has dropped from KSEB's investment program. The Act makes no
specific provision for expensing such assets and, at present, KSEB does not
expense them. At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that it will
expen;e extraordinarily the full amount of intangible assets in a manner
acceptable to the Bank in a period of not more than eight years.
1/ These taxes are separate from Excise Taxes charged the consumer in addi-
tion to KSEB's tariff and which are deposited to GOK at the time of
collection.



-27-
4.21    Suspense Accounts.  In its audited accounts for 1982/83, KSEB was
carrying about Rs. 360 million in a Materials Suspense Account. This is an
account for holding transactions only until the accounts department receives
the necessary supporting documentation from all parties to the transaction.
At KSEB, non-completion of this documentation has been a chronic problem and
many items included under this heading should have been reallocated to other
accounts years ago. KSEB estimated that about 75% of the assets classified
under the Material Suspense Account have been used in capital construction,
and therefore should have been reallocated to work in progress or gross fixed
assets. The remainder is believed to have been expended in operations and
maintenance and should have been included among KSEB's expenses in previous
years. Similarly, KSEB has been carrying another suspense account entitled
"Inter-unit Transactions" on its year-end balance sheet. As of September
1984, about Rs. 147 million were included in this account. KSEB believes
that the amounts included in this account were used entirely for operations
and maintenance and should have been expensed in previous periods. At
negotiation, KSEB provided an undertaking that, following a review of the
contents of these accounts, it will capitalize those items which can be
identified as having been used in the construction of specific assets and
recognize as an extraordinary expense those items which have been expended
for operation and maintenance. The adjustments which are completed prior to
March 31, 1986 will be made in KSEB's accounts for the financial year
1985/86; the remainder will be taken into KSEB's 1986/87 annual accounts.
In total, these adjustments are believed to imply extraordinary losses of
about Rs. 240 million.
4.22    Fixed Asset Accounting.  KSEB's fixed asset registers do not
accurately reflect its plant and equipment. Until the late 1970s, the fixed
asset registers were not maintained comprehensively or systematically; since
then, accounting practice has improved; but, the engineering records, from
which the fixed asset registers are derived, still appear incomplete and out
of date. The proposed project includes a provision for a comprehensive fixed
asset inventory to be conducted by KSEB with assistance from consultants.
Draft terms of reference for this consultancy were discussed at appraisal
(Annex 7). This inventory has the dual objective of providing accurate
financial records of KSEB's plant and equipment while updating the
information needed for operation, inspection and maintenance of all
facilities. At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that it will, not
later than August 31, 1985, retain consultants acceptable to the Bank to
conduct a fixed-asset inventory
4.23    Accounts Payable.  During the past four years, KSEB has stretched its
current liabilities beyond acceptable levels. GOK is by far KSEB's largest
creditor; however, a number of suppliers and contractors have significant due
bills outstanding and could create difficulties if together they pressed for
payment. Moreover, KSEB has exhausted the financial cushion afforded by
delaying payments to creditors. At negotiations, KSEB provided an
undertaking that, beginning in 1985/86, it will maintain its accounts payable
at not more than the operating expenses and capital expenditure, net of those
capital expenditures financed through suppliers' credits, incurred during the
preceding two months.



-28-
4.24    Accounts Receivable.  In 1982/83 and 1983/84, KSEB encountered
difficulties in collecting its revenues, resulting partly from consumer
resistance to the September 1982 tariff increase and partly from the slower
payment of larger bills issued according to the uneven pattern of meter
readings and billings (para 4.12). To address this problem, KSEB changed its
billing practices to enable consumers to remit payments against
self-assessments and took legal action against numerous municipalities whose
arrears had become excessive. KSEB affirms that both these efforts have been
effective and that it expects to carry less than 3 months' accounts
receivable at the end of 1984/85. At negotiations, KSEB provided an
undertaking that it will maintain its accounts receivable at less than 2.5
months of sales in 1985/86 and less than 2.0 months of annual sales
thereafter.
4.25    Security Deposits.  Currently, KSEB collects two months' security
deposits from all consumers. The Bank considers this practice satisfactory.
KSEB's Tariff
4.26    The structure of KSEB's tariffs is extremely complex.  Although the
tariff specifies only nine major consumer categories, the majority of these
are subdivided and many of the subdivisions are divided further. The
essential elements of the HT and EST tariffs are a demand charge based on
recorded kVA or 75% of the contracted load, whichever is the higher, and one
or more energy charges depending on consumption per kVA. However the energy
charges are subject to complex adjustments which depend (nonlinearly) on what
proportions of the user's energy consumption is for factory lighting and
housing colonies. The domestic tariff comprises a fixed monthly charge and a
"slab-based" energy charge.  The "slab" system charges consumers a regular
monthly sum which depends on the consumption slab into which they fall, e.g.
someone using between 21 and 30 kWh per month would pay an energy charge of
Rs. 8.00. This system was designed to reduce the frequency of meter reading
from monthly to quarterly. Other Low Tension (LT) tariffs include fixed
charges, either flat rate or dependent on connected load, and energy charges
which are also either flat rate or dependent on connected load. The overall
effect is a very complex system of tariffs which is difficult for consumers
to comprehend and difficult for KSEB to administer. The structure is not
related to the underlying costs of supply.
4.27    In view of the complexity of the tariff, its difficulty of
administration, and its divergence from the costs of supply, the project
includes a study aimed at simplifying and improving the efficiency of KSEB's
tariff. The study will include:
(a) determination of the cost of supply for different categories of
consumers based on the power expansion plan for the Southern Region
approved by GOI;
(b) determination of a "lifeline" consumption level and a corresponding
affordable tariff;



-29-
(c) simplification of the tariff structure, with the objective of
better reflecting the cost of supplying different consumer classes;
and
(d) preparation of a program acceptable to the Bank for gradually
restructuring the tariffs as recommended by the study.
At negotiations, KSEB provided an undertaking that, to perform the study, it
would retain consultants, according to terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, not later than December 31, 1985.
4.28    GOK last increased KSEB's tariff in September 1982.  The increase
was intended to provide KSEB with about 30% more revenue. The tariff
increase was designed to take effect in stages, so that about 60% of its
effect was introduced in September 1982, a further 20% in April 1984, and the
remainder in April 1985. In addition to tariffs, KSEB's consumers pay excise
taxes which are related either to their consumption or their entire bill,
depending on consumer category. Table 4.2 (page 30) presents a summary of
average tariff realization per consumer by category for both 1981/82 and
1984/85. The average realization, including collections for excise taxes,
across all consumer categories has been about 40 paise/kWh in 1984/85. For
the purpose of comparison, the long-run marginal cost (strictly average
incremental cost) of power in the Southern Region is estimated to be 56
paise/kWh in economic terms, equivalent to an average financial tariff of 70
paise/kWh, given a standard conversion factor of 0.8.
Future Finance
4.29    KSEB's detailed financial projections for the period 1985/86-1994/95
are presented in Annex 10. Table 4.3 (page 30) summarizes the projected key
indicators for each year during that period.
4.30    Financing Plan.  KSEB's financing plan for the period 1985/86 through
1989/90, the period of execution of the proposed project, is presented in
Table 4.4. KSEB would finance 30% of its investment program (including
interest during construction) from internal cash generation. The proposed
Bank loan would finance 20% of KSEB's investment program. The proposed
Project is expected to comprise 38% of KSEB's investment program for the
period.

4.31    On-Lending.  At negotiations, COK agreed to on-lend the proceeds of
the Bank loan to KSEB for 20 years, including 5 years of grace on repayment
of princi.pal, at the higher of (a) the interest rate applicable on its loans
to KSEB at the time of drawdown, or (b) the Bank's current rate of 9.29%.
Currently, COK's applicable rate is 13.5%. The rate had remained constant
at 10.752 from mid-1981 until late 1984. GOK indicated that, while the
applicable rate might drop below the current level, it would probably not
fall below 10.75Z daring the period of project implementation.
Rate of Return
4.32    During appraisal, financial performance targets similar to the
contribution to investment eligibility criteria included in the Third Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN) were discussed with KSEB, GOK and GOI.
GOK and KSEB indicated that the tariffs implied by these financial
performance targets could be implemented without substantial difficulty.
However, GOI objected to the principle of contribution to investment targets,
indicating instead a preference for a rate of return approach that is



-32-
consistent with the August 1983 amendment to the Act. The Bank agreed with
this approach under the Chandrapur Thermal Power Project.
4.33    At negotiations, COK agreed that, beginning with 1985/86, it would
take all such measures as may be necessary, including adjustment of KSEB's
tariff, to ensure that KSEB's total revenues in any financial year shall,
after meeting:
(i) all expenses properly chargeable to revenues, including
operating, maintenance and management expenses;
{ii) taxes on income and profits;
(iii)  depreciation; and
(iv)  interest payable on all debentures, bonds and loans;
produce such surplus of not less than 3X of KSEB's net fixed assets in
service at the beginning of that year. This measure of performance is
identical to the financial performance requirement specified in the 1983
amendment to the Act.
4.34    At negotiations, COK confirmed that, for the purposes of evaluating
com,liance with this agreement, the critical terms would be defined as
follows:
(a) "tota! revenues" means KSEB's revenues from the sale of electricity
and other services, miscellaneous income, rural electrification
subsidies, state electricity duties received, and suc:. other
subventions received from GOK to cover extraordinary costs which are
borne by KSEB and which should not reasonably be borne by its
customers;
(b) "expenses" means the cost of power purchased, fuel, o-erating,
maintenance, management and administrative expenses, and all taxes
and duties accruing during the financial year, other L.aan taxes on
KSEB's income and profits;
(c) "taxes on income and profits" consist of income taxes and other
levies accrued by KSEB according to the provisions of any applicable
legislation or regulation;
(d) "depreciation" means a provision, based on KSEB's gross fixed assets
in service at the beginning of the year, derived by using the
straight line method in conjunction with the schedule of useful life
of assets that was notified according to provisions of Section 68
of the Act, on April 3, 1985;
(e) "interest payable on all debentures, bonds and loans" means all
interest (whether paid or waided), including interest during
construction, accrued by KSEB during the financial year, and all
other charges on debt; and



-33-
(f) "net fixed assets in service" means, (a) the original cost of fixed
assets, reduced by the aggregate of the cumulative depreciation taken
on those assets, less (b) consumers' contribution for service lines,
also reduced by the aggregate of the cumulative depreciation taken on
that portion of the service lines which were financed by consumer
contributions.
KSEB has not received any rural electrification or other subsidies from GOK
in recent years. The currently notified useful lives of assets are
appropriate. The Bank considers these definitions to be acceptable.
4.35    Table 4.3 (page 30) shows the acceptable financial performance levels
implied by Annual 3% surpluses computed according to this formula,
re-expressed in terms of the Bank's definitions of rate of return and
self-financing ratio. Based on the confirmed definitions, the minimum target
of 3% would yield annual rates of return on historically valued net fixed
assets in operaticn averaging 13.2% and annual self-financing ratios
averaging 33% during the period 1985/86-1993/94. The debt/debt plus equity
ratio, which is particularly low due to the reclassification of the
"perpetual" loans as an equity equivalent (para 4.18), should be read only as
an indicator of GOK's support for KSEB in periods of financial dififculty.
FinanciaL Recovery Program
4.36    The measures discussed in the preceding analysis are needed to put
KSEB on a sound financial footing. Taken together, these steps form a
comprehensive financial recovery program. To recapitulate, KSEB would:
(a) meet specified annual targets for:
Ci) revenue surplus (para 4.33);
(ii) accounts receivable (para 4.24); and
(iii) accounts payable (para 4.23).
(b) conduct a tariff study (para 4.27).
(c) make adjustments to its accounts including:
(i) expensing its intangible assets (para 4.20);
(ii) clearing its suspense accounts (para 4.21); and
(iii) conducting a fixed asset inventory (para 4.22).
(d) upgrade its accounting and financial practices by:
(i) strengthening its financial management (para 4.07);
(ii) introducing a commercial accounting system (para 4.08);



-34-
(iii) providing intense training to its finance and accounts
personnel (para 4.09); and
(iv) strengthening its internal audit unit (para 4.10).
Eurthermore, GOK would:
(e) enable KSEB to meet financial performance targets (para 4.34);
and
(f) subordinate repayment of principal of "perpetual" loans and arrears
in taxes and interest to funds needed to implement Plan approved
projects (paras 4.18 and 4.19).

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Analysis
5.01    The principal element of the p-oposed Project is the Lower Periyar
hydro scheme and, in relation to this, three particular decisions require
economic justification. These concern the installed capacity, the number of
units and the place of the scheme in the Southern Region's leazt cost
development plan. The justification for the installed capacity of 180 MW is
based on the trade-off between capital and operating costs of the Lower
Periyar Station and system savings estimated by reference to alternative
coal-fired generation. The Bank has reviewed this analysis and found it
sati3factory; brief details are given in Annex 11. The choice between 2 and
3 wi_ts is reasonably finely balanced with capital and operating cost
differences being partially offset by differences in generation during
periods of turbine outage. Nn initial choice of 2 units might have reduced
total system costs by $2.6 million. However, the advanced stage of
engineeLing for 3 units makes this the more economic option. Even a
one-month delay caused by changing the decision would increase total system
costs by $3.3 million, thereby eliminating any possible benefit from choosing
2 rather than 3 units. In fact, a change to 2 units would probably delay the
project by about six months. In order to analyse whether the scheme forms
part of the Southern Region's least cost development plan studies have been
carried out by CEA using the optimization model WASP-IlI. In all cases
analyzed the earliest feasible implementation of the Lower Periyar scheme
forms an integral part of the least cost development plan. The methodology
and the assumptions employed, including the load forecast presented in Annex
11, have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.
5.02    Other elements of the proposed Project comprise transmission lines in
the Idukky Calicut corridor, a reactive power compensation program and
distribution works in Trivandrum, Cochin and Calicut. The transmission lines
are necessary to evacuate power from Lower Periyar and from Idukky Stage II.
KSEB and CEA have considered different options for transmission development
to a0hieve this, including schemes based on 110 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV. The
Bank is satisft d that the proposed 220 kV configuration would form part of
the system's least cost development. The choice of how much reactive power
compensation to install has been based on minimization of the sum of costs
arising from transmission losses, owing to power factor, and the capital and
operating costs of compensation. Distribution plans have been prepared by
KSEB and CEA in accordance with accepted but not state-of-the-art utility
practices. While the Bank is generally satisfied with the proposed plans,
the use of computerized distribution planning models and a more decailed
geographic disaggregation of the load forecast might indicate that refinement
is possible. As part of the proposed Project, KSEB has retained consultants
to assist in finalizing the reactive compensation program and distribution
plans (para 3.08). Subject to any modifications that may be identified at
that stage the Bank is satisfied that the proposed reactive compensation
program and distribution works will contribute to the least cost development
of the system.



-36-
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.03    Benefits of the four elements of the proposed Project cannot readily
be separated from those of other investments in generation, transmission and
distribution. Therefore, having established that the elements of the
proposed Project form part of the least-cost expansion plan for the Southern
Region it is appropriate to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on the entire
plan in order to ensure that the expansion envisaged is desirable. For this
purpose a 'time-slice' of the Southern Region's investment program, covering
schemes to be commissioned in the period 1989/90-1995(6, has been analyzed.
Capital costs of the investment program (covering generation, transmission
and distribution) together with incremental operating and fuel costs are
given in Annex 11. The benefits of the investment program relate mainly to
the incremental consumption which it makes possible 1/. A minimum measure of
benefit, which ignores consumer surplus, can be derived from the revenue
generated by the incremental sales. In the absence of adequate class
specific consumption conversion factors, the standard conversion factor
(estimated to be 0.8) has been applied to convert financial revenue into a
measure of economic benefit. On this basis the minimum internal economic
rate of return achieved by the program is 4%.
5.04    However, this estimate is more a reflection of the inadequacy of
tariffs than of the economic merit of the investment program which includes
the proposed Project. The estimated minimum economic rate of return, 4%, is
substantially less than the established opportunity cost of capital, and this
is indicative of the fact that tariffs to consumers are presently less than
LRMC (para 1.06). In reality the program will confer benefits in excess of
those described above. There will be consumer surplus associated with the
incremental consumption and typically there will be other external benefits.
Consumers' reactions to the severe shortages of power experienced at present,
and expected for the foreseeable future suggest that willingness to pay
substantially exceeds present tariff levels.
5.05    In order to derive a more realistic estimate for the internal
economic rate of return of the program it is useful to estimate a measure of
consumer surplus, at least for industrial and agricultural consumers. Their
willingness to pay will be related to the costs of autogeneration and diesel
pumping respectively. Many consumers are presently observed to find these
economic when public supply is not available. Annex 11 presents an estimate
of diesel autogeneration costs at Rs. 1.12/kWh. It would, however, be
unreasonable to assume that all consumers would be willing to pay this price
for the whole of their consumption from the public supply system. Therefore,
as a conservative measure, it has been assumed that the consumer surplus
1/ The program may also lead to benefits in terms of a reduction in the cost
of meeting existing demand, particularly through fuel savings. However,
the energy deficit is such that by far the greater part of the output
available from plants in the program will lead to increased sales.
Therefore, fuel savings resulting from the program are likely to be small
and this element of the benefits has therefore been ignored.



-37-
attributable to incremental sales can be derived from an average of the cost
of autogeneration and the prevailing tariff. Similarly for agricultural
consumers the equivalent cost of diesel pumping has been estimated at Rs.
2.21/kWh and average willingness to pay has been estimated at halfway between
the average agricultural tariff and this alternative cost. This more
realistic measure of the benefit of consumption results in an internal
economic rate of return for the program of 13%. However, it must again be
stressed that this still represents a lower bound estimate as domestic
consumer surplus and other external benefits, have still not been included.
Justification for Bank Involvement
5.06    The Bank would be supporting OOI's efforts to:
(a) accelerate the development of hydro;
(b) alleviate power shortages in the Southern Region;
(c) improve the quality of supply; and
(d) reduce system losses.
The Bank's involvement to date 14s already achieved significant improvements
in project design and the Bank's continued involvement would:
(a) contribute substantially to the institutional development of
KSEB;
(b) cause KSEB to undertake a comprehensive financial recovery
program; and
(c) through consultancy assistance for the reactive compensation and
distribution elements of the Project, introduce KSEB to
state-of-the-art planning techniques in these fields.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01    The following agreements were reached at negotiations:
(a)  KSEB will develop a detailed training program acceptable to
the Bank not later than June 30, 1986 (para 2.08);
(b)  KSEB will create, by Septembe- 30, 1985, a Project Cell (PC)
under the Chief Engineer (Planning) to: (a) coordinate project
implementation; (b) serve as liaison with GOI, CEA, CC and the
Bank; (c) monitor project execution; (d) prepare the necessary
periodic reports for the project authorities and the Bank; and
(e) process disbursement applications (para 3.09);
(c)  GOI will notify the new uniform accounting system to be used
by the SEBs by July 15, 1985 (para 4.08);
(d)  KSEB would as of April 1, 1986, implement commercial accounting
according to a system to be specified by GOI (para 4.08);
(e)  KSEB will furnish to the Bank its unaudited annual financial
statements not later than nine months after the close of each
financial year; and, not later than twelve months after the end
of such year, its annual financial statements certified by the
C&AG or an acceptable alternate, together with the auditor's
report (para 4.10);
(f)  GOK will on-lend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to
KSEB for 20 years maturity, including 5 years of grace on
repayment of principal, at GOK's applicable rate of interest on
loans to KSEB at the time of drawdown (para 4.31);
(g)  GOK will take all such measures as may be necessary,.including,
if necessary, adjustment of KSEB's tariff, to ensure that,
commencing with the financial year 1985/86, KSEB's total
revenues in any financial year shall, after meeting:
(i) all expenses properly chargeable to revenues, including
operating, maintenance and management expenses;
(ii) taxes on income and profits;
(iii)  depreciation; and
(iv) interest payable on all debentures, bonds and loans;
produce such surplus as is not less than 3% of the SEB's net
fixed assets in service at the beginning of such year
(para 4.33).
6.02    Undertakings regarding the following items were received during
negotiations:



-39-
(a) GOI will seek to finance about US$30 million equivalent,
representing 85X of the aggregate cost of the reactive power
compensation equipment, the gas insulated switchgear and tL2 110
and 66 kV cables for distribution, through suppliers' credits,
export credits or commercial bank loans. If this financing
materializes, the Bank funds no longer needed for these items
would be reallocated to other elements of the project (para
3.05);
(b) KSEB will create a Steering Committee for the Institutional
Development Program including key members of KSEB's staff to
coordinate all technical assistance and training activities
(para 3.10);
(c) KSEB will retain all consultants for the project not later
than December 31, 1985, with the exception of the consultants
being hired to assist with the introduction of commercial
accounting and those conducting the fixed-asset inventory, both
of whom will be appointed no later than August 31, 1985
(paras 2.03 and 3.10);
(d) KSEB will conduct an interim reorganization of its finance
department in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and fill new
senior financial managerial posts with qualified people not
later than December 31, 1985 (para 4.07);
(e) KSEB will take whatever preparatory steps are necessary to ensure
that, by the beginning of the financial year 1986/87 (April 1,
1986), it will implement correctly commercial accounting
according to the system to be notified by GOI (para 4.08);
(f) KSEB will strengthen its internal audit unit not later than
December 31, 1986 (para 4.10);
(g) KSEB will expense the full amount of intangible assets in a
manner acceptable to the Bank in a period of not more than
eight years (para 4.20);
(h) KSEB will review the contents of the suspense accounts, and
capitalize those items which have been used in construction while
recognizing as an extraordinary expense those items wlhich have
beein expended for operation and maintenance. These adjustments
should be made in KSEB's accounts for the financial year 1985/86
(paras 3.10 and 4.21);
(i) GOK will subordinate repayment of principal for "perpetual"
loans and payment of arrears for both interest and taxes to
funds needed to implement Plan approved projects;
(j) KSEB will maintain its accounts payable at not more than the
last two months' cash operating expenses and capital expenditure,
beginning in 1985/86 (para 4.23); and



-40-
(k) KSEB will maintain its accounts receivable at less than 2.5
months of sales in 1985/86 and less than 2.0 months of annual
sales thereafter (para 4.24).
Recommendation

KERALA STATE POWER PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Lover Periyar Power Station
1.      The Lower Periyar utilizes an average river flow of 39 m3/s over an
average head of 204 m. The plant would have a total installed capacity of
180 MS distributed in three units 60 MW of capacity each   The gross storage
provided by the diversion dam is 5.2 Mm3 of which 4.5 Mm is live storage,
sufficient for daily regulation. The station would operate as a peaking
facility during the dry season, and it would be dispatched as a base plant
during the monsoon season.
2.      The physical works of the plant comprise:
(a) a concrete gravity dam 30 m high and 244 m long of which 102 m
are overflow section controlled by six radial gates of 15.2 x
13.5 m each. The left most gate is pLaced at a lower elevation
to permit flushing of eventual sediment deposits near the
intake area. The spillway has been designed for a Standard
Project Flood of about 11,800 mi s. Energy disipation
would be provided by a conventional hydraulic jump stilling
basin, URBR Type II;
(b) vertical intake structure of be bell-mouth type (4.5 x 6.8 m)
on the left bank equipped with normal operation gate and
emergency stop-loggs;
(c) head race concrete lined tunnel 12 km long and 6 m in diameter
with a maximum capacity of 125 m /s;
(d)  surge tank of the restricted orifice type 98 m deep and 18 m
in diameter;
(e) steel lined inclined pressure shaft of 5.25 m in diameter and
about 350 m in length which branches, 200 m upstream of the
power station, into three pressure shafts of 2.90 m in diameter;
(f) surface powerhouse (17.50 x 90 m) for the three units
discharging into an 80 m long tail race channel; and
(g) 220 kV switchyard.
3.      The major power plant equipment consists of:



-46-
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 8
(a) three vertical shaft Francis type turbines of 84,920 MHP at a
synchroneous speed of 300 rpm;
(b) three 66,667 kVA generators with 0.9 power factor and
11,000 volts plate generation voltage;
(c) turbine inlet valves of the rotary type 2.6 m in diameter;
(d) electrical overhead travelling crane with 175 t capacity;
(e) three three-phase main step-up transformers 11/220 kV,
66,667 kVA, OFW cooling system;
(f) the 220 kV switchyard would be equipped with 3 machine bays,
6 feeder bays and one bus coupler bay. Due to space
restrictions, the switchgear is proposed of the gas insulated
type.
4.      Geological investigations for the project began in 1964-65.  So far
42 drill holes have been completed at the dam site and 23 in the vicinity of
the power house area. Additional drilling is being completed at specific
locations of the head race tunnel identified after the surface geological
mapping. The rock formations in the project area comprise mostly massive
grey composite gneiss and granitic gneiss belonging the Archaeon Supergroup
with excellent engineering properties for tunnelling and foundation of major
structures. Fresh rock outcrops at the dam site and along the head race
tunnel alignment. In addition to the site exploration, good information
about the prevailing geological conditions is available from the neighboring
Idukky underground power scheme and from the portions of the Lower Periyar
head race tunnel excavated so far where massive dry rock has been found. No
difficulties are expected for the treatment of the dam foundation or for the
remaining excavation of the tunnel.
5.      Hydrological studies for the project were based on the records
available for a 17 year period covering 1964-65 to 1980-81. According the
same the generation of the power station would vary from 19 MW continuous
during the dry season (November - June) to 180 MW continuous in the wet
months (July - October) averaging 33 MW continuous in the dry season to
105 MW in the high flood period. These figures are based on an 85% gate
opening.
Transmission Lines and Associated Substations
6.      The following 220 kV double circuit lines are proposed under the
Project:

Total                                   413
7.      The following additional transformer capacities would be installed
at the receiving substations:
Cochin                   320 MVA          220/110 kV
Trichur North            420 MVA          400/220 kV

requirements, by any subsidy or income distribution objectives established by
GOI and GOK, and by administrative considerations.
Terms of Reference
The consultants should in particular:
(a) analyze, on the basis of the Southern Region's and KSEB's
investment program, the economic costs of generating,
transmitting, and distributing electricity to different
consumers in accordance with their location, time of consumption
and voltage levels over the next 10 years;
(b) collect all the necessary office and field information,
including sample metering of consumers or/and representative
feeders, surveys, etc;
(c) analyse daily and seasonal variations both in aggregate demand
and by consumer class;

Page 9 of 9
(d) compare the existing tariff structure with the economic costs of
supply and recommend a program of adjustment to a new structure,
over a reasonable period if required. In choosing a new tariff
structure, consideration should be given to the use of
"lifeline" tariffs designed to make a level of zonsumption
consistent with basic needs affordable for poor consumers but to
charge more well-off consumers a price more consistent with the
costs of supply. The new tariff structure should be simple and
inexpensive to administer. The program of adjustment should
include specific recommendations for changes in KSEB's metering,
billing and collection practices and training of the staff as
needed; and
(e) coordinate as necessary with the consultants for (a) the
Organization and Management Study; and (b) the Data Processil.g
Study;
(f) train KSEB in the data collection and analysis required for KSEB
to revise tariffs on a regular basis.

KARALA STATE POWER PROJECT
Economic Analysis
optimization of Installed Capacity at Lower Periyar
1.      In order to identify the optimum installed capacity at Lower Periyar,
four capacity levels were considered; 120 NW, 150 NW, 180 MW and 210 MW.  210
MW can be eliminated sumnarily because an installed capacity of 180 MW would
capture essentially all the energy available from the site, 604 CWh p.a., and
210 NW could not be utilized for a reasonable duration of peaking period
throughout the greater part of the year, November-June. The maximum power
which could be utilized for the duration of peaking period consistent with
the system's daily load curve would be 180 MW. The choice between 120, 150
and 180 MW was analyzed by reference to the costs of alternative coal-fired
generation. As new coal-fired generation would operate essentially as base
load rather than peaking plant, estimates of the equivalent coal-fired costs
include a credit for the fuel savings which new thermal plant would generate.
The present value of costs and savings for each installed capacity are given
in Table 1. CEA norms nave been assumed for plant availability,
stabilization of units, auxiliary consumption, etc. Coal consumption of
existing peaking plant has been estimated at 0.85 kg/kWh with 5 ml/kWh oil
support. Coal consumption in new plant has been estimated at 0.55 kg/kWh
with 0.5 ml/kWh oil support. The economic costs of coal and oil are detailed
in para 5.

The above analysis indicates that the optimum installed capacity is 180 MW.

Number of Units at Lower Periyar
2.      The Southern Region system could accomodate a single 180 MW unit but
there would be problems transporting a unit of this size. In any event, a
single unit would be uneconomic for an essentially run-of-river scheme such
as Lower Periyar, owing to the large loss of generation during periods of
turbine outage. The practical choice is therefore between 2 x 90 MW and 3 x
60 MW. Both configurations would have the same expected peaking capacity and
the slightly higher variance of 2 x 90 MW would not be material on a system
the size of the Southern Region. There is, however, a small difference in
expected generation between the two configurations. 3 x 60 MW would produce
approximately 4.9 GUh p.a. more than 2 x 90 MW. Given an estimated marginal
fuel cost of circa 30 paisa/kUh this generation is worth approximately Rsl.5
million p.a. (Capitalized at a 10 discount rate this is equivalent to
Rs14.5 million). On the other hand the specific capital cost of
electromechanical plant for 60 MS units would be of the order of 10  more
than for 90 MW units. Consequently, 3 x 60 MW would cost circa Ms45 million
more than 2 x 90 MW, and therefore 2 x 90 MW would reduce total system costs
by circa Rs3O milion. is now advanced for the 3 x 60 MW configuration and
even a small delay in project completion would totally negate the potential
savings available from 2 x 90 MW. A one-month delay would increase total
system costs by approximately Rs40 million, and as a change to 2 x 90 MW
would probably delay project completion by 6 months, it is economic to
proceed with the 3 x 60 MW design.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
3.     As described in Chapter 5, the elements of the proposed Project form
an integral part of the expansion plan for the Southern Region and,
therefore, cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out on the whole program
rather than on the Project in isolation. The Southern Region's investment
program covering schemes to be completed in the period 1989/90-1995/96 has,
therefore, been analyzed. Capital cost, incremental operation and
maintenance, incremental fuel cost and benefit streams are all shown in Table
2. Assumptions underlying these figures are detailed below.
4.     Capital Costs.  Anticipated capital expenditure on generation at
financial prices has been converted to economic prices by (i) expressing the
imported content at cif prices; (ii) valuing unskilled local labor at 0.65 of
the mrket wage rate; and (iii) applying the estimated standard conversion
factor, 0.8, to local costs. Transmission and distribution capital
expenditures have been estimated at 50% of generation expenditure.
5.     Operation and Maintenance Costs.  Ir'remental annual operating and
maiptenance costs have been estimated as the Zollowing percentages of capital
value: thermal generating plant 2.5%, hydro-electric 1X, and transmission and
distribution 2.0%.

ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 5
6.      Fuel Costs.  Incremental fuel costs arise only from coal-fired
thermal plant included in the Region's investment program. The economic cost
of 4950 kCal/kg coal at the minemouth at Ramagundam has been estimated at
Rsl45/tonne by the Industry Department of the Bank. The economic cost of
coal at coastal stations has been estimated at Rs261/tonne for 4600 kCali'kg.
The economic cost of coal in inland locations has been estimated on the basis
of the minemouth cost plus transport costs of RsO.3/tonne km plus Rs2O/tonne
loading and unloading. A boiler efficiency of 86% and a heat rate of 2060
kCal/kWh have been assumed. Fuel oil consumption for start up and support
has been estimated at 5 ml/kWh with an economic cost of Rs2500/kilolitre.
7.      Case 1. Benefits.  Case 1. benefits are based solely on incremental
revenue at existing tariff levels.  Incremental sales attributable to the
investment program are shown in Table 2.  These allow for transmission and
distribution losses which are assumed to remain constant at 20% of net
generation.  The average tariff in January 1984 is estimated to be RsO.42/kWh
which, after applying the standard conversion factor of 0.8, and an allowance
for one year's inflation of 8.5%, corresponds to an economic value of revenue
of RsO.37/kWh in current prices.
8.      Case 2. Benefits.  In Case 2, the benefits of incremental consumption
include elements of consumers' surplus for both industrial ard agricultural
consumers. Surplus has been estimated at half of the difference between the
average tariff, and the alternative cost of autogeneration, for industrial
consumers, and diesel pumping, for agricultural.
9.      The cost of industrial autogeneration has been estimated as follows:
Purchase price (incl. installation)       Rs 4,300/kW
Life of set                                  15 years
Average utilization                            302
Discount rate                                  12%
Operation and maintenance cost            Rs 215/kW per annum
Fuel and lubricant                        Rs 0.80/kWh
Average cost                              Rs 1.12/kWh
10.     The cost of electricity which would make electrical pumping
equivalent to diesel is calculated as follows:

I1.     Average industrial and agricultural financial tariffs in the Southern
Region are estimated at RsO.47tkWh and RsO.12/kWh respectively. These
financial tariffs and the estimated costs of autogeneration and diesel
pumping detailed above, imply an average willingness to pay, converted into
economic terms at a standard conversion factor of 0.8, of RsO.795/kWh for
in4ustrial and RsO.93/kWh for agricultural. Combining these benefit
estimates with revenue estimates of the benefits to other consumers gives an
average economic benefit of RsO.70/kWh.
