                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is coming to its completion, having made important contributions to improving the quality of teaching and learning in Moldova's rural schools. As this is the Project's final
                         Implementation Supervision Report, a considerable amount of time was dedicated to determine whether it has achieved its Development Objective. This was particularly challenging
                         as the Project's two outcome indicators --approved in 2006 and revised in 2012-- derive from high school exit exams (Baccalaureate - BAC), which have proved to be problematic.
                         Between 2006 and 2010, Baccalaureate results showed a positive trend, indicating that the Project was on track to achieve its objective. However, in 2011 the Ministry of Education

                         changed the exam's methodology, leading the Bank to revise the indicators’ baseline from 2006 to 2011. However, as part of an effort to curb cheating and strengthening the integrity
                         of test results, in the 2012-2013 school year the MoEd introduced advanced surveillance over the exams, including video cameras and independent supervisors. As a result, exam
                         results are not comparable across years. Given this limitation, the Bank is unable to determine if the Project had any impact on the testing performance of rural students. At the
                         same time, as part of preparing the Project's Implementation Completion Report, the Bank will seek alternative evidence to determine whether the Project mostly achieved its

                         development objective.

                         Given the above limitations as well as a recognition that student assessment results present additional problems as a measurement of the impact of education projects of this type,
                         the Bank's team focused on reviewing specific inputs/activities supported under the Project that are generally associated with education quality. Specifically, as a result of the
                         Project: (i) new textbooks and teaching guides for physics, math, biology and chemistry for Grade 12 were distributed to all rural schools; (ii) curriculum implementation guidelines
                         were published and distributed to support the implementation of a modern curriculum for all lyceum subjects; (iii) 10th, 11th and 12th grade teachers received training on the new
                         curriculum; and (iv) school grants financed the purchase of teaching materials such as science labs, mostly in rural schools. Further, the Project also supported efforts to strengthen
                         the capacity of the Quality Assurance Agency of MoEd to prepare, conduct and analyze results of the national assessments, as well as the country's participation in PISA 2009 Plus,
                         thus providing MoEd with data to support policy making. Finally, the Project financed the design and implementation of a pilot of formula financing in two rayons, eventually rolled out
                         nationwide, setting the stage for a major school rationalization effort that is expected to increase the efficiency in the use of education resources and to provide fiscal space for quality
                         improvements.

                         As part of project closing activities, the Bank's team carried out visits to nine schools in three rayons in the North, South, and Center of Moldova (Stefan Voda, Ungheni, and
                         Soldanesti). Interviews were done with school directors and heads of the education offices of the rayons. All those interviewed highlighted that the most important changes
                         introduced to the education system in the last few years were: (i) financing reform, which has given them autonomy in the allocation of unused resources to areas the schools identify
                         as priority; (ii) efforts to curb cheating at the Baccalaureate exams, which have resulted in students and families taking the exams more seriously; and (iii) curriculum reform to
                         “unpack? the secondary level curriculum. While the areas highlighted by the stakeholders did not surprise the Bank's team, it was relevant to this assessment that they all pertained
                         to quality improvements – the team heard that financing reform will push schools to keep improving the quality of services they offer to attract more students and increase their
                         financial sustainability, and that a more credible Baccalaureate exam is directly linked to students’ effort to improve academic performance.

                         Unfortunately, despite all the Project's contributions, in light of the lack of concrete evidence as to whether the quality of education in rural areas in Moldova has improved as a result
                         of the Project, the preliminary assessment of the Project is that there were shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives. As such, the Project's Development
                         Objective is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Further data review, to be complemented by field research and stakeholder consultations, is expected to take place over the next
                         two months to, hopefully, upgrade this assessment.
