                    FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY CREDIT

Borrower                  Nepal
Implementing Agency       Ministry of Finance
Financing Data            IDA Credit
                          Terms: Regular (40 years, with 10 years grace period)
                          Amount: US$30 million equivalent
Operation Type            The proposed Financial Sector Stability Credit is a standalone single
                          tranche development policy operation that supports the broader
                          Government of Nepal reform program to address financial sector
                          vulnerability.

                          The IDA credit is expected to be withdrawn in a single tranche of US$30
                          million equivalent.
Main Policy Areas         Although the current Government of Nepal’s monetary and fiscal policy
                          stance is sound, enhancing financial sector stability is critical. A financial
                          sector crisis could have a devastating impact on Nepal’s economy.

                          As such, the Financial Sector Stability Credit will support the following
                          areas:
                              (i)      Formulation of a financial sector development strategy
                              (ii)     Restructuring of two state-controlled banks: Nepal Bank
                                       Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB)
                              (iii) Assessment of the condition of class A, B and C financial
                                       institutions and potential restructuring
                              (iv)     Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank
                                       restructuring process
                              (v)      Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for effective
                                       bank resolution
                              (vi)     Increasing the transparency of the financial system

                                (trade finance, remittance inflows and Foreign Direct Investment)
Program Development     The objective of the credit is to support the implementation of the financial
Objective(s) and        sector reform program initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the
Contribution to ISN /   vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its transparency. The
CAS                     proposed credit recognizes the important progress made so far by the
                        Nepalese authorities to tackle financial sector vulnerability and supports
                        the acceleration of a medium term reform strategy which commenced
                        implementation in 2011.

                        The current Nepal Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY12/13 notes the
                        vulnerability of the financial sector. At the time of the Board presentation
                        of the ISN, World Bank Executive Directors noted the emerging
                        weaknesses in the financial sector and urged the Bank to assist the
                        Government of Nepal (GoN) in addressing them inter alia through the
                        potential use of development policy lending.

                        The new Nepal Country Assistance Strategy (FY14-17) currently under
                        preparation underlines persistent financial sector weakness and the risk this
                        poses to macroeconomic stability and economic growth, as illustrated by
                        the liquidity crisis in 2011. It recognizes the efforts undertaken by the
                        authorities to address the root causes of the financial sector difficulties and
                        makes the case for the use of Development Policy Credits to support those
                        reform efforts.
Risks and Risk          The main risks identified are political instability and reform
Mitigation              implementation risks.

                        Continued political uncertainty has become the norm in post-conflict Nepal
                        characterized by frequent changes in government. The dissolution of the
                        Constituent Assembly in May 2012 has brought additional uncertainty.
                        However, on March 13, 2014, political parties agreed to form an Interim
                        Election Government with the Chief Justice as Chairman (Prime Minister)
                        and consisting exclusively of former secretaries, ending a 10 month
                        political impasse. The Interim Election Government is charged with
                        holding new Constituent Assembly elections by December 2013.

                        It should be noted that Nepal stands out as a country that has achieved
                        stable economic performance and good development results despite these
                        political uncertainties.


                                          6
               To continue to mitigate political uncertainty to the extent this is possible,
               the Bank actively engages with leaders across the political spectrum to
               confirm bipartisan support for sound economic policies and continuing
               financial sector reforms. Delivery of the prior actions for the proposed
               operation was agreed with the economic leadership of all major political
               parties.

               Reform implementation risks are high in the present environment. The
               financial sector reform program initiated by the Government and supported
               by the Development Policy Credit affects vested interests, which may
               trigger resistance. Capacity to implement reforms is low and will therefore
               be supported by intensive technical assistance. The present political
               environment in Nepal complicates the reform process, in particular for
               legal reforms given the absence of a Parliament.

               Implementation risks for this Development Policy Credit have been
               mitigated through the choice of the instrument: i.e. stand-alone single
               tranche DPC, with prior actions completed ahead of DPC approval. In
               addition, during the preparation of the DPC, starting in November 2011,
               the DPC team worked closely with key technical counterparts, who have
               played a critical role in the delivery of the prior actions and who have also
               provided continuity in the policy dialogue. This close collaboration has
               also created a strong momentum for further reforms in the Government’s
               medium term program. Furthermore, close alignment with the International
               Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Kingdom’s Department for
               International Development (DFID) – which is providing technical
               assistance to both the preparation and implementation of the DPC – has
               ensured a consistent message from development partners on how best to
               address financial sector vulnerability in Nepal.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.      In mid-2011, a financial sector crisis was about to unfold in Nepal. Withdrawals of
deposits from smaller financial institutions and severe liquidity constraints across the banking
sector exposed the vulnerabilities of the financial system and required urgent intervention by
Nepal’s central bank and bank regulator, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). The World Bank,
together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), was called on by NRB and the
Government of Nepal (GoN) to provide assistance, both technical and financial, to support
efforts to contain the developing crisis and to provide longer-term support for institutional and
regulatory changes that would contribute over time to a more robust system. Due to quick and
effective intervention by NRB, with technical assistance from the Bank and the IMF, and thanks
to a favorable environment (notably continuing large flows of remittances which contributed
liquidity to the system), the development of a full-blown financial crisis was averted. In this
process, a strong dialogue between the authorities and the Bank developed, leading to the
articulation of a medium-term program to address the underlying vulnerabilities of the financial
sector, including the insolvency and governance challenges posed by the two largest state-
controlled commercial banks, the excessive number of small financial institutions with weak
governance and supervision, the nascent bank restructuring and resolution frameworks, and
issues of transparency in the financial system. In the context of the presentation of the Interim
Strategy for Nepal in the fall of 2011, the Bank’s Board was informed of the troubled status of
the financial sector and of the Bank’s readiness to provide support through development policy
lending and other means as necessary to help stabilize the situation.

2.      This program document describes a stand-alone, single tranche, Financial Sector
Stability Credit of US$30 million to support the Government’s efforts to address financial
sector vulnerabilities that remain critical to macroeconomic stability and economic growth.
The actions supported under the proposed Development Policy Credit (DPC) form part of a
broader, medium-term Government program aimed at reinforcing banking sector stability and
paving the way for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial sector. The key
components of this medium-term program are also described in detail in the document. Sufficient
overall progress towards the objectives of the medium-term program would allow the Bank to
provide additional support in the form of a second DPC within about 18 months. Given the depth
of the Bank’s dialogue with the authorities, the detailed elaboration and mutual understanding of
the medium-term Government program, as well as commitment by key stakeholders, this
operation could have been designed as the first phase of a programmatic series of DPCs
supporting financial sector stability and reform. However, the fluidity of the political situation
and the current lack of a Parliament argue for a two-stage approach. This allows the timely
acknowledgment of the important steps already taken by the Government to preempt a possible
financial crisis and strengthen financial sector stability, and the continuation of a deepening


                                                8
dialogue on further reforms that could be supported by a follow-up operation when conditions
warrant.

3.     The objective of the credit is to help reduce the vulnerability and increase the
transparency of the banking sector. The credit will support the following policy areas:
   (a) Formulation of a financial sector development strategy.
   (b) Restructuring of two state-controlled banks, Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya
       Banijya Bank (RBB).
   (c) Assessment of the condition of class A, B and C financial institutions and potential
       restructuring.
   (d) Strengthening of the institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring process.
   (e) Strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank resolution.
   (f) Increasing the transparency of the financial system


II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

   A. Recent Political Developments

4.      While there have been setbacks in the path towards a stable democracy, Nepal is
making progress on consolidating peace and building a new political system. Still emerging
from a-ten year armed conflict that ended in 2006, the country is currently passing through a
prolonged political transition. This transition entails two interrelated processes: promulgation of
a new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. Nepal has made good
progress on the peace process—notably by formally concluding integration of former ex-
combatants into the armed forces in August 2012—but the country’s political transition is taking
longer than expected. The Constituent Assembly, in session since 2008 and tasked with drafting
Nepal’s new constitution, was dissolved in May 2012 without completing the constitution.
Deeply-rooted differences between and among the existing political parties, and the rise of
‘ethnic identity politics’ are making consensus building complicated and leading to political
instability. The Constituent Assembly was disbanded due to irreconcilable differences between
the political parties and within cross-party caucuses on key issues such as state restructuring and
the extent of federalism. Since then, the country has been facing various constitutional, legal and
administrative uncertainties, exacerbated by the absence of a political consensus between the
leading political parties to address them.

5.    The 10-month political impasse that followed the dissolution of the Constituent
Assembly in May 2012 ended on March 14, 2013, when the Chief Justice was sworn in as
Chairman (Prime Minister) of the Interim Election Government. The Interim Election
Government is charged with holding new Constituent Assembly elections by December 2013.
The Chairman appointed an 11 member Council of Ministers exclusively from retired
government secretaries.

6.      In spite of the political uncertainty of recent years, Nepal has demonstrated a
remarkable ability to achieve development results. Paradoxically, in light of the 10-year
conflict and the post-conflict challenges of reaching consensus on the future shape of the state,

                                                9
Nepal has experienced economic stability and surprisingly strong results, especially in poverty
reduction and human development. Political instability is bound to remain a concern for the
foreseeable future, but Nepal’s track record shows its ability to accomplish development
outcomes at a reasonably fast pace notwithstanding the uncertain environment. As a fragile state,
Nepal stands out for its relatively stable economic performance and good development results
even during the height of the conflict.

7.     The progress achieved to date by the Nepalese authorities in addressing financial
sector vulnerabilities has demonstrated the capacity of GoN to implement critical reforms
despite political uncertainty. It has also demonstrated a strong willingness to engage and
respond to assistance provided by external partners, and provides a compelling basis in pursuing
the Bank’s engagement in the financial sector. The formation of an Interim Election Government
and the forthcoming Constituent Assembly elections will allow for an acceleration and
deepening of reforms.


    B. Recent Economic Developments

8.      Notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain political transition, economic
performance has continued to be good during the past few years. The economy grew by an
estimated 4.6 percent in FY 2012 (Table 1), and is projected to grow by three to 3.6 percent in
FY 2013 despite the lower-than-expected growth in India and a shortfall in public spending. 1
Higher growth in FY 2012 reflected stronger agricultural performance (up 4.9 percent), a
rebound in the service sector (up 5.1 percent) and a positive but slow turn-around in the
industrial sector (2.7 percent). Good monsoon rains and strong inflows of remittances and
tourists contributed to the good performance. Consumption , fueled by the surge in remittance
inflows, continued to be the main driver of growth, (Figures 1 and 2). The expected growth
slowdown in FY 2013 is due to a combination of exogenous shocks and domestic factors. A poor
monsoon has depressed agricultural output. Likewise slower growth in India, whose economy is
now projected to grow at 4.5 percent in FY 2013, is affecting Nepal via exports, Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) and remittance channels. 2 Growth has also been dampened by significant
shortfalls in public spending, reflecting the shortcomings of the FY 2013 budgetary framework.




1
  These growth rates are well above Nepal’s population growth of 1.35 percent per annum.
2
  India accounts for 60 percent of Nepal’s exports, 50 percent of its FDI, and about 20 percent of its remittance
inflows.

9.       While still high and heavily dependent on price movements in India, inflation has
declined. Because of the fixed peg of the Nepalese rupee to the Indian rupee and the fact that
around two thirds of the country’s imports come from India, inflation in Nepal is closely linked
to that in India. For FY 2012, average inflation is estimated at 8.3 percent, down from 9.6
percent the previous year. This is mainly because of lower food prices due to good harvests in
Nepal and India, counterbalancing the effect of persistently high core inflation (averaging 9
percent). Non-food inflation was driven by higher (administered) fuel prices, continued pressure
on wages and the exchange rate depreciation triggered by the depreciation of the Indian rupee.
Given the currency peg, Nepal has only limited ability to carry out independent monetary policy
and use it to control inflation. Nepal Rashtriya Bank (NRB) – the central bank of Nepal – has
pursued an accommodative monetary policy stance (with remittances inflows only partly
sterilized) to allow banks to rebuild liquidity. In FY 2012, broad money grew by 22.7 percent,
well above nominal GDP growth (14 percent). However, the NRB shifted policy in July 2012
signaling its intent to bring broad money growth down to 15 percent, as the pressure to keep
liquidity high to support the financial sector eased. Inflation is projected at 10.2 percent for FY
2013 but is expected to decline further subsequently.

10.     Despite the large trade deficit, high remittance inflows have led to a substantial
current account surplus. In FY 2012, the balance of payments surplus reached an all-time high,
largely due to surging remittances inflows. Remittances rose by 25 percent compared to the
previous year to reach a record 23 percent of GDP. The current account surplus (including
grants) reached an historic high of 4.7 percent of GDP, up 5.7 percentage points from the
previous year (Figure 3 and Table 1). Gross official reserves rose to more than US$4.3 billion in
FY 2012, equivalent to 6.8 months of total imports (up from 5.8 months in FY 2011). High
remittances have been more than sufficient to offset the large trade gap (imports accounting for
28.9 percent of GDP and exports 5.2 percent of GDP). While for some countries a high trade
deficit may signal an unsustainable external balance, for Nepal the risk is low. Worker
remittances are quite stable as migration destinations are diversified among both oil and non-oil

producing countries. Moreover, a drop in remittance inflows (or more likely slower growth rate
of remittances) would ultimately be “self-corrected? by a commensurate decline in imports.

11.     Nepal has made important inroads in reducing poverty and improving human
development outcomes. In 1996, 68 percent of the country’s population lived under US$1.25
per day (in Purchasing Power Parity); by 2011 the rate had fallen to 24.8 percent. The pace of
poverty reduction accelerated sharply in recent times – from 1.5 percentage points per year
during the 1996-2004 period, to 2.5 percentage points during the 2004-2011 period. 3 Nepal has
progressed from being the poorest nation in South Asia in 1990 to being the third-poorest today,
having overtaken India and Bangladesh. Both growth and reduced inequality contributed to the
large observed decline in poverty between 2004 and 2011, with most of the observed poverty
reduction having occurred in rural areas. Nepal has already achieved the first Millennium
Development Goal (MDG): its poverty headcount rate in 2010 was well below the corresponding
rate in 1990 (Figure 4). If poverty reduction is maintained at this pace, poverty may be eradicated
within the next decade. In addition, Nepal has already met the target on improved access to
water, and it stands out as the only fragile and conflict-affected state to have already reached the
target on reducing maternal mortality. 4 For women in Nepal, the chances of dying in childbirth
have been cut in half since 1996.




3
  This amounts to a 40 percent higher rate of poverty reduction than that achieved by another remarkable performer,
Bangladesh (1.78 percentage point reduction per year from 2005-2010).

12.    Nepal’s good growth performance in recent years is partly due to external factors.
Given the current structure of its economy, Nepal’s economic fortunes are largely determined by
exogenous factors, including rainfall, remittances, and India’s economic situation. Good
monsoon rains resulted in the agricultural sector growing by nearly 5 percent in FY 2012.
Remittances have more than doubled as a share of GDP over the past decade (Figure 3). Nepal’s
economy has also benefited from strong economic growth in neighboring India, and total exports
have increased rapidly in recent years.

13.     However, the government’s prudent policy stance has also been an important
contributing factor. Fiscal balances improved in FY 2012 from an already strong position
(Table 2). Revenue collection was particularly buoyant with tax and non-tax revenues increasing
23.8 percent from the previous year, a sign that tax administration reform is bearing fruit. On the
expenditure side, total spending grew at a slower pace (18.3 percent) though mostly on account
of restrained growth in capital expenditure (16 percent). Overall, the GoN was able to contain the
fiscal deficit: the overall balance before grants improved by 0.4 percentage points of GDP, from
-5.2 percent to -4.8 percent (Table 1). At around 33 percent of GDP, public debt remains low; it
has fallen steadily from over 40 percent of GDP in FY 2008. The year 2012/13 was exceptional
from a fiscal point of view because of prolonged political uncertainties (Box 1). The
supplementary budget recently announced by GoN is aligned with poverty reduction objectives,
and is consistent with macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. In line with past practice,
the supplementary budget is available – in full red book – on the Government’s website.

                                          Box 1: Nepal’s FY 2013 Budget

The failure of political parties to reach agreement over a consensus government in 2012 meant that the caretaker
government was unable to propose a full-fledged budget for FY 2013. Instead, the President approved two
ordinances authorizing public spending up to the actual levels spent in FY 2012. The combination of (i) lower
overall ceilings, (ii) adoption in phases, and (iii) inefficient arrangements for implementation resulted in
significantly lower-than-planned budget execution and led to the first eight months of FY 2013 being quite
exceptional from a fiscal point of view. However, the formation of a new consensus government has opened the way
for the adoption of a supplementary budget for FY 2013 (announced on April 9, 2013), which is expected to boost
spending in the last trimester of the year. GoN has also announced its intention to prepare a full-fledged budget for
FY 2014.
The proposed ‘full adjusted budget’ for FY 2013 foresees a significant increase in overall revenues and
expenditures. Overall expenditure is expected to rise from NPRs 359 billion budgeted in FY 2012 to NPRs 405
billion; this 13 percent increase is almost exactly equivalent to the combined rate of growth of economic activity and
prices (that is a real increase in spending of 3.5 percent). Executing the full budgeted amount will most likely not be
possible given that (i) it includes an appropriation of NPRs 14 billion for election-related spending (in the event that
a June date could be kept to hold the elections), (ii) actual spending was 89 percent of budgeted expenditure in FY
2012, and (iii) spending has been particularly low in the first eight months of the fiscal year (NPRs 155 billion). On
the revenue side, financing would come from domestic revenue (about NPRs 290 billion), repayment receipts (NPRs
4.4 billion) and foreign grants (NPRs 47 billion) leaving a balance of NPRs 64 billion to be covered by foreign and
domestic borrowing.
The proposed FY 2013 budget appears consistent with macro stability, even at the proposed relatively high level of
spending. With the proposed levels of expenditure and expected revenue and grants, the required level of domestic
financing would be equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP. Given that expenditure targets are ambitious, while revenue
objectives are likely to be met, domestic financing needs are very unlikely to be above two percent of GDP, even if
grants are lower than anticipated—that is the proposed budget is very unlikely to negatively affect macro-stability or
overall debt sustainability dynamics. The revised budget partially addresses the shortfalls in social sector allocations
under the previous ordinances. Under the proposed adjusted budget, social sector allocations – including education,
health, drinking water, local development amount and other social sectors – amount to over 32 percent of the total
(7.6 percent of GDP) with education and health jointly making up 20.6 percent of the total. Moreover, the proposed
budget foresees an increase in ‘economic’ expenditures including irrigation, road and power expansion.

      C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

14.     Despite expected headwinds in FY 2013, Nepal’s medium-term growth prospects
remain good. Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 3.6 percent in 2012/13, reflecting a
forecasted weak monsoon and lower growth in India (Table 3). A slowdown in public
expenditure has also depressed aggregate demand. However, Nepal is expected to grow on
average at 4.1 percent per year over the next five years. It could overshoot these targets if it
achieved greater political stability, enhanced private sector engagement, and invested in new and
better infrastructure. Fiscal revenue is expected to increase further, reflecting continued reform
momentum in tax administration, 5 while expenditure is expected to grow moderately as a share
of GDP.

15.     The joint IMF-WB Debt Sustainability Analysis shows a moderate risk of debt
distress. Under baseline projections, Nepal’s debt indicators remain below the indicative
sustainability thresholds. In the baseline scenario, the present value of public debt decreases
moderately as a share of GDP from 31 percent in 2012 to 26 percent at the end of the projection
period (corresponding, respectively, to 171 and 190 percent of revenue and grants). Moreover,
debt dynamics also remain generally sound under standard stress tests, including shocks to GDP
growth, exports, non-debt creating flows, and a one-time 30 percent exchange rate depreciation.
Nepal’s debt indicators are below the sustainability thresholds under all but the most severe of
these stress test scenarios (specifically a substantial slowdown in remittances 6 would cause the
present value of the ‘external debt to exports and remittances’ ratio to exceed the indicative
threshold by 10 percentage points in 2014).

16.     Nepal’s key macroeconomic vulnerability remains its financial sector. Non-standard
debt sustainability scenarios show that in case of financial stress, three debt ratios would cross
the threshold 7.A financial crisis could cause a loss of 30 percent of Nepal’s GDP and result in

  Reforms undertaken by the Inland Revenue Department include (i) e-filing of tax returns (now representing over
90 percent of returns), (ii) skills and capacity upgrading resulting in increased investigations and assessment
amounts, and (iii) outreach to taxpayers (with the establishment of 26 ‘Taxpayer Service Offices’ throughout Nepal).

severe fiscal distress (Box 2)8. Consequently it is important for GoN to assess and address the
risks posed by the financial sector, and also for it to develop good estimates of the magnitude of
its quasi-fiscal liabilities. 9 These non-standard scenarios call for a continued prudence on the
fiscal side, with a fine balance of expenditure reduction and revenue enhancement, and resolute
actions to address financial sector weaknesses.

                                       Box 2: Financial Sector Risk in Nepal

A recent middle range estimate by the IMF suggests that real GDP loss could reach 30 percent in the first four years
of a financial crisis before growth recovers to the baseline trend. 10 Reserves would fall by half in the first two
quarters of the crisis through the widening current account balance 11 and capital flight, though foreign borrowing
could reverse partially the reserve losses later. The fiscal cost would be about 25 percent of GDP, leading to rapid
deterioration of debt dynamics. Even though the fiscal cost could be largely assumed domestically at the onset of the
crisis (for bank resolution and deposit coverage), net domestic financing has to be gradually brought down to 2.75
percent of GDP in outer years considering the capacity of the domestic financial system, and foreign borrowing
would be heavy over the long run.

17.      Nepal’s macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for the proposed operation,
which will help mitigate significant risks to macro-stability and growth. GoN has pursued
prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Following IMF and World Bank advice, its economic
policy agenda is centered on two main pillars (i) continued prudent fiscal policy and a return to a
normal budgetary framework, together with ongoing Public Financial Management reform, and
(ii) tighter monetary policy coupled with financial sector strengthening.



8
   The IMF assessed the potential fiscal costs of a scenario where an escalating financial crisis initially afflicts
smaller and weaker banks, causing deposit runs, and then spreads to larger banks. This represents an extreme loss of
confidence, given past history of deposit flight to Class A institutions during times of distress. If all banks including
large Class A institutions were affected, initial fiscal costs could rise to as high as 23 percent of GDP with a medium
term output loss of 30 percent of GDP.
9
   These include the potential fiscal burden of financing the losses of Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) and Nepal
Energy Authority (NEA). The authorities appear committed to restructuring the NEA and moving to an automatic
adjustment mechanism for fuel prices, which would contribute to bringing NOC gradually back to financial health.
10
   The assumption of output loss is based on the average level of crisis episodes in the past few decades in a sample
of countries. In low income countries, macro-financial linkages tend to be lower compared to more advanced
economies, and therefore output loss may be smaller. However, Nepal’s financial sector is relatively large, standing
at 70 percent of GDP, which is comparable to many emerging economies.
11
   The widening of the current account balance is consistent with recent experience in Nepal. Remittances appear to
decline in times of uncertainty. Further, when there is ‘flight to safety’ the general population tends to import gold as
a store of value – increasing imports.

     D. Recent Financial Sector Developments

The 2011 liquidity crisis

18.      By mid-2011 a financial sector crisis was about to unfold in Nepal, due to acute
liquidity stress. A number of the smaller development banks (‘Class B institutions 12’) and
finance companies (‘Class C institutions’) came under severe liquidity stress. Several institutions
requiring emergency liquidity assistance from NRB, which in some cases was accompanied by
corrective action directives and intensified supervision. The institutions’ underlying liquidity
problems derived mainly from the rolling over of loans to mask the inability of borrowers to
repay, especially in the real estate sector (a practice known as ‘ever-greening’). Liquidity
problems were made worse by falling profitability and increased competition for deposits –
factors which were reinforced by a loss of depositor confidence as these problems became public
knowledge. The underlying structural problems were most evident in class B and C financial
institutions, which together hold approximately 22 percent of total banking sector assets. Despite
their capital insolvency, the two large state controlled banks (NBL and RBB) did not suffer from
the liquidity crisis, because they were perceived by the population at large as enjoying an
implicit state guarantee on deposits.

19.     The 2011 liquidity crisis was a symptom of significant underlying weaknesses
affecting the banking sector. The liquidity stress faced by numerous institutions can be mostly
attributed to weak risk management practices, including a mismanagement of deposit-to-loan
ratios, mismatches between deposit and loan terms, and a high concentration of liabilities in the
largest 10 depositors. Violations of NRB circulars and directives -including under-reporting of
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), rolling over of loans and over-exposure to the real estate sector-
also played an important role in the liquidity crisis. As a result, financial institutions became
highly vulnerable to shocks, such as delays in Government expenditures or a downturn in
remittances. The liquidity difficulties of a number of institutions were further compounded by
the loss of interbank funding, as banks protected their own financial positions by withdrawing
wholesale funding from those institutions identified (or rumored) to be in trouble.

20.      The liquidity crisis was also the symptom of potentially deeper solvency issues in
financial institutions. The real financial condition of banks is not yet known as a result of
lending growth concentrated in real estate loans, practices of ‘ever-greening’ or using overdraft
facilities to hide problem assets. Factors contributing to possible solvency issues include poor
management practices 13, with weaknesses relating to the governance structure of financial
institutions (which can lead to conflicts of interest and insider transactions) and weak risk
management systems and practices (use of institutional depositors without a sufficient base of
long term retail depositors, portfolio concentrations in the largest 10 borrowers, sectoral
concentration of portfolios, rapid loan growth without attention to potential asset bubbles, hiding
potential problem assets through ever-greening, or inappropriate use of overdraft facilities).

12
   The banking system in Nepal consists of Class A financial institutions (commercial banks), Class B institutions
(development banks) and Class C institutions (finance companies). In effect, other than different capital adequacy
requirements, there is little operational difference between these three classes.
13
   Onsite inspections of institutions applying for liquidity assistance revealed serious governance failures, impaired
assets, and financial interconnectedness.

                                                          18
Weaknesses in the quality and effectiveness of banking supervision can also be identified, with a
lack of adequate (human and technological) resources, an outdated approach to bank
examination, weak supervisory enforcement, and unreliable data being provided by financial
institutions to supervisors.

21.      Thanks to quick and effective interventions by NRB, with technical assistance from
the Bank and IMF, a full-blown financial crisis was averted. These interventions were also
supported by a relatively favorable environment, notably continuing large flows of remittances
which contributed liquidity to the system. The NRB took a series of quick actions 14 to tackle the
liquidity crisis, including: (i) daily monitoring of liquidity ratios, (ii) capping of the allowable
Credit to Deposit Ratio (CDR) at 80 percent, (iii) introducing deposit insurance (up to NPR
200,000), (iv) capping of allowable exposure to real estate (25 percent), (v) activation of a lender
of last resort facility and special refinancing window (both facilities provided liquidity funding to
financial institutions experiencing liquidity stress), (vi) reduction in the required cash reserve
ratio from 5.5 percent to five percent, (vii) allowing foreign investors to make fixed deposits,
(vii) changes in AML declaration forms to encourage use of formal financial institutions, and
(viii) discouraging gold imports to reduce the conversion of deposits into gold.

Coming back from the brink

22.     The quick actions of the Nepalese authorities have led to stabilization of the
financial sector. In 2011 and 2012, NRB (with support from the IMF) conducted stress tests for
Class A institutions (see Box 3) which highlighted the credit and liquidity risks facing
commercial banks. The 2012 stress tests show that the vulnerability of commercial banks (Class
A institutions) had decreased compared to the previous year. In addition, the overall liquidity of
the financial sector has also improved since mid-2011 (see Figure 5).




14
     The majority of these measures are still in place.

                                                          19
                                            Box 3: NRB Stress Testing Results

The latest stress tests conducted by the authorities for commercial banks show some improvement compared to
the previous year’s results, but weaknesses persist. Among the 32 existing commercial banks, a standard credit
shock would push capital below the regulatory minimum in 20 banks, and a third of commercial banks would be
under-capitalized if real estate and housing loans are downgraded 15. Sustained deposit withdrawals over five
consecutive days would render 14 banks illiquid, and liquidity ratios at a number of banks would fall below 20
percent in the event of sudden large withdrawals, or withdrawals by institutions.

23.     While the overall liquidity situation of the banking sector has improved, this
improvement hides significant variation between institutions. In the second quarter of FY
2013 (mid-January 2013), the overall Credit to Deposit Ratio (CDR) in local currency for
commercial banks stood at 82.2 percent. However, 27 of 32 banks recorded a CDR above 80
percent (with 11 of these exceeding 90 percent). The average CDRs for development banks and
finance companies were reported at, respectively, 84 percent and 89 percent as of mid-January
2013. Financial institutions with CDRs above 90 percent are considered vulnerable to liquidity
shocks.




15
  This refers to the scenario in which 25 percent of performing loans of real estate and housing are directly
downgraded to loss loans.

24.      Liquidity pressures are more intense for Class B and C institutions. During and after
the 2011 liquidity stress, interbank lending was cut and deposits moved from Class B and C
institutions to the perceived safety of Class A banks, amidst concerns over balance sheet
weaknesses and governance. Class B and C institutions now have to pay significantly higher
rates for deposits as compared to Class A, which places additional pressure on earnings already
suffering from the deterioration in real estate lending portfolios.

A changing structure of the financial sector

25.     Since 2005, the number of Class A banks has almost doubled (with a total of 17
commercial banks licensed in 2005 and 32 in 2012) and the total assets of Class A banks
have almost tripled. Private commercial banks accounted for the vast majority of this growth,
while the combined assets of the two large state-controlled banks (Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB)
and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL)), as a share of the sector’s total assets, declined to 15.2 percent.
Nonetheless, RBB is still the largest bank in Nepal, representing 9.3 percent of total commercial
bank assets and NBL is the fifth largest bank, with 5.9 percent of total assets. As of February
2013, the nine largest banks accounted for 54.9 percent of commercial banks assets (Table 4). At
the same date, the banking system comprised 32 Class A (commercial banks), 90 Class B
(development banks), and 66 Class C (finance companies) institutions, accounting for 79, 13 and
eight percent of banking system assets, respectively (see Figure 6). Nepal’s banking sector 16 has
expanded rapidly in recent years, with domestic credit to the private sector jumping from 28

  The ‘banking system’ refers to commercial banks (Class A), development banks (Class B), and finance companies
(Class C). Other than different capital adequacy requirements and some operational restrictions on Class B and Class
C institutions (foreign exchange and international transactions), there is little operational difference between these
three classes. In addition, there are 25 Class D micro-credit institutions that report to the NRB and thousands of rural
credit cooperatives that are under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture. Other financial services are available
through insurance companies and the Nepal Stock Exchange. There are 24 insurance companies and 225 listed
companies, of which 80 percent are banks or nonbank financial institutions. NRB’s foreign exchange department
oversees more than 50 remittance agencies.

26.     The rate of credit growth has contracted since 2009, as the effects of a build-up of
nonperforming loans began to be felt, but despite this, the banking system has continued to
grow in the 2009-2013 period. During this period, the assets of Class A institutions expanded
by 37 percent and those of Class B and C institutions grew by 172 percent and 34 percent,
respectively (see Figure 8). However, the growth of Class C institutions significantly slowed
down following the 2011 liquidity crisis.

27.     All of the Class A banks now meet NRB’s minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)
of 10 percent except the two state-controlled banks 17. Overall CAR is estimated at 11.7
percent in FY 2013 Q2 (that is, mid-Jan 2013), a slight deterioration from 12.1 percent as of end
FY 2012, but up from 11.1 percent computed as of end FY 2011 and 9.5 percent as of end FY
2010. The improvement in FY 2012 is primarily due to GoN injecting capital into NBL and RBB
as part of the two banks’ recapitalization programs. Excluding these two banks, CAR is
computed as 14.3 percent as of end FY 2012 which does not vary significantly from 14.2 percent
as of end FY 2011 and 14.3 percent as of end FY 2010.

growth of 46 percent. Seven large banks (representing 43 percent of the system) registered
profits in excess of NPR 500 million by end FY 2013 Q2. Their total profits amounted to NPR
4.9 billion, which represents around 61 percent of the total profits earned by commercial banks.
All three state controlled commercial banks (RBB, NBL and Agricultural Development Bank
Limited) registered net profits (totaling NPR 1.2 billion).

29.    Reported data may however overstate the strength of the system because of
underreporting of Non-Performing Loans – and hence under-provisioning and overstatement
of income – and collateral valuation uncertainties. Underreporting of NPLs, as well as real estate
exposure, is further discussed in the section below.

Financial sector risks

30.     While Nepal’s macroeconomic framework remains relatively sound, current and
potential problems in the financial sector could severely undermine macroeconomic
stability and economic growth. Stress testing (Box 3) conducted by NRB with IMF assistance
has identified significant risks to the solvency of financial institutions from the potential impact
of declining real estate prices and from a potential loss of depositor confidence.

31.     Most observers agree that the risk of a credit quality driven systemic problem is
largely concealed by what is believed to be widespread under-reporting of NPLs. Based on
reported data, the asset quality of the financial sector appears to have improved at the end of FY
2012, with the NPL ratio for the commercial banking industry improving to 2.8 percent as of first
quarter FY 2013 (but increased to 3.1 percent in the second quarter of FY 2013) from 3.7 percent
reported as of first quarter FY 2012 (Figure 9). In absolute terms, NPLs have increased by NPR
5 billion since last FY end and by NPR 3 billion in the last quarter. Most banks report NPLs
below 2 percent. Such NPL ratios—given banks’ high level of exposure to a rapidly declining
real estate market—strongly suggest significant under-reporting of NPLs and ever-greening of
loan portfolios. Some banks have also benefited from NRB’s adoption of regulatory forbearance
that allowed banks a grace period of 15 additional days from FY 2012 to recover overdue
loans/interest, which helped prevent loans from having to be disclosed as NPLs in year-end
reports.

32.     The true level of banks’ total exposure to the real estate sector is also likely under-
reported. NRB regulations only require commercial real estate loans and large residential
mortgages (above NPR 10 million) to be reported as real estate exposures, resulting in significant
under-reporting of the true total exposure of financial institutions to real estate. Reported total
real estate exposures of commercial banks as of Q1 FY 2013 (mid-October 2012) reduced to
16.3 percent of total loans from 19.0 percent reported the previous year. Reported real estate
exposure further decreased to 15.1 percent as of Q2 FY 2013 (mid-January 2013). Development
banks and finance companies reported exposures of 21 percent and 24 percent respectively as of
mid-October 2012. Seven commercial banks (18 percent of total assets) reported exposures
exceeding 20 percent of their portfolio as at end Q2 FY 2013. None of the banks reported real
estate exposure in excess of 25 percent compared to four banks (with a market share of 9.5
percent) a year ago.

33.     The real estate sector is showing signs of increasing difficulties. Prior to 2012, notices
of auctions of foreclosed land parcels and/or developed property by financial institutions rarely
exceeded 12 per month, but by the fourth quarter of FY 2012 this number had reached about 300
per month. It is also reported that very few bidders participate in these auctions due to lack of
financing and, if financing is available, interest rates are considered unaffordable by investors.
Together this means that most auctions fail. Based on an internal study, NRB concluded that real
estate is overpriced by 30 percent and that there is a need for sellers to adjust prices to stimulate
the market. Market participants suggest that this estimated decline may be understated in major
markets (such as Kathmandu and Pokhara) where the level of speculative investment has been
highest.

34.     The real estate crisis is not the only cause of banking sector vulnerability. A number
of additional factors have contributed to the fragility of the sector, including the rapid credit
growth seen during the FY 2008-2010 period, weak supervision and enforcement of prudential
regulations, and a liberal bank licensing policy. Inadequate governance and risk management in

                                                                          25
banks has heightened systemic fragility and financial interconnectedness, including through
connected lending, and possible cross shareholding among banks arising from pledging of equity
shares as loan collateral.

35.     There are signs of renewed liquidity stress starting to develop in early 2013. The
overall CDR in local currency (LCY) stood at 82.2 percent in FY 2013 Q2 (mid-January 2013),
compared to 78.4 a year ago and 76.2 as of mid-July 2012. During the first half of this financial
year, banks’ deposit grew by 4.4 percent (NPR 38 billion), compared to a credit growth of 12.3
percent (NPR 76 billion). This is a reverse trend from the corresponding period in 2011 when
deposits grew by 10.7 percent (NPR 74 billion) and credit by 6.2 percent (NPR 32 billion).
Eleven commercial banks, representing 30 percent of the market, recorded a CDR (in LCY) in
excess of 90 percent. This tightening of liquidity is mainly due to two factors: (i) lower
Government expenditure reducing liquidity by restricting the flow of funds into the economy (as
explained in Box 1), and (ii) growth in lending higher than the growth in deposits—as banks aim
to maintain or increase their level of profitability20.

The reform agenda ahead

36.     Addressing underlying banking sector vulnerabilities by building on the reforms
efforts already undertaken by the Nepalese authorities since the 2011 liquidity crisis is a
critical priority. Nepal already has a relatively comprehensive financial sector supervision
framework that needs to be further strengthened. NRB licenses, regulates and supervises deposit-
taking institutions. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) contributes to policy formulation for the
financial sector through the Economic Affairs and Policy Analysis and Financial Sector
Management Divisions. The High Level Financial Sector Coordination Committee (HLFSCC),
consisting of representatives of financial sector regulators, chaired by the Minister of Finance, is
tasked with coordinating regulators—NRB, the Securities and Exchange Board of Nepal
(SEBON, which oversees stock brokers, merchant banks, and other capital market participants)
and the Insurance Board under MoF (which supervises and regulates insurance companies)—and
policy formulation.

37.    The authorities have responded to the identification of weaknesses in the regulatory
and supervisory frameworks and the emergence of new and potential problems by
commencing implementation of a multi-faceted program directed at the early identification
and effective management of financial system risks 21.
  i.   First, the HLFSCC was established in 2011 to monitor progress and recommend policy
       actions to promote financial sector stability.
 ii. Second, NRB has strengthened the regulatory and supervisory frameworks (see Table 5)
       by issuing new regulations, circulars, directives and notices covering required CARs,

20
   Following the liquidity crisis, commercial (Class A) banks became more conservative and reduced their lending.
At the same time, their deposit base increased (because commercial banks were perceived as safer than development
banks and finance companies). As commercial banks were not able – due to competition – to reduce interest rates on
deposits, their profitability started to decline. As a result, commercial banks have now started to resume lending in a
more aggressive manner, to maintain profitability, which is in turn affecting their liquidity.
21
   Technical assistance to support implementation of this program has already been secured from Department for
International Development, DFID (see Appendix to Annex 3).

                                                         26
          credit risk management, insider lending, collateral, and operational risks. Loan
          classification and provisioning regulation have been improved; new risk management
          guidelines have been issued and a Liquidity Monitoring Framework adopted.
 iii.     Third, a single department supervising both Class B and C institutions was split into two
          dedicated departments. On-site inspection practices have been strengthened through IMF
          technical assistance. Regular stress testing of commercial banks is being undertaken.
          Macro-prudential monitoring has been strengthened by the creation of a Financial Sector
          Stability Unit in NRB, which will create semi-annual financial stability reports.
 iv.      Fourth, NRB has provided a degree of forbearance by relaxing three requirements
          relating to the real estate sector, following pressure from banks and real estate
          developers: (i) the deadline for banks to meet a real estate exposure cap of 25 percent of
          total loans has been extended by a year to July 2013; (ii) home mortgage loans of up to
          NPR 10 million are excluded when computing real estate exposure; and (iii) allowing
          financial institutions a grace period of 30 days from the end FY 2011 and 15 days from
          the end of FY 2012 to recover overdue loans/interest, especially from real estate
          borrowers.
     v.   Fifth, the NRB has established a Prompt Corrective Action framework and a bank
          resolutions desk to implement the framework. The NRB has also approved a Bank
          Resolution Manual and amendments to the NRB Act which strengthen and expand
          NRB’s bank resolution powers.
 vi.      Sixth, the MoF has approved a Deposit and Credit Guarantee Trust Bill which would
          provide a sound legal basis for the deposit insurance system in line with international
          practice.
vii.      Seventh, with IMF support, in 2012 NRB commenced a program of diagnostics of 20
          financial institutions to better identify institution-specific and potential systemic risks. In
          2013, with Department for International Development (DFID) support, this program will
          be widened to cover up to 60 financial institutions, and the scope of diagnostics—which
          will be carried out by consortia led by international auditing firms—significantly
          expanded to allow an in-depth assessment (‘deep dive’) of all aspects of each institution’s
          condition.
viii.     Eighth, NRB has initiated the consolidation of the financial sector through maintaining a
          licensing moratorium on new financial institutions 22, tightening eligibility criteria for
          licensing upgrades (between Classes A, B and C) and issuing a new bylaw to facilitate
          mergers between institutions.




22
  However NRB does not restrict up-graduation (through increased capital or merger, for example) subject to
meeting NRB conditions for up-graduation.

III. THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES
38.      As highlighted previously, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain political
transition, Nepal economic performance has continued to be good during the past few
years. The economy grew by an estimated 4.6 percent in FY 2012 and is projected to grow by
three to 3.5 percent in FY 2013, despite the lower-than-expected growth in India and shortfall in
public spending. Nepal has also made important inroads in reducing poverty and improving
human development outcomes (with 68 percent of the country’s population lived under US$1.25
per day in 1996, down to 24.8 percent in 2011). In April 2013, the newly formed consensus
Government approved a supplementary budget, which should boost public funding in the last
trimester of the year and also announced its intention to prepare a full-fledged budget for FY
2014. In addition, the newly formed Government fully recognizes the need to further accelerate
reforms to address financial sector vulnerabilities, which are a key threat to macroeconomic
stability in Nepal.

39.     Despite the complex political environment, the Government, acting through NRB
and MoF, has taken a number of important steps to address financial sector vulnerabilities.
As described in the previous section, starting in 2011, the Government implemented a series of
regulatory and supervisory measures designed to provide a first response to the weaknesses in
the financial sector and begin the process of identifying systemic and institution-specific risks.
Building on the foundation of these actions, the Government has now begun implementing a
comprehensive medium-term reform program to complete the identification of emerging risks
that could threaten stability, and to initiate broader financial sector restructuring.

40.     The authorities have initiated the consultative process to prepare a Financial Sector
Development Strategy. The process is led by NRB. Initial rounds of discussions with
stakeholders began in early 2013 on issues to be tackled by the Strategy. The authorities intend
that the Strategy will have an important focus on financial inclusion and financial literacy. As
part of this process, the authorities have also made an official request for a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) to be carried out by IMF and the World Bank, and DFID will
provide support for coordination of the preparation of the Strategy and for its dissemination.

41.     In 2012/13, the Government commenced restructuring of state-controlled banks.
The Government’s policy is to retain RBB as the sole state controlled financial institution. RBB
will have a development focus but on a commercially self-sustaining basis. All other state-
controlled institutions are to have control either divested (ADBL and NBL) or be merged into
RBB (Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, NIDC). By end-January 2013, the
recapitalization program for RBB had progressed very rapidly with its Capital Adequacy Ratio
becoming positive (up from -21.79 percent a year earlier) 23. RBB is already profitable, and the
additional capital will provide it with long-term viability. NBL is operating under NRB control,
and an initial capital injection by the Government of NPR 1.37 billion (of a total of NPR 6
billion needed) was made in July 2012. NBL expects to raise the balance of the amount required
from private sources (through a rights offering) and by selling non-banking assets 24, half of
which were tendered to the public in February 2013 with the remainder to be offered starting in
23
     See Box 4 for further details of the RBB and NBL recapitalization programs.

     See Box 4.

                                                          29
April 2013. As a result, NBL expects to have a positive CAR by mid-July 2013. Significant
progress has also been made on RBB and NBL governance. Both banks: (i) have professional top
management appointed by NRB (NBL) or competitively recruited (RBB); (ii) no longer issue
politically motivated loans; (iii) follow standard procedures for credit approval; (iv) have staff
performance evaluation and promotions standards; (v) have made the internal audit function
independent of management and reporting directly to the Board; (vi) give the CEO and
management targets and are expected to maintain corporate governance standards with ex-post
review by the Board; and (vii) achieved a higher compliance rating of central bank prudential
norms. ADBL is now in the process of preparing for divestiture of state control with assistance
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Lastly, in 2012 MoF also took an important step to
improve its ability to provide governance for state-controlled financial institutions and any future
Government interventions in the sector by establishing a Financial Sector Management Division
(FSMD), which will work in close coordination with the Economic Affairs and Policy Analysis
Division (EPAD). The capacity of FSMD and EPAD will be built up in 2013-2015 with
intensive DFID support.

                                   Box 4: NBL and RBB Recapitalization Plans

 NBL’s recapitalization plan was approved by NRB in January 2012. The plan calls for the Bank to be recapitalized
 by increasing its capital by approximately NPR 8.2 billion in stages over three years by the following actions:
 • Purchase of NPR 1.3 billion of new shares by the Government as its share of an NPR 3.6 billion rights offering
    (completed).
 • Sale of five percentage points of the Government’s shares to the staff of NBL as a condition of NBL’s unions’
    agreement to the bank’s restructuring (completed – NBL staff purchased about 2 percentage points).
 • Purchase of a further NPR 2.3 billion of shares by private investors, representing the remainder of the NPR 3.6
    billion rights offering (rights offering subscription launched in May 2013). The rights offering (9.5 shares for
    one share) is expected to close in mid-June 2013 and be completed in July 2013 (underway).
 • Sale of non-banking real estate assets to generate approximately NPR 1.3 billion of after-tax profits (first NPR
    one billion estimated value of assets, involving eight properties, was offered for sale to the public in February
    2013, the remainder to be sold before end-December 2013) (underway).
 • Government exchange of NPR 670 million of income tax liability arising from profits on the sale of non-banking
    assets for NBL shares (MoF has agreed in principal but a binding agreement between NBL and the Government
    has not yet been signed – the exact amount will be determined by the total profits realized from sales of non-
    banking assets).
 • Net income to generate retained earnings of NPR 2.6 billion (Provisional data indicate NPR 406 of Net Income
    for FY 2012).

 As of October 15, 2012, NBL had negative equity of NPR 2.65 billion. NBL management projects that the capital
 position will become positive by mid-July 2013 as a result of: (i) injection of NPR 2.3 billion from the rights
 offering; (ii) NPR 600 million in after-tax profits from non-banking asset sales; (iii) NPR 300 million in conversion
 of income tax liability on non-banking asset sales; and (iv) retained earnings for FY 2012/13. Sale of the remaining
 non-banking assets and retained earnings would then increase NBL’s capital to comply with regulatory
 requirements by mid-July 2016.

 In mid-July 2011, the Government’s stake in NBL was 40.59 percent. As a result of the sale of Government shares
 to NBL staff, this stake fell to 38.6 percent by end-December 2012. The Government has fully subscribed its share
 of the rights offering, with the result that its ownership share will not change when the rights offering is completed.
 However, as a result of the projected conversion of NPR 670 million of income tax liabilities arising from the sale
 of non-banking assets, NBL management projects that the Government could rise again to approximately 48
 percent. The Government’s medium-term strategy calls for the divestiture of this stake.

 RBB’s capital plan was approved by NRB in July 2012. The Bank is 100 percent Government-owned and would
 remain so after implementation of the capital plan is completed. The Government’s medium-term strategy calls for

                                                         30
 RBB to remain as the sole state-owned bank. The recapitalization plan calls for RBB to meet regulatory capital
 requirements by mid-July 2016 as a result of the following actions:
 • Government purchase of NPR 4.32 billion in new shares (completed).
 • Assumption of liability by the Government for on-lent World Bank funds 25 resulting in new equity in the
    amount of NPR 3 billion (completed).
 • Conversion of NPR 787 million of Government-owned preference shares to common shares increasing the
    capital weight of this amount to 100 percent (completed).
 • Conversion of NPR 87 million preference share dividend payable to the Government to equity (completed).

 As a result of the completion of these four actions injecting NPR 7.7 billion of common equity, RBB’s capital ratio
 improved from -9.35 percent (a figure which reflects the Government injection of NPR 4.3 billion to purchase new
 shares) to become positive as of January 15, 2013. In the period from July 2012-July 2016, RBB’s capital plan
 projects that the Bank’s capital ratio will increase to 11.42 percent (regulatory requirement 10 percent) as a result of
 the following:
 • Capital increase of NPR 416 million as a result of merger with NIDC Development Bank (underway, completion
     expected by mid-July 2013).
 • Retention of earnings of approximately NPR 3.5 billion.
 • Issuance of supplementary capital (subordinated debt) in the amount of NPR 4.25 billion.

42.     Building on the important measures taken in 2011/12 to alleviate the liquidity crisis,
the authorities are now addressing the root causes of the crisis with World Bank, DFID,
and IMF support. These root causes include the importance of detecting and taking action to
address emerging risks to the stability of the financial system and individual institutions, which
is one focus of the proposed DPC. In 2012, NRB moved to address these issues by launching a
pilot program (supported by IMF) of special inspections focused on risk management practices
and real estate lending of 20 financial institutions. By May 2013, 14 of these diagnostics had
been completed. NRB has also made a decision to expand the diagnostics program by launching
in-depth diagnostics of up to 60 institutions representing about 65 percent of financial system
assets. These diagnostics (supported by DFID) will be carried out by consortia led by
international accounting firms working under terms of reference aligned with international
practice.

43.     NRB has been supporting the consolidation of the financial system by encouraging
mergers of Class C institutions in difficulty with stronger institutions where such mergers
can provide long-term viability26. In 2012, NRB issued an amended bylaw to facilitate mergers
and has maintained its moratorium on new licenses for institutions (see Table 5). NRB
recognizes the need to review the overall structure of the financial sector (in particular the
number of institutions and their classifications). The financial sector strategy under
development—complemented by FSAP (requested by the Nepalese authorities)—aims at
building a consensus on the most appropriate structure to ensure that the Nepalese financial
sector is both inclusive and a motor for economic growth in the years to come.

44.    The Government has also completed preparation of important enhancements to the
financial sector safety net and to the legal framework for bank resolution. MoF has

25
   The World Bank funded Financial Sector Restructuring Project financed the Voluntary Retirement Schemes
(VRS) at NBL and RBB. The GoN on-lent the funds allocated for the RBB VRS to RBB. As part of RBB
restructuring plan, GoN agreed to convert its loan to RBB into capital.
26
   Between January 2012 and January 2013, 11 Class B and C institutions completed mergers, one Class C
institution completed a voluntary liquidation, and one Class C institution completed a forced liquidation.

                                                          31
approved a Deposit and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DCGT) Bill to place the deposit
insurance system on a sound legal footing. With DFID support, a program is also underway to
strengthen the capacity of DCGC to provide depositors with speedy and accurate repayment of
insured deposits and to build DCGC’s operational capacities. Both the NRB Act and the Banking
and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA, revisions to which have been under Parliamentary
consideration for some years) provide NRB with legal tools to intervene in troubled financial
institutions, and underpin the PCA framework. However, overlaps, gaps, and conflicts raise
uncertainty. With technical assistance from IMF, NRB has prepared amendments to the NRB
Act to allow for more efficient bank resolution through modernization and strengthening of
NRB’s bank resolution powers. NRB has also established a Bank Resolution Unit and has
prepared, with technical assistance from FIRST 27 and DFID, two bank resolution manuals: one
that can be used in the current legal framework (with the current version of NRB Act and
BAFIA) and one that will be used once the amendments to NRB Act are approved.

45.      The authorities have also taken steps to promote the transparency of the financial
sector. In order to improve transparency and in parallel improve the ability of supervisors to
detect emerging risks in the financial system, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal
(ICAN—the legal decision maker for all accounting issues in Nepal) has decided to require the
implementation of IFRS 28-compliant Nepal Accounting Standards 29 by listed financial
institutions starting in FY 2015/16. In consultation with the NRB it has been decided to stagger
the implementation process over three years, allowing additional time for lower capacity
institutions (primarily Class B and C institutions) to prepare themselves. DFID and World Bank
support will be utilized over the 2013-2015 period to build regulatory, audit industry, and
financial statement preparer capacity to work in an IFRS-compliant environment, and to adjust
regulatory frameworks to IFRS.

46.     Decisive steps have been taken by the Government to act against money laundering
and terrorist financing. In 2012, ordinances were approved by the President, which enacted the
Mutual Legal Assistance Bill and Extradition Bill. These pieces of legislation (ordinances have
the force of law but will have to be submitted for approval within six months of a Parliament
being elected), along with the Organized Crime Bill approved by ordinance in February 2103,
are expected to be enacted once a Parliament is in place and, along with the already enacted
‘Asset (Money) Laundering Prevention Act (2008)’, will provide a legal framework in line with
international standards. The authorities have also put in place the institutional infrastructure
required, with dedicated units at NRB and MoF, and establishment of a special court and
prosecutors to handle Anti Money Laundering / Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
cases. However, to avoid the Financial Action Task Force 30 (FATF) ‘dark list’ (also referred to

27
   Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative (http://www.firstinitiative.org/)
28
   International Financial Reporting Standards
29
   For convenience these have been referred to as IFRS.
30
   The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989. The objectives of
FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for
combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international
financial system. FATF has developed a series of Recommendations that are recognised as the international standard
for combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
FATF monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money laundering and
terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and implementation of appropriate

                                                       32
as a ‘public statement’), the following additional measures have to be completed by the issuance
of ordinances by end June 2013 enacting: (i) amendments to AML/CFT laws which incorporate
FATF recommendations, and (ii) the Proceeds of Crime Bill.

47.    The Government’s medium-term program for the financial sector focuses on
reforms designed, over a three-year period, to place the financial sector on a sound
foundation for the future. This program encompasses:
    i. Completion of a financial sector strategy based on wide consultation with stakeholders.
   ii. Completion of restructuring of three state-controlled banks through recapitalizations and
       a merger, and divestiture of control over two out of the three remaining institutions after
       completion of the merger 31. Only one bank with 100 percent state ownership, RBB, will
       remain with a commercial banking license but following a development focused strategy.
 iii. Completion of the program of in depth diagnostics of all at-risk and systemic banks,
       followed by appropriate measures to ensure that all banks are in regulatory compliance
       within two years.
  iv. Approval of a modernized bank resolution process and appropriate capacity within NRB
       to undertake bank resolution.
   v.  Putting in place a functioning financial sector safety net through enactment of the DCGT
       Bill and operationalization of the deposit insurance system.
  vi. Adoption of amendments to NRB Act and BAFIA to give supervisors stronger legal tools
       for bank resolution.
 vii.  Improvements to the transparency of the financial system through a staged adoption of
       IFRS.
viii. Enactment of further measures to support the fight against money laundering and terrorist
       financing.

48.     The participatory process has been enhanced as a result of NRB stepping up the
consultative process with stakeholders in recent months to keep pace with the changing
environment and to make appropriate amendments to the existing rules and regulations in
the financial sector. Regulatory changes are drafted by relevant departments before being
reviewed and endorsed by the Regulations Committee. The draft amendments are then shared
with relevant stakeholders—such as the associations of banks and financial institutions— for
their feedback before they are finalized and submitted to NRB management for approval. The
High Level Financial Sector Coordination Committee headed by the Finance Minister takes key
decisions on major financial sector reforms (such as RBB and NBL restructuring) and facilitates
consultations with key Government stakeholders (that is, MoF, NRB, Insurance Board,
Securities Board).




measures globally. FATF currently comprises 34 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organizations representing
most major financial centers in all parts of the globe. The World Bank has the status of observer.
31
   The four state controlled financial institutions are NBL, RBB, ADBL (where the GoN divestiture process is
supported by ADB) and NIDC (which will be merged with RBB, as per the RBB recapitalization plan).

IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
       A. Link to Interim Strategy Note (ISN) and Country Partnership Strategy
          (CPS) Under Preparation

49.     The current Nepal ISN (FY 2012-FY 2013) notes the vulnerability of the financial
sector and its potential adverse impact on growth. The ISN 32 is built around three pillars: (i)
enhancing connectivity and productivity for growth; (ii) reducing vulnerabilities and improving
resilience; and (iii) promoting access to better quality services—with two crosscutting themes (i)
governance and accountability, and (ii) gender equality and social inclusion. At the time of the
Board presentation of the ISN, World Bank Executive Directors took note of the emerging
weaknesses in the financial sector and urged the Bank to assist the Government in addressing
them inter alia through the potential use of development policy lending.

50.      A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2014-FY 2017 is under
preparation. The proposed CPS would be centered on four pillars aimed at: (i) increasing
accessibility and growth; (ii) promoting growth in human potential; (iii) enhancing governance,
accountability and citizen’s empowerment; and (iv) strengthening resilience and social equity.
The Concept Note for the proposed CPS underlines persistent financial sector weakness and the
risk this poses to macroeconomic stability and economic growth, as illustrated by a liquidity
crisis in 2011. It recognizes the efforts undertaken by the authorities to address the root causes of
the financial sector difficulties and the support provided by the World Bank, IMF and DFID. The
CPS Concept Note makes the case for the use of Development Policy Credits to support the
reform efforts of the authorities.


       B. Collaboration with IMF and Other Donors

51.      This proposed development policy credit has been prepared in close collaboration
with IMF and DFID. As a result of the vulnerability of the financial sector, the World Bank
(mostly through FIRST), IMF, and DFID have been providing technical assistance to the
Nepalese authorities, and in particular to NRB and DCGC. The focus of these efforts was: to
establish a framework for bank resolution, undertake initial diagnostics of some financial
institutions, prepare a prompt corrective action framework, and to finalize amendments to NRB
Act and prepare the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Trust (DCGT) Bill.

52.     The World Bank and IMF share the same concerns regarding the vulnerability of
the financial sector and the need to take urgent actions—as highlighted in IMF Article IV
consultation report (December 2012). The two institutions have therefore agreed to collaborate
closely on activities to address financial sector vulnerability.

53.    DFID is working closely with the World Bank on financial sector issues. Notably,
DFID co-financed the World Bank Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (P071291,
closed on December 31, 2011). DFID is now providing technical assistance support to both the
World Bank and the Government for the preparation of the proposed Development Policy Credit

                                                       34
and DFID has also recently approved a US$7.5 million equivalent technical assistance package
for 2013-2015 designed in coordination with the World Bank to support the implementation of
the broader Government financial sector reform program (see Annex 3 Appendix, below).

54.      This operation also complements the activities of IFC (Investment and Advisory
Services) to develop the Nepalese financial sector. IFC has invested in several financial
institutions in Nepal (Bank of Kathmandu, Nirdhan—a microfinance institution, Nepal
Ventures—a Small and Medium Enterprise venture capital fund, Rural Microfinance
Development Centre (RMDC)—an apex microfinance wholesale lending institution, and
International Leasing and Finance Company). IFC’s Financial Markets and Access to Finance
advisory work focuses on financial infrastructure, sustainable energy financing and SME
lending, microfinance, credit information bureaus, secured transaction registries, and support to
long-term lending institutions.

     C. Relationship to Other Bank Operations

55.    This proposed Development Policy Credit builds on the lessons from the World
Bank financed US$16 million Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (P071291,
approved in 2002 and closed in 2011) and the US$75.5 million Financial Sector
Restructuring Project (P084219, approved in 2004 and closed in 2009) 33.

56.     The Financial Sector Technical Assistance (FSTA) Project focused on three broad
objectives: (a) helping to restructure and re-engineer NRB, so that it can effectively perform its
key central banking functions; (b) commencing commercial banking reform in the two large
state-controlled commercial banks that dominate the sector (RBB and NBL) by introducing
stronger bank management to protect the financial integrity of the two banks and prepare the
banks for the next steps of restructuring; and (c) supporting a better environment for financial
sector reform in areas such as enhanced credit information, better financial news reporting, and
better training for staff in financial institutions. The FSTA Project closed in December 2011 and
the recently completed Implementation Completion Report (ICR) evaluated the project outcome
as Moderately Unsatisfactory and the Bank Performance, as well as Borrower Performance, were
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The ICR of the FSTA project (as well as the ICR of the
Financial Sector Restructuring Project described below) recognizes that important reforms—in
particular with regard to RBB and NBL—took place during the initial stages of the project, but
that the reform momentum then disappeared, hence the rating of the projects.

57.      Similarly, the objectives of the Financial Sector Restructuring Project were to: (a)
improve corporate governance through provision of management support to the two large
commercial banks (NBL and RBB), to substantially improve their operating capacity and
commercial viability; to move them as swiftly as possible into the private sector; and, thereafter,
develop the Government's oversight and supervisory capacity over them and other banking
institutions; (b) improve market structure by reducing the size of the state-owned segment of the
banking system; (c) sustain and deepen banking sector reforms, which entailed further
strengthening of NRB through a program of bank supervision strengthening; accounting and

33
  Both projects were IDA credits. The US$75.5 million Financial Sector Restructuring Project included a US$7
million grant component.

                                                    35
auditing development, human resource re-engineering, information technology up-grading, and
other support. This project represented the second phase of a larger financial sector reform effort
that began with the FSTA Project. The project closed in 2009 and the ICR evaluated the project
outcome as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Bank Performance, as well as Borrower Performance,
were rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

58.     These projects initially managed to implement a number of reforms, notably with
the two largest state controlled banks (such as the implementation of a Voluntary Retirement
Scheme (VRS) and the implementation of management contracts within the banks). However,
they then suffered from the political instability in Nepal during project implementation, from
shifting commitment from the frequently changing governments regarding the restructuring of
the two largest state owned banks, and from a blocked procurement process that derailed further
implementation 34.

59.     More recently, the World Bank has provided technical assistance to NRB and
DCGC on contingency planning, crisis management, bank resolution and deposit insurance
through the FIRST Initiative and in coordination with DFID technical assistance. The design of
the proposed Development Policy Credit relies on the recommendations of this technical
assistance. Section E below provides further detail on the technical assistance and analytical
work undertaken by the World Bank, IMF and DFID.


       D. Lessons Learned

60.     In 2008, the Bank undertook a comprehensive review, both in its operations and
research areas, of its responses to earlier financial crises 35. Notably, the largest Bank crisis-
response programs for South Korea, Argentina, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, and Russia have
been reviewed and critically assessed. The main generic lessons from Bank responses to previous
crises stressed the importance of an early response: the fiscal cost of interventions can be quite
large but the cost of inaction can be even larger.

61.     Experience during the 1990s financial crisis points to three broad areas requiring
close attention:
    • Focus and selectivity. The speed and focus of Bank response are both crucial for good
        outcomes during and after crises. Past crisis support was much more successful when it
        was nested in a results framework (explicit or implicit) that incorporated selective
        coverage and focused on the Bank’s comparative strengths. The proposed operation
        incorporates this lesson by focusing on policy actions that address directly the immediate
        needs of stabilizing the financial sector.
    • Financing modalities and organizational arrangements. Development Policy
        loans/credits can usefully address crisis needs, as they can support incremental reforms.
    • Coordination with partners. Coordination among key partners, particularly with IMF, is
        critical, as differences of view surface quickly during crises and are potentially damaging.

     See Footnote 35.

     IEG, Evaluation Brief 6, Lessons from World Bank Group Responses to Past Financial Crises, 2008.

                                                         36
        As mentioned in section B above, this proposed Development Policy Credit is prepared in
        close coordination with IMF and DFID.

62.      A number of lessons have also emerged from the more recent global financial sector
crisis (which started in 2008), as highlighted by the 2012 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
report 36 on the “World Bank Group’s Response to the Global Economic Crisis.? This report has
provided useful guidance for the development of this proposed intervention. In a situation like
Nepal, where the financial sector problems are chronic rather than acute, the report advocates a
phased program of intervention that sets forward-looking targets through a broad and medium-
term reform program. Finally, the report also highlights the key role of World Bank analytical
work to inform the policy dialogue and the reform program.

63.     In addition, the proposed operation takes into account the lessons from the
Financial Sector Technical Assistance and Financial Sector Restructuring Projects. While
these two projects initially achieved notable results with regard to NBL and RBB restructuring,
the results of both were ultimately disappointing. They have shown the limits of stand-alone
technical assistance projects when it comes to achieving politically sensitive reforms, especially
in the complex Nepalese political environment 37. Learning from the lessons from these two
projects, a different approach to supporting financial sector reform has been adopted, combining
intense policy dialogue in the context of the preparation of a Development Policy Credit with
technical assistance provided by FIRST and DFID. The policy dialogue on financial sector
reform was restarted following the mid-2011 liquidity crisis and through this intensive dialogue,
the Nepalese authorities and the World Bank have agreed on a financial sector reform roadmap,
whose initial steps would be supported by the proposed Development Policy Credit. Technical
assistance provided by FIRST and DFID has also proved critical, providing just-in-time policy
guidance to the authorities on issues such as NBL and RBB restructuring, bank resolution, and
deposit insurance.

     E. Analytical Underpinnings

64.     The design of this operation has relied on technical assistance financed by DFID, the
FIRST Initiative, US Treasury, and IMF. In particular, the design of this operation has been
informed by IMF on-going technical assistance to NRB, analytical work and on-site work on the
condition of the banking sector performed by DFID and IMF, and the recommendations of IMF
Article IV consultations. As highlighted in Figure 10, the reform program supported by DPC is
fully aligned with the IMF roadmap for financial sector reform. Boxes 5, 6 and 7 provide a
summary of the main recommendations of the various technical assistance reports.

37
   Following allegations of mis-procurement from the Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of Authority
(CIAA) under the Financial Sector Restructuring Project, the Governor of NRB was dismissed in July 2007 and the
Governor position remained vacant for one year and half. The Appellate Court absolved the former Governor from
all charges of corruption and reinstated him in July 2009. These events had a detrimental impact on the projects and
put a halt to all reform efforts. In addition, NRB has since then been extremely reluctant to undertake any
procurement under World Bank financed projects.

    Box 5: Responding to Issue Facing the Financial Sector of Nepal: Summary of Key Recommendations

A. Near-Term (as soon as possible)

Supervision
    • Conduct ‘deep dive’ diagnostics of banks to determine their real financial positions. This will help to
        identify any weaknesses not currently identified and afford a better opportunity to address them. The order
        of banks to be reviewed should be based upon the current identification of those thought to be the weakest
        and those that are most strategic to the system.
Resolution of troubled financial institutions
    • Consideration should be given to allowing a small institution to fail and be taken over by NRB, sold or
        liquidated.

B. Medium- and Longer-Term (will require more time to address, but need to be started soon)

Structure of the banking system
    • The number of bank classes should be reduced to two. Clear distinctions should be drawn between the two
        types of licenses in such areas as: required capital, the types of funds which can be mobilized and the term
        of the funds mobilized as well as the level of supervision applicable to each type of bank.
Supervision
    • Improve supervision: review structure of NRB supervision departments for class A, B and C; strengthen
        training of supervision staff and limit staff rotation; identify and closely monitor systemic banks.
Liquidity/solvency
    • Liquidity support should not be a substitute for addressing fundamental weaknesses of an institution. Care
        must be given to ensure liquidity support is not provided to an otherwise insolvent institution.
    • Undertake thorough review of loan portfolios, in terms of borrower repayment capacity, valuation of
        collateral, loan classification and provisioning to more adequately estimate the true capital position of
        banks.
Resolution of troubled financial institutions
    • Create a framework for effective bank resolution
    • Amend the law (BAFIA and/or NRB Act) to give sole discretion to NRB to determine a bank’s viability
        and its need for liquidation/insolvency and to act thereupon.

                     39
                    Box 6: Nepal Problem Bank Resolution Framework: Key Recommendations

• Harmonize the NRB Act, Banks and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA), and the proposed law on the Deposit
Credit and Guarantee Trust (DCGT). NRB should have the authority to determine the fate of the bank / financial
institution (BFI), not a court, and DCGT needs clear depositor preference status for its claims.

• Determine the extent to which the real estate downturn has affected BFIs by performing ‘deep dive’ diagnostics
of as many Class A, B & C institutions as possible.

• Establish a Problem Bank Resolution Unit at NRB, independent of but working closely with the BFI
Supervision Departments. The size of this unit would depend upon the extent of the problems disclosed by
diagnostics and the number of BFIs in distress as a result. The Unit will make recommendations for resolution
methods as well as supervise the Conservators and Receivers appointed over the non-state owned entities. The
Conservators appointed to operate institutions until a resolution is accomplished should not be employees of NRB,
they should be professionals hired as such. NRB as regulator and supervisor of BFIs in Nepal should not also be
directly managing a BFI due to conflicts of interest.

• If the real estate problem proves to be significant, it may be necessary to consider some open bank resolution
alternatives in addition to the traditional methods of conservatorship or receivership. It is hard at this time to
recommend one specific approach until the extent of the problem is known. One option used by other countries—
and which has been discussed in Nepal in similar situation—is to establish an Asset Management Company (AMC)
to acquire NPLs from problem institutions. Who will bear the cost to capitalize the AMC, at what price would the
assets be purchased out of the institutions and how will the institutions recapitalize? The use of AMCs has not been
universally successful and great care needs to be taken in designing an AMC to avoid it becoming a mechanism for
bank shareholders to avoid losses by shifting costs to the taxpayer. These are questions that would have to be
answered and highlight the need for working with MoF to develop a coordinated strategy for dealing with potential
widespread insolvency. It is important that the role of NRB as the supervisor become clearly separated from the use
of budget funds to finance the restructuring and recapitalization of financial institutions.

• Work with DCGT to develop procedures for insuring depositors receive their insured deposits in a reasonable
period of time; procedures are developed to insure the DCGT is reimbursed by the Receivership as appropriate
under applicable law and that the public is aware of deposit insurance and what it means.

•      Consider relaxing the cross holding limitations under BAFIA to allow institutions to acquire other institutions.

Report

                   Box 7: Nepal Bank Resolution Legal Framework: Key IMF Recommendations

    IMF technical assistance (TA) analyzed the current legal regime under the Nepal Rastra Bank Act and provided
    specific drafting suggestions based upon international good practices.

    IMF TA recommended that a new Chapter 9A of the Nepal Rastra Bank Act (“the NRB Act?) substitute its
    existing sections relevant to bank resolution. Chapter 9 of the NRB Act currently provides for corrective actions
    against problematic banks and contains several provisions for restructuring banks under official control. It has
    some useful provisions for restructuring banks, including: (i) the quantitative and qualitative triggers of taking
    control over banks, and (ii) the full control of an ‘Appointed Officer’ over bank’s general meeting and
    management.

    However, the existing legal framework for bank resolution is not effective. The weaknesses in the existing Chapter
    9 of the NRB Act include: (i) the lack of safeguards to creditors and shareholders, (ii) the complicated procedural
    requirements for each step of the official control, (iii) the provisions to allow releasing a bank from the official
    control without conducting any restructuring measure, and (iv) the power of an appellate committee to set-aside
    resolution transactions. Furthermore, there is no liquidation procedure specifically aiming at liquidating banks in


                                                            40
 an orderly manner. Under the absence of a bank specific liquidations procedure, only the general insolvency
 procedures under the Insolvency Act are available, but they are not suitable for orderly bank liquidation.

 IMF TA also reviewed the Bill for the Amendment and Consolidation of Legislation regarding Banks and
 Financial Institutions, which is under review at the Parliament. The Bill contains provisions very similar to those
 under Chapter 9 of the NRB Act. In order to eliminate possible overlap and inconsistency between the
 recommended Chapter 9A of the NRB Act and the Bill, IMF TA recommended deleting these relevant provisions
 under the Bill, if it continues to be under review at the Parliament.

V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
    A. Operation Description

65.      A standalone single tranche operation, supporting part of the medium-term
Government financial reform program, is proposed. The DPC will focus on putting in place
building blocks for banking sector stability, while the medium-term Government reform program
aims at consolidating banking sector stability and paving the way for the development of a robust
and inclusive financial sector. Given the depth of the Bank’s dialogue with the authorities, the
detailed elaboration and mutual understanding of the medium-term Government program, as well
as commitment by key stakeholders, this operation could have been designed as the first phase of
a programmatic series of development policy credits supporting financial sector stability and
reform. However, the fluidity of the political situation and the current lack of a Parliament argue
for a two-stage approach. This allows the timely acknowledgment of the important steps already
taken by the Government to preempt a possible financial crisis and strengthen financial sector
stability. It also allows the continuation of a deepening dialogue on broader reforms that could be
supported by a follow-up operation when conditions warrant.

66.     The proposed DPC builds on the authorities’ reform efforts and would allow a
deeper dialogue. As already outlined above, the policy dialogue on financial sector reform re-
initiated since the liquidity crisis in mid-2011 is bearing fruit and the Nepalese authorities have
commenced implementation of key steps in an ambitious financial sector reform program, with
the support of the World Bank, DFID and IMF. The authorities have demonstrated that despite
the complex political environment, they are able to implement important reform efforts such as
the approval and implementation of the recapitalization plans for NBL and RBB and the issuance
of Presidential ordinances (which have the force of law) on AML/CFT. The proposed DPC—
coupled with technical assistance from DFID and IMF—would play a key role in maintaining a
close and constructive dialogue. It would maintain this close policy dialogue, moving forward, to
ensure implementation of the longer-term Government financial sector reform program.

67.    The proposed prior policy actions for the Development Policy Credit are
summarized in the Box 8. The Policy Matrix is included in Annex 2. The articulation between
the proposed DPC and the medium-term Government financial sector reform program is
presented in Annex 3.



                                                         41
                                Box 8: Prior Actions for Development Policy Credit

The following constitute the prior actions for presentation of the Development Policy Credit to the World Bank’s
Board.

1.   The first phase of a time bound recapitalization plan for RBB has been approved by NRB and completed,
     including a cash injection from GoN of NPR 4.32 billion and the conversion of a loan of NPR 3 billion from
     GoN into capital.
2.   The first phase of a time bound recapitalization plan for NBL has been approved by NRB and completed,
     including: (i) a cash subscription from GoN of NPR 1.37 billion in advance payment for rights offering shares,
     (ii) the publication of a notice for tenders from the public for the sale of non-banking assets of NBL with an
     estimated value of NPR 1 billion; and (iii) the initiation of a rights offering for private shareholders to purchase
     NBL shares with a value of up to NPR 2.2 billion.
3.   NRB has approved a program of in-depth diagnostics for a list of financial institutions whose aggregate assets
     represent over 50 percent of the total banking assets in Nepal, including approval of the terms of reference of
     the diagnostic and the initial list of the institutions on which diagnostics will be performed.
4.   NRB has established a bank resolution desk and approved a bank resolution manual.
5.   NRB has, in May 2011 and October 2012, issued, respectively, a bylaw and amendments to the bylaw, as
     provided for under the NRB Act, to facilitate mergers of financial institutions so as to consolidate and
     strengthen the financial sector.
6.   The moratorium on new license applications for Class A, B and C financial institutions, as defined in BAFIA,
     and evidenced by no acceptance of banking license applications in 2012, has been maintained
7.   The draft Bill on Deposit and Credit Guarantee Trust has been endorsed by MoF for submission to the Cabinet.
8.   Amendments to the NRB Act providing NRB with modernized tools for bank resolution have been approved by
     NRB Board and further endorsed by MoF
9.   The President of Nepal has promulgated the Mutual Legal Assistance Ordinance, Extradition Ordinance and
     Organized Crime Ordinance.


     B. Policy Areas

68.     The DPC supports six main policy areas: (i) formulation of a financial sector
development strategy; (ii) restructuring of NBL and RBB; (iii) assessment of the condition of
Class A, B and C financial institutions and potential restructuring; (iv) strengthening institutional
arrangements to support the bank restructuring process; (v) strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework for effective bank resolution; and (vi) increasing the transparency of the
financial system.

Formulation of a financial sector development strategy

69.     The DPC supports the decision of GoN to prepare a comprehensive strategy to
support the development of an inclusive financial sector. The preparation of a financial sector
development strategy would help the authorities look beyond the short-term need to stabilize the
financial sector and help the authorities and the financial sector stakeholders come to a consensus
on a vision for the Nepalese financial sector in five to ten years and on the steps required to
transform this vision into reality. This strategy exercise will also undertake a review of the
current structure of the financial sector (Class A, B, C and D institutions, as well as cooperatives)
and to assess whether this structure is still relevant to Nepal’s needs because there is a growing
recognition that a consolidation of the financial sector is required (moving towards fewer

                                                           42
categories of financial institutions more sharply differentiated by required capital, with increased
minimum capital requirements and more stringent licensing regulations; the types of funds which
can be mobilized and the term of the funds mobilized; as well as the level of supervision
applicable). As explained in paragraph 40, this exercise is led by NRB. By December 2013, NRB
and MoF will have initiated technical consultations with stakeholders for the elaboration of the
financial sector development strategy for Nepal and a roadmap for strategy preparation would
have been developed. The medium-term Government program will ensure that the financial
sector development strategy has been approved and that the strategy is under implementation, as
per its action plan.

Restructuring of NBL and RBB

70.     These two undercapitalized state controlled banks 38 represent 15.3 percent of total
commercial banks assets (as of mid-October 2012). It is critical for the Nepalese authorities to
establish a level playing field and to require that all banks (public as well as private) meet
prudential norms and, in particular, capital adequacy requirements. Allowing state-owned banks
to remain insolvent indefinitely sends a negative message to the overall financial sector,
indicating that lack of compliance with prudential regulation is acceptable. It also significantly
reduces the authorities’ credibility to tackle problem banks.

71.      As discussed above, the authorities have initiated the restructuring of NBL and
RBB. The prior actions for the DPC read as follows: (i) the first phase of a time bound
recapitalization plan for RBB has been approved by NRB and completed, including a cash
injection from GoN of NPR 4.32 billion and the conversion of a loan of NPR 3 billion from GoN
into capital and (ii) the first phase of a time bound recapitalization plan for NBL has been
approved by NRB and completed, including: (a) a cash subscription from GoN of NPR 1.37
billion in advance payment for rights offering shares, (b) the publication of a notice for tenders
from the public for the sale of non-banking assets of NBL with an estimated value of NPR 1
billion; and (c) the initiation of a rights offering for private shareholders to purchase NBL
shares with a value of up to NPR 2.2 billion. The recapitalization plans are described in Box 4, in
Section III. The medium-term Government reform program aims at ensuring that, following
diagnostic audits, RBB and NBL remain in compliance with their approved recapitalization
plans. In addition, while RBB will remain a fully state-owned bank, the Nepalese authorities
intend to transfer control of NBL to a reputable strategic investor, which will be critical to ensure
the continued sound governance of NBL. NBL is currently under the direct control of NRB,
which ensures appropriate governance. As discussed in paragraph 41, in 2012, MoF took an
important first step to improve its ability to provide governance for state-controlled financial
institutions and any future Government interventions in the sector by establishing a Financial
Sector Management Division (FSMD), which will work in close coordination with the Economic
Affairs and Policy Analysis Division. By December 2013, both RBB and NBL CARs will be
positive (RBB CAR stood at -21.79 percent in Mid-January 2012, while NBL CAR stood at -
8.53 percent at the same date).

72.    The medium-term Government reform program will focus on completing the
restructuring and full recapitalization of NBL and RBB. The approved recapitalization plans
38
     While GoN only owns 38.6 percent of NBL, NBL is still perceived by the public as a state-owned bank.

                                                         43
for NBL and RBB include several phases that should ensure that NBL and RBB exceed
minimum CAR requirements by FY 2016. The first phases of NBL and RBB recapitalization
plans have been completed; however it will be important to ensure timely and effective
implementation of the remaining phases of the recapitalization plans. In addition, to ensure that
the recapitalization (that is, financial restructuring) of the institutions is sustainable, it is indeed
critical to ensure that the errors of the past (which led to the insolvency of both banks, that is,
poor governance) do not re-occur and to pursue the institutional restructuring of the banks—as
spelled out in NBL and RBB business plans. NBL and RBB have prepared—building on the
approved recapitalization plan—business plans which demonstrate how the two institutions aim
to improve their operations and facilitate access to financial services to the Nepalese population.
MoF has indicated that it intends—with support from the recently approved DFID long-term
technical assistance package—to closely monitor the performance of the two state-controlled
institutions through the new established FSMD. In recent years, both MoF and NRB have
demonstrated a strong commitment to ensure good governance within RBB and NBL, as well as
compliance with prudential regulations.

Assessment of the condition of Class A, B and C financial institutions and potential
restructuring

73.      NRB has recognized the need to undertake an in-depth assessment of financial
institutions which are either considered to be at risk or systemic. As highlighted in paragraph
42, to better understand the true situation of the financial sector, NRB has launched a pilot
program (supported by IMF) of diagnostics focused on risk management and real estate lending
of 20 financial institutions. Considering the lack of reliability of reported financial information
(notably with regard to NPLs and exposure to real estate), it is important to deepen this exercise
and NRB has taken the decision to undertake comprehensive diagnostic audits of financial
institutions (A, B and C class) representing at least 50 percent of total banking assets. The World
Bank, DFID and NRB have agreed on Terms of Reference (including selection criteria for up to
60 institutions) for these in-depth diagnostics. The prior action for the DPC therefore reads as
follows: NRB has approved a program of in-depth diagnostics for a list of financial institutions
whose aggregate assets represent over 50 percent of the total banking assets in Nepal, including
approval of the terms of reference of the diagnostic and the initial list of the institutions on which
diagnostics will be performed. By December 2013, the in-depth diagnostic program will have
been initiated, to provide comprehensive information on problem institutions.

74.      The medium-term Government reform program will ensure that the diagnostic
audits of financial institutions will be completed; and that corrective action programs are
implemented for undercapitalized institutions. If the diagnostics identify undercapitalized
banks, the authorities will develop and implement appropriate resolution processes, which would
involve restructuring and recapitalization from private sources for viable banks or financial
institutions and orderly liquidation for non-viable banks or financial institutions. In the case of
undercapitalized systemic institutions, if insufficient private capital is available, then state
intervention may be necessary. Strengthening of banking supervision and resolution capacities
will be critical to ensure that corrective action programs are implemented for undercapitalized
institutions.



                                                  44
Strengthening institutional arrangements to support the bank restructuring process

75.      The Nepalese authorities have initiated key reforms to strengthen the bank
restructuring process with, in particular, the issuance of regulations to facilitate mergers of
financial institutions, continuation of the moratorium on new licenses, preparation of a bank
resolution manual, and preparation of a Bill to transform the Deposit and Credit Guarantee
Corporation (DCGC) into the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Trust (DCGT). Such steps are
critical before receiving the results of in-depth diagnostics, which might lead to the need to
resolve a number of problem financial institutions. The prior actions for the DPC therefore read
as follows: (i) NRB has established a Bank Resolution Unit and approved a bank resolution
manual; (ii) NRB has, in May 2011 and October 2012, issued, respectively, a bylaw and
amendments to the bylaw, as provided for under the NRB Act, to facilitate mergers of financial
institutions so as to consolidate and strengthen the financial sector; (iii) the moratorium on new
license applications for Class A, B and C financial institutions, as defined in BAFIA, and
evidenced by no acceptance of banking license applications in 2012, has been maintained; and
(iv) the draft Bill on DCGT has been endorsed by MoF for submission to the Cabinet. The Bank
Resolution Desk for Class A financial institutions has been established, and this Desk will also
become responsible for the resolution of Class B and C institutions, in order to ensure
consistency and better utilization of resources. The Bank Resolution Manual—which can be used
with the current version of the NRB Act—was approved in May 2013 by NRB. A second version
of the Bank Resolution Manual, to be used once the amendments to the NRB Act have been
enacted, has also been developed. As illustrated in Table 5, NRB has issued regulations in 2012
to facilitate mergers of financial institutions and NRB has maintained the moratorium on new
licenses for class A, B and C institutions 39. As a result, the consolidation of the sector has been
initiated and as of January 2013, the sector consisted of 187 institutions in Classes A, B and C,
reduced from 199 in January 2012. By end-2013, the sector is expected to be reduced to 175
institutions. MoF has finalized the draft DCGT bill with DFID assistance, taking into account
international practice and new senior management has been appointed. The following results are
therefore expected by December 2013: (i) NRB Bank Resolution Desk is operational and
undertakes bank resolutions; (ii) consolidation of the financial sector is underway through a
decrease in the number of financial institutions; and (iii) the legal and operational framework for
deposit insurance is ready for implementation (pending legislative approval).

76.     The medium-term Government reform program supports the development of
DCGT as an efficient and effective deposit insurance mechanism. Once the Constituent
Assembly is in place, the DCGT Act will be submitted for Parliamentary approval 40. The DCGT
Act will be complemented by the issuance of several key documents: (i) regulations on criteria
for setting deposit insurance coverage and the annual guarantee fee; (ii) payout procedures for
effective deposit compensation; (iii) Deposit Insurance Institutional Development Plan; and (iv)
DCGT organizational structure (with competitive recruitment of staff). Starting in the second
quarter of 2013, the DFID technical assistance package will provide DCGC with the information


39
   A new class B institution has been established in 2012—as it had received an in-principle approval from NRB
before the moratorium was put in place.
40
   However, should a financial crisis break out, it would be possible for the DCGT Act to be approved by
Presidential ordinance.

                                                     45
systems required to execute deposit pay-out operations and to build the capacity of DCGT staff.
This will ensure that the legal and operational framework for deposit insurance is in place.

Strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for effective bank resolution

77.     The legal framework for bank resolution (notably the NRB Act and BAFIA)
overlaps and conflicts, which creates legal uncertainty. Moreover, declaring a bank insolvent
is complex, lengthy, and subject to interference by creditors and shareholders. As a result, the
prior action for the DPC is as follows: amendments to the NRB Act providing NRB with
modernized tools for bank resolution have been approved by NRB Board and further endorsed
by MoF. By December 2013, the legal framework for effective bank resolution should be
finalized (pending legislative approval 41). The NRB Board approved the amendments to the
NRB Act on May 22, 2013. A review by the IMF and World Bank of the NRB Act amendments
on bank resolution approved by NRB Board showed that while the amendments relating to bank
resolution were conceptually satisfactory, further precisions and revisions to ensure clarity were
needed in the text. Following the NRB Board approval, these amendments have been forwarded,
for endorsement, to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance, in close coordination with
NRB, further revised the amendments (in light of the IMF and World Bank comments) and
endorsed the revised amendments on bank resolution for further transmission to the Ministry of
Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs.

78.     Under the medium-term Government program, MoF will ensure that the
amendments to the NRB Act and the conforming amendments to other legislation
(including BAFIA) have been submitted to Parliament and necessary directives for their
implementation have been finalized. This would ensure that the legal framework for bank
resolution has been modernized to allow effective bank resolution. Following a request from the
Nepalese authorities, IMF and DFID will provide technical assistance to revise BAFIA (starting
in FY 2014).

Increasing the transparency of the financial system

79.     The authorities have taken important steps to promote the transparency of the
financial sector. In particular, the authorities have demonstrated their commitment to act against
money laundering and terrorist financing with the approval of three key ordinances (Legal
Assistance Bill, Extradition Bill and Organized Crime Bill). The authorities have also decided to
adopt—with support from the recently approved DFID technical assistance program—IFRS-
compliant accounting standards, which will allow a more accurate picture of the performance of
financial institutions and, thus, more effective supervision.

80.    The prior action for the DPC reads as follows: The President of Nepal has
promulgated the Mutual Legal Assistance Ordinance, Extradition Ordinance and Organized
Crime Ordinance. This prior action is complemented by the following policy action under the
DPC: the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) has taken the decision to adopt
IFRS in July 2015 for the financial sector. By December 2013, it is expected that Nepal retains

41
  However, should a financial crisis break out it would be possible for the NRB Act amendments to be approved by
Presidential ordinance.

                                                      46
grey (or better) classification from FATF, and therefore avoids being on the FATF dark list that
would have dire consequences for Nepal (that is, cut off from the international financial
system 42). The medium-term Government program will support the submission to Parliament of
the three ordinances on Mutual Legal Assistance, Extradition and Organized Crime.


VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

     A. Poverty and Social Impact

81.     Nepal attained the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG), to halve extreme
poverty, ahead of time. The percentage of people living below the international line for extreme
poverty (people earning less than US$1.25 per day) has halved in only seven years. At this
measure of poverty, the percentage of poor people declined from 53.1 percent in 2003/2004 to
24.8 percent in 2010/2011. With a higher poverty line (people earning less than US$2 per day),
poverty declined by one quarter to currently 57.3 percent. Nepal's overall Gini coefficient has
simultaneously declined from 0.41 to 0.35, a measure that shows poor segments of the
population have been able to increase household incomes in relation to higher income groups.
While general increases in household incomes were largely driven by remittances, a recent
poverty diagnostic suggests that remittances had only a relatively small effect on the decline in
absolute poverty, which was mainly driven by internal migration. The link between remittances
and poverty reduction and Nepal’s drivers of poverty reduction in general still require further
analysis, which is ongoing. Despite the progress in poverty reduction, Gross National Income
(GNI) per capita remains low at US$742 (2012) and Nepal remains among the poorest countries
in the world.

82.      A potential financial sector crisis would have serious negative impacts on poverty
and social development. The specific measures supported by this operation, and the medium-
term Government program, are targeted at mitigating the impact of a potential financial sector
crisis, in particular for households. They are therefore considered to have a substantial positive
social impact. The proposed operation supports initial measures that safeguard banking system
stability and give priority to individual depositors in the process of bank resolution. At the same
time, it is well known that banking crises have large direct fiscal costs and even larger indirect
costs in terms of foregone economic growth—costs that increase significantly as a result of non-
action. As highlighted in the IMF Article IV report for 2012, the potential impacts of a financial
crisis on Nepal could include fiscal costs of 23 percent of GDP and an output loss of 30 percent
of GDP. DFID has calculated that a financial crisis of the potential magnitude in Nepal projected
by IMF would result in about an additional two million people remaining below the poverty line
over 10 years 43. The financial sector reform program supported by this proposed operation is

42
   If Nepal were to be blacklisted by FATF, Nepalese financial institutions would lose their credibility in the
international financial system and, for example, commercial banks might not be able to approve letters of credit
issued by Nepalese banks. This could sharply restrict Nepal’s international trade finance transactions, especially
imports (which would have to be paid for in physical foreign currencies). In turn this would cripple economic
activity and deprive the country of basic or essential commodities. It would also have a devastating impact on FDI
and remittances, which would have to switch to informal channels.

designed based on the principle of least cost solutions to addressing banking sector stress, with
private shareholders and unsecured creditors bearing the brunt of the costs of bank failures.

83.     Maintaining the stability of the weakened financial sector, a central aim of the
proposed operation, is critical to safeguard household deposits. As highlighted by Figure 11,
total deposits in commercial banks have more than doubled since 2007, from NPR 352 billion in
FY 2007 to NPR 898 in January 2013. To safeguard these deposits and preserve the trust in the
financial sector, the authorities decided to establish DCGT, protecting deposits up to NPR
200,000.

84.     In addition, if Nepal were to be blacklisted by FATF, the impact on remittances
inflows—and thus poverty—could be dramatic. Nepalese financial institutions would lose
their credibility in the international financial system, which would likely severely curtail Nepal’s
international financial transactions. It would have, in particular, a devastating impact on
remittances, which would have to switch to informal channels.

85.     Overall, the proposed measures would strengthen the performance of financial
institutions, as well as increase the capacity of NRB to supervise the financial sector and
resolve problematic financial institutions. In the medium-term, the poor and the vulnerable
would benefit substantially as the health of financial institutions is regained, and growth would
likely be accelerated with a more stable and efficient financial sector. At the same time, the
poor’s access to financial services is expected to improve, again, benefitting the poor.


    B. Environmental Aspects

86.   Actions proposed under this operation (and the medium-term Government
program) are not expected to have any negative effect on the environment.


                                                   48
     C. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

87.     The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for overall implementation, in close
coordination with NRB. Progress towards the proposed outcome indicators is monitored
regularly. The HLFSCC (chaired by the Minister of Finance and composed of NRB Governor,
Chairman of the Insurance Board, Chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal, Finance Secretary,
Deputy Governors, and the Executive Director of NRB Regulations Department—who acts as
the Coordinator) has played a key role in the implementation and monitoring of reforms. MoF
has recently strengthened its capacity to oversee the financial sector by forming the Financial
Sector Management Division to complement and expand the capacity already in place in the
Economic Affairs and Policy Analysis Division.

88.     This development policy credit, which supports initial financial sector reforms and
paves the way for the medium-term Government reform program, will be complemented
by significant technical assistance. The appendix to the policy matrix in Annex 3 identifies the
areas where technical assistance will be provided. DFID has provided short-term technical
assistance to the preparation of the DPC and has recently approved a US$7.5 million equivalent
technical assistance package to support the implementation of the medium-term Government
financial sector program from 2013-2015. This DFID technical assistance, along with support
from other donors, is critical for the implementation of the financial sector reform program
initiated by the Government and supported by the Development Policy Credit.


     D. Fiduciary Aspects

89.     Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment. In 2007, the
assessment of Nepal’s performance in Public Finance Management (PFM) was concluded. GoN
initiated the process with the support of the World Bank and in collaboration with other
development partners that assessed the performance of the country’s PFM systems in comparison
with internationally accepted benchmarks. This assessment followed the Public Financial
Management Performance Measurement Framework prepared by Public Expenditure Working
Group 44. The methodology examined the soundness of the PFM framework by rating 28+3
indicators (the three are related to donor practices) using specific criteria provided by the
guidelines. The scope of the assessment covered fiscal and debt management, budget
formulation, budget execution, internal controls, procurement, accounting and reporting,
auditing, transparency, and external scrutiny based on specific criteria for ratings for each
indicator provided in the methodological document contained in the Public Financial
Management Performance Measurement Framework referred above, known as the Public
Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) Framework.

90.     The assessment concluded that the financial management system has been well
designed but unevenly implemented. It specified that the budget has become a credible policy
tool, clearly linked to policies in some sectors, with a solid control of aggregate outturns and a
reasonable control framework at the transaction level (notably for payroll). However, it noted

44
   World Bank, IMF and Joint Donor Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Unit, available at
http://www.pefa.org/Documents.htm

                                                 49
that there are many gaps in the control framework as well as significant implementation
constraints, and large fiscal activities remain outside the scope of the central budget. Several
weaknesses originate in the weak demand (from both Government and external stakeholders) for
better budget information (financial and physical) and management. It further stated that the
performance in terms of fiscal discipline is generally positive but remains threatened by four
main weaknesses: (i) lack of monitoring of fiscal risks (including those related to donor funding)
is creating significant uncertainties; (ii) poor capital budget preparation and implementation
weakens GoN’s capacity to make the best use of existing fiscal space; (iii) weak sector strategies
prevent GoN from managing the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF); and (iv) weak
reconciliation of revenue accounts reduces available resources.

91.      Public Financial Management Strategy, Phase I and follow up actions. Following the
2007 PEFA assessment, GoN (in collaboration with development partners) formulated a
Development Action Plan that described the menu of actions for strengthening PFM systems and
processes. In 2008, GoN formed a PFM Steering Committee (chaired by the Finance Secretary)
and set up a PEFA Secretariat to drive the reform initiatives and coordinate PFM reform efforts.
In 2009, with the support of the World Bank and DFID, GoN formulated a Public Financial
Management Reform Program (PFMRP) Strategy, Phase I (2010-2013), with the objective of
adopting a holistic Government-wide approach to PFM reforms encompassing both the
institutional and technical aspects. The PFMRP strategy has two key priorities for the short term:
(i) to deliver actions that yield effective results in strengthening the PFM system, in general, but,
more specifically, on the ex-post side of PFM institutional and process strengthening; and (ii) to
build the capacity of the PEFA Secretariat to lead the PEFA agenda and institutionalize the
reform process. The PEFA Secretariat is now driving the PFM Reform Agenda.

92.      As a result of continuing political instability, the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) score has been low, especially in sections dealing with public financial
management and governance. While there are limits under the given political situation on how
much the reform agenda can be accelerated, at the bureaucratic and technical level, a number of
the core reforms are currently taking place under the support of Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF) for Public Financial Management. Implementation of single treasury system of accounts
has been a success story for Nepal, with the roll-out of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) in 60
districts covering almost 95 percent of expenditures and 98 percent of revenue, thus ensuring
better cash management and timely reporting. The government plans to roll out the TSA in all 75
districts by the end of FY 2012/13. Similarly, the intervention at the Office of the Auditor
General through the support of MDTF is also expected to improve the quality of audits focusing
on risk-based auditing and performance auditing. The Bank is also working with the civil society
organizations to create demand for better accountability. Regular dialogue is taking place
between the Bank and the government on PFM agenda, discussed during the recently concluded
Nepal Portfolio Performance Review and at PFM Steering Committees chaired by the Finance
Secretary. Development partners have formed a PFM Thematic Group at the technical level to
discuss and share knowledge and experiences with the objective of harmonizing development
assistance to areas related to PFM. The Government also has committed to carry out the Repeater
PEFA Assessment this financial year with the aim to complete the assessment in 2014. All these
are likely to affect the result of the relevant CPIA score in the years to come.



                                                 50
93.     Budget information is available to the public as soon as the Finance Minister tables
the fiscal year budget proposal for Parliament’s approval. The information available on the
Ministry’s website represents aggregate budget numbers for the proposed year and includes
budget numbers of the two previous years’ expenditures, as well as forward budget estimates for
the next two years, along with functional and program/project budget lines. Upon Parliament’s
approval of the budget, fiscal year budget numbers by geographical region are made available to
the public. It should however be noted that this information is relatively technical and the
population at large might not be able to effectively use the available information.

94.    Increased demand for improved PFM from civil society. In addition to the
Government’s focus on strengthening government public expenditure and financial management
systems, there has also been an increasing interest in recent years on the part of non-executive
branch state actors, civil society organizations and development partners to strengthen financial
accountability, with the goal of improving use of public resources and obtaining value for
money. With regard to transparency and information sharing, GoN promulgated the Right to
Information Act in 2007, mandating the need for information sharing and transparency. GoN has
been working closely with development partners in the design and implementation of PFM
reforms initiatives at the country and sector level, particularly in two sector wide programs in the
education and health sectors. Regular stakeholder meetings are held to review activity budgets,
implementation status reports, and output flash reports.

      E. Disbursement and Auditing

95.     Disbursements. This operation is a standalone single-tranche credit of US$30 million
equivalent. The credit proceeds will be made available to the Government upon credit
effectiveness. Upon approval of the credit and notification by the World Bank of credit
effectiveness, the Government will submit a request to the World Bank to withdraw the funds.
The World Bank will disburse the proceeds of the credit into a treasury account at the request of
MoF, which will be deposited in the Nepal Rastra Bank. The Government will transfer an
amount in local currency but equivalent to amount disbursed by the World Bank to the budget
(the general fund). GoN will confirm to the Bank, within 30 days, receipt of the tranche proceeds
and its credit in the general fund. If after deposit in the NRB account, the proceeds of the credit
are used for ineligible purposes (for example, to finance goods or services on the World Bank’s
standard negative list), the World Bank will require the Government to return that amount to the
account for use of eligible purposes.

96.     IMF conducted an update in 2010 of a safeguards assessment that was carried out in
2002 of the Nepal Rastra Bank and concluded that NRB had made progress in recent years
to strengthen its safeguards framework. However, it suggested that further improvements
could be made in some areas, notably the involvement of an audit partner or firm with
experience in auditing central banks or larger financial institutions for the external audit;
enhancement of transparency by resolving matters raised by the auditors; improving financial
reporting and control systems; and modernization in areas such as reserves and currency
management. The update assessment noted that most recommendations made in the 2002
assessment have been complied with. However, the following actions remain outstanding and
require serious consideration: (i) enhance the role of the Audit Committee and its independence
by changes to the composition of the Audit Committee and indicate appropriate requirements for

                                                51
membership of the Audit Committee (this could be addressed through the amendment of the
NRB Act); (ii) strengthen the internal controls, accounting procedures, and internal auditing
practices by forming a task force chaired by the Audit Committee Chair; and (iii) prepare a
written reconciliation of program data with accounting records for all test dates under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement. NRB is currently addressing these
recommendations in the context of the amendments to the NRB Act. While amending the NRB
Act to allow more effective bank resolution, NRB is also making broader amendments to
strengthen the Act.

97.     The latest audit report of NRB for FY 2011/12 was a qualified report, and all
preceding audit reports were also qualified. Key audit observations are related to the
following: (i) non-compliance with NRB Act 2002, and (ii) non-compliance with IFRS. NRB has
indicated that it is fully committed to address the observations included in the audit reports.

98.     No audit will be required under DPC. The Government will maintain accounts and
records showing that loan disbursements were made in accordance with provisions of the Credit
Agreement. Within thirty days of remittance of funds by the World Bank, the Government will
provide a confirmation to the World Bank that the funds have been received by NRB and that
these funds are available for financing budget expenditures. The IMF Safeguard Assessment of
NRB indicates that there are no strong reasons for the World Bank to request an audit of the
deposit account or to require additional safeguard measures, as permitted under Operational
Policy (OP) 8.60. As such, no audit will be required under the DPC.


   F. Risks and Risk Mitigation

99.     The main risks identified are political instability and reform implementation risks.
Political uncertainty has become the norm in post-conflict Nepal, characterized by frequent
changes in Government. The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in May 2012 has brought
additional uncertainty although the recent formation of the pre-election Government augurs well
for the orderly conduct of elections and formation of a democratically elected Government by
end-2013. It should be noted that Nepal stands out as a country that has achieved stable
economic performance and good development results despite these political uncertainties. The
speed of implementation of the medium-term Government reform program could be slowed
down depending on the prevailing political environment. However, Nepal has proven in the past
that it can generate consensus on financial sector issues at critical times as in the case of the
recent approval on three key ordinances on AML/CFT.

100. Changes in Government might affect policy dialogue continuity. To mitigate this
situation, to the extent possible, delivery of prior actions was discussed with economic leadership
across the major political parties so that there is wide ownership and continuity of policy
agreement even if there is Government change (as has recently happened). While political risks
to implementation of the Government’s medium-term program for the financial sector are
substantial, this operation takes the view that such risks are best managed through continued
active engagement, coupled with a strong technical assistance program (to be mostly supported
by DFID).


                                                52
101. Reform implementation risks are high in the present environment, but mostly affect
the medium-term Government program. The financial sector reform program initiated by the
Government, whose initial steps are supported by the Development Policy Credit, may affect
vested interests, which could trigger resistance. Capacity to implement reforms is low and will
therefore be supported by intensive technical assistance. The medium-term Government reform
program includes complex and sensitive reforms. The diagnostics will provide information on
the exact financial situation of the institutions under review. If the diagnostics identify under-
capitalized institutions, NRB will need to request shareholders to recapitalize their respective
institutions or to initiate liquidation. It will be critical for NRB to be able to enforce resolution
actions. While the authorities have stressed their commitment to divest from NBL and find a
reputable strategic partner (while maintaining RBB as a fully state-owned bank), it is also likely
that this decision will face resistance, notably from the powerful NBL unions and/or some NBL
shareholders. A detailed risk analysis for each policy action of the financial sector reform
program is included in Annex 4.

102. It is recognized that the present political environment in Nepal complicates the
reform process (in particular for legal reforms, given the absence of a Parliament).
However, the vulnerability of the financial sector is such that urgent measures need to be
taken. In addition, the Nepalese authorities have demonstrated during the preparation of the
DPC that they are able to take critical decisions in an uncertain political environment (such as the
approval of the recapitalization plans for NBL and RBB and subsequently making large capital
injections into the two banks, as well as the closure of distressed financial institutions, and the
decision to proceed with in-depth diagnostics). Implementation risks for this DPC are mitigated
through demonstrated commitment at the highest levels of the Government and bureaucracy, and
through close alignment with IMF and DFID, as well as through an extended preparation phase
with continued policy dialogue, which has allowed the authorities to complete the prior actions.

103. The proposed operation (stand-alone, single tranche DPC) has been designed in
such a way to mitigate political instability and reform implementation risks. As explained in
paragraph 2, the actions supported under the proposed DPC form part of a broader, medium-term
Government financial sector reform program. Sufficient overall progress towards the objectives
of the medium-term program would allow the Bank to provide additional support in the form of a
second DPC within the next 18 months or so. This two-stage approach allows the timely
acknowledgment of the important steps already taken by the Government to preempt a possible
financial crisis and strengthen financial sector stability. It also allows the continuation of a
deepening dialogue on broader reforms that could be supported by a follow-up operation when
conditions warrant.
