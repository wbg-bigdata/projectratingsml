MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Sudan
Blue Nile Pump Schemes Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1118-SU)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Sudan - Blue
Nile Pump Schemes Rehabilitation Project (Credit 11 18-SU)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
The Borrower did not submit Part II. While it fails to highlight the deficiencies of Bank appraisal,
it provides a good overall assessment of project performances and outcomes.
The project, which aimed to rehabilitate a pre-existing irrigation system serving 21,000
ha managed by the Blue Nile Agricultural Corporation (BNAC), and to provide agricultural
machinery and workshops for accelerating cotton cultivation in the rest of the BNAC command area,
had a most unsatisfactory outcome. The project was rated as having major management problems
throughout the greater part of its implementation phase. It failed to meet its irrigation modernization
objectives in spite of a four year and three month extension to completion. Forty percent of the
credit was cancelled.
Expansion of cotton growing to 25,000 ha did not occur; instead, the area declined
from 13,000 ha in 1983 to only 9,000 by 1990, due to lack of financial incentives. The Government's
commitment at appraisal to supportive macroeconomic and institutional reforms did not materialize.
Institutional development was negligible.
An audit is planned.

BLUE NILE PUMP SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
CR. 1118-SU
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Blue Nile Pump Schemes
Rehabilitation Project in Sudan, for which Credit 1118-SU in the amount of SDR 25.1 million
(US$32 million) was approved on March 26, 1981. The credit was closed on September 30,
1992, almost five years behind schedule. It was 59 percent disbursed and the last disbursement
was on October 23, 1990. 1/ An amount of SDR 10.3 million was canceled. The African
Development Fund also provided financing of US$10 million.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of Country
Department II, Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Borrower did not submit Part II.
Preparation of this PCR was started in October 1990 and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report, the President's Report, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.
1/ There was a long gap between the last disbursement date and actual credit closing because
the Government delayed in sending documents for reconciling the special account.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
BLUE NILE PUMP SCHEMES REHABILITATION PROJECT
CR. 1118-SU
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.   The Project was appraised at a time when the productivity of major irrigated areas was
declining, including the production of cotton, a major export crop. This contributed to a
deteriorating balance of payments situation. In order to address this problem, the Government
wished to promote exports in order to increase export revenue, and to increase overall
productivity. One major policy intended to achieve these objectives was the Export Action
Program (EAP), which aimed to increase the volume of cotton production for export by an
average of seven percent a year through the eighties. The Blue Nile Project was one of four
Projects designed to support the EAP.
2.   The project had three objectives: (a) improving agricultural production on about 50,000
fed; (b) improving the living conditions in the project area; and (c) increasing the foreign
exchange earnings of Sudan.
Proiect Preparation and Design
3.   The project was first discussed with the GOS in 1975, and by 1978, a project preparation
report was finalized by the Blue Nile Study Consultants. In line with GOS policy, the project
scope was limited to rehabilitation works only. The main course of action for the rehabilitation
work was to group small minor pump schemes into larger units, each with a single pumping
station. The project was carefully prepared and formed part of an overall plan for the irrigation
subsector.
4.   The project preparation missions considered strengthening of the management and
organization of the schemes crucial to attaining project objectives. In 1979, GOS dismantled the
overcentralized Public Agricultural Production Corporation (PAPC) which operated all pump
schemes. In January, 1980, the Blue Nile Agricultural Corporation (BNAC) was established as
an independent corporation with powers to recommend water charges and administration fees (to
be approved by the Minister of Agriculture), grant and terminate tenancy agreements and allocate
the returns from cotton. Through the project, BNAC was to be strengthened by establishing a
Planning and Development Unit (PDU). In addition, the Department of Planning of MAFNR was
to set up an Advisory Unit for Agricultural Corporation (AUAC) to assist the Ministry in its
obligations towards the agricultural corporations, especially in providing assistance in planning,
programming and other technical areas. Finally, irrigation functions in the project area were to
be transferred from the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) to the BNAC in order to improve
coordination and reduce O&M costs.
Implementation Experience
5.   The main achievement of the project was the construction of two new pumping stations and
new irrigation infrastructure in the Sasheina project area, and the procurement of farm machinery



- iv -
and implements, and incremental farm inputs. However, implementation of the major works was
delayed by five years. As a result, the impact of the project has not been significant. Factors
which contributed to the delay included poor management, inability of BNAC to establish a strong
and reliable irrigation engineering department which was supposed to take over irrigation
operations from MOI, the wide dispersion of the many small schemes and interrupted fuel
supplies.
6.   The establishment of the AUAC and employment of consultants to strengthen the PDU was
delayed, thus affecting the preparation of work programs and the monitoring of the project's
planning and execution. AUAC was eventually established and carried out its work satisfactorily.
7.   Following two years of slow progress, a consulting firm was hired to redesign the project.
The revised project as adopted did not include fundamental changes in the engineering
components except for the inclusion of a new pumping station and an extension of at least two
years for implementation. On the consultant's recommendations and the Bank's insistence, GOS
decided in 1984 to hand over all project irrigation activities back to MOI.
8.   MOI, which was to design and implement the main pumping stations, was also delayed in
its work program due to various internal reasons. The actual construction work did not
commence until 1985, and due to misprocurement related to the pumping stations, the Bank
canceled SDR2.07 million from the Credit. Difficulties were also encountered in the construction
of the pumping stations, because the state corporation that was awarded the contracts was already
handling a large number of projects. Implementation was further delayed and the project closing
date was extended to September 30, 1990. At the end of the project, the credit was 59 percent
disbursed. Total project cost is estimated at US$50 million, about 74 percent of the appraisal
estimate.
Project Results
9.     The project's economic rate of return was estimated at 3.5 percent compared with an
appraisal estimate of 31 percent. The reasons for the shortfall were: serious delays in project
implementation, low crop yields, high operating costs and a sharp fall in international commodity
prices. These were aggravated by a general decline in macroeconomic conditions including an
overvalued exchange rate that caused a sharp fall in the real domestic cotton price, and high
inflation.
Proiect Sustainability
10.   To maintain productivity, efforts by MOI and BNAC should be directed towards ensuring
proper operation and maintenance of the scheme. Measures aiming at full cost recovery of land
and water expenditures should be implemented as soon as possible in the rehabilitated areas in
order to prevent further losses by BNAC. Also operating costs would need to be reduced,
especially for land and water services. Headquarter expenses would have to be cut, and clear
management and budgetary responsibility established for the water service.
Lessons Learned
11.  The lessons learned are summarized below:
- Sustained GOS commitment to macroeconomic and institutional reforms are central
to the rehabilitation effort. However, this is difficult to predict in a country
experiencing an unstable political environment;



v 
- The feasibility of institutional restructuring must be carefully assessed, to avoid
worsening an already difficult situation. In this case, given the time needed to build
a new institutional unit to implement the irrigation works, the project could have
been carried out in two phases: institution-building in the first stage and capital
investments in the second.
- Implementation capacity of the local contracting industry also needs to be carefully
assessed. In this case, it turned out that the number of irrigation projects being
implemented at the time of the Blue Nile impeded its implementation. This was
severely felt, when the construction contracts for the pump stations were awarded to
a state corporation which already had a large number of contracts.
- Greater attention needs to be paid to measures to reduce costs of operating entities.
Design of pump schemes should be comprehensive to include grouping,
electrification, and technological packages, and arrangements need to be made so as
to ensure that surplus labor generated be redeployed.

B. Project Background
2.         Macroeconomic Context. In the early 1980s, Sudan was facing a balance of
payments crisis. It had a large and growing deficit on current account and external payments
arrears accumulating to a level of about $1.2 billion in 1979. The crisis was largely the
consequence of inadequate economic management policies compounded by external factors, such
as the sharply increased cost of petroleum imports. At the same time, Sudan's exports declined,
due mainly to the reduction in yields and area of production of cotton, the chief export
commodity.
3.         To tackle this crisis, the Government of Sudan (GOS) made significant policy
changes to re-establish financial equilibrium and restore the economy's development momentum.
These included (a) financial stabilization and IMF agreements; (b) export promotion and public
investment programs; (c) changes in public corporations; and (d) improvements in the
management of external debt. The Government's strategy was to concentrate on the completion
of ongoing projects and to choose those investments that would most quickly contribute to the
growth of exports and domestic revenues. As part of this strategy, the Government introduced
several policies, including an Export Action Program (EAP), which aimed to increase the volume
of cotton production for export by an average of seven percent a year through the eighties.
Sorghum and groundnut production would be increased as well, but to a lesser degree.
4.         Bank group lending during this period followed a comprehensive approach of
supporting agricultural and infrastructural investments to restore production capacity on the one
hand, and institutional and economic reforms on the other. The emphasis of the investment
projects were in areas that would help the country generate increased export earnings to support
the recovery effort. The focus in the near term was on rehabilitation and increasing irrigation
intensity in existing irrigation schemes, which produced 95 percent of the cotton exports. At the
same time, the Bank supported sectoral reforms through the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program I
(Cr. 1000-SU), which was implemented in conjunction with IMF programs.
5.         Agriculture Sector Development Objectives. At the time of appraisal, agriculture
was the dominant sector in the economy and was viewed by the Government as the key to future



growth and development. However, the 1970s had witnessed a declining trend in the
productivity of most major irrigated areas. This decline was a result of several factors, including:
an expansion of irrigated areas at the expense of maintenance investment; poor decisions on crop
choices (a policy of import substitution which meant diversification out of cotton to other crops)
aggravated by tax and price policies; foreign exchange constraints which limited import of
agricultural inputs; and weak management of public sector corporations. In the Blue and White
Nile areas, these problems had led to a decline in productivity resulting in reduced personal
incomes and an outflow of population from the area. It also contributed to a diversion of labor
input from agriculture to livestock and urban employment. The Government viewed a rapid
expansion in agricultural output and exports as a way to improve its balance of payment and debt
service ratio. It embarked on a program to rehabilitate irrigation schemes where most of the
cotton was grown.
6.          The irrigation subsector was considered to have the most potential for increasing
yields and realizing the objectives of the EAP. The Agricultural Rehabilitation Program served as
a basis for the introduction of four further projects to support the EAP, all within the irrigation
subsector. These included a rehabilitation project for New Haifa (FY80), a major rehabilitation
project for the Gezira (FY83), and twin rehabilitation projects for the Blue Nile Pump Schemes
(FY82), and the White Nile Pump Schemes (FY82). All of these irrigation sub-sector projects
shared the short-term goal of rapidly increasing the output of export crops (particularly cotton) for
ten years or so. This increased output was expected to yield quick returns in terms of foreign
exchange earnings thereby helping to alleviate the balance of payments problem. Medium-term
objectives for the irrigation subsector were to modernize the pump schemes, and to abandon the
unremunerative schemes; and the long-term goal was to tap Sudan's under-utilized hydro-power
potentials to improve the financial viability of irrigation schemes. A study component, designed
to analyze how to meet the medium-term objective of modernizing the irrigation sub-sector, was
also included in the Project.
Proiect Obiectives and Description
7.          Proiect Obiectives. The project had three objectives: (a) improving agricultural
production on about 50,000 fed; (b) improving the living conditions in the project area; and (c)
increasing the foreign exchange earnings of Sudan.
8.          Proiect Description: The project was, over a period of 5 years, to rehabilitate the
Shasheina Region of BNAC and provide agricultural machinery and workshops for cotton
cultivation in the rest of the BNAC area. Specifically the project was to include:
-     rehabilitation of the irrigation system in the Shasheina Region, including the
construction of two new pumping stations, a drainage system and service roads
(US$21.9 million);
-     construction of buildings for administration, workshops and staff housing (US$6.4
mill ion);
-     provision of agricultural machinery and vehicles and farm inputs (US$11.1 million);
-     electrification, telecommunications and potable water supply facilities (US$1.7
million); and



-3-
-    provision of technical assistance and consultancy services (US$3.6 million).
The total project cost including cont:ngencies were estimated at US$67.3 million based on
September 1980 prices.
Project Design and Organization
9.         The pump schemes in Sudan, developed mainly by private farmers as early as the
1950s, are scattered along the Blue and White Nile and cover an area of about 1 million fd. The
decrease in cotton prices and increase in production costs led to social unrest during the early
1960s. Finally, in the late 1960s, all pump schemes were nationalized and were operated and
maintained by the then Public Agricultural Production Corporation (PAPC), which was under the
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (MAFNR). The Blue Nile Agriculture
Corporation (BNAC) was established as a sub-corporation under the PAPC.
10.        The nationalization was unfortunately not preceded by adequate studies and planning.
Thus instead of enhancing the sustainability of the agricultural production, it led to the transfer of
liability from the private sector to the already weak public sector. Tenants incomes continued to
be low and their indebtedness continued to rise. They lacked incentives to produce in the face of
increased managerial and production costs while pricing of their produce and exchange rates
applied to exports remained unfavorable. By the mid 1970s, the state of these schemes further
deteriorated. As an emergency measure, funds from ongoing projects were made available in
order to replace some of the old pumps.
11.        The project was first discussed with the GOS in 1975, and by 1978, a project
preparation report was finalized by the Blue Nile Study Consultants. In line with GOS policy, the
project scope was limited to rehabilitation works only. It was agreed that the project would
include the rehabilitation of Suki and Shasheina schemes (42,000 fed) instead of extending to new
areas and that the Wad Salman irrigated area would be reduced to around 10,000 fd. The main
course of action for the rehabilitation work was to group small minor pump schemes into larger
units, each with a single pumping station.
12.        The project was carefully prepared and formed part of an overall plan for the
irrigation subsector. Its approval, like the White Nile Pump Schemes Rehabilitation Project, was
conditional upon important economic reforms designed to provide incentives to cotton
growers. 2/ The main thrust of the project was institutional and policy reforms, while the
introduction of technologies to lower operating costs and increase efficiency was paid little
attention. In retrospect, the design of pump schemes should have been comprehensive to include
grouping, electrification and technological packages and arrangements needed to be made so as to
ensure that surplus labor generated be redeployed.
2/ The Government had instituted a Financial Stabilization Program which included devaluation of
the Sudanese pound; it entered into an Extended Fund Facility agreement with the IMF that
triggered a number of policy reforms including (1) abolition of the export duty on cotton, (2)
offering a more attractive exchange rate for cotton exports and (3) some measures to build into
the tax and profit sharing systems an element of bias in favor of cotton.

13.        The project preparation missions consider-ed strengthening of the management and
organization of the schemes crucial to attaining project objectives. In 1979, GOS dismantled
PAPC which used to be responsible for the financial management and other administrative matters
of the sub-corporations. GOS, supported by IDA, felt that this arrangement was overly
centralized, inefficient and had led to the incurrence of large debts. On January 23, 1980, BNAC
was established as an independent corporation with powers to recommend water charges and
administration fees (to be approved by the Minister of Agriculture), grant and terminate tenancy
agreements and allocate the returns from cotton. IDA recognized that BNAC was weak in
planning, financial management, accounting, and procurement. Through the project, BNAC was
to be strengthened by establishing a Planning and Development Unit (PDU) which would include
four internationally recruited staff with local counterparts. In addition, the Department of
Planning of MAFNR was to set up an Advisory Unit for Agricultural Corporation (AUAC) to
assist the Ministry in its obligations towards the agricultural corporations, especially in providing
assistance in planning, programming and other technical areas. Finally, irrigation functions in
the project area were to be transferred from the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) to the BNAC in
order to improve coordination and reduce O&M costs. In the past, the responsibility for the
maintenance of the irrigation system lay with MOI while the yearly clearance of the field
distribution channels was BNAC's responsibility. However, the division of labor was unclear and
coordination was lacking. Project designers felt that these problems would be overcome by
transferring full responsibilities for the irrigation operations to BNAC.
14.        There was a clear conceptual foundation for the project which was shared and
understood by the interested parties. The concept was straightforward and was consistent with
the GOS policy of concentrating efforts in the sub-sector on rehabilitation works rather than
developing new areas. The consolidation of small pump schemes into larger ones and the use of
electrical pumps instead of diesel were sound since they would decrease operation and
maintenance (O&M) costs as well as reduce pump maintenance. Once proven successful, these
measures were to be used for rehabilitation of the remainder of the pump schemes on the Blue
Nile.
15.        The respective roles of the executing agency (BNAC) and others involved such as
the MAFNR, the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) and the Public Electricity and Water Corporation
(PEWC) were clearly defined in the SAR and were well understood by the Sudanese officials.
16.        In retrospect, the timing of this investment, as with the investments in the White
Nile pump schemes, is debatable. One criticism is that the project may have been premature, and
that reforms in pricing and marketing and production relationships should have preceded
investments in the irrigation schemes. The other side of the argument, however, was that at that
time, there was an urgent need to increase agricultural production. It was also expected that
policy reforms would be carried out hand in hand with the rehabilitation. However, the appraisal
mission could not have foreseen the political instability and the lack of Government commitment
that affected the materialization of these reforms. When the supporting policy changes did not
take place, the project could not stand on its own.
Project Implementation
17.        The main achievement of the project was the construction of two new pumping
stations and new irrigation infrastructure in the Sasheina project area, and the procurement of
farm machinery and implements, and incremental farm inputs. However, implementation of the



-5-
major works was delayed by five years. As a result, the impact of the project has not been
significant. Factors which contributed to the delay included poor management, inability of BNAC
to establish a strong and reliable irrigation engineering department which was supposed to take
over irrigation operations from MOI, the wide dispersion of the many small schemes and
interrupted fuel supplies. (For actual implementation of physical targets against appraisal
estimates, see Annex 4).
18.         The project encountered serious difficulties from the beginning. Problems started
with a severe shortage of fuel required for pump operation, which was aggravated by the lack of
fuel storage facilities. (This problem was alleviated in 1985, when fuel storage facilities were
increased to 3.5 million liters.) At the same time, MOI did not allow its engineers to be seconded
to BNAC as agreed. Efforts to recruit qualified irrigation engineers failed because public salary
scales could not compete with the private sector for the scarce trained manpower.
19.         During the first few years of the project, little progress was achieved in establishing
the AUAC. It was to assist the Minister in evaluating Annual Work Programs and assessing the
performance of each corporation annually. Furthermore, the planning role which was to be
played by the PDU was unfortunately impeded by the delays in recruiting the technical assistance
personnel by BNAC. This very much affected the preparation of work programs and the
monitoring and evaluation of the project's planning and execution. AUAC was eventually
established and consultants recruited, although three years late. PDU, however, recruited only
one of the four international consultants to be financed by the project.
20.         On the agricultural production side, the cultivation of cotton was to expand to half
the total area in Shasheina, or 25,000 ha. However, due to the lack of financial incentives and
inputs, and the water shortages, the area for cotton declined from about 13,000 in 1983 to 9,000
in 1990. The drought that resulted in a shortfall in rainfed food production also led GOS to
redirect irrigation production away from cotton into wheat and sorghum. Cotton yields fluctuated
but did not reach the targeted level of 5.5 kintar/fd. With the introduction of new farm
machinery in 1983, cotton yields increased to an average of 4.0 kintar/fd. The impact, however,
was not sustained and yields steadily declined to around 3.0 kintar/fd by 1987 (i.e. the pre-project
level). It started to pick up due to the introduction of a new cotton variety and the modernization
of the "Ramash" pumping station. The peak was in 1988/89 when yields reached almost 5.0
kintar/fd. Sorghum yields remained almost stagnant for seven years of the project period and
increased only during the last two years.
21.         Cotton production was also adversely affected by the general decline in
macroeconomic conditions. Aggravating the decline in international cotton prices was an
overvalued exchange rate that caused a sharp fall in the real domestic cotton price. Also, the lax
fiscal policy of the government led to higher dependence on the implicit (cotton) exchange rate
tax, and the weak monetary stance fueled inflation and eroded the real value of crop prices. At
the same time, food grain prices were mostly determined by market forces. This has over time
shifted the relative terms-of-trade between cotton and food grain prices.
22.         Aside from the slow progress in the rehabilitation of pumping stations, the
breakdown of engines, lack ot spare parts andl inade(quate maintenance of canals were recurrent
problems. Maintenance of agricultural machinery wa, poor and the BNAC was unable to fulfill

23.         As a result of the above mentioned problems, the project status was listed by the
Bank supervision missions in 1983 as having "major problems." A consultant firm was thus
engaged to pinpoint the weak areas of the project and to recast project targets, components, and
implementation schedule. The revised project as adopted did not include fundamental changes in
the engineering components except for the inclusion of a new pumping station and an extension of
at least two years for implementation. On the consultant's recommendations and the Bank's
insistence, GOS decided in 1984 to hand over all project irrigation activities to MOI.
24.         The revised project design still indicated a favorable economic rate of return (25
percent against 31 percent at appraisal), provided that a number of fundamental changes in the
organization and operation of BNAC were implemented. It was recommended that BNAC: (a)
concentrate on potentially productive schemes; (b) simplify its activities and confine to cotton
production; (c) control its finances and operate on a commercial basis; (d) attain full cost recovery
by year 5 of the revised project; and (e) introduce a new organization and management structure.
The project closing date was extended by two years to December 31, 1988.
25.         MOI, which was to design and implement the main pumping stations, was also
delayed in its work program due to various internal reasons. The actual construction work did
not commence until 1985, and due to misprocurement related to the pumping stations, the Bank
canceled SDR2.07 million from the Credit. Difficulties were also encountered in the construction
for the pumping stations, because the state corporation that was awarded the contracts was already
handling a large number of projects. Implementation was further delayed and the project closing
date was extended to the end of 1990. The credit was also used to finance a modernization study
for the Blue Nile schemes, which could be used as a basis for designing future investments. At
the end of the project, the credit was 59 percent disbursed. Total project cost is estimated at
US$50 million, about 74 percent of the appraisal estimate. The credit account closed two years
after project completion because GOS delayed in sending documents for reconciling the special
account.
Project Results
26.         Economic Rate of Return. The economic rate of return of the Sasheina Project has
been estimated to be 3.5 percent (for details, see Annex 6). The SAR estimate was 31 percent.
The reasons for the shortfall in the rate of return are: (i) serious delays in project implementation;
(ii) a sharp fall in commodity prices; (iii) lower than expected crop yields and (iv) high operating
costs. If the project had been completed according to schedule, or if commodity prices had
remained at the high level projected in the SAR, the ERR would have been around 15-20 percent.
It should also be noted that certain parts of the project (irrigation structures) have not been
completed, and that the project is not yet fully operational. The estimated ERR is therefore based
on projected future performance, rather than an established track record.
27.         Financial Performance. From the early years of the project, it was clear that BNAC
was incurring financial losses and was a huge drain on the national economy due to the large
loans the corporation took out from the Bank of Sudan. These loans amounted to around LS 155
million by 1990.  ihe corporation did not manage to introduce any effective measures such as
eliminating excess staff, although this problem had been identified by a special committee
appointed by the Minister ol Agriculture, or increasinig land and water charges. Continual
excessive costs and low produLction on ihe schemnes maean1t that tenant debts rose to about LS 66



7-
million by 1990. As debt could only be recovered from tenants producing a surplus, not much
could be recovered since the number of surplus tenants was consistently low.
28.        Tenant Family Income. The widening gap between relative prices of food crops and
cotton have reduced tenants' interest in cotton production. But the high food prices, which were
market-determined, gave tenants with access to water a very good return. Increased food
production in the schemes also helped to ease the food shortages experienced during the severe
drought of 1984/1985. The annual financial return to a tenant with a typical tenancy (5 fd.
cotton, 5 fd. sorghum and 2.5 fd. wheat) increased by more than 80 percent from LS 49,500 to
LS 90,400 as a result of the project (see Annex 6C, Table 2).
29.        Foreign Exchange Earnings. At full development, the project would generate an
additional annual foreign exchange inflow of around US$10 million a year (70 percent from
additional export and 30 percent from import savings (see Annex 6C, Table 4). This compares
with the appraisal estimate of US$37 million a year at full development.
30.        The project had no marked effect on sectoral growth and policies, on the physical
and technological environments and on national institutions. Its only technical achievement was
the conversion from diesel to electric driven pumping station, a trend which should be pursued in
future irrigation development in Sudan due to its lower O&M costs and environmental hazards.
Project Sustainability
31.        Once the modernized Shasheina scheme comes into full operation, crop yields would
be expected to increase. To maintain a high level of productivity, efforts by MOI and BNAC
should be directed towards ensuring proper operation and maintenance of the scheme. Measures
aiming at full cost recovery of land and water expenditures should be implemented as soon as
possible in the rehabilitated areas in order to prevent further losses by BNAC. Also operating
costs would need to be reduced, especially for land and water services. Headquarter expenses
would have to be cut, and clear management and budgetary responsibility established for the
water service.
Bank Performance
32.        The Bank carefully identified and supervised preparation of the project. During
appraisal, the Bank's team members tried to prepare an integrated project that would take into
account the agricultural and irrigation needs of the Blue Nile pump schemes. However, the
ambitious goal of entrusting the corporation with the operation and maintenance of irrigation
schemes did not succeed.
33.        About 20 Bank missions visited Sudan between 1980 and 1990 for general
supervision of the project. Supervision missions were techniically strong with good staff
continuity. The missions adopted a constructive attitLide and enabled several key policy changes.
The Bank's resident mission in Sudan provided goocl suipport and managed to continuously
monitor and supervise the project. In common with Uther pro jects in Sudan at the time, the
auditing of projects accounts was never in complialumc vwith the covenants of the credit and the
Bank was unable to coriect this.

Borrower Performance
34.         The main executing agency BNAC, did not have the autonomy to carry out the
project as appraised. Although the Board was empowered to recommend water and other
charges, GOS continued to fix those rates. Unfortunately none of these reflected the true costs
and undermined BNAC's financial viability. Successive Bank missions tried to change this
pattern but were not successful.
35.         The management and organization weaknesses persisted within BNAC till the mid-
eighties. Senior management positions within BNAC were difficult to fill. Four Managing
Directors were appointed throughout the project period, some of them were not able to forge a
good working relationship with both MOI and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MOFEP). The result was that cost-effectiveness in annual operations, as well as physical
capability particularly in irrigation management, was lacking and crop failures became recurrent
features. This situation did, however, improve when the burden of irrigation works was
transferred back to MOI giving more time for BNAC to concentrate on other activities.
36.         The general shortage of engineers in MOI was also an important element with
respect to borrower's poor performance. This meant that project preparation, design and
tendering were frequently delayed.
37.         The corporation's delayed recruitment of specialists under the agreed technical
assistance program adversely affected the project. Furthermore, the steering committee which
was supposed to assist the Minister of Agriculture in matters related to allocation of resources and
coordination was never put in place.
Proiect Relationship
38.        In general, the Bank's relationship with the borrower remain positive. The
continuous dialogue concerning matters of general application such as cost recovery, and crop
prices to be paid to farmers, was constructive. However, the Bank experienced some stress in
relation with the Ministries involved in the project (MAFNR, MOI) at various times during
implementation (e.g. misprocurement with respect to a pumping stations contract) and with BNAC
with respect to poor project management and its reluctance in appointing technical assistance
experts. The relationship between the cofinancing agencies was good.
Consulting Services
39.         The technical assistance for the establishment of AUAC was largely implemented.
Various supervision missions reported that the AUAC performed well, and the MAFNR was in
agreement that the unit be strengthened and continued, if funds were made available. Technical
assistance provided by the financial advisor for the PDU of BNAC proved effective, but the
recruitment of other specialists did not happen. The consultants hired to conduct the Blue Nile
Pump Schemes Modernization study successfully completed their report in March 1990.
Project Documentation and [)ata
40.         The project agreement for Cr. 1 18-St) was weli prepared. The SAR was complete
and provided a useful framework for project implemientation. However, documents listed in the



9
project file could not be found in the Africa Information Services Center. Data related to crop
production and yields for the PCR were available, though procurement data and accounts were
difficult to obtain.
Lessons Learned
41.         The lessons learned are summarized below:
- Sustained GOS commitment to macroeconomic and institutional reforms are central
to the rehabilitation effort. However, this is difficult to predict in a country
experiencing an unstable political environment;
- The feasibility of institutional restructuring must be carefully assessed, to avoid
worsening an already difficult situation. In this case, given the time needed to build
a new institutional unit to implement the irrigation works, the project could have
been carried out in two phases: institution-building in the first stage and capital
investments in the second.
- Implementation capacity of the local contracting industry also needs to be carefully
assessed. In this case, it turned out that the number of irrigation projects being
implemented at the time of the Blue Nile impeded its implementation. This was
severely felt, when the construction contracts for the pump stations were awarded to
a state corporation which already had a large number of contracts.
- Greater attention needs to be paid to measures to reduce costs of operating entities.
Design of pump schemes should be comprehensive to include grouping,
electrification, and technological packages, and arrangements need to be made so as
to ensure that surplus labor generated be redeployed.
