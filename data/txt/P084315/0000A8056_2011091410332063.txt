                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Project Development Objectives (after restructuring) are as follows:
                         (i) increase access to short-term employment in food-insecure areas (new objective);
                         (ii) increase access to basic social services in poor communities (reformulated objective); and
                         (iii) contribute to building the capacity of communities to plan their development (reformulated objective)
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         This is the last ISR.

                         The Project has been successfully implemented.

                         Project's outcomes have been achieved both before and after the 2009 additional financing/restructuring. With the 2009 introduction in the Project of a new cash-for-work component,
                         short-term employment in food-insecure areas has increased though the provision of cash-for-work to 4,300 people (above the target of 3,000), of whom 57% are women (above the
                         target of 50%). Access to basic social services has increased: the Project has built classrooms to benefit over 6,000 students, has improved water sources for over 54,000 people
                         and has improved roads to benefit about 27,000 people. Also, both before and after restructuring, the Project has increased the capacity of communities to plan their development.
                         One hundred and fifty six (156) community-development plans (CDP) have been completed under the Project (right on target). The recently completed "Technical Audit and
                         Community Development Assessment" mentions that communities themselves report having benefited from the community development process implemented under the Project, that
                         communities feel that they "own" their CDP, and that communities have been able to use their CDP to attract new funds from other donors (Dupety and Islam, January 2011). Also,
                         capacity development of communities has been emphasized through the training of community representatives. The health service component has maintained some medical
                         equipment and has provided training to medical specialists who are currently practicing in Comoros. The urban water system component has financed water systems in the capitals of
                         two of the three islands of the Union of the Comoros (Anjouan and Moheli).

                         Project's cost efficiency has been high. At 17%, Project's management costs are below end-of-Project target of 18%. FADC's management has substantially improved following the
                         nomination of a new Project Director in early 2009. Project's financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and implementation of safeguards have remained
                         satisfactory. An assessment of the cash-for-work program shows that the proceeds reach the intended beneficiaries (Ramasomanana and Razakatoanina, September 2010). The ex-
                         post cost efficiency of community-based sub-projects is very high with economic rates of return in the order of 30%-50% (Rakotomanana, June 2011). However, the sustainability of
                         sub-projects remains uneven across communities. Also, while the two urban water systems financed under the Project are operational, their sustainability remains questionable
                         (Rakotoniaina, May 2011).

                         It is worth noticing that the cash-for-work program and the community-driven basic infrastructure sub-projects will continue to be financed under the Emergency Crises Response
                         Project (IDA-H5720, P120631) which closes on June 30, 2014, and the Emergency Food-Security Project (TF-97191, P121550) which closes on July 13, 2014.
