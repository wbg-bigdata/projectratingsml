Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project objective is to support the development of a more efficient and effective social welfare system. As a result of the
policy reforms already approved but not yet implemented, as well as those to be developed and implemented during the project
period, Latvia should have a modem, fully affordable social insurance and old-age security system. Progress in achieving this
development objective will be evaluated on the basis of the following: (a) improved financial health of the social insurance
system resulting from successful implementation of the Government's reform program; (b) a client-oriented social insurance
administration will be implemented, measured by improvements in cost efficiency, processing speed and accuracy, improved
external accountability and transparency, effective internal monitoring and evaluation, uniform handling of legislation and good
client service, and flexibility to introduce new regulations; (c) private pension plans will become professionally supervised,
financially stable, and viewed by the public as a viable savings alternative; (d) more efficient and effective delivery of social
assistance will occur, including an increase in the number of clients of programs that provide alternatives to institutionalization
of vulnerable groups; (e) high quality and professional policy monitoring and evaluation will become the norm, with
Government and Parliament using applied social policy research outputs in their work; and (e) efficient and timely
implementation of the project will occur.

3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits:
* Social insurance: The component will allow the State Social Insurance Fund to implement the social insurance
reform program. This reform program improves the affordability and equity of the social safety net and also



3
improves resource allocation while increasing public savings. As a result, the income level of the population
should increase. Implementation of most of this reform would be impossible without the proposed investments.
The expected benefits are:
a) After ten years, and given successful implementation, the expenditures on pensions are projected to be
one-third lower than they would have been under the old system (see "Latvian Pension Reform" in project
file). This represents a savings of about 2 percent of expected GDP. This is primarily the effect of
delayed retirement, and decreased benefits for early retirement, but it also results from switching to price
(from wage) indexation of benefits. These savings will be gradually allocated to privately managed
second pillar accounts. By 2005, it is expected that about ten percent of total contributions will be
privately-managed and invested -- a potential increase in national savings of about I percent of GDP per
year. Because of the strong incentives to delay retirement, the system dependency ratio will fall steadily
from eighty-five percent to below fifty percent by the end of the period. At the same time, the payroll tax
rate will be progressively reduced. Implementation of these reforms could raise economic growth by 10-
20 percent over the project period, and even more thereafter.
b) The new organization and administration of social insurance will be significantly more effective, flexible
enough to adapt to future change in a cost-effective way, and focused entirely on serving the clients.
Under the new organization (1) new regulations and procedures will be easily introduced; (2) the time of
clients (employers and beneficiaries) will be saved, with some benefit decision times reduced from days or
weeks to the first client visit; (3) standard treatment of clients will be provided under the law; (4) effective
payment systems will be in place; (5) new accounting and financial management systems will improve
external accountability and transparency; and (6) internal monitoring and evaluation will be more
effective. Fast and reliable public information on rights and responsibilities would be made available.
The new system will also increase the collection of tax revenue.
*  Regulation ofprivately managedpensions: This component will increase old age security by providing a safe
and secure place for private savings for old age. The system should be of benefit to all labor force participants and
their families. The privately managed pension system in Latvia may have as much as I percent of GDP under
management beginning in 1998. This is expected to grow and will reach an estimated 20 percent of GDP by the
year 2025 through mandatory and voluntary contributions. This development will introduce institutional investors
to the capital markets of Latvia. Their appetite for long-term investments will provide the vehicle for financing
options that are not available to local entrepreneurs at present, as well as a supply of local financing for large
projects such as infrastructure requirements. The financing burden of the state government will thus be sharply
reduced. The development of pension funds, with their long-term savings nature, will lead to a deepening of the
capital markets in Latvia.
.  Social assistance: The project activities will strengthen'the capacity of the national government to assist localities
in targeting and assisting the poor, including providing poor and vulnerable groups with services that are more
responsive to their needs during the transition to market. Successful replication of the Kandava pilot will improve
the quality of life and productivity of individuals in danger of isolation, homelessness, or institutionalization. The
project will also support the development of an appeals mechanism that will provide benefit adjudication rights
consistent with Latvian law.
*  Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Policy: In 1995, total government expenditures on social insurance and
assistance amounted to 14.9 percent of the Latvian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but the effectiveness of this
spending is not known. Weak evaluation capacity results in imprecise assessments of social policy options,
resulting in policies that fail to achieve their goals. Improved social policy monitoring and evaluation will allow
policy-makers to identify groups that are the most vulnerable and to design and implement effective policy
responses. Better targeted social policy should reduce poverty and improve the efficiency of public spending.
Beneficiaries: This project will benefit social insurance contributors, employers, poor and other vulnerable groups, pensioners,
Kandava municipality, the Ministry of Welfare, the State Social Insurance Fund, and the Inspectorate of Private Pensions.

Poverty focus: The social assistance and monitoring and evaluation components specifically target the poorest and most
vulnerable populations in Latvia.
Gender focus: Project design has incorporated a gender focus. In the Monitoring and Evaluation component, training
programs will include an analysis of gender issues in transition, and research projects in this topic are eligible for funding under
the project supported Policy Research Program, which should assist policy-makers to assess gender related issues and
appropriate policy responses. In the Social Assistance component, the Kandava pilot center will undertake a needs assessment,
mid-term and final evaluation that will pay special attention to gender issues, including the needs and characteristics of women
in the region, and the development and impact of regional programs on women.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: June 30, 1997 - June 30, 2002
Executing agencies: Ministry of Welfare; Ministry of Finance; State Social Insurance Fund; Kandava Municipality
Project coordination: A Project Coordination Unit was established in July, 1996. Currently, there are 5 full-time positions,
which are all filled. With financing from the Swedish Government and UNDP, the PCU has received extensive training, and
has begun handling complex procurement, disbursement, and accounting tasks associated with the project PPF and project trust
funds. The PCU will be responsible for the timely implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of project activities and will
ensure effective administration of critical project activities. For this purpose an Operational Manual describing the
organization of the PCU, its functions, and responsibilities, and the linkages between the different entities, as well as report
formats and administrative steps to be followed in implementing and monitoring the project is being prepared by the PCU.
The PCU will also be the focal point for public information about the project and donor activity coordination.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): The project Steering Committee will provide overall policy guidance. The Steering
Committee is chaired by the Minister of Welfare, and includes representatives from the senior management of the MoW and
State Social Insurance Fund (SSIF). The PCU will report directly to the Steering Committee and serves as its secretariat.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The PCU will maintain separate accounts and records for each
project component, and consolidate them into the project accounts and SOEs. Supporting documentation will be made
available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. It will also prepare and provide the Bank semi-annual
reports on implementation progress along with a financial statement of project expenditures. The PCU will be responsible for
monitoring the project's financial information, ensuring that all project expenditures and commitments are consistent with the
project's agreed allocations for expenditure categories.
All project-related accounts will be prepared in accordance with internationally accepted accounting procedures. Project
accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing
principles applied by external private independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and
reports approved by the Bank. The costs of the consultant services to be employed for such annual audits will be fully
incurred by the Govermment. Audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of the Government's
fiscal year. The Operational Manual will provide guidance on accounting and auditing to the Government in the
implementation of Bank assisted projects, drawing from information provided in the Financial Accounting Reporting and
Auditing Handbook (FARAH). The Operational Manual will also provide template formats for financial statements,
standard forms for audit documentation, and sample generic terms of reference for audits.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The Steering Committee and the PCU will be responsible for monitoring project
implementation activities. The Monitoring Plan (included in the Operational Manual) includes component perfornance
indicators developed by the working groups which will be used to track progress made towards objectives (see Annex I). The
PCU will ensure that all reporting requirements under the project are carried out in accordance with the appropriate formats
and with the agreed submission schedules.
Semiannual project implementation reports will be submitted to the Bank by June 30 and December 31 of each
calendar year, with the latter also including a draft Annual Action Plan for the upcoming calendar year for Bank approval.
The Government and the Bank will conduct joint reviews in an annual supervision mission on the progress made in the
implementation of the project of each year. During these reviews, the Bank and the Government would agree upon proposed
Action Plans incorporating the results of the process evaluations. Only those activities in the approved plans would be



eligible for project financing. A formal mid-term review will be conducted by the Bank and the Government, where
progress toward all targets will be assessed. Project design will be adjusted if needed. An Implementation Completion
Report would be submitted to the Bank promptly after the completion of the project, but in any event no later than six
months after the Loan Closing Date.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Objective: Improved delivery and sustainability of the social safety net and basic social services.
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Category 4 country, assistance strategy update discussed December 19,
1996, in the context of the Structural Adjustment Loan (R96-246).
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
By 1993, Latvia realized that the social protection system inherited from the Soviet period was: (a) too expensive given current
fiscal resources; (b) inequitable; (c) non-transparent, encouraging rent-seeking behavior; and (d) lacking the flexibility needed
during the transition. In 1994, the Government prepared a comprehensive new set of legislation governing cash benefits and
non-cash social assistance to families, covering: (i) social assistance, (ii) unemployment benefits; (iii) pension benefits; (iv) work
injury benefits; (v) sickness and maternity leave, and (vi) social insurance financing. This legislation all passed Parliament in
1995. In social assistance, the legislation was designed to implement Latvia's plan to decentralize social services. In social
insurance, the goal was to tie benefits more closely to contributions. This required removing non-insurance benefits from the
insurance program financing, placing them in the state budget. Included in this legislative package was the first step in a
fundamental reform of the pension system: creating a new, three tier system with increased reliance on individual savings
efforts (privately managed) for income replacement in old age (see Box 1: Latvian Pension Reform).
In 1996, three additional pieces of legislation regulating the welfare system were submitted to Parliament. The first was
legislation creating the regulatory framework for licensing and supervising privately-managed pensions. Initially, most of these
programs will be employer sponsored plans. However, it is envisaged that in 1998, a portion of the mandatory contributions to
the Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme will be channeled into privately-managed funds. The second was a piece of consolidating
legislation, rationalizing coverage and contribution rates across insurance programs and adopting standard definitions (consistent
with other legislation, including other tax codes). Reduced payroll tax rates (corresponding to reduced insurance coverage) will
be offered beginning in 1998 for farmers, the self-employed, and those over 60 who continue to work. This legislation also sets
the stage for the transfer of the administration of social insurance contribution collection (the social tax) to the State Revenue
Service (SRS). In 1997, legislation completing this transfer will be prepared, as will legislation regulating the assignment of
contributions from the public PAYG system to privately-managed funds (the second tier). Finally, a new disability pension
formula was put in place, harmonizing this system with the rest of the reforms. This policy agenda is also supported by the
Latvia SAL.
Implementing this ambitious policy agenda will be a five year task. Policy-making and administrative agencies need to be
transformed to handle their new responsibilities. For example, in order for the incentives in contribution-based system to
function, individual accounts must be established and maintained by the social insurance agency. This infornation must also be
available to contributors on a timely basis. Regulatory agencies must be strengthened to insure that financial intermediaries
investing pension funds are protecting the safety and security of assets. Municipalities need support to assume their new
responsibilities. The Ministry of Welfare needs to develop effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in order to track
progress towards policy objectives, and to improve the ability to develop effective policies in the future.
Social insurance. The Ministry of Welfare Social Insurance Department is formally responsible for developing policy, drafting
legislation and submitting it to Government and Parliament, monitoring the impact of policy, and overseeing the Social
Insurance Fund. The State Social Insurance Fund is the agency responsible for administering benefits, system budgeting,
providing financial and management information to the Social Insurance Department, and assessing the administrative
implications of new legislation. The SSIF prepares its own plans and budgets and submits them to the SID.

The current organization, facilities and equipment of the SSIF are inadequate to administer the new social insurance laws.
*   Inadequate financial management systems have resulted in no differentiation between Fund assets and liabilities
for benefits and Fund administration to date, and no ability to properly analyze administrative costs.
Accountability is thus limited under the existing system.
*  The antiquated computer system does not permit the maintenance of individual accounts as envisaged by the
legislation. Nor does it allow for sharing of information on clients among offices and across services, slowing
benefit processing and limiting the cross-checking needed to prevent fraud and abuse of the system.
*  Local office organization is functionally disjointed, so that the functions have specialized administrative systems.
This results in poorly developed information and work flows between the systems and with the central office.
Each administrative function is undertaken by an overly bureaucratic apparatus that engages in activities that
frequently do not add value or that are duplicative. The organization has too many levels to operate efficiently,
and system controls are inefficient.
Social assistance. The Ministry of Welfare's Department of Social Assistance oversees policy design, most state programs,
licensing of institutions, and adjudication of disputes over local benefits. Since the passage of the 1994 decentralization and
social assistance legislation, the financing and administration of social assistance and care is divided between the national
government, 26 regions, the 7 largest cities in Latvia, and 562 municipalities. The seven cities perform all of the functions of
both the region and the municipality. Each municipality/city is required by law to open a social assistance office, but the size
and organizational structure of that office is left to its discretion. Institutions are mostly managed by the state or the region, as
defined in the legislation. The social assistance office administers the legally mandated means-tested benefit and any other
benefits at its discretion. Municipalities have autonomy in determining eligibility and assessing benefit levels for the means-
tested benefit within the criteria set by state law.
The social assistance reform is ambitious in its objectives to move away from the highly centralized Soviet-era social assistance
system, towards a system which responds to the needs of the community and individual. However, the design of the system
has a number of shortcomings.
. A national social safety net to ensure universal coverage and facilitate the transition to market is not realized.
Under the 1994 decentralization program, municipalities were granted full autonomy in spending and full
responsibility for financing and administering the safety net. The Government has attempted to address the gaps
in provision to the truly needy through the issuance of detailed regulations.  However, these are generally not
followed at the local level.  As a result, Latvia has an uncoordinated network of 595 local, city and regional
offices, and a mixed provision of social assistance with no guarantee that the poor or categorical groups will
receive equivalent treatment.
*  The new financing system does not encourage the development of community-based alternatives to institutional
care. Multiple financing sources for institutions (all with input-based budgeting) do not encourage the
substitution of community based alternatives for institutional care.
Many municipalities are too small to develop and effective social assistance system. Most municipalities range in size from
500 to 5,000 residents, and spend some 15 percent of their budgets on administration alone. Small municipalities do not have
the resources to provide a full range of services -- in some cases, there are only one or two staff who may lack professional
training. Because many municipalities are so small, branch offices are reportedly overburdened by the services they are
expected to provide, and they are also largely unable to develop new forms of care or service due to the administrative demands
that are placed upon them (municipal staff engaged in means tested and other administration of cash benefits have little or no
possibility to develop a community based senior citizens program). A baseline assessment in the Municipality of Kandava in
late 1996 showed that four poorly trained social workers were serving 124 children in families with severe problems such as
battering and alcohol abuse, 240 residents over the age of 80 and 243 other elderly living alone, 252 disabled adults and 21
children, and 991 children in families with less severe hardships but on the margin.



7
The Government has developed a strategy to address these key institutional development priorities.
*  In the Ministry of Welfare, the two relevant policy departments, (Social Insurance Department and Social
Assistance Department) have both reviewed their activities, processes, and organization in light of their new
responsibilities. Business plans for their development have been prepared.
*  Two new agencies are being created under the supervision of the Ministry of Welfare. The existing State Social
Insurance Fund (SSIF) is being transformed into the independent Social Insurance Services Agency (see Section
7), with a new organizational structure focusing on delivering services in an efficient, client-oriented manner. An
independent Social Assistance Fund has been created to oversee the increasingly decentralized network of social
care institutions and to support the development of community-based alternatives to institutionalization for
vulnerable groups. Both of these agencies have also prepared business plans describing their institutional goals
and means for achievement.
*  The Ministry of Welfare has created a new Strategic Department, responsible for overall policy monitoring and
evaluation as well as for assisting specialized departments to perform their own monitoring and evaluation
functions. A project coordination unit has been formed within the Strategic Department to oversee project
implementation.
.  The Ministry of Finance is strengthening the Department of Insurance Supervision to handle the enhanced
responsibility of supervising pensions.
*  A local government reform program is being prepared to improve the efficiency of subnational governments. The
regional level of government will be abolished by 1999, and smaller municipalities will be consolidated.
Implementation of this reform should go a long way to improving the efficiency of social service delivery at the
sub-national level. Once this reform is prepared, the Ministry of Welfare will propose a new financing system for
social assistance which will move from an input-based system, favoring institutionalization, to one where "money
follows the client," favoring least-cost, community-based solutions.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the.project.andistrategic ch oices T e first str aegic choice faced by the Government
was on the principles, and timing and sequencing of the welfare reform prograrn. The government chose the very ambitious
approach of reforming all entitlements at once. Timing and sequencing was motivated by: (a) the strong desire to decentralize
social service delivery as far as possible (social assistance); and (b) by concerns about the affordability, efficiency effects, and
equity of the system of social insurance inherited from the Soviet period. In reforming entitlements, the Government sought to
create a system which would serve Latvia in the transition to a more open society, integrated into Western Europe, and a market
economy through: (a) separating insurance benefits from assistance ones; (b) moving the responsibility for administering the
assistance benefits to as close to the target population as possible through decentralization; (c) basing entitlements to insurance
on contributions (reducing the inefficiency associated with social insurance); and (d) increasing the role of private and public
savings in assuring old-age income support.
Once the Government developed the main policy proposals for the reform and drafted the legislation, the institutional
development effort began. Ideally, this effort would have commenced simultaneously with the development of policy.
Inexperience typical of a transition economy, combined with the sheer ambitiousness of the Latvian effort, probably caused the
early neglect of implementation capacity. However, the Government has now moved rapidly on this issue. The key strategic
choice has been what kind of agency or agencies should be responsible for administering contributions and benefits, and the
financial management of the separate social insurance budget.
*  With respect to contributions, the Government has decided to stop investing in two separate agencies (SSIF and
State Revenue Service (SRS)), and instead to consolidate all revenue administration functions in one agency: the
SRS. This transfer of responsibilities will occur over the next 18 months, and is also supported by the SAL.
*  With respect to benefit administration and financial management, the Government has decided to create one
independent public sector agency for this purpose, rejecting the alternative of separate agencies for each program.



8
By 1998, the agency will be independent of the civil service, with its own personnel structure, and a new
organizational and management structure will be in place, focusing on client service and flexible, efficient and
professional service delivery. A new financial management system will also be put in place, following
International Accounting Standards (IAS) principles.
To regulate privately-managed pensions, the Government has decided to expand the Department of Insurance
Supervision to include pensions, rather than to create a new agency or to assign the responsibility elsewhere in the
Government.
Major changes in the institutional framework of the social assistance system will depend on the outcome of the reform of local
governments, including the decision on what, if anything, will replace the regional level. However, the business plans of the
national agencies both recognize the decentralization goals and propose increased emphasis on support to municipalities
through training and dissemination of best practice, moving away from the traditional "control" approach of the Soviet system.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  ........
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons rejected: Type ofproject: The government requested a broad-based
investment project, supporting the whole program of welfare system reform. A more narrowly-focused project was therefore
rejected. Also rejected was a hybrid loan to support both policy and institutional development, as the Government requested a
SAL which covered this area (and more).
Guarantee: The option of including Bank support for a guarantee scheme for the privately-managed pension system was
discussed in the Bank and with the Government. This option was rejected. If Bank financing for such a scheme is eventually
needed, it will be considered in a subsequent operation.
Social assistance component: Various options for Bank support to the evolving social assistance system were discussed.
However, development of this system is dependent on the on-going local government reform, since the responsibility for social
assistance has been devolved to the sub-national level of government. The MoW and the Bank agreed that this operation
would support a small pilot effort to develop new program models, and limited training and technical assistance in the Ministry.
Once more viable political units are created at the local level, these models could be replicated with support from other donors
or local funds.
A number of sites were considered for the pilot location. The locality of Kandava was chosen because this area was already
working with the Ministry of Local Government Affairs on consolidation of social service delivery. This pilot then formed a
part of this on-going effort.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
To date, the Bank has implemented a Rehabilitation Loan in Latvia (FY96). The lessons learned from that project (Report
15173) include:
.  Strong and sustained Government commitment to policy reform is needed along with aflexible and active policy
dialogue. Government commitment to social welfare system reform has been amply demonstrated by the legislation
already adopted (including the first major reform of a public pension system in Eastern Europe). The project will
provide the Government with the resources necessary to sustain its commitment to a new, innovative social welfare
system.
. The appointment of well qualif ed procurement and disbursement advisers to the Project Coordination Unit is
important given the inexperience of this new borrower: The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established and
fully staffed immediately after pre-appraisal. Extensive technical assistance and training has been provided to set up
the necessary procurement, disbursement, and accounting systems. The project will provide continued support to
the PCU during implementation.
.   Higher than average resources are needed when working with new borrowers, particularly in loans that include
policy reform components. Project preparation activities included substantial technical assistance and training
programs supported by donor funds (Sida and PHRD). These activities will continue during the project period.
Supervision requirements during the first year are estimated at 20 staff weeks.
Successful projects in the social sectors are usually characterized by (i) a supportive policy framework, assessed by the Bank
prior to project preparation; (ii) a high degree of local ownership, including of project stakeholders; and (iii) well-prepared
implementation plans, with clear and monitorable goals. In this project, preparation activities focused on developing ownership
by the counterparts of project objectives, activities, and outputs. Stakeholders are involved at the local and central levels in the
preparation of all components. All components have developed clear implementation plans with measurable monitoring
indicators (see project files).



10
11. Indicators of borrower commitment and ownership:
*   During preparation, two project workshops were held with all MoW management and staff involved in the
project, as well as representatives from other concerned ministries and stakeholders, to discuss and agree on
project objectives, activities, and monitoring plans. One of these workshops was facilitated to encourage
counterpart participation.
*   All main components have prepared their own strategy documents as part of the preparation process.
*   A project PCU has been established and is managing the project well, including the execution of a special trust
fund.
*   A PPF (US$1.99 million, dated October 18, 1996) has been agreed and signed.

12. Value added of Bank support: This project continues World Bank support for the design and implementation of the
Region's first significant pension reform, which is serving as a model for other countries in the region. The Latvia pension
reform is based on the innovative "notional defined-contribution" approach to public pension entitlement. The Bank is
uniquely placed to support the ongoing reform given our international experience in this area. Especially important is the
assistance to the Government across sectors and ministries to support development objectives, such as the implementation of
regulated privately managed pension options. Implementation of this reform is a complex task requiring a coordinated
program of support including technical assistance, training and equipment.
There is an essential public role to be played in the provision of a social safety net and the insurance of risks that are either
uninsurable privately or that require a national program for efficient risk pooling. No private agency can provide this
type of financial assistance, nor is any other donor agency able to respond in this sector.
This project has attracted significant donor support, with approximately 20 percent of project costs covered by donor
financing, allowing the Bank to serve as the financier of last resort. Most donors active in this area are now coordinating
their programs with the Bank through parallel financing of project activities.

Fiscal impact (for allprojects): Detailed economic analysis was only carried out for component 1 (83.4 percent of project
costs). The fiscal impact by the end of the project period from full implementation of the welfare reform program is expected
to be about 50 million 1997 Lats per year. After 10 years, this impact should rise to about 100 million Lats per year, or about
2.5 percent of projected GDP. Investments in component 1 will result in administrative cost savings equal to the investment
cost after 6.7 years. In addition, benefit processing time will fall from up to 2 weeks, to less than I day, with a lower error rate,
saving clients' time. The automated system will also save taxpayers time, as forms will be simplified and filed electronically.
Benefits to the economy as a whole are summarized in section 3 above.
Cost recovery measures will be applied where appropriate. For example, once the pension regulatory agency is set up and in
full operation, fees will be imposed on fund management companies to cover the costs of running the agency.

15. Technical Assessment: This project is technically sound.
* Organizational changes to be implemented in this project reflect best practice in public sector service delivery
agencies in OECD countries. The client-service principles followed in this design will lead to more flexible and
efficient organizations, saving time of clients and staff.



11
*   The computer solution chosen for the social insurance agency represents a good balance between functionality and
cost. It uses a combination of object-oriented and traditional approaches to data-base management. All software
will be fully tested in pilot operations before implementation nation-wide.
*   The automation and civil works investment programs were designed only after the core business processes had
been reviewed and assessed to ensure that efficient, effective, client service principles were applied. A full
information model was constructed to consider how to effectively introduce automation into the system, and what
were the technical needs. This project preparation sequence insures that the project will not involve automating
manual processes, but will instead use automation as a tool to improve business.
Investment and recurrent cost estimates for the project are based on estimates of prevailing market unit cost (including recent
experience in procurement under Bank-financed project in other transition economies), with appropriate allowance for inflation.
An adequate allowance for physical contingencies has also been included in project costs.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: All executing agencies are young agencies, created after Latvia regained independence. Despite this
relative inexperience they have designed and implemented one of the most far-reaching reforms in any transition economy.
They have benefited from substantial technical assistance and training during this period, which has built strong technical and
managerial capacity in the executing agencies. This has been demonstrated by the high quality of the project preparation
documents prepared by the agencies.
It is expected that the need for technical assistance and training will decline over the project period. However, staff turnover is
always a risk, given low public sector salaries relative to opportunities in the private sector. Ample technical assistance and
training are included in project plans to mitigate this risk (especially important in the IT area).
b. Project management: The PCU has done an excellent job in managing the project to date, despite the MoW's limited
experience in implementing externally-financed projects. The proposed technical assistance and training for the PCU under the
project will help to deepen its capacity to manage more complex tasks in the areas of financial management, procurement,
accounting and reporting.
17. Social Assessment: Social assessments were u dertaken during project preparation to ensure that the project design and
strategy are the most appropriate. A nationwide survey on societal knowledge and attitudes towards social insurance was
commissioned and undertaken in the summer of 1996 (about 6 months after the initial wave of reforms). This survey found a
very weak knowledge base in both employers and employees on the provisions of the new legislation. The project
communication strategy is designed to address this knowledge gap. The effects of new organizational changes piloted in the
Ziemelu social insurance office were evaluated rather informally in 1996. Clients expressed satisfaction with the changes,
including the reduced waiting times which resulted from improved organization. A full client survey will be undertaken in
1997 by SSIF. A thorough sociological mapping of the population of the Kandava region was undertaken in 1996 in order to
design the pilot. This survey identified a number of vulnerable groups who were not yet being served by social assistance
services. An assessment of public knowledge and attitudes towards the newly developing private pension industry will be
undertaken in early 1997 by the Government. The project will support follow-up social assessments of both social
insurance/private pension clients (ongoing) and the Kandava municipality (middle and end of project). To build up local
capacity, training in beneficiary assessment will occur as part of the Monitoring and Evaluation component.

20. Sustainablity: This project will develop the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Welfare and the State Social
Insurance Fund. It is expected to be both cost-saving and quality enhancing. Borrower ownership is high, owing to the extent
of participation in preparation activities.
*  Social insurance: The improvements in systems, processes and facilities will permit improved performance at a
lower cost per standardized benefit. These efficiency improvements, combined with an improved financial
position of the social insurance budget from implementation of the policy reforms, will ensure project sustainability
(see Annex 4).
.  Privately-managedpensions: Initially, the costs of the supervisory system will be paid for by the state budget.
However, by the end of the project period, licensing fees will be imposed on pension funds to recover the annual
recurrent costs of the system.
*  Social assistance: The component supports the development of more cost-effective approaches to assisting
vulnerable groups. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation activities will help to ensure sustainable models are
developed.
*  Monitoring and evaluation: At the end of the project, a research network will be established that is sustainable
beyond the life-time of the proposed activities. The acquired skills and attitudes in the training will be passed on to
new civil servants and will be useful in the future, although it may be necessary to update the knowledge continuously.
The Social Policy Research Program (SPRP) is expected to be continued beyond the lifetime of this project with
increasing support from the Latvian government for local researchers and declining need for donor funds to finance
foreign technical assistance. The need for policy analysis will remain, and changes in policies will have to be
monitored and evaluated. Researchers will be trained in performing social research and the increase in private
research institutes will raise the demand for research funds. The increased supply of high-quality research should also
help ensure the sustainability of the SPRP.

Box 1: Latvian pension reform
Latvia has become the first country in Eastern Europe to begin implementation of a major reform of the public pension
system. In November 1995, Parliament approved legislation creating a new public system for those who retire after 1995
(pensions for current pensioners were not affected).  The Latvian pension concept provides an entirely new formula for
calculating future pensions, one in which benefits are directly linked to individual contributions and to the retirement age. It
also provides for the introduction of funded pension programs, initially as a supplement to the public system.  In 1998,
contributors will be allowed to allocate a portion of their payroll tax to individual, privately managed accounts (the second
pillar).
The new pension system is a "notional defined contribution" one,  It is designed to mimic the contribution-based
pension that would be offered in the private sector by an efficient insurance company. The system starts by giving everyone
paying the social tax an individual account.  As contributions earmarked for the pension system are paid, the account is
credited, as if it were a savings account. The "capital" in the account earns a rate of return just like a savings account. This
rate of return is equal to the growth of the sum of wages on which contributions are collected (the contribution wage base). At
retirement, the pension paid is equal to the total capital in the person's account divided by the expected post-retirement life span
for all those of that person's age. For example, if a person has 10,000 Lats in their account at retirement, and is expected to
live 10 more years, the pension would be 1000 Lats per year or 83 Lats per month. The pension will be indexed, adjusting for
price changes. In the new system, there is no mandatory retirement age and no "full pension." The minimum retirement age
will be 60 years for most participants. But the system provides strong incentives to work longer. Longer working years
reduces the number of payments, allowing each to be higher, and increases the initial capital. The new system includes a
minimum guaranteed pension for all those who reach the age of 60.
How Do the Actual Benefits Compare Under the Old and New Systemns? Assuming that under the old system, the required
quarterly indexation would have taken place in 1996, most new pensioners with full years of service retiring after 60 do not
suffer a benefit decline compared with the old system. For those who work longer, benefits increase -- by over 200 percent for
those who work another 10 years.  Benefits are also larger for those with higher incomes (who in the future will also
contribute more). Early retirees will be penalized. For example, a woman who retires at 55 will experience on average a 25
percent decrease in her pension under the new system if she stops contributing. Those who retire even earlier will suffer an
even greater loss of benefits.  It is expected that these strong incentives to work and contribute will drastically reduce the
number of early retirees.
Macroeconomic Impact. After 10 years, the expenditures on first tier pensions are projected to be 1/3 lower than they would
have been under the old system (see also Block 1.3 and Annex 4). The system dependency ratio will fall steadily to below 50
percent by the end of the period. Provided Latvia realizes at least some economic growth, the affordability of the system
should be achieved.
Other Economic Effects. As benefits are completely and fully dependent on contributions in the new system, a large part of
the disincentive effect of a traditional social insurance tax disappears. When benefits are unrelated to contributions, the social
insurance contribution becomes a tax, and like any other tax embodies a loss of income and utility to the payee. The closer
benefits are related to contributions, the less loss of income and utility the system implies, and the easier administration
becomes. There is always some loss of income and utility associated with a mandatory contribution system, however.
The new system also permits a flexible adjustment of benefits to changes in life expectancy. This avoids the acrimonious
debate over retirement age.   The system also has the advantage of containing one simple fornula which covers all
circumstances. In doing so, it provides a wider range of options for older workers. Anyone over the age of 60 can take a
pension if they desire. Or they can continue working and get a higher pension later. Or they can do both, and get a slightly
higher pension later. Or they can stop working for a while, and then start up again. These options can be especially important
for women (who tend to have greater responsibility for taking care of dependent family members), and those whose health may
be weakening, but still wish to work part time and require limited income support.

Annex 2
Latvia Welfare Reform Project
Detailed Project Descriptioni
Project Component 1 - Social Insurance Development US$ 32.15 million (total cost of component).
This component of the project would help reform and modernize the Ministry of Welfare's Social Insurance Fund by
supporting:
(i) a flexible and efficient system for managing and administering social insurance;
(ii) the capacity of the social insurance administration to manage the social insurance budget under the
forthcoming reforms, including the development of core skills for system pers;onnel;
(iii) a client orientation, by developing during project preparation a pilot in a branch office at Ziemelu to
demonstrate new ways of providing service, evaluating the pilot, and expanding its positive elements to other offices during
project implementation; and
(iv) improved accountability and transparency through better reporting and handling of information, clearer lines
of managerial and financial subordination, and improved control mechanisms
SubcomponentA: Improving Policy Design
This subcomponent supports the design and implementation of strategically oriented policy by the Social Insurance
Department (SID), and to develop and implement the second tier legislation.  It will assist the SID to present clearly and
transparently the strategic goals of policy, to revise the policy strategy on an annual basis, to draft appropriate system
regulations in a timely fashion, and to implement a Business Plan aimed at (a) clarifying the respective roles of the SID and the
SSIF; and (b) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SID's work methods. tinder this subcomponent, the project
will finance local and foreign technical assistance and training, civil works t) upgrade the offices, furniture and equipment.
i.     SID Business Plan: The subcomponent will assist the SID to implement a Business Plan to improve
the organization and management of the Department. It will also assist the SID to implement a long
term policy plan for developing and amending the current legislation.  Technical assistance and
training will be provided to improve the quality of policy analysis (such as through the development
of tools to analyze policy scenarios and trends), and policy formulation and presentation to clients
(primarily Government, Parliament, and public).
Subcomponent B: Developing System Administration
This subcomponent supports the implementation of the social insurance reforms by improving the recording of
revenues and benefit administration. It will develop and introduce administrative procedures that are consistent with
the new legislation, and revise the layout of the local social insurance offices in order to improve client service (based
on the results of a pilot office in Ziemelu that was evaluated during project preparation).  A business plan has been
drafted by the SSIF. Under this subcomponent, the project will finance technical assistance, training and study tours,
some equipment, and minor works.
i.     Contributions recording: This subcomponent will develop the capacity of the administration to record
contribution related information in a timely, reliable, and accurate manner.  It will support the
eventual transfer to the Ministry of Finance of contribution collection functions.



23
ii.    Benefit administration: The subcomponent will help ensure that benefits are administered properly
and on time, within a more efficient administration that can manage multiple benefits and variable
rates of contribution.
Subcomponent C: Supporting Organizational Change
The objective of this subcomponent is to support the ability of the SSIF to undertake its core functions. A business
plan has been drafted by the SSIF, and a preliminary audit and accounting prestudy is to be revised.   A
communications strategy has been adopted and is soon to be under implementation.  Under this subcomponent, the
project will finance technical assistance, training and study tours.
i.     Project planning and management:  This will assist the SSIF to employ new  planning and
management tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its daily work.
ii.    Financial management: These activities will support the introduction of a new financial management
system, including a new accounting system and an improved planning/audit cycle.
iii.   Communication/PR: These activities will support more effective SSIF communication with clients,
and the development of a coherent PR strategy.
iv.    HR Development: These activities will support a more flexible and effective HR system, including
recruitment, staff development/training, etc.
v.     Introduction of Object Oriented Information Base: These activities will support the introduction,
testing and upkeep of an object oriented information base that will provide for the information needs
of SSIF management through a system that requires minimal maintenance, while allowing the
efficient transfer of information and data across regions concerning a wide range of benefit types.
Through improved technology, it is expected that service to the client will improve through much
faster and more effective processing.   The new system  will be designed in accordance with
management requirements. The information model will consist of data 'objects' that correspond to a
particular individual, piece of legislation, etc.  The system will select the appropriate objects and
algorithms for a particular calculation or processing event, and will also process system-wide data in
order to provide information to managers.
Subcomponent D: Supporting Information Technology
The objective of this subcomponent is to support the introduction of hardware and software in order to meet the
automation needs of the new  system.   A detailed draft automation plan has been completed.   Under this
subcomponent, the project will finance technical assistance, training and study tours, equipment, and minor works.
i.     Technology platform:  This will assist the SSIF to introduce a new hardware platform, with
networking within the local offices.
ii.    Telecommunications/networking: These activities will support the introduction of a new wide area
network (WAN) through linkages with the Post Office system.
iii.    Information/programming:  These activities will support more effective programming, including
programming necessary for the introduction of the new information model
Project Component 2 - Regulation of Privately Managed Pensions USS 0.44 million (total cost of component)
This component supports the provision of safe and supervised options for the Latvian public to make personal provisions for
retirement through privately-managed personal savings schemes.



24
Subcomponent A. Legislative Development
This subcomponent will provide technical assistance and training to support the monitoring and evaluation of the
private pension law and related legislation and regulation, and assist with the necessary policy development over the
project period.
Subcomponent B. System Supervision
This subcomponent will assist the Inspectorate of Private Pensions to become an effective supervisory body. It will
support the implementation of an automation plan prepared during project preparation that will allow the Inspectorate

management and supervision of the system (accountants, auditors, asset managers, fund managers, and others).
Subcomponent D. Communication Strategy
This subcomponent will provide technical assistance and training to support the implementation of a program to
communicate to target groups the merits and advantages of privately-managed pension plans. This strategy should
assist in overcoming the lack of confidence that is perceived to exist in the minds of potential participants in private
pensions.
Project Component 3 - Social Assistance Administration US$2.90 million (total cost of component)
The objective of this component is to ensure that all needy receive effective and efficient social services. The project will
improve the performance of the Ministry of Welfare Social Assistance Department in developing social assistance policy, and
the municipalities in delivering local level services. A pilot social assistance office in Kandava region will seek to demonstrate
best practice in service delivery, and disseminate lessons learned throughout Latvia. Under this subcomponent, the project will
finance civil works, equipment, training, technical assistance, and furniture.
SubcomponentA:       Improving Social Assistance Policy Development and Implementation
This subcomponent will support the development of an effective and efficient central level social assistance policy
development and administration through improved legislation, a clearly defined organization, and stronger institutional
capacity and performance of the Social Assistance Department.
i.     Supporting Legislative Development:  This set of activities will provide technical assistance and
training to the Social Assistance Department to implement the plan for legislative and regulatory development
over the medium term outlined in the White Paper. This will include support to develop and introduce the
new financing system for institutional care and simplified benefit system, training for the social assistance
department on policy development, and technical assistance to develop safe and appropriate regulation of care.
ii.    Implementation of a Business Plan for Social Assistance: This subcomponent will support the
implementation of the Business Plan, including the new SAD organization. Technical assistance and training
will assist the MoW to develop a monitoring system for the Business Plan and a mechanism for annual review
and adjustments, implement a program to privatize MoW social enterprises (such as those producing
prostheses) and to monitor the quality and costs of institutional care, develop and introduce an effective
adjudication system, and develop and introduce a training program that assesses gaps in social assistance skills
and supports the dissemination of information nationally on best practice in delivery.



25
Subcomponent B:       Community Based Social Services: Kandava Pilot
The objective of this subcomponent is to encourage the development of a uniform cash benefit system to improve
targeting of those in need, the efficient use of staff, and to develop a less expensive and more effective community
social service alternative to institutions. Technical assistance, training, civil works, furniture and vehicles will be
provided to develop a pilot office in Kandava (in western Latvia) which has been selected as a model region for the
proposed municipal reform, and which covers a population of some 6,000. The municipality will demonstrate the
advantages of consolidation of local administration across all sectors, including social assistance, and will show how
social care can be responsive to local needs and result in fewer individuals being placed in institutional care. The
activities under this subcomponent will support pilot design (including agreement on service provision and financing
plan for investment and recurrent costs), development, facility renovation, staff training and implementation of a
community social assistance center. The services to be delivered are:
(i) a benefit information and payment department will provide a full range of information services to clients on
available cash and non-cash assistance, including the selection and purchase of institutional care, and that will
administer cash assistance. The client base of the department is expected to cover some 900 residents of the
municipality, many of whom receive little or no service today. Four full-time social workers will provide the
assistance.  Of those residents who are already institutionalized, it is expected that this department may be
able to facilitate the return of a small number to their homes.
(ii) a home care program that will provide those in need with limited mobility (such as disabled and elderly)
with access to trained social workers at home (five will be employed by the program). The client base of the
program is expected to cover some 160 residents of Kandava, mostly the very old or very disabled living alone
and with little or no support from their families. The social workers will primarily work to ensure that the
clients receive adequate support to meet their nutritional, mnedical, and other needs.
(iii) a program to support families at risk, which aims to provide a range of services such as support to
battered women, and to children who may be at risk of institutionalization because of parental
unemployment/family poverty, or alcohol abuse. The client base of this program covers some 46 families
(124 children). One social worker and one family therapist will work with those fanilies (perhaps 30 percent)
that may only require assistance with finding employment or other sources of income to overcome crisis. The
other families will be provided with information on and support for options aimed at protecting, for example,
the wife or children from further abuse.
(iv) a day center for the elderly to provide elderly in the community with assistance on problems they face on
issues such as health care and personal finances, and to improve their quality of life by providing social and
recreational opportunities.  A social worker and a nurse will be on site to provide assistance, which will
include support to those who suffer from dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.  Some 25-30 elderly are
expected to visit the center each week.  The day center activities will be coordinated with the home help
program.
(v) a day center to provide rehabilitation and support to the handicapped and support and training to their
home care-givers. This center will provide follow-up support for those who have received rehabilitative and
occupational therapy in a residential center, in order to support independent living, a return to work (where
possible) and avoid further institutionalization. The client base is expected to be a large fraction of the 270
handicapped individuals currently living in Kandava.
Subcomponent C:       Kandava Pilot Evaluation and Dissemination
The subcomponent will support the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Kandava pilot.
Monitoring and evaluation will draw off of a baseline study of the demand for social services in the region and
currently available service provision, and will include the following: (i) establishment of a case monitoring system
and bi-annual site reports; (ii) annual conferences to review the pilot projects; (iii) a mid-term evaluation of service



26
provision; and (iv) a final evaluation including the plan for replication. These activities will be used to determine if
the pilot projects are providing cost effective and replicable services to the region. The subcomponent will finance
local and foreign technical assistance and staff training.
Project Component 4 - Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Policy USS1.89 million (total cost of component)
The objective of this component is to ensure that Government, Parliament and society are regularly informed about the impact of
social policies by developing adequate organizational potential, and human and material resources in the MW to design,
implement, monitor and evaluate social policy. The component will support the development, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of the MW social policy agenda. It will improve the allocation of human and financial resources within the Ministry
through improved internal and external organization and communication. The component will strengthen the capacity to develop a
workable social policy strategy. It will also strengthen local capacity to prepare high quality social policy analysis through training
for the staff of the MW and for researchers in the field.
Subcomponent A:       Improving Local Monitoring
This subcomponent will support the envisaged pilot social assistance office in Kandava to establish a more effective
administrative data collection system  and to replicate the lessons learned throughout Latvia.   It will assist the
municipalities with the monitoring of social assistance benefit administration by providing technical assistance, training
and standardized procedures to deal with revenues, benefits and clients and by avoiding the wasting of resources. After
implementation, the local authorities and the MW will be provided with the information needed to monitor social assist-
ance policy and to evaluate its impact.
i.     Determination of data needs for monitoring and evaluation.  the Strategic Department and the Social
Report Group will determine their data needs with regard to clients, target groups and the Kandava population.
ii.    Standardized procedures: within the Kandava pilot, standardized procedures to manage information on
budgets, benefits and clients will be developed, allowing the municipality to register its records in an easy and
accessible way that can be used for policy monitoring and evaluation. This activity includes a baseline study of
the current situation in Kandava, the development of new~ information procedures, a local data management
system, and data communication management.
iii.    Evaluation and dissemination: after the first stage in the Kandava pilot, the implementation of the tools
and the devices will gradually be extended towards others mtnicipalities in Latvia as warranted.
Subcomponent B: Annual Social Report
This subcomponent will assist the Ministry of Welfare to produce an annual report on social policy for Government,
Parliament and the public (first one to be published in 1997).  This subcomponent will take the form of an ongoing
activity during the entire training and assistance period. It will create a working group that should start working on an
Annual Social Report. At the end of the period this Report will review (a) the actual social situation in the country, using
empirical information from in house analyses and academic research. (b) the policy actions undertaken during the report-
period; (c) an evaluation of the policy measures taken; and (d) an action plan for future policy initiatives.
Subcomponent C: DevelopingAnalytical Capacity
This subcomponent will support the implementation of a training and technical assistance progran for users of the new
household budget survey and other data related to social policy. Users will include the Departments within the Ministry,
research institutes, universities, NGO's and local consultants.



27
i.     Applied empirical policy analysis: This subcomponent encompasses training and updating skills and
knowledge of MW Officials as well as outside specialists in the area of applied policy analysis. It will support
exercises with large survey data sets, intermediate and advanced econometric analyses and panel data exercises.
ii.    Rapid appraisal: Training in rapid appraisal studies on new policy initiatives, in merging data and in
advanced software applications will be supported.
iii.    Seminars: Seminars and workshops on designing evaluation programs, on modem developments in
OECD Welfare States and on evaluating Social Security and Social Assistance Reform in Latvia will be
supported.
Subcomponent D: Social Policy Research Program
This subcomponent will support competitively selected research proposals in applied social policy analysis.  It will
provide the MW with the resources to commission out social policy research to researchers and research institutes, using a
process of competitive tendering, in order to assist the Ministry to improve the quality of policy monitoring and evaluation
activities. The Social Policy Research Program will consist of a dedicated fund, financed out of donor financing and other
resources. The procedures and bylaws will guarantee the policy focus of the projects, the independence of researchers as
well as their academic integrity. Competitive tendering, peer review and academic discussion will improve the quality of
the research.
Project Component 5 - Project Coordination US$1.18 million (total cost of component)
This component will ensure the effective provision of support and efficient management of the project in order to achieve the
welfare reform project goals.

Social Insurance Development
Fiscal impact. This component will assist the State Social Insurance Fund (SSIF) to develop an administration that
can implement the Government's Welfare reform. At present, the main elements of the reform (contribution related benefits
based on individual accounts; increased savings in privately managed pension programs) cannot be implemented, as
administrative systems cannot perform their responsibilities. The main fiscal gain, therefore, is from implementing the
reform and the behavioral response. The non-project scenario, therefore, implies that key provisions of the new legislation
are not implemented.
On the revenue side, the projected 5-year increase of 72.4 million Lats into the social insurance budget comes from
two behavioral assumptions.
*  Longer working life provides more system revenue: given information about the new benefit structure and the
incentives to work longer, average retirement age will rise gradually.
*  Better information systems combined with new benefit formulas gradually increases contributions: Direct linkage
of benefits to wages, including accurate information on contributions provided regularly to employees, will
encourage voluntary compliance. Improved tracking of individual contributions under the automated system
will allow faster detection of tax evasion.
On the expenditure side, the projected 5-year savings of 38.4 million Lats comes from decreased benefits for early
retirees under the new formula and postponed retirement. Other positive expenditure effects from the new legislation (e.g.
price indexation instead of wage indexation) were not considered here, as new information and administration systems are
not needed to realize these savings. The savings to other programs (e.g. social assistance programs, unemployment
benefits, etc.) from better monitoring of individuals permitted by the nationwide computer network is also not included,
although this will be an externality of the project. Also not considered is the revenue effect on other tax bases of lowered
incentives to join the informal sector. If all of these effects are considered, the total fiscal impact after 10 years is expected
Over 5 year peri')d, exclusive of -roject costs and depreciation of investme it



30
to be about 2.5 percent of GDP per year. (For further information, see Fox, Palmer, and Mclsaac, 1996, in the project
file).
IWhat is the most cost-effective approach to the design of the new system?
The administrative reform will be primarily based on the principle of client orientation, in order to develop an
administration that is significantly more effective, and flexible enough to adapt to future change in a cost-effective way.
Client orientation is based on the following three principles,
*  All business is focused on serving the client
*  One inspector handles one benefit at a time
*  All necessary information must be available during the handling time
Introducing these principle will require that SSIF's business be reorganized, new systems installed, the premises
reconstructed and the personnel trained. A successful reorientation should lead to an organization that can handle benefits
in minutes instead of weeks, higher quality and accuracy, and a dramatically more effective organization. Currently, the
SSIF employs about 1500 people, with a total administrative budget in 1996 of 6.2 million Lats, or 1.9 percent of revenues.
During the design phase, three approaches to system improvement were considered for SISA as it implements the
current reform. One alternative considered was marginal modifications to the current organization and administration.
Two involved the introduction of a client-oriented system. These scenarios are summarized in the component working
paper. The costs and benefits of each scenario, as well as the non-project scenario are summarized in the table below. The
alternatives were judged for effectiveness in according to the following criteria:
-  It will permit the implementation all provisions of the new legislation
It will improve cost-efficiency (lower administrative costs per standardized benefit)
-  Uniform handling of the laws and good client service will be provided
-  Effective payment systems will be in place
-  It will provide transparent accounting
-  Effective monitoring and evaluation will occur

system                                     of the country
(for full discussion, including financial analysis, see component working paper).
Key assumptions in the analysis
*  timeframe: 10 years
*  interest costs: not included in pay-off cost. Net present value over 10 years is 0 with 6 percent real rate of
interest for Options 2 and 3. Net present value is negative for Option 1.
*  depreciation (options 2 & 3): replacement /maintenance investments are projected at $1 million in year 5 and $2
million in year 7.
*  staff cost savings: none in non-project scenario and option 1 (more staff will be needed to manually process
information); 550 jobs (net) are eliminated over the first three years of the project in option 2; 800 jobs (net)
are eliminated over the first three years of the project in option 3. Layoffs are assumed to be costless.
* externalities: economic effects such as the time savings of clients, or reductions in administrative costs for other
programs are excluded from the financial analysis, as these are very difficult to quantify.
Based on this analysis, Option 3 was chosen for this component. Option 1 does not yield any cost savings. It actually
wastes money. Option 2 is viable and cost-effective. However, it would leave roughly 1/3 of the country out of the
network. Processing time in these offices would be slow, wasting clients' time. Nationwide cross-checking of individuals
to detect fraud would be much slower, and less rigorous. Local social assistance offices would not be able to tap into the



32
network to check income information during means-testing. More staff would be needed than for option 3, and as a result,
the total savings is not much different from Option 3.
Regulation of privately managed pensions
Fiscal impact. Plans for the development of a private pensions system in Latvia call for the creation of funds that will
be receiving up to 5 percent of covered payroll for all workers in Latvia. From the first year of operation of such funds, they
may have as much as I percent of GDP under management. This is expected to grow and will reach an estimated 20 percent of
GDP by the year 2025. This development will introduce very substantial institutional investors to the capital markets of
Latvia. They will have an appetite for long-term investments, providing the vehicle for financing options that are not available
to local entrepreneurs at present and providing a supply of local financing for large projects such as infrastructure requirements.
The financing burden of the public sector will thus be sharply reduced.
Latvia has previously established a State Insurance Supervision Inspectorate (SISI). Due to the similarity in
the functions required to carry out the two types of supervision, it has been decided to assign the pension fund supervisory
responsibilities to SISI. It is estimated that the incremental cost to the Ministry of Finance to establish the pension supervision
will involve the addition of two staff-members to SISI for an annual cost not exceeding 30,000 Lats. The pension supervisory
system would share the overhead and infrastructure costs of SISI, thus producing economies of scale for both parties.
Cost recovery. Once the system is set up, it is envisaged that a licensing fee will be collected from all pension funds
each year. Once the system reaches maturity, as early as five years from the start, the fees should be sufficient to completely
defray the costs of supervision of pension plans incurred by the Ministry.
Is the component the best and most cost-effective alternative?
The alternative to establishing a regulatory and supervisory regime for privately-managed pension funds is not to do so.
Individuals would have to depend on their own resources to monitor the accounting for their deposits and for the safe handling
of the funds. The risk of financial loss to savers in such a system is high. It would not be advisable under these circumstances
to channel any mandatory contributions into privately-managed accounts, so the pension reform would not be possible. In
addition, the retirement income of participants could turn out to be less than promised.
Another option would be to create a separate agency to carry out the supervision of private pensions. This would be a
more costly altemative than the one proposed. The new agency would require a complete staff and infrastructure, certainly
more than two persons. Such a choice would also magnify the difficulty of finding competent officials to staff the regulatory
agency.
Social assistance administration
Fiscal Impact of Providing Alternatives to Institutional Care. A baseline survey in Kandava region (the pilot locality)
in late 1996 is indicative of the gap in social service provision that will increase institutionalization in the absence of reform.
In this time of rapid economic and social change, the survey found that a total of four poorly trained social workers are
available to serve 124 children in families with very severe problems (battering, alcohol abuse, etc.), 240 residents over the age
of 80 and 243 other elderly living alone, 252 disabled adults and 21 children, and 991 children in families facing less severe
hardships but on the margin. Little is offered these groups other than direct cash assistance or referral to an institution -- only 8
residents receive home care. Successful implementation of a reform requiring municipal payment for institutional care for
residents in state care will mean that municipalities will face the choice of (a) institutional bed-month costs that range from
roughly US$180 per month to US$300 per individual (1996 figures) depending on type of care; or (b) diverting institutional
referrals into altemative care that would roughly cost US$40 per individual served per month, based on preliminary figures
from the Kandava pilot. While it is impossible to predict how high demand for institutional care will rise, a one percent
increase in institutionalization in Latvia would lead to some 120 new placements.

Monitoring and evaluation of social policy
Fiscal impact. In 1995, total government expenditures on social insurance and social assistance amounted to 14.9 percent
of the Latvian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but the effectiveness of this spending is not known. Undeveloped information
systems and skill gaps result in imprecise evaluations of social policy options resulting in policies that fail to achieve their goals, or
do so at high costs. The analysis of social policy before and after implementation provides an instrument for monitoring and
evaluation of social regulations and the resulting expenditures. This component will support the development of skills through an
applied training program in social policy, a policy monitoring and evaluation plan, and the strengthening of local research capacity.
Monitoring and evaluation will provide informnation on different policy options serving as an input for government and parliament
in their decision-making activities. Social policy research will provide the necessary data on the most vulnerable groups of the
population allowing policy makers to allocate the benefits in the optimal way.
Better targeted social policy resulting in less poverty and a better motivated labor force will contribute to a climate
favorable to investment in human capital. This in turn will improve conditions for economic growth and hence government
income. Moreover, improved policy monitoring will enhance policy efficiency, effectiveness and adequacy, which will lead to
easier tax collection and less tax evasion. The non-component scenario would result in the population suffering from badly
targeted social policy activities, a need for increasing the expenditures on social policy, wasting of resources, demotivated Ministry
staff, and a 'brain-drain' from academics initially interested in social research.
