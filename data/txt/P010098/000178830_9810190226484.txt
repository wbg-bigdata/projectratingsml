INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR THE BHAIRAWA-LUMBINI GROUNDWATER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$9.0 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a groundwater irrigation project
in the Lumbini Zone near Bhairawa.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "A Review of Major Issues
Related to Nepal's Development Prospects" (Report No. 677a-NEP) was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1975. A mission visited
Nepal in January/February 1976 to review the public sector investment pro-
gram and the adequacy of available resources. The principal findings and
conclusions of this mission are included below. Country data are shown
in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1974 was
estimated at $90-100 per year and the literacy rate at about 14%. Serious
efforts toward development have been underway only since the 1960s. Develop-
ment expenditures have increased rapidly from NRs 232 million in 1964/65 to
NRs 926 million in 1974/75. About half of expenditures for development has
been financed with external assistance, notably from India, the United
States and the People's Republic of China. About 80% has been in the form
of grants.
4.        Nepal's economic growth over the last nine years has been slow.
From 1965-67 to 1973-75, the average annual rate of growth of GDP was only
2.2% in real terms. During the same period population increased at a rate
of over 2%. There was, therefore, hardly any improvement in GDP per capita.
Agriculture accounts for about two-thirds of GDP and for 80% of export earn-
ings and provides employment to about 90% of the population. Foodgrain pro-
duction has grown at a lower rate than population since the mid-1960's. If
present trends continue, domestic consumption per capita or exports of food-
grains will fall. Nepal is currently exporting over 200,000 tons of rice a
year, accounting for about 60% of export earnings. Some progress was achieved
in the organized manufacturing sector which, however, accounts for less than
3% of GDP.

-2-
5.        This slow growth largely reflected the priority given to de-
velopment of road infrastructure over the directly producing sectors. This
priority was probably an inescapable necessity. When the country began
to come out of its isolation in 1951, it had no transportation facilities
and hardly any trained people to man an administration oriented toward econo-
mic development. At least one generation was needed to build a basic physical
and administrative infrastructure without which a development policy is devoid
of meaning. In that respect, substantial progress has been achieved.
6.        In the past, only 20% of public sector investments was made in the
directly producing sectors, which largely benefited the Kathmandu Valley,
and, to a lesser extent, the eastern Terai plains. The development of the
Kathmandu Valley, where 4% of Nepal's population lives, has been a success
story. New cultivation methods have been widely adopted and the farming
community is enjoying an improved standard of living. With the Fifth Five-
Year Plan (1975/76-1979/80), Nepal is now attempting to shift its order
of priorities and to focus on the productive sectors and the development
of its very substantial hydroelectric potential. Half of planned develop-
ment expenditures is tentatively allocated to these sectors; 30% of public
sector capital expenditures is planned to be allocated to agricultural and
rural development. The basic strategy of the Fifth Plan towards agriculture
is to balance growth with more equal income distribution and regional dev-
elopment. Largely because of absorptive capacity problems, the country may
experience serious difficulties in redirecting its development along this new
and very pertinent course.
7.        Nepal's development is likely to be impaired seriously by the re-
cent changes in world economic conditions. The country has to import prac-
tically all capital and manufactured consumer goods. World price increases
are, therefore, greatly affecting Nepal. As the country is landlocked, it
depends on India for most of its imports, but India developed shortages of
its own. This forced Nepal to import from distant places at high prices
together with very high freight and transit costs through India, particularly
for bulky commodities such as cement. For the ten years ending in the latter
part of 1974 the trade deficit was more than offset by invisible earnings,
mainly from remittances and pensions, interest on external reserves and
tourism. Over this period balance of payments surpluses amounted to about
$10 million a year and foreign exchange reserves were at the very comfortable
level of $139 million in November 1974 (more than 12 months of imports). How-
ever, and largely because of changes in world prices in late 1974, Nepal's
foreign exchange reserves declined to $94 million by September 1975. This
decline is expected to continue at a rate of $20-25 million a year, unless
Nepal succeeds in increasing its foreign exchange earnings and obtaining
increased foreign assistance.
8.        If imports have to be curtailed, this would not only directly
affect economic activity but also the potential for domestic resource
mobilization, as nearly two-thirds of tax and non-tax revenue is collected



- 3 -
on external transactions. Revenue potentials from other tax sources are
limited, given the poverty of the country and the low degree of monetiza-
tion of the economy. In view of its importance for resource mobilization,
encouragement of exports has high priority. Export potentials lie mostly in
the development of agriculture, tourism and hydro-power.
9.        On October 9, 1975 the Nepal Rupee was devalued against the U.S.
dollar from NRs 10.56 to NRs 12.50. Rates for other foreign currencies are
established daily by the Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank on the basis of the
parity rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies. The parity rate
with the Indian Rupee remains unchanged. This selective devaluation was
addressed to the problems of increasing earnings of convertible foreign
exchange and reducing the demand for such exchange, encouraging labor-inten-
sive investments, reducing the diversion of trade through unofficial channels,
restoring the profitability of jute exports and increasing revenues in Hill
areas by enhancing the rupee value of pensions and remittances received
mainly by retired Gurkhas who had served abroad. There can be little doubt
that the devaluation was a step in the right direction.
10.       In April 1975, substantial changes were made in the pricing of
resources to consumers and investors. Consumer subsidies on basic commodi-
ties, such as rice and sugar, which in the recent past were growing rapidly,
have been almost entirely rescinded. In addition a major reform of the
interest rate structure was introduced in April 1975 with a view to in-
creasing mobilization of private savings and rationalizing resource allo-
cation. This welcome and timely reform entails an increase of the two-
year fixed savings deposit rate from 9-3/4 to 16% per annum. Lending rates
of commercial banks have been raised to the level of 15-18% per annum and
those of financial institutions to 10-16%. These rates were introduced
when the rate of inflation was about 20% a year. Inflation has, however,
declined markedly since then; in the 12 month period ending October 1975,
it was 8%.
11.       Development expenditures, including foreign assistance, for the
Fifth Plan (1975/76-1979/80) are estimated at about $670 million, i.e.,
twice as much in real terms as during the previous plan (1970/71-1974/75).
The plan may be ambitious compared to the likely availability of resources
and the country's implementation capacity. Substantial additional foreign
assistance above the present level would be redquired. Recurrent expenditures
are likely to increase sharply on account of rapidly growing expenditures
in social sectors, especially in education, increased maintenance and manage-
ment cost of previous investments, and additional administrative cost re-
quired to decentralize Government (HMG) services. As in the past, the in-
crease in HMG's recurrent expenditures is likely to outstrip growth of revenue
so that the budget surplus is likely to fall sharply, possibly to a third
of its current level in real terms. In view of this, an economic mission
visited Nepal in January to review the public sector investment program
and the related resource requirements; its report is expected to be issued
in July.



- 4 -
12.       In summary, on the one hand, the extreme poverty of the country
points to its limited capacity to generate resources; on the other hand,
urgent development needs and the expected gradual improvement in the coun-
try's absorptive capacity will lead to an increasing demand for foreign
exchange. Consequently, Nepal's requirements for foreign assistance on
soft terms will rise rapidly. There is also a clear need for some local
cost financing, as most projects with high development priority have a
larger domestic cost component than can be mobilized from internal sources.
13.       So far, Nepal's external debt has been very low.     As noted in
paragraph 3 the bulk of foreign aid has been in the form of grants. As of
December 31, 1975 official foreign debt amounted to only $125 million of
which $90 million remained undisbursed. This low utilization is largely
due to the fact that 80% of foreign loans has been contracted since 1970.
Consequently, debt service was about $1.5 million in 1975 or equivalent to
about 2% of exports of goods and services. IDA's share in the debt service
was negligible. However, future assistance may increasingly take the form
of loans, albeit soft. In view of the accelerated development efforts,
external public debt is expected to rise and, based on the trend in recent
years, may well reach $250 million by 1980, of which approximately 2/3 could
be in IDA credits. The debt service ratio by 1980 is, however forecast to
remain below 10%, of which the Bank Group's share would be less than 1%.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
14.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed
by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($3.2 million), irrigation
($6 million), a second telecommunications project ($5.5 million), a water sup-
ply and sewerage project ($7.8 million), a settlement project ($6.0 million),
a power project ($26.0 million) and a rural development project ($8.0 mil-
lion). The proposed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assistance to
Nepal to $75.7 million equivalent net of cancellations. No Bank loan has
been made to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal (US$3.2 million)
in a hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank Group operations as of May 31, 1976 and notes on the execution
of ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain delays in the implementation of
these projects, particularly during the initial periods. These delays are
largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities. In
order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical
assistance is being given in the form of inputs of staff time in Washington,
from our Resident Mission in Kathmandu, and during frequent missions to Nepal.
As a result, improvements in the rate of disbursements are being realized.
During the first eleven months of FY 76, $2.5 million were disbursed compared
to $4.3 million disbursed during the previous six years. Moreover, there is
scope for substantial further improvement.



- 5 -
15.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so, far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of, external assis-
tance. This is due to the country's limited absorptive capacity, affecting
the rate of project preparation and implementation. The Bank has, there-
fore, agreed with HMG to assist it in project preparation, particularly by
acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance projects
in the current UNDP Five-Year Program, which coincides with Nepal's Fifth
Five Year Development Plan.
16.       The Bank Group's objectives in Nepal reflect the country's needs:
(a) to place major emphasis upon directly producing sectors, particularly
agriculture, and increasing food production; and (b) to continue assistance
for the development of complementary infrastructure -- including feeder
roads--to support other development expenditures, facilities to expedite
communications (particularly between the Hills and the Terai), and addi-
tional hydroelectric capacity to meet the forecasted increase in demand for
energy for agricultural and industrial development.
17.       Preparation work is being carried out for a number of projects,
including a third irrigation project, a DFC project, a feeder roads project,
and a technical assistance project. In view of the institutional constraints
and shortage of trained personnel in Nepal, technical assistance and training
would be an important element in the proposed project as well as in future
projects.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN NEPAL
18.       As indicated in paragraph 4 above, Nepal's economy depends heavily
on agriculture. However, out of two million hectares of cultivated land
only 260,000 ha (13%) are irrigated. Paddy, the main crop, covers 51% of
cropped area; maize 19%; wheat and other cereals 16%; and other crops
including oilseeds, pulses, jute, potatoes, sugarcane, tobacco and horti-
cultural crops 14%. Livestock accounts for 22% of the agricultural output
and contributes an important part of the farmer's subsistence diet, and
in many Hill areas provides the only source of cash income. Forests cover
some 46,000 km2 or about one-third of the country. Terai forests, covering
about 820,000 ha, are the most significant economically. All forest land is
owned by HMG, and the Ministry of Forest is responsible for forest management
and forest industries.
19.       Agriculture is still mainly characterized by subsistence farming.
In spite of HMG efforts in recent years, the increase in agricultural pro-
duction during the last decade has fallen behind population growth, result-
ing in decreased exportable surpluses, mainly rice, and foodgrain deficits
may appear by the turn of the decade, unless agricultural production is
increased at a higher rate. The major development constraints include



- 6 -
inadequate irrigation and drainage facilities, the low level of agri-
cultural inputs and shortage of trained manpower. In order to increase
food production, HMG is giving high priority to the development of quick
yielding irrigation projects accompanied by improvement of inputs and ex-
tension services. The Terai offers the greatest potential for such develop-
ment.
20.       Because of physical conditions, conventional surface irrigation
development in Nepal has been slow; sedimentation is heavy and only small
areas can be commanded by gravity diversions between the foothills and the
Indian border. Also, to permit year-round irrigation, storage is required
to supplement the natural river flows during the dry season. Though of
recent origin in Nepal, the development of groundwater irrigation has pro-
mising prospects in the Terai plains. Most of the Terai is underlain by
a groundwater aquifer which drains the underground flows from the foothills
to the Ganges River. These can be quickly developed and put to use without
the need to develop major works normally involved in surface water develop-
ment requiring long gestation periods. However, in view of the high
operating costs (energy, pumps, motors and well) costs must be control-
led, water used efficiently, and productivity raised through the provision
of necessary inputs and extension services. This also requires effective
management of the individual wells, including the organization of the farmers
using each well. Extension, provided by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and
Irrigation (MFAI), is weak, reflecting lack of staff and training, limited
research and lack of facilities. Extension at the farm level is carried out
by Junior Technical Assistants and Panchayat Level Agricultural Assistants
supervised by Junior Technicians and District Agricultural Development
Officers. MFAI receives support in extension and research from a number of
external agencies including USAID, UNDP and IDA.
21.       The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN), established
in 1967, provides institutional agricultural credit directly to large farmers
and, through guided cooperatives or guided village committees, to small
farmers. The Agricultural Inputs Corporation provides farming inputs, while
the Agricultural Food Corporation buys rice from farmers. Surplus rice is
exported by the recently established Rice Exporting Companies. Inadequate
storage and transportation are major marketing constraints. ADBN and the far-
mers cooperatives undertake the construction and management of storage facil-
ities while the Roads Department is in charge of planning, construction, and
maintenance of roads down to the village level. Village roads, tracks and
canal roads are the responsibility of local Panchayats (local governments).
22.       The Ministry of Land Reform is responsible for the implementation
of the two land reform acts of 1959 and 1964 which fixed ceilings for
ownership and provided for the sale of surplus land. In the Terai the
ceiling is 16.4 ha. The Ministry is also responsible for cadastral surveys
and land classification for the purposes of tax assessment.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The proposed project would be the second IDA project for the devel-
opment of irrigation in Nepal; the first is the Birganj Irrigation Project
(Credit No. 373 of April 18, 1973) which includes the irrigation of 28,700 ha
by surface water and 2,700 ha by tubewells. Implementation of the Project
encountered initial delays, but present progress is satisfactory and the
Project is expected to be completed by mid 1978 as originally scheduled. The
proposed project is based on a feasibility report prepared by consultants
(Tahal Engineers Ltd., Israel) financed under Credit No. 373, and on the
findings of an appraisal mission in November/December 1975. Negotiations were
held in Washington in May 1976. HMG was represented by a delegation led by
Mr. B. K. Pradhan, Director General, Department of Irrigation, Hydrology and
Meteorology, MFAI. A report entitled "Nepal-Appraisal of the Bhairawa-Lumbini
Groundwater Project" (Report No. 1093a - NEP, dated June 17, 1976) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
24.       The proposed project would involve the construction of 63 tube-
wells, each with a storage reservoir, and associated irrigation and drain-
age networks to permit year round irrigation of 7,500 ha, near Bhairawa in
the Western Terai, which are now limited to the production of one crop per
year under rainfed conditions during the monsoon season. In addition, the
project would include the construction and improvement of village roads,
the construction of 11 kV transmission systems to electrify the wells, the
provision of additional grain storage capacity, strengthening of the agri-
cultural support services -- particularly the extension service and the pro-
vision of agricultural production credit -- a feasibility study for another
tubewell project in adjacent areas and a study of irrigation water charges
in Nepal with the view to recommending their future levels.
Organization and Implementation
25.       The implementation of the project would be carried out by
existing line agencies of HMG:
(a) The Department of Irrigation, Hydrology and Meteorology (DIHM)
of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation would be
responsible for the topographic survey of the project area, the
design and construction of tubewells, associated irrigation and
drainage networks, village roads, 1,000 ton grain store and
other project buildings. DIHM would establish the Bhairawa
-Lumbini Groundwater Project Office in the project area,
headed by a Project Manager, who would be responsible for
the project on a day to day basis;



- 8 -
(b) The Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC) would construct and
operate the electrical transmission system;
(c) The Department of Agriculture (DA) would carry out the agri-
cultural research and extension components of the project;
(d) The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) would be re-
sponsible for the agricultural production credit component of
the project (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, hired labor and
bullock teams); and
(e) The Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC) would mobilize inputs
to^meet increased demand.
The beneficiaries would construct on-farm irrigation and drainage canals.
Consultants would be appointed to provide technical assistance in construc-
tion, procurement, general administration and operation and maintenance;
to conduct feasibility studies for a further groundwater irrigation project in
adjacent areas and to assist HMG in conducting a study of water charges in
Nepal. They would also assist DA in carrying out agricultural research and
extension programs and in making a soil survey for the project area.      A total
of 235 man-months would be required. All project works are expected to be
completed in four years.
26.        Coordination would be achieved by two committees.    The existing
Groundwater Resources Development Board (GRDB) at the central level, would
coordinate and resolve any policy issues including those related to program-
ming, budgeting and finance. The present membership of GRDB includes the
Secretary of MFAI (Chairman) and representatives of the Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Water and Power, the National Planning Commission, DA, and DIHM
and the Project Manager of GRDB who serves as Secretary. The Order establish-
ing CRDB provides for the addition of other members as appropriate. For
purposes of implementing the proposed project, representatives of NEC and the
Ministry of Home and Panchayat would be appointed as members to be called as
needed (Section 3.01 (c)(i) of draft Development Credit Agreement). At the
field level a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) would be established under
the chairmanship of the Chief District Officer, who is responsible to the
Ministry of Home and Panchayat, and would include the District level officers
and representatives of participating agencies to advise and assist the Project
Manager in the coordination of various components of the project, in particular
in the siting of wells and the organization of water users groups (Section
3.01 (c)(ii) of draft Development Credit Agreement).
27.       The appointment of the Project Manager, with qualifications and
experience acceptable to IDA, the establishment of PCC and the selection of
the consultants would be conditions of credit effectiveness (Section 5.01
of draft Development Credit Agreement).



- 9 -
28.       A water users group including all farmers receiving water would be
established in respect of each tubewell. To ensure that project farmers
accept the responsibility for meeting project charges, drilling of any indi-
vidual tubewell would not be started until potential beneficiaries represent-
ing at least two thirds of the service area had signed up in the tubewell's
water users group and agreed to pay water charges (Section 3.06 (a) of draft
Development Credit Agreement).
29.       Alter completion of construction works for each tubewell and com-
mand area, the irrigation and drainage networks would initially be trans-
ferred to the tubewell's water users group for operation and maintenance,
while DIHM would continue to operate the tubewell. As the water users de-
monstrate their capacity to operate the system, it is anticipated that they
would be encouraged to expand their operation into such activities as trans-
portation, storage and marketing, and eventually take over the operation of
tubewells.
30.       Extension services would be strengthened by appointment of an
Assistant District Agricultural Development Officer and 63 Panchayat Level
Agricultural Assistants, one for each tubewell command area, and four Subject
Matter Specialists (rice, wheat, plant protection and on-farm water manage-
ment), in addition to the presently sanctioned staff of 12 Junior Technicians
and Junior Technical Assistants. Consultants would assist in conducting the
extension services and in training HMG extension staff.
31.       It is expected that the increase in production resulting from the
project would be mainly exported to India through the traders in Bhairawa
and the Rice Export Companies. The Nepal Food Corporation would acquire
a percentage of rice marketed by farmers (25% in 1975) for shipment to food
deficit areas in Nepal. It is estimated that more than 17,000 tons of food-
grains would be available for export annually.
Cost Recovery
32.       The vast majority of the beneficiaries would be small farmers.
Approximately 40% of the inhabitants of the project area have average holdings
of 0.6 ha and average annual per capita incomes of approximately $28, while
16% are larger farmers with average holdings of 6.07 ha and average per capita
incomes of $59. Average annual per capita income in the proposed project area
amounts to approximately $37, compared to the national average of approximately
$100. Although the project would raise average farmers' incomes from present
subsistence levels to close to the national average, farmers' ability to pay
would be limited for most beneficieries. Water charges would be collected
from beneficiaries receiving water from each tubewell starting one year after
completion of works for the tubewell.    Water charges would be fixed at such a
level as to recover full operation and maintenance (O & M) costs from the
outset and would be raised gradually over a reasonable period of time to
recover as much of the investment cost of irrigation works as practicable,
with due regard to farmers' incentives and capacity to pay. It is estimated
that charges amounting to approximately 10% of gross value of production or



- 10 -
25% of incremental net farm income would be adequate to cover O&M including
the cost of energy and replacements, and in 30 years recover approximately 20%
of capital cost at 10% interest. Considering the risks inherent in the higher
cropping intensities projected, charges in excess of such a level would
adversely affect the incentive for farmers to participate in the project. HMG
in consultation with the Association would review the level of charges at
intervals of not more than three years (Section 4.02 of draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Cost and Financing
33.       Total project cost excluding taxes and duties is estimated at
US$13.7 million equivalent, of which US$6.8 million equivalent would be in
foreign exchange and US$6.9 million equivalent in local cost. The proposed
credit of US$9.0 milion equivalent would finance the entire foreign exchange
cost of the civil works, equipment and consulting services plus approximately
US$2.2 million of local cost, amounting to 66% of total costs. Local cost
financing is recommended in view of the country's very limited capacity to
generate resources (paragraph 12 above). HMG would finance the balance of the
local cost of US$4.7 million equivalent.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Procurement of all construction materials, equipment, vehicles and
spare parts would be on the basis of international competitive bidding follow-
ing IDA guidelines. Such materials and equipment would be bulked as far as
possible in lots of not less than $100,000, and local manufacturers would be
allowed a preference of up to 15%. However, small off-the-shelf items costing
less than the equivalent of US$10,000 would be purchased through normal Gov-
ernment procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA, provided the
total cost of such procurement would not exceed US$100,000. Since the timing
of the drilling of each well would depend upon establishment of the respective
water users group, construction of the wells would not be suitable for compe-
titive bidding since any delay in the organization of such groups might give
rise to damage claims. Therefore, drilling and development of project wells
would be carried out by force account. The irrigation and drainage networks,
transmission system, the grain store, project buildings, and roads would
be small, simple, suitable for labor-intensive construction, subject to
seasonal weather interruption and, so far as possible, would be constructed at
times when interference with farming operations would be minimal . These
would not be attractive to international contractors. They would be procured
by local competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory to IDA. To
avoid delays which could be the basis of contractual claims, no civil works
contracts would be awarded until the necessary land or rights-of-way (in
case of transmission lines) have been acquired.
35.       Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported construction materials, equip-
ment, vehicles and spares, 90% of local expenditures if purchased from local
manufacturers, or 75% of their total cost if procured off-the-shelf; 100% of



- 11 -
the foreign exchange cost of consultants; and a percentage of the cost of
civil works presently estimated at 75% if carried out by force account or 100%
of foreign expenditures plus 75% of local expenditures if carried out under
contract.
Benefits and Risks
36.       The major benefits from the project would be the substantial increase
in foodgrain production in the project area, mainly rice and wheat; increased
foreign exchange earnings, employment opportunities to the approximately 22,500
inhabitants of the project area who are mainly small farmers; and substantial
increases in net farm income. At full development of the proposed project, it
is estimated that production of paddy would increase from 8,700 tons at
present to 25,000, wheat from 900 to 16,500 tons, pulses from 170 to 300 tons
and oilseeds from 80 to 200 tons. New crops of maize and potatoes would add
400 and 2,500 tons respectively. Production of sugarcane would remain at
5,000 tons cultivated on 100 ha instead of the present 200 ha. Average annual
per capita income would increase from the current US$37 equivalent to US$140,
with nobody on farms over 0.5 ha in size living below the subsistence level.
Farmers in the poorest groups would have an average per capita income of
approximately US$70 after payment of water charges at the proposed level. It
is estimated that 3,400 tons of rice and 14,000 tons of wheat would be available
for export, yielding about US$1.7 million in net foreign exchange earnings.
37.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 19%.    A
sensitivity analysis shows that with an increase of 20% in project cost, a
20% decrease in benefits and a delay of one year in the realization of bene-
fits the estimated rate of return would still be 11%.
38.       Other intangible but important benefits would include the demon-
stration effect of the project and its institution-building and training
aspects. The experience gained in its implementation would serve in repli-
cating it in other parts of the Terai.
39.       Water from tubewells in the project area is potable and the develop-
ment would help in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases result-
ing from polluted water used by the villagers. No adverse ecological effects
are foreseen from the project.
40.       Project risks considered during appraisal arise from the uncertainties
related to: the coordination of agencies involved in project implementation
and their ability to carry out the project; farmers' acceptance of project
charges; and the provision of the services necessary to enable farmers to obtain
full project benefits. In order to minimize these risks, coordination would
be achieved by two committees: one, GRDB, to coordinate and resolve policy
issues, the other, PCC, to coordinate implementation and assist the Project
Manager in the field (Paragraph 26). Consultants would assist the Project
Manager and participating agencies in implementation and carrying out studies.
Acceptance by farmers of the responsibility of meeting project charges is



- 12 -
being approached through the formation of the water users groups. Drilling
of any individual tubewell would not be started until potential beneficiaries
representing at least two-thirds of the service area had signed up in the
water users group and agreed to pay for the charges (Paragraph 28). In
order to assist farmers in obtaining full project benefits, special measures
to ensure the availability of extension services, agricultural inputs and
credit are included in the project (paragraphs 25 and 30).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of
Nepal and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Exe-
cutive Directors separately.
42.        Special features of the draft Development Credit Agreement are
referred to in paragraphs 26, 27, 28, and 32 above. Special conditions of
effectiveness would be (a) appointment of a Project Manager with qualifica-
tions and experience satisfactory to the Association, (b) establishment of
the Project Coordinating Committee and (c) arranging the appointment of a
consulting firm for the purposes described in paragraph 25 above.
43.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION1/
Credit No. 166  -  Telecommunications Project US$1.7 million Credit of
November 10, 1969; Effective Date: February 26, 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974 - Revised Closing Date:
September 30, 1976
This was the Associations first project in Nepal. In the early
stages there was delay in setting up the Nepal Telecommunications Board,
later converted into a corporation (NTC), followed by delays in obtaining
expert assistance with consequent delay in procurement. There have also
been delays in civil engineering work. Satisfactory progress has been made
over the last four years and almost all the facilities to be provided under
this project are now in service about 2-1/2 years behind schedule. Very
real progress has been made in developing a satisfactory organization for
the sector and NTC showed its first profit in FY 1974.
Credit No. 223 - Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Initially project implementation was delayed mainly due to land
acquisition difficulties and a national shortage of cement and fuel. With
a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project road bridges
and the remaining two of the five porter suspension bridges are expected to
be opened in 1976. All project road maintenance equipment has been received
and is now part of the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction
has been slow due to contractual difficulties stemming from price escalation;
however, workshop construction should be completed by the end of 1976. Bid
prices, although above appraisal estimates, are within contingencies. Total
project cost is approximately 11% above appraisal estimate. In view of the
effect of general inflation on the benefits, this is not likely to affect
the rate of return. The project is expected to be completed by the end
of 1976.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects, in execution and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken. They should
be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purpose to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Credit No. 291 - Tourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of
Cancellation) of March 22, 1972; Effective Date:
November 9, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering
and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope proposed
by the sponsors of the subprojects, the project is two years behind schedule.
Construction of the Yak and Yeti subproject is underway and is expected to
be completed by January 1977. On the other hand, it was not possible to
reach a firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the
Annapurna subproject, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the
original allocation ($2.88 million) for that subproject. The remaining
$1.88 million would meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti subproject and
finance feasibility studies for further tourism facilities outside the
Kathmandu Valley.
Credit No. 373 - Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project was initially delayed by Govern-
ment's delay in appointing consultants for detailed engineering and con-
struction supervision, slow field surveys and procurement difficulties.
Contracts to the value of 20% of the total under the project have been
awarded. After a slow start, present progress is satisfactory. Cost over-
runs are approximately 50% of appraisal estimate. The Project remains viable
in view of increase in agricultural commodity prices, and is expected to
be completed by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior
management and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays
in procurement and the project is at this stage about 12 to 18 months behind
schedule. Good progress is now being made with the assistance of consultants
and experts provided through ODM and present estimates allow for completion
by December 1979, about 6 months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit
of May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
Project implementation is proceeding with approximately 20% of the
contracts awarded. Tender documents for the major contracts have been ad-
vertised and bids received. Because of recent price escalations, signifi-
cant cost overruns are expected. Therefore, when tenders on the major
contracts have been evaluated and total project costs are more accurately

known, the Government will decide upon a method for financing the increased
costs or postponing some parts of the project to the next stage. A manage-
ment team made up of four specialists provided by the British Overseas
Development Ministry is now in Nepal and is assisting the Water Supply and
Sewerage Board.
Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14,
1974; Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing
Date: July 15, 1982
Project implementation is more than a year behind schedule due
to delays in signing and making the credit effective; also due to delays
in preparing bidding documents. Intensive supervision is being provided
to accelerate project implementation. In the meantime, work has begun on
clearing a portion of the existing settlement area, together with procure-
ment and work on preparing the necessary infrastructure (sawmills, work
camps) prior to clearing the new settlement area. A field training program
on the use of winch lorries is being set up.

Procurement
Agreements              All equipment, vehicles and imported materials
(US$3.3 million) for the project would be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with IDA guidelines, and drilling
and development of project wells would be carried
out by force account (US$0.4 million).
The irrigation and drainage networks, project buildings,
and roads (US$4.2 million) would be small, simple,
suitable for the labor-intensive construction method,
subject to seasonal weather interruption and, so far
as possible, would be constructed at a time to mini-
mize interference with farming operations. These
would, therefore, be procured by local competitive
bidding procedures under government procedures which
are satisfactory to IDA. Small off-the-shelf items
costing less than the equivalent of US$10,000 would
be purchased through normal Government procurement pro-
cedures which are satisfactory to IDA, provided the
total cost of such procurement would not exceed
US$100,000.
Disbursements           Disbursements from the proposed credit would cover:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported construction materials, equipment,
vehicles and spares, purchased from local
manufacturers;
(b) 90% of local expenditures for locally manufac-
tured construction materials, equipment, vehi-
cles and spares (purchased from local manufac-
turers);
(c) 75% of total expenditures for other construction
materials, equipment, vehicles and spares (off-the-
shelf);_
(d) 75% of local expenditures for civil works if carried
out by force account, and 100% of foreign expendi-
tures and 75% of local expenditures if carried out
by local contractors; and
(e) 100 % of foreign expenditures for consultants
services.

Technical
Assistance              A consulting firm would be retained: (a) to provide the
project with technical assistance and advisory services
in construction, procurement, general administration and
operation and maintenance (180 man-months), and (b) to
conduct feasibility studies for a further 15,000-20,000
ha groundwater irrigation project in adjacent areas of
the Lumbini Terai, and a study of water charges and
recommendations of their future levels with the view to
recovering full 0 & M costs and a reasonable portion of
capital costs of projects, having due regard to the
incentives and capacity of farmers to pay (55 man-months).
