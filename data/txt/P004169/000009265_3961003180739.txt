KWANGJU AND SEOUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summarv
Borrower:         Republic of Korea
Beneficiaries:    Kwangju and Seoul City Governments
Amount:           US$110 million equivalent
Terms:             15 years, including 5 yearx of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate
Onlendina Terms:  The same terms as the Bank loan, including foreign exchange
and interest risks, plus a 0.05% administrative charge
Proiect
Description:      The project is a logical continuation of the Bank's ongoing
support of Government programs to improve the water supply and
sewerage sector, which includes protecting the national water
courses. The proposed project would reduce pollution in two
major rivers, the Yongsan and the Han, by expanding wastewater
treatment facilities in Kwangju, the nation's fifth largest
city, from 300,000 m3/d to 600,000 m3/d and in Seoul, the
n4ion's capital, from 1.0 million m3/d to 2.0 million m3/d.
It would also support institutional development for wastewater
management  in  the  two  cities  and  promote  innovative
technological and policy initiatives to conserve water. The
Kwangju component would also include a pumping station and
about 36 km of interceptors.
Benefits
and Ri.kE:        The project would reduce the pollution in the Yongsan and Han
Rivers and in the country's western coastal waters. The most
apparent environmental benefit would be removing wastewater
from inner city rivers and improving living standards of the
population, especially those residing and working near the
water  courses  now  polluted  by  raw  wastewater.    Water
conservation studies would recommnd actions to reduce losses
and waste in the cities' water supply systems, decrease the
volumes of water taken from the rivers, reduce the quantity of
wastewater generated and the load on treatment plants. There
are no particular risks in this project as the facilities are
essentially duplications of what were already built and now
operate. The institutional initiatives are in line with the
country's general policy for the sector.  An extended time
period may be required to implement the recomendations of the
water conservation studies.

KOREA
KWANGJU AND SEOUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Population
1.1         Korea,  with  a  land  area of  99,000  km2,  and  a population  of
44 million, is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with 440
persons/km2 (the U.S., by way of comparison, has 27 persons/km2). The country
has rapidly industrialized over the past three decades and the urban population
has grown correspondingly, mainly due to migration from rural areas. About 33
million people, or 75% of the total population, are now urban dwellers. This
rapid growth has been accompanied by a substantial increase in the demand for
water.
B. Water Resources
1.2         Industrial and municipal water demand has increased to the point
where it now equals the annual rainfall run-off and is expected to exceed run-off
by 50% by the year 2001.  The geological structure does not offer sufficient
groundwater to supply concentrated population centers; rather, rivers are the
principal source. However, while these have been dammed extensively to collect
run-off, there is little scope for further impoundment (which now equals about
7% of total water resources). As the amount available for consumption cannot be
substantially increased, water resources must be conserved. Also, because river
water must now be re-used pollution must be subject to stringent control.
C. Water Pollution Control
1.3         Since the 1960s, the volume of municipal and industrial wastewater
discharged into rivers has been increasing at a rate of 7% and 20% per year and
in 1989 contributed 70% and 30% respectively to river pollution. Wastewater from
large-scale livestock farming has also had a significant impact.   Thus, the
preservation of acceptable water quality in rivers depends mainly on treating
municipal wastewater and livestock waste and on efficient disposal of highly
contaminated and often toxic industrial waste.
1.4         The first municipal wastewater treatment plant (WTP) was constructed
in 1976 and during the next decade only four more were completed. The National
Water Improvement Program (NWIP) was formulated by the Ministry of Construction
(MOC) in 1989; it directed over 70 cities to construct sewerage systems and WTPs
by 1996. A follow-up review by Ministry of Environment (MOE), which specified
the type and size of proposed plants in relation to the projected quality of
river water, enlarged the initial construction program which is now estimated at
W 4,100 billion (US$5.3 billion).



D. Sewerage Sector organization
1.5         Development, operation and maintenance of the sewerage systems are
the responsibility of local governments that are supported by the Ministries of
Construction (MOC) and Home Affairs (MOHA).  MOC provides guidelines for the
planning and design of municipal sewer systeme and for setting sewerage tariffs.
MOHA advises municipalities on their organizational and financial planning and
consolidates statistical information on local governments. The Economic Planning
Board (EPB) and the Ministry of Finance determine the allocation of financial
resources and foreign loans to various agencies.   MOE, the key agency for
protecting the environment, provides standards and guidelines for implementing
environmental laws, monitors compliance and reviews environmental impacts of
major projects.
E. Previous Bank Support of the Sector
1.6         The Bank has helped finance five water supply projects and one
sewerage project, and prepared a sewerage sector study (Korea - Sewerage and
Wastewater Management: Issues, Options and Recommendations, April 1988) which
assisted the Government in formulating sewerage sector strategies.  The five
water supply projects" addressed the expansion of water supply in about 73
local authorities.   Four were successfully completed and the last is under
implementation. Through these projects, the Bank has helped introduce corporate
planning in the Korean Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO), establish national
policies for water tariffs, introduce computerized accounting systems, transfer
leak detection technology, improve leakage control programs, and improve the
organization of water supply and sewerage services. The sewerage projectV is
under implementation; it will improve the environment in two cities, reduce
health hazards and continue to support technological and institutional
modernization in the sector.
1.7         These projects were implemented largely by MOC with the involvement
of municipalities and KOWACO. They were prepared up to the detailed design stage
at appraisal. Procurement was grouped into major contracts and institutional
components were directed at improving existing procedures in reasonably managed
and disciplined agencies. The agencies responded to institutional improvements
and maintained the projects' institutional changes after works were completed.
Evaluations indicate that the completed projects substantially contributed to
institutional development (PRAR No. 8174 and PCR No. 10833) and that all project
goals were achieved or surpassed (Report No. 11062 -- Annual Review on Evaluation
Results 1991 -- OED, August 1992); they also state that adequate preparation,
well defined key objectives with regard to project targets and commitment of
responsible agencies contributed to the success. Drawing upon these lessons, the
objectives of the proposed project are clearly spelled out and focus on key
physical and institutional goals. The proposed project is at an advanced stage
of preparation and the actions it promotes enjoy solid support from the
implementing agencies.

F. Rationale for Bank Involvement in the ProDosed Proiect
1.8         The proposed project is a logical extension of the Bank's long
involvement in Korea's water and sewerage sector and represents an appropriate
final project for the sector prior to the planned graduation. While the Bank's
primary role has been to help Korea adopt appropriate technology and practices
for planning, design, construction and operation of water and wastewater
facilities, the projects have directed attention at finance, accounting, cost
recovery and institutional reform.   The proposed project adds an important
element by linking pollution prevention efforts with the need to conserve water
and thereby reduce wastewater. The results will have important implications for
Korea as well as other countries.

II. SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA
A. Proiect Area
2.1         The project would be carried out in Kwangju and Seoul.  Kwangju is
the fifth largest city and lieu in the low-income southwestern corner of the
country, 260 km south of Seoul. Seoul, the capital and largest city, is near the
northwestern coast. Both are important commercial and administrative centers and
place a high priority on improving the environment. In selecting these cities for
the project, priority was given to Kwangju, the poorest among the large cities,
and to Seoul, for its leadership role in the development of the country. Both
need to improve sewerage facilities and are committed to implementing the works.
B. Urban Growth and Economic Activity
2.2         Kwancsiu's  population grew from 483,000 in 1975 to 1.2 million in
1991 and it is projected to reach 1.7 million in 2001. When the municipality was
upgraded to special city status in 1988, the administrative area was increased
from 215 km2 to the current 500 km2 (a large part of which is rural). Nearly
500,000 people are employed, about half in services and the rest in manu-
facturing, fisheries and agriculture. The  city is divided into four self-
governing urban districts (Gu) and 83 subdistricts (Dong). The organization of
Kwangju City government (KCG) is shown in Chart 1 and of an urban district
government in Chart 3.
2.3         Korea's rapid industrial growth in the 1960s and 1970s was not as
marked in the southwest as elsewhere, which left Kwangju and its rural
surroundings less developed and poorer. For example, despite its being the fifth
largest city, Kwangju ranked 14th in terms of gross regional product in 1988. Its
proportion of urban poor (6.4% of the total in 1991) was higher than the national
average (5.3%). The Government has taken various steps to help this area
including providing about W 30 billion annually to support the city's
infrastructure development, including water supply, sewerage, solid waste and
roads.
2.4         Seoul's population of 11 million in 1991 represented 25% of the total
national population; its growth was largely due to in-migration and expansion of
the administrative area during the last 30 years to 605 km2. Seoul accounts for
30% of the country's GNP, which mainly consists of services; the proportion of
manufacturing is slowly declining, as firms move out of the city. Nearly four
million people are employed, 70% are in services and the public sector and the
remainder are in manufacturing.
2.5         The Seoul City Government (SCG) recently began to execute a long-term
program designed to maintain the population at about 12 million and various
measures are being carried out in coordination with the national Government to
encourage greater dispersion of population in the future. A number of Government
departments and units have been moved to other parts of the country. Incentives
offered to industry to locate outside Seoul are already taking effect. The city
is divided into 22 self-governing urban districts and 494 subdistricts. The
organization of SCG is shown in Chart 2 and of an urban district government in
Chart 4.



C. Water SuDDly Services
2.6         Water supply services are managed by the Waterworks in Kwangju and
the Water Supply Office in Seoul, both self-financing municipal corporations
reporting to city mayors. In 1991, the Kwangju Waterworks (KWW) provided services
to commerce, industry and 1.1 million people (90% of the city's total) through
93,000 connections. Average production was 336,000 m3/d or 311 lcd, 38% of which
is non-revenue water (NRW); about 67% of water sales was to residential
consumers, while 33% was to commerce and industry and for public use. The system
can supply about 390,000 m3/d which KWW plans to expand to 620,000 m3/d in 1995
and 850,000 m3/d in 2001.
2.7         In 1991, the Seoul Water Supply Office (SWO) provided water services
to commerce, institutions and 10.9 million or 99.6% of the population. Out of 1.6
million connections, about 88% was residential and consumed 69% of the water
supplied; 12% was commercial, institutional and for public use and consumed 31%.
Average production was 4.9 million m3/d or 450 lcd, 38% of which is NRW. The
system can supply 5.65 million m3/d which the SWO plans to expand to 7.15 million
m3/d in 1995 and 8.15 million m3/d in 2001.
D. Water Conservation
2.8         NRW is attributed to leakage from the water distribution network and
house internal plumbing, inefficient water meters, unauthorized connections, and
other unknown losses. It is believed that leakage in the distribution network
represents a major part of NRW. Attempting to reduce water loss in 1986, the
Government directed the water agencies to include leakage units to inspect and
repair network leaks. In 1989, it expanded that directive to include massive
upgrading of the distribution networks during 1990-95, by replacing old and
defective pipelines.
2.9         Implementation of those programs between 1986 and 1991 gradually
reduced NRW from 54% to 38% in Kwangju and from 47% to 38% in Seoul./ It is
expected that when the network rehabilitation program is completed in 1995, the
NRW would drop to 35% in both cities.   Further NRW reduction would require
expanding activities beyond leakage control to reviews of metering practices and
house  internal  plumbing.    However,  the  advantages  of  reducing  NRW were
counterbalanced by a major increase in per-capita water demand from 1980 to 1991:
in Kwangju, water sales per capita grew from 107 lcd to 187 lcd and are projected
to be 316 lcd in 2001. In Seoul, sales grew from 153 lcd to 283 lcd and are
projected to be 424 lcd in 2001. Thus, past and projected growth indicates that
leakage control must be accompanied by water conservation measures.
2.10        Limited water resources and a scarcity of funds for both water supply
and sewerage agencies means that closer attention must be paid to water
conservation and demand management than in the past. The connection, however, is
only loosely understood; thus, as part of the proposed sewerage project, KWW and
1/    While these NRW values correspond to levels found in developing countries,
they are higher than, for example, in Taegu, which at 25% is the best in
Korea, and much higher than in Singapore, which reported about 8% in 1991.



-6-
SWO agreed to undertake a study that would provide a data base for future
technical and financial actions aimed at water conservation (para 3.13).
E. Seweraae and Drainaae Services
2.11        sewerage services are provided by the Sewerage Division (KSD) of the
Construction Bureau in Kwangju and the Treatment Division (STD) of the Sewerage
Bureau (SSB) in Seoul.   Facilities include combined and separate sewers,V
interceptors and WTPs.
2.12        The Kwanciu system covers 82 km2 or 95% of the built-up area and
serves 1.1 million people or 91% of the city's population, of which about 0.9
million are served by combined sewers and 0.2 million by separate sewers. Of
those with combined sewers, 0.4 million people use traditional toilets with
vaults to store nightsoil that is collected daily.  The total length of the
system is 1,625 km which consists of 1,400 km of combined sewers, 170 km of
separate sewers and 55 km of interceptor sewers.
2.13        Wastewater of about 358,000 m3/d is conveyed by interceptors to the
first phase of Yu Deog Dong WTP with a capacity of 300,000 m3/d, which is equal
to 67% and 44% of wastewater generated in 1992 and 1996, respectively. The plant
is conventional, using the activated sludge treatment process.  Part of the
digested and dewatered sludge is provided free to farmers and the remainder is
disposed of at the city's sanitary landfill sites. Although it is overloaded,
the plant produces effluent of better quality than expected in the design.
2.14        Nightsoil from about 0.4 million people and sludge from septic tanks
(amounting to 400 m3/d in 1991) are collected by contractors and disposed of at
a nightsoil treatment plant (NTP). Most dewatered sludge from the NTP is
composted and sold to farmers.
2.15        The Seoul system covers 395 km2 or 85% of the city's administrative
area and serves 8.7 million people or 72% of the city's population, of whom about
8.2 million are served by combined sewers and 0.5 million by separate sewers.
About 2 million use traditional toilets with vaults to store nightsoil that is
collected daily. The total length of the system is 8,970 km which consists of
8,000 km of combined sewers, 660 km of separate sewers and 310 km of interceptor
sewers.
2/    Combined sewers provide one pipe for both surface water drainage as well
as wastewater which is required to first pass through septic tanks (or
suitable pre-treatment for industrial effluent) to remove solids and
toxics.  To be accepted into public sewers the industrial and commercial
effluent have to comply with effluent quality standards.  Hygienically
superior separate sewers provide separate pipes for each service.



- 7 -
2.16        Wastewater of about 4.6 million m3/d is conveyed by interceptors to
WTPs at Chungrang (which has a capacity of 1.21 million m3/d), Tancheon
(0.6 million m3/d), Anyang (1.0 million m3/d) and Nanji (0.5 million m3/d).
Chungrang and Tancheon, located in the upstream half of the city, provided
primary and secondary treatment for about 85% of wastewater generated in their
drainage areas in 1992 while Anyang and Nanji, located in the downstream half,
provided only primary treatment for 60% of the wastewater generated; however,
facilities for secondary treatment are under construction at both sites.
Digested and dewatered sludge is disposed of at the city sanitary landfill site.
2.17        Nightsoil (about 1,600 m3/d in 1991) is collected by contractors and
deposited at Chungrang and at the NTP at Pukpu. Sludge from septic tanks (about
4,500 m3/d) is also collected by contractors and disposed of at the Chungrang,
Anyang and Nanji plants. Dewatered sludge is hauled to the Nanji-do landfill by
private firms (one for each plant) that have one-year contracts.
F. Operation and Maintenance
2.18        Under the existing organization, the KSD and the STD are responsible
for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  sewerage  facilities.    Duties  are
decentralized, depending on the prevailing function of the system. Drainage
functions, such as combined sewers and the storm water pumping stations, are
maintained by the district drainage units that report to the district manager;
wastewater functions, such as WTP, sanitary sewers and interceptors, are operated
and maintained by WTPs that report to the cities' mayors.
2.19        The KSD and STD provide technical guidance to the operating entities
and, as required by the budgets of the respective units, allocate funds from the
sewerage special account. These funds are managed and administered by the KSD
and SSB (para 4.3). This allocation of duties and responsibilities is reasonable
and would also be extended to facilities provided under the project.
2.20        The private sector plays an active part in the wastewater collection
and treatment activities of both cities. Its major role is to haul digested and
dewatered sludge from the WTPs to the sanitary landfills, and to collect
nightsoil and solid waste. Private banks collect wastewater revenues. Private
contractors are also employed to clean the wastewater and drainage networks on
a regular basis.  In addition, they repair and do preventive maintenance on
treatment facilities (usually as part of the manufacturers' guarantee). Both
cities are careful, however, to maintain direct control of key functions to
prevent  essential  services  from being  interrupted  due to  a contractor's
bankruptcy or strike by its workers.
G.  Solid Waste Management
2.21        Kwanoiu solid waste services are managed by KCG's Environmental
Bureau through its Cleansing Division.   Waste collection and disposal are
decentralized to the districts' environmental divisions which arrange for
contractors to provide the services. In 1991, the city collected about 2,350 t/d
of solid waste and deposited it at five landfills which are becoming filled and
will be closed in 1993. A modern sanitary landfill, about 8 km from the city
center and with an expected life of 10 years, is being constructed; the first
phase is expected to be completed and ready to operate by mid-1993.



-8-
2.22        Seoul solid waste services are managed by SCG Waste Management Office
through its Cleansing and Facilities Bureaus. The collection is decentralized,
provided either directly or through contractors employed by the district waste
disposal divisions. Disposal is carried out by the Facilities Bureau, with no
district involvement.   In 1991, the city collected about 34,000 t/d of solid
waste and deposited it at Nanji-do landfill, including dewatered sludge from
water and the WTP. In 1993, Nanji-do is to be closed and a modern sanitary
landfill will open at Kimpo, with an expected life of 25 years. (See Annex 1 for
details of the water supply, sewerage and solid waste services provided in both
Kwangju and Seoul).
H. Demand for the Proiect
2.23 The demand for the project arises from the increasing water consumption in
Kwangju and Seoul and the need to prevent wastewater from polluting the Yongsan
and Han rivers. The Yongsan catchment area, located in the southwestern corner
of Korea, extends to over 3,000 km2. At its mouth, the river has an average flow
of 69 m3/s of which over 10% is treated wastewater, mainly from Kwangju. This
proportion of treated effluent is projected to reach nearly 20% in 2001. The Han
catchment is much larger, over 34,000 km2, and the average flow at its mouth is
700 m3/s.  The proportion of treated effluent arising from Seoul alone (i.e.
excluding upstream pollution sources) is about 7% of average flow and will reach
10% by 2001. Government policy is to maintain or improve river water quality and
the treatment facilities under the project are an essential component of that
policy.



III. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectivex
3.1         Tho proposed project is intended to accomplish the following:
(a) assist in cleaning the Yongsan and Han Rivers in order to reduce health
hazards and attain the water quality needed for the comfort and prosperity
of much of the cities' population an well as for those using water downstream;
(b) focus the attention of water agencies on conservation of water to reduce
water demand and the wastewater generated; (c) encourage the cities to develop
self-financing efficiency for wastewater activities; and (d) support t-ch-
nological and institutional improvements in the sector.
B.  Dlcrilption
3.2         The project would have the following components:
(a)   In Kwangju, expansion of Yu Deog Dong WTP, to increase its capacity
from 300,000 m3/d to 600,000 m3/d; a wastewater pumping station at
Song Am and about 36 km of interceptors with various diameters;
(b)   In Seoul, expansion of Anyang WTP, to increase its capacity from
1.0 million m3/d to 2.0 million m3/d;
(c)   Znginsering  services  to  supervise  construction  and  a  water
conservation study in both cities.
3.3         The WTPs would use an activated sludge process and anaerobic
digestion of sludge, which would be dewatored and disposed of at sanitary
landfills. The same treatment process has been used in the first phase at both
plants. A detailed description of the project is given in Annex 2, and the
location of the proposed works is shown on maps IBRD 24477 and IBRD 24478.
C. Status of Preoaration
3.4         KSD and STD, the implementing agencies,  completed studies and
engineering designs for the proposed works with the assistance of consultants in
November 1992.   The designs follow Korean design  standards  for sewerage
facilities, with some minor modifications based on the latest experience from
satisfactory operations of similar WTPs in the country. The design standards and
proposed treatment technology are satisfactory.
3.5         The environmental impact assessments (IA) required for both project
components were submitted to MOB in February 1990 and July 1992. The Kwangju
component was approved in August 1990 and the Seoul component in October 1992
with various recomme ndations which were included in the final designs.

D. Cost &stLimat
3.6         The project would cost an estimated W 391.2 billion  (US$508.1
million), including taxes estimated at US$41.9 million quivalent. The foreign
currency requirement is estimated at W 146.9 billion (US$190.7 million) or 37.5%
of the total. The construction supervision and water conservation studies are
expected to require a total of 2,600 person-months to be providod by local
consultants.
3.7         Base costs reflect *nd-1992 price levels. Physical contingencies are
estimated at US$21.8 million or 5% of base costs.  Price contingencies are
estimated at US$50.0 million, or about 11% of base cost plus physical
contingencies, and assum the following annual rates of inflation: For local
coots, 6% for 1993, 5.5% for 1994 and 5% thereafter; and for foreign costs, 3.7%
for 1993 and thereafter. Cost estimates are based on detailed designs and bids
received for on-going civil works and equipment. The cost estimates are shown
in Annex 3 and suzmarized in Table 3.1.

excluding interest during construction. At the Government's request, the Bank
loan would finance only materials and euipment. Civil works and project support
would be financed locally through a U8S$32.5 million loan from the Regional

3.9         The borrower would be the Republic of Korea. The proposed Bank loan
would be for 15 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The loan would be onlent in amount. of US$30 million and
US$80 million to the Kwangju City government (KRG) and the Seoul City Government
(SCG), respectively, on the same terms as the Bank loan, including the foreign
exchange and interest risks, plus 0.05% administrative charge. The execution of
Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the government and the Kwangju and Seoul City
governments would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. Separate
project agreements would be executed between the Bank and the cities with
covenants on operational, financial and monitoring aspects as well as carrying
out the water conservation investigation (para 3.13).
F. Implementation
3.10        The KSD and STD would implement the project.  For construction
supervision they would be supported by the cities' Construction Bureaus, assisted
by  consultants.    Their  duties  would  include  ensuring  compliance  with
specifications for works and goods, adhering to construction schedules, testing
and commissioning of completed works, advising on training of staff to operate
completed facilities, and preparing progress and other reports required for
carrying out the works. Consultants will be appointed in July 1993 in Kwangju
and were already appointed in December 1992 in Seoul by Construction Bureaus
through local bidding procedures. The project would run from 1992 to 1996. The
implementation schedule (Annex 4) is considered realistic as it is based on the
I/    Land developers contribute to construction of a municipal wastewater
treatment plant instead of constructing separate facilities for individual
estato-.

experience and performance of both implementing agencies which recently
constructed similar works.
3.11        In Kwangju, civil works  would be divided into four contracts, one
for the Yu Deog Dong WTP, another for the pumping station at Song Am, and two for
the interceptors. Civil works for the WTP would start in July 1993; the single
contract for manufacturing and installing equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding (ICB) in July 1994 with construction and
test operation scheduled to be completed by December 1996. Construction of
interceptors would be carried out from July 1993 to December 1996. The pumping
station would be constructed from July 1994 to June 1995; the contract for
equipment and installation would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding (LCB) in August 1994 and completed in June 1995.
3.12        In Seoul, the construction of the Anyang WTP would include one civil
works and one equipment contract.  The civil works contract was awarded in
December 1992; manufacturing and installing equipment, to be covered under one
contract, would be awarded on the basis of ICB in June 1993 with construction and
test operation of one half of the WTP scheduled to be completed in December 1995
and the remainder in December 1996.
3.13        The water conservation study would be carried out by Kwangju and
Seoul Waterworks. The study would have three phases: (a) designing the study and
preparing study areas, to be completed by December 1993; (b) gathering data, from
January 1994-December 1995; and (c) preparing the final report with
recommendations, including evaluation of the data and design of an action plan
for implementation, to be completed by July 1996. Financing of the study would
be included in the water conservation program of both Waterworks. The two agreed
to the outline of the study, which was completed with assistance from UNDP
(project GLO/91/017) in September 19925 it is available in the project file.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the KCG and SCG would cause
their Waterworks to (a) carry out the water conservation investigations from
April 1993 through December 1995; (b) provide the Bank with semi-annual reports
on the study progress and (c) complete the final report on the study and submit
it to the Bank by July 1996.
G.  Land Acauisition
3.14        In Kwangju, land for the second phase of the treatment plant and the
pumping station is being procured by the KSD. The 20.2 ha required for the plant
are agricultural and owned by 88 individuals.  The 2.9 ha required for the
pumping station are partly agricultural and have four owners (2.3 ha) while the
remaining 0.6 ha are public and Goverrment land.
3.15        Land for the plant was also occupied by a village with 36 households
which all vacated their former houses; 35 have been compensated and have moved
into apartments provided by the city as part of the compensation package.
Compensation of the remaining houseowner and of the land for the WTP and the
pumping station is to be completed in October 1993; this is acceptable with
respect to the construction schedule.



- 13 -
3.16        In Seoul,  the land for the plant is within the river-land  '
expropriated by the Government without compensation in 1971. In 1983, the
Government agreed that under certain conditions former owners can be compensated.
The Kangseo district has been processing compensation of the river-land laying
within its jurisdiction, including 46.6 ha of land required for WTP. Since the
land belongs to the Government, the compensation process would have no impact on
construction schedule. About 16 farmers currently cultivating about 29.4 ha of
the land were given notices about the proposed use of the land; STD took
possession of the land in December 1992, after the harvest, to keep crop
compensation to a minimum.
3.17        The  cities'  actions  followed the  guidelines  in Korea's  land
compensation law and are satisfactory. The law as well as the documents on land
acquisition are available in the project file.  Detailed status is shown in
Annex 10.
H. Procurement
3.18        The project would be implamented through five civil works and three
supply contracts. All civil works (US$238.7 million) and implementation support
(US$13.4 million) would be locally financed and procured under LCB procedures
which are acceptable to the Bank.
3.19        The bulk of equipment, totaling about US$208.0 million, would be
procured through ICB, following Bank guidelines.  Also in accord with Bank
guidelines, a preference margin equal to the amount of the customs duties or 15%
of the C.I.F. bid price (whichever is lower) would be allowed for domestic goods
for bid evaluation. Various materials' contracts, not exceeding US$300,000 each
and totalling about US$3.0 million for both components, would be procured through
LCB procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Prior Bank review would be
needed for goods contracts over US$1.0 million each, which would include about
98%  of the value of  Bank-financed equipment.   The proposed procurement
arrangements are shown in Table 3.3.

3.20        The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against either 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials, 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment and materials,
or 65% of local expenditure. for other equipment and materials procured locally.
Disbursement for equipment contracts of US$1.0 million or less would be made on
the basis of a Statement of Zxpenditures (803). Supporting documentation for
these expenditures would be retained by the cities' implementing agencies, made
available for review by Bank supervision missions, and regularly audited by
independent auditors (para 4.7). Two IBRD special accounts of US$3.0 million and
US$7.0 million (representing an estimated average of three months'
disbursements), would be established by Kwangju and Seoul Citieu, respectively,
at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank to facilitate loan disbursement
against eligible expenditures. The IBRD special accounts would be replenished
monthly or whenever the available balance in the accounts dropped below 50% of
the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
3.21        Project implementation would extend over five years.  The Bank loan
would be disbursed in four and half year period, which is the time allocated in
the project schedule for manufacture and installation of the Bank-financed
equipment. Project works are expected to be in operation by the end of 1996 in
both project cities but payments may be extended through 1997. The loan closing
date would therefore be December 1997. A schedule of estimAted disbursements as
well as a profile of disbursements under previous Bank-assisted water and
sewerage projects is shown in Annex 5.
J. Environmental Imoact
3.22        According to the Korean regulations, the engineering designs of
proposed WTPs in both cities require that MOE approve the ZIA. The implementing
agencies are responsible for submitting the ZIA to MOZ, including results of a
public review of the project, prior to starting construction.  They are also
responsible for complying with the ZIA's recommendations, MOE comments on ZIA,
and the legal requirements concerning environmental quality standards, including
monitoring and reporting on project activities.
3.23        Kwangju SD submitted the ZIA in February 1990 and received MOZ
approval in August 1990. In its approval, MOZ summarized various measures to be
carried out by KSD to reduce negative environmental impacts during construction
and eventual operation. The standard actions on major construction sites involve
reducing dust, washing soil from excavated surfaces, restricting transport of
excavated and construction materials during peak traffic hours and reducing noise
at night. For operating the plants, MOZ require- that odors originating from raw
wastewater and sludge handling be controlled, noise from the plant be reduced,
and sludge generated during the treatment process be disposed of in a sanitary
manner. In addition, MOZ stipulates that KSD must secure adequate land area in
the vicinity of the plant for possible tertiary treatment if required in the
future; also, that the architectural design, site landscape and greenery respect
aesthetic criteria, and that KSD prepare and implement an environmental



- 15 -
management plan to monitor the effectu of mitigating measures am well as the
plants' performance.
3.24        KSD is complying or will comply with the environmental requirements.
Actions to be implemented during construction are included in *pecificationz for
the civil works contracts and compliance would be enforced by construction
supervision staff. Those related to operations, such an controlling odor and
noise, are incorporated in the designs: primary settling tanks, aeration tanks
and sludge thickeners will be covered and can accommodate deodorization
equipment; noisy equipment will be housed in insulated buildings. Adequate land
for possible tertiary treatment next to the plant was secured in the city's land
use plan, and the architectural design of building. and greenery also respect
aesthetic criteria.
3.25        Seoul TD submitted the ZIA report in July 1992 which MOZ approved in
October 1992; in its approval, MOE summarized the measures 8TD must carry out to
reduce negative environmental impacts during construction and operation of
facilities. In addition to the standard actions (para 3.23), MO0 stipulates that
STD must study various options to reduce residual pollution in Han River, such
as (a) chlorinating effluent in relation to the self-purification capacity of Han
River, (b) extending the effluent discharge pipe downstream of under-water Singok
Dam, and (c) reducing nitrogen and phosphorus in the WTP effluent.  MOE also
requires that the architectural design, site landscape and greenery respect
aesthetic criteria, and that STD prepare and implement an environmental
management plan to monitor the effects of mitigating measures as well as the
performance of WTP.
3.26        STD is complying or will comply with the environmental requirements.
Actions to be implemented during construction are included in specifications for
the civil works contracts and compliance would be enforced by construction
supervision staff.  Those related to operations, such as control of odor and
noise, are incorporated in the designs: primary settling tanks, aeration tanks
and sludge thickeners are covered and provided with deodorization equipment;
noisy equipment is housed in insulated buildings. The architectural design of
buildings and greenery also respect aesthetical criteria. The investigations
requested are included within detailed designs and implementation studies of the
sewerage master plan.  These studies would be carried out from 1993 to 1996
(Annex 1, para 51).
3.27        During appraisal, the staff reviewed MO1  recommendations to reduce
adverse impacts of the proposed WTPc as well as KSD and 8TD compliance and found
the documentation satisfactory and consistent with Bank requirements. Actual
performance would be monitored before and after completion of WTPz.  During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that six months prior to completion of
each treatment plant, both cities would implement an environmental monitoring
program, satisfactory to the Bank, to collect and evaluate data on plant
performance and the environmental impact of plant operations. Summaries of ZIAs
for both components were made available to the Board in October 1992.
3.28        The overall environmental impact of the project would be highly
visible and beneficial. When completed and operational, the WTPz would remove
(in 1997) pollution equal to about 62 t/d of BOD and 62 t/d of  uspe nded solids



- 16 -
(SS) in Kwangju and about 200 t/d of BOD and 220 t/d of SS in Seoul. Without
this effort pollution would transform the Yongsan and Han Rivers into fetid open
sewers with obnoxious odors and a repulsive gray color. With WTPs, the river.
will offer a pleasant environment for recreation and fishing and be a suitable
source of water. A detailed assessment of the project's environmental impact is
provided in Annex 10.
K. Superviion
3.29        Supervision by the Bank would require about 46 staff-weeks over the
life of the project, of which about 14 staff-weeks would be at headquarters to
review progress reports, procurement actions, correspondence, etc. and 32
staff-weeks would be in the field. Supervision would be provided by sanitary
engineering and financial staff as well as specialists in water pollution
control, environmental issues and water conservation. The borrower'c contribution
to supervision would entail reports on various subjects, including regular
reporting on implementation progress and coordination of Bank visits. A project
supervision plan is given in Annex 6.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Imolementing Agencies
4.1         The project would be implemented by the XSD of the Kwangju City
Government (KCG), and the STD, supported by the Construction Bureau of the Seoul
City Government (SCG). Both would be assisted by consultants. The KSD and the
STD have carried out similar development projects and are experienced in project
implementation.
B. Oroanization and Manacement
4.2         Municipal services in Kwangju and Seoul are provided by various city
agencies and bureaus. The bureaus, headed by director-generals reporting to the
mayors, are responsible for planning, budgeting and general guidance for their
activities. Operations, maintenance and construction of network facilities are
generally decentralized to the city districts. In Kwangju, sewerage services are
provided by the Construction Bureau through XSD, and in Seoul by the Sewerage
Bureau (SSB) and it. three divisions, including the Treatment Division.
4.3         The KSD and STD are directly responsible for constructing and,
through the treatment plant units, for operating the plants and interceptors.
The districts, headed by administrators, are organized into several bureaus as
well as divisions/sections. The KSD and STD coordinate the overall planning and
budgeting of the districts' sewerage operations, and provide technical guidance
on network and pumping station operations and maintenance, as well as on new
construction.
C. Accountina and Auditina
4.4         The budgets prepared according to MOHA and EPB guidelines are divided
into general and special accounts, and are approved by mayors and city
parliaments.   Districts prepare their  own budgets  (approved by district
parliaments) which are submitted to city governments for information and budget
support negotiations.   Special accounts, generally established for revenue-
generating operations, are managed on a break-even basis, with revenues
(including transfers from the general account) being of the same magnitude as
expenditures. All general and special accounts follow traditional government
cash flow  accounting.   In addition,  operations established  as municipal
enterprises (local public corporations - LPC), have their accounts adjusted at
the year's end to comply with commercial-based accounting principles and are
independently audited. The implementing agencies of both cities would maintain
project accounts within the sewerage special accounts.
4.5         In Kwangju, sewerage operation. have LPC status and the sewerage
special account (KSA) is annually audited by a public accounting firm.  The
accounts maintained by KSA are not computerized (except for bill preparation)
and monthly cash flow reports comparing actual results with budgets are prepared
manually.   KSD recognizes the need to develop its staff to upgrade the
preparation of timely financial and operational reports, and plans a gradual
expansion of its management information system.



- 18 -
4.6         In Seoul, the Bank supports the move to introduce accrual accounting
systems for the *ewerage operations and the plan to become a more commercially
oriented organization by conforring LPC status in January 1995. At present, the
activities of the sewerage operations are split between a special account (SSA)
for the WTPs and interceptors, and city and district general accounts for costs
of administration,  network and pumping utation activities.   The accounts
maintained by SSA are not computerized (except for bill preparation) and monthly
cash flow reports comparing actual results with budgets are prepared manually.
The proposed move to LPC status will enable SSB to gradually introduce more
comprehensive financial and management reports. The only external audit for the
sewerage special account (SSA) has been carried out by the Government's Audit
Board, which does not provide summary reports. The SSB recognizes the need for
an independent audit (as is usually conducted for LPCs) even before the sewerage
operations receive LPC status, and would arrange for it to be performed.
4.7         During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the financial
statements of the KSA and S8A would be audited by auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Such statements and audit reports would also include a separate opinion
on Statements of Expenditure and the IBRD Special Accounts for the Bank loan, and
would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal
year.
D. Billina and Collection
4.8         In both project cities, bills for various services are combined into
one monthly bill by the integrated billing section in each district. These cover
water supply, sewerage, gas, television, solid waste disposal, and electricity
(the latter in Kwangju only). All water supply connections are metered, and the
monthly consumption is the basis for both water supply and sewerage charges. The
integrated bills and accounts receivable ledgers are prepared by computer, and
customers are given up to one month to pay the total of all charges. The bills
are paid at banks. Details of any customer's failure to pay within the allotted
time are reported to the service organizations for appropriate enforcement
action. Collection efficiency is high at around 99% in Kwangju and 97% in Seoul,
and the accounts receivable for KSA and SSA in 1991 were equal to 35 and 37 days'
sales respectively.
B. Staffina and Trainina
4.9         In 1992, the KSD, STD and districts employed 165 permanent staff to
handle wastewater collection, treatment and administration in Kwangju and 2,625
in Seoul. In Kwangju, maintenance and cleaning of the network is carried out bi-
annually by 1,500 casual workers employed for two separate periods of three
weeks. In Seoul, firms of contractors are employed to clean all large sewers
while the small pipes are cleaned by direct labor.   Staffing levels and
efficiency compare favorably to levels achieved in sewerage companies in other
countries.



- 19 -
4.10        Several Government training programs exist.  HOC operates one f or
engineers, technicians and operators on the practical aspects of water supply and
treatment (primary and secondary), water conservation, wastewater treatment and
the operation and maintenance of plant and network. SCG also offers technical
courses for its staff in Seoul.  MOHA provides training for accounts *taff,
including personnel of LPC's using double-entry commercial-based accounting. All
permanent staff are expected to attend MOC/HOHA training courses every year for
two or three weeks as well as special training courses after every five years of
service. Staff are transferred between city bureaus and departments to gain
wider work experienc- and dovelop their career potential.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Rate Structure and Revenues
5.1         sewerage tariff policies, introduced in Xorea in 1983, were to be
valid until the end of 1991.  Each municipality established sewerage tariffs at
levels which would cover estimated operation and maintenance expenses,
depreciation and interest on borrowing.  The sewerage tariffs for Kwangju were
set in 1985 and for Seoul in 1983; these were based on estimated expenses from
the year they were introduced through the end of 1991.
5.2         Based on the recommendations of an HOC national tariff study,
reviewed by the Bank and approved in November 1991, the Government authorized
sewerage bureaus to follow HOC guidelines when introducing new tariffs from 1992
onwards. The tariff is expected to cover all operating and maintenance expenses
and depreciation, and provide a rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
up to a maximum of 7%. The tariff should not vary significantly between cities,
and should be affordable and regularly reviewed. All costs relating solely to
drainage and river maintenance are to be financed from general revenues.
Initially, MOC and EPB will monitor and confirm all new sewerage tariffs to
ensure that approved criteria and methodology are followed, but it is expected
that the task of setting and approving sewerage tariffs would later be
decentralized to the cities.
5.3         In Kwangju, the KSA submitted its tariff study to MOC in December
1992, and it is expected the average sewerage tariff will increase to W 101/m3
(9%) and be effective from 1993; subsequent annual increases would be about the
same rate. Any shortfall in revenues needed to develop the sewerage system would
be made up from the city's general account and local loans.
5.4         In Seoul, the SSA submitted its tariff study and recommendation to
HOC in October 1992. On average, sewerage tariffs will be raised to W 97/m3, to
be effective in July 1993, representing a 23% increase. As the approved hike
falls short of the SSA request, it is expected that MOC will approve additional
annual increases of around 9% until the tariff setting authority is devolved to
the city.
B. Fixed Assets and Revaluation
5.5         In Xwangju, the KSD special account was established as an LPC in
1986, and the network fixed assets were valued at replacement cost less
depreciation and treated as equity contributions.  The WTP construction was
completed and added to the register in 1991. Xorean law covering LPCs requires
the revaluation of fixed assets at least once every five years which is
acceptable. XSD should have carried out this exercise for the network in 1990;
as the work was not done, it is scheduled for 1993. Interim adjustments between
revaluations are made in connection with periodical tariff studies.



- 21 -
5.6         In Seoul, the SSA is not an LPC and is therefore not required to
produce annual balance sheet. reflecting revalued fixed assetu and accumulated
depreciation. The Bank supports SSA's decision to prepare commercially-based
financial accounts beginning in 1993 as a step towards LPC status; an auditor's
qualification to the asset valuation may be needed for two or three years (para
4.7). A detailed asset valuation was prepared in 1983 (when the first sewerage
tariff for Seoul was introduced) and was updated in 1992 as part of the new
tariff study. This was accomplished by adjusting the original 1983 figures with
each subsequent year's asset additions and disposals. A complete asset valuation
is to be undertaken within the city's sewerage master plan from 1993-95 which is
satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that KSA and SSA
fixed assets would be revalued in 1993 and 1995, respectively.
C. City Finances
5.7         KCG and SCG finances are satisfactorily managed; in recent years,
cash surpluses were generated on their general accounts and, in aggregate, on
their special accounts. A summary of both cities' 1989-91 financial status and
1992 budgets are available in the project file.
D. Kwanciu Sewerace SDecial Account
5.8         Past cerformance and Dresent lposition. KSA revenues increased by 44%
between 1989-91 in line with increased wastewater volumes. Operating expenses
increased over the same period by 88% because the WTP at Yu Deog Dong began to
operate in 1990. Operating income decreased by 9% in this three-year period with
the 1991 rate of return dropping to 1.74%. Both 1990 and 1991 registered non-
operating losses due to foreign exchange losses on an OECF loan.  Internally
generated funds financed around 22% of 1989-91 capital spending, while the rest
was financed largely from equity contributions provided from KCG general
revenues. At the end of 1991, long-term debt was 17.5% of total capitalization.
5.9         Financial Dlan.  KSA's capital spending requirements and financial
plan for its 1992-97 implementation period are as follows:

terms, were confirmed during negotiations.
5.11        Future finances. XSA financial projections are shown in Annex 7 and
the assumptions used to prepare them are in Annex 9. Based on these projections,
KSA financial performance is adequate to cover 0 & N costs, debt service and
depreciation.
5.12        The project would constitute about half of RSA's estimated capital
spending of W 230 billion between 1992-97. KSA's projected annual rate of return
would average around 3% and would contribute around 21% towards its present and
future investment needs.   Around 31% of the capital requirements would be
provided by the city's general accountl/ and regional development fund, and an
additional 38% would be contributions from developers and city districts, all of
which are treated as equity contributions. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that starting in July 1993, KCG will charge sewerage tariffs that can
yield adequate revenue to meet operating and maintenance costs, including
depreciation and debt service payments in excess of depreciation, as well as
provide a rate of return of at least 3% on net fixed revalued assets in
operation.
5.13        From 1992-2000, ISA's net internal cash generation is projected to
increase by over three times, mainly because of increased revenues and the
relatively low debt service requirement. KSA's working ratiol/ would be at

satisfactory levels, not exceeding 38% throughout the period. Sewage volumes
from 1992-2000 would increase by an average annual rate of about 10%. Long-term
debt as a percentage of total capitalization would be 10%-15% during the period.
E. S-oul Sewerace Soecial Account
5.14        Past oerformanc- and Present Rosition.  The se*wrage network mainly
consists of combined drainage and sewerage systems.  SSA only records costs
relating to the WTPs and interceptors, and unlike Kwangju and other LPCs, does
not record expenses relating to the network (para 4.6). For the purpose of the
past and future financial projections, a qualified judgement has been made to
handle SSA accounts on the same basis as the LPCs. Conseuently, it has been
assumed that 50% of all network assets and district sewerage costs relate to
sewerage and the remainder to drainage.
5.15        SSA profits were reduced between 1989-91, as the sewerage tariff
effective to the end of 1992 was unchanged since 1983. Revenues increased by 17%
due solely to increased wastewator volumes, but operating expenses increased by
37% in the same period partly due to expansion at the Joongrang and Tanch-on WTP.
Operating income declined by 35% and the rate of return was 2.2%. There was a
non-operating loss of W 23.2 billion due to foreign exchange losses on an OFCF
loan.
5.16        Financial olan.  SSA's capital spending requirements and financial
plan for the 1992-97 project implementation period are as follows:

5.17        The SSA financial plan, including the Seoul City contribution from
the general account, were confirmed during negotiations.
5.18        Future finances.  Financial projections for SSA are shown in Annex 8.
The project would constitute about 27% of 8SA estimated capital spending of
W 1078 billion between 1992-97. From 1993 onwards, 8SA would need a 2% rate of
return to help finance its immediate and future inve-tment needs.   During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that starting in July 1993, SCG would
charge sewerage tariffs that yield adequate revenue to meet operating and
maintenance costs, including depreciation, and debt service payments in excess
of depreciation, as well as provide a rate of return of at least 2% p.a. on net
fixed revalued assets in operation.
5.19        Between 1992-2000, SSA's net internal cash generation is expected to
increase five times, mainly because of revenue generated from tariff increases
and the very low debt-payment levels. SSA's working ratio in 1992 was 53%, and
from 1993 onwards will not exceed 47%. Sewage volumes are expected to increase
by an annual average of about 7% during this period. It is estimated that about
55% of SSA'. 1992-2000 capital spending can be financed from internally-generated
funds, which would place a small burden on SCG's general account.
F. Monitorina and Evaluation
5.20        Project performance would be monitored against the implementation
schedule (Annex 4) while the implementing agency's operational, financial and
managerial performance would be assessed against the monitoring indicators given
in Annex 11 and 12. The performance of the water conservation studies would be
monitored against the study objectives and schedule  (para 3.14)   During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that KCG and SCG will send the Bank semi-
annual project progress reports, including revised project cost estimates and
implementation schedules, no later than March 31 and September 30 of each project
year; also, they will send updated financial projections no later than September
30 of each project year.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Proiect Benefits
6.1         Over the last decade and a half, the Government has adopted various
policies and programs to halt the serious environmental deterioration associated
with rapid urban and industrial growth. In particular, it plans to restore and
protect the riverine and coastal environment (para 1.4). Its policies recognize
that communities within a river basin must treat their liquid waste to a standard
that will not create problems when it is returned to the river. Treatment, under
this policy, becomes an integral part of a sewerage system and not simply an
accessory. Kwangju and Seoul have been energetically supporting central
Government policy in this regard.   In recent years, both have constructed
interceptor sewers to minimize the discharge of raw wastewater to their rivers
and to carry intercepted wastewater to treatment plants designed to produce
effluent of high quality.
6.2         The direct benefits of the proposed project would come from removing
wastewater  from  inner city rivers and improving living standards of the
population, especially those residing and working near the water courses which
are now polluted by raw wastewater.   The interceptors to be constructed in
Kwangju under the project would ensure that an increased volume of wastewater
would be contained within the system and not allowed to contaminate inner-city
waterways.  This would reduce the health risk from contact with river water,
improve the air quality by eliminating unpleasant odors, and improve the cities'
aesthetic environment. The project works would also increase property values in
areas adjacent to the currently polluted waters, which are also important
recreational areas (particularly in Seoul).
6.3         In addition, project support would include water conservation studies
(para 1.10). Actions taken as a result of these studies would reduce losses and
waste in the cities' water supply systems, decrease the amount of water taken
from the rivers, lower pumping and chemical costs, and reduce the quantity of
wastewater generated and the load on wastewater treatment plants.
B. Rate of Return
6.4         As  a proxy  for measuring  the  economic  benefits  of  sewerage
improvements, calculations often include community willingness to pay for
improvements through user charges in order to provide an approximate measure of
the minimum economic return from the investment. These revenues are related to
the capital and operating costs of the system provided through the financial
internal rate of return (FRR).
6.5         The FRR for Kwangju is about 3% and for Seoul, 4%. These are adequate
considering the social nature of the project and the other non-quantified
benefits that include improved health, increased property values, a cleaner
environment and enhanced recreational benefits enjoyed by citizens and tourists
who will have access to aquatic activities and cleaner riverside parks and
entertainment areas.   The difference in the two cities' FRR is attributable
largely to the economies of scale of Seoul's larger facilities.



- 26 -
6.6         The sensitivity analysis test assessing (a) an increase in the
capital cost by 10% and (b) a one-year delay in project construction as well as
an increase in capital costs by 10% made only marginal reductions to the FRR.
Detailed computation of the FRR, including assumptions used, are shown in
Annex 13.
C. Least-Cost Solution
6.7         The proposals selected for the project represent the least-cost
solution to improve wastewater treatment plants at Kwangju and Seoul and extend
the interceptor sewers in Kwangju.  The location of the plants, the scale of
their phased expansion, the treatment technology, and the alignment and design
of interceptor sewers were selected after evaluation of several alternatives
during preparation of the sewerage master plans for the project cities. In both
treatment plants, the second phase extensions would be virtually identical in
size and type of treatment units to those constructed in the first phase (para
3.3). The method of treatment at both plants is the activated sludge process,
quite appropriate for large communities and for areas with high population
density where the cost of land is at a premium.
6.8         The sewerage master plans for Kwangju and Seoul were prepared up to
eight years ago when the cities were clearly different in terms of area,
population and economic activity. However, the plans are still acceptable with
regard to developing interceptor sewers and locating the wastewater treatment
plants. Further, they were updated to ensure that later phases of development
and treatment plant expansion will be optimal choices and least-cost
solutions.
D. Affordability
6.9         Sewerage charges in Korea do not impose an undue burden on households
at the lowest income levels. The lowest paid workers are mainly in unskilled
jobs such as street cleaners and laborers, with an estimated income in early 1992
of about W 440,000 per month.  Low-income families also qualify for social
benefits, such as cash for food and services (para 2.3).  Since the average
household contains just under four persons and 1.44 wage earners, the lowest
average  household  income  is about W  650,000 per month.   Assuming water
consumption of 264 lcd (which was the average household consumption in Seoul in
1992), the average sewerage charge at the new levels proposed would represent
0.40% of gross household income in Kwangju and 0.47% in Seoul.
6.10        In an additional assessment of the effect of increased sewerage and
water charges, it was found the combined charges would still be less than 2% of
household income at the lowest income level.   This is well below the 4-6%
considered affordable for water and sewerage services in other developing
countries.   Moreover, because per capita and household income in Korea are
expected to continue rising, these percentages would be reduced even further.
E. Environmental Impact
6.11        The Government, through its National Water Improvement Program,
intends to improve the quality of the environment -- in particular, with regard
to rivers (para 1.4). The proposed project would support the implementation of



- 27 -
this plan in the first and fifth largest cities with the principal objective of
substantially improving the environment by removing pollution from wastewater
that is discharged into the cities' rivers. When constructed and functioning in
1997, the treatment facilities would remove pollution equal to about 62 t/d of
BOD and 62 t/d of suspended solids in Kwangju and about 200 t/d and 220 t/d,
respectively, in Seoul. The project works will provide primary and secondary
treatment for 45% and 16% of wastewater generated, bringing the total volume
treated in 1997 from 45% to 90% and from 75% to 91% in Kwangju and Seoul,
respectively, and will thereby improve the environment in the project areas,
raise living standards for the local population, eliminate offensive odors,
improve the appearance of waterways and reduce the amount of litter on the river
banks. The details of the environmental assessment and the recommendations are
discussed in paras 3.22 through 3.28 and Annex 10.
6.12        The project will also lay the foundation for further environmental
improvements through water conservation studies. The findings should enable the
cities to reduce (i) water losses both in pipe reticulation and consumer
plumbing, and (ii) water use through various water conservation measures which
in turn will reduce the demand on water sources and the amount of wastewater
generated.
F. Proiect Risks
6.13        The project's components do not present any special risks. Virtually
identical treatment plants were constructed on adjacent sites with similar ground
conditions and the interceptor sewers to be built in Kwangju do not present any
unusual difficulties. operationally, the treatment to be provided is already
used successfully in both cities.  The main risk will be in implementing the
recommendation of the water conservation studies since the range of possible
actions including pricing and technological inerventions could be politically
unpopular.   Past experience in Korea and the seriousness with which water
pollution issues are viewed, however, reinforce the potential for success
possibly over a more extended period of time.

VII   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1         During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government and
the Kwangju and Seoul City governments that:
(a)   The cities' waterworks would (i) complete the water conservation
investigations by December 1995; and (ii) complete the final report
on the study by July 1996 (para 3.13;
(b)   By June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1996, Seoul and Kwangju, respectively,
would implement an environmental monitoring program, satisfactory to
the Bank, to collect and evaluate data on the plants' performance
and their environmental impact (para 3.27);
(c)   The cities' sewerage special accounts, as well an statements of
expenditures and the special accounts established for the Bank loan,
would be reviewed by auditors acceptable to the Bank.   Such
statements and audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within
six months of the close of each fiscal year (para 4.7);
(d)   The Kwangju and Seoul sewerage fixed assets would be revalued
(para 5.6);
(e)   The cities would charge,  from July 1, 1993,  sewerage tariffs
yielding adequate revenue to meet operating and maintenance costs,
including depreciation and debt service payments in excess of
depreciation, as well as provide a rate of return of at least 3% and
2% p.a. on net fixed revalued assets in operation in Kwangju and
Seoul, respectively (paras 5.12 and 5.18); and
(f)   The cities'  sewerage agencies would  send semi-annual progress
reports to the Bank, including updated project cost estimates and
implementation schedules, no later than March 31 and September 30 of
each project year, as well as updated financial projections for the
sewerage special accounts no later than September 30 of each project
year (para 5.20).
7.2         During negotiations,  the financial plans for Kwangju and Seoul
Special Sewerage Accounts for the project period, including the Cities'
contributions from General Accounts and the availability of the Regional
Development Fund loan and its lending terms, were confirmed with the Kwangju and
Seoul City governments (paras 5.10 and 5.17).
7.3         The  loan  would  be  onlent  in  amounts  of  US$30  million  and
US$80 million equivalent to the Kwangju City government and the Seoul City
government, respectively, on the same terms as the Bank loan, including the
foreign exchange and interest risk, plus 0.05% administrative charge. Execution
of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and the Kwangju and Seoul
City governments would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para 3.9).
7.4         Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$110 million equivalent, for
a period of 15 years, including a grace period of five years, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.

KWANGJU AND SEOUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
EXISTING WATER SUPPLY. SEWERAGE AND SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEM
KWANGJU COMPONENT
Population
1.          Kwangju is the fifth largest "Special City" situated in the low-
income and less-developed southwestern corner of Korea, some 260 km south of the
capital. It accounts for about 2.5% of the country's GNP mainly from services
(government, commerce, transportation, banking, education), as well as
manufacturing and intensive agriculture. Nearly half a million are employed; 50%
are in services and the remainder are in manufacturing, fisheries and
agriculture.
2.          Kwangju's population has grown from 483,000 in 1975 to about 1.1
million in 1988 when the municipality was upgraded to special city status under
the control of the Government.  The increase in population has been mainly a
result of large scale boundary extension and migration from rural areas. The
administrative area of 215 kmi in 1987 grew to its present size of 500 km2, of
which about 410 km2 (80%) form a rural belt surrounding the developed center of
about 90 km2 (20%).
3.          The city is divided into four self-governing urban districts (Gu) and
83 sub-districts (Dong). The organization of Kwangju City Government (KCG) is
shown in Chart 1 and of an urban district in Chart 2.
Water SupplY
4.          The water supply services are managed by Kwangju Waterworks (KWW),
a self-financing municipality enterprise, consisting of two bureaus, four
divisions, four branch offices for water sales, materials and laboratory
services, with 400 employees in total. The KWW is headed by the assistant mayor
for Waterworks.
5.          The production and distribution capacity of the water supply system
in 1991 was 390,000 m3/d and the daily average production was 336,000 m3/d or 311
lcd, including about 40% of non-revenue water. Water services were provided to
1.1 million or 90% of the population. Out of 93,000 service connections, about
77% were residential, using about 67% of water supplied; 23% were commercial and
institutional, using the remaining 33%.
6.          The waterworks facilities include three impounding reservoirs and two
river sources, five water treatment plants of sizes varying from 30,000 m3/d to
240,000 m3/d, 11 balancing reservoirs with the total volume of 98,000 m3, a
boosting pump station, and about 4,200 km of pipes of various diameters. The KWW



-3                                  ANN3X 1
Page 2
is expanding its production and distribution capacities by 230,000 m3/d through
the Juam Regional Water Supply, now under construction.
7.          The past and projected daily average water production and sales are
shown in Table A 1.1.

Water Conservation
8.          Only a portion of water entering the distribution system is sold to
customers.   The remaining part is classified as the non-revenue water (NRW)
attributed to leakage from the water supply network and houses internal plumbing,
defective water meters and other unknown losses. It is believed that leakage in
the distribution network represent a major part of NRW.
9.          In 1986, on basis of recommendations of studies carried out under the
Bank-supported Second Water Supply Project (LN 2350-KO), the Government adopted
the National Leak Detection Program directing each water supply agency at
establishing leakage section responsible for periodical leakage control and
repair of leaks. Further findings on leakage lead the Government to adopting,
in 1989, the National Water Improvement Program which instructs the water supply
agencies to upgrade, within 1990-1995, the distribution network through replacing
pipelines older that 15-20 years suspected to be constructed without the proper
testing and the corrosion protection, and to eliminate easily corroding pipe
materials.
10.         Implementation of these Government-initiated programs resulted in KWW
in gradual reduction of NRW from over 54% in 1986 to 38% in 1991.   Upon
completing the network rehabilitation the NRW is expected to reach 35%. Further
NRW reduction will require expanding activities beyond leakage control, including
review of water metering practices and assessment of various types and quality
of house internal plumbing.
11.         The impact of reducing NRW has been constricted by fast growing per-
capita water demand, reflecting rising living standards, such as replacement of
traditional toilets by flush facilities, provision of modern bath in new
apartments, larger use of washing machines, but also growing excessive use. In
Kwangju the water sales per-capita grew from 107 lcd in 1980 to 187 lcd in 1991
or 1.7-times, and are projected at 316 lcd in 2001 or 3-times more than in 1980.

12.         Limited water resources and financial constraints of both water
supply as well as sewerage necessitate allocation of greater focus on water
conservation and demand management than in the past. The subject, however, is
not very well studied and also relates to local conditions. In connection with
the sewerage project the KWW agreed to undertake much a study which would provide
a data basis for future technical and financial action aimed at efficient water
conservation.
Sewerage and Drainage
13.         Sewerage and drainage services are managed by the construction bureau
through its sewerage division (KSD). Construction, operation and maintenance of
drainage systems are decentralized to the districts while those for sewerage to
the treatment plant management.
14.         The city is served by 1,400 km of combined sewers, 170 km of separate
sewers and 55 km of interceptors.  Combined sewers provide one pipe for both
drainage as well as wastewater while hygienically superior separate sewers
provide one pipe for each. Before entering combined sewers, however, wastewater
is required to first pass through septic tanks to remove solids. In the western
part of the city (Hanam) an extensive private industrial and housing development,
generating about 20% of the city's wastewater, is provided with a separate system
and, exceptionally, the requirement in respect of septic tanks has been waived.
The Hanam sewer to the wastewater treatment plant (WTP) therefore carries
solids; it does not have any storm overflows so there are no discharges of raw
sewage to the river.
15.         Traditional toilets are still used by about 0.4 million people.
Nightsoil is held in household vaults or cesepits emptied as required either
privately (about 60%) or collected together with sludge from septic tanks by
contractors and disposed of in the nightsoil treatment plant.
16.         The dry weather flow in the sewers is collected by interceptors laid
along the water courses to convey it to WTP. Flows in excess of 3 times dry-
weather-flow occurring in sewers during heavy rainfall are spilled by 160 storm
overflows to the nearest water course. The overflows are located at a sufficient
level above the receiving streams to be able to discharge freely without pumping.
17.         The first phase of the WTP at Yu Deog Dong, in operation since
January 1990, was designed to treat a daily maximum flow of 300,000 m3 and
intended to load the plant up to the capacity of its pumps of 400,000 m3/d, until
the second phase is completed. By the end of 1992, the plant treated the total
average wastewater flow of about 358,000 m3/d with a maximum flow of 420,000
m3/d.   The plant is conventional and uses the activated sludge process as
secondary treatment. The primary and secondary sludge are digested and dewatered
by filter belt presses. Grit, screened refuse, and a part of dewatered sludge
are disposed of to sanitary landfill sites.  Some sludge is provided free to
farmers. Despite being overloaded, the plant produces effluent of better quality
than expected in the design.
18.         The WTP and interceptors are operated and maintained by 90 employees
under the WTP manager. The sewerage system is maintained by contractors and 60



- 32 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4
employees in district construction divisions through one of its two civil
engineering sections. The development of the sewerage system is planned by KSD
which has 12 staff and is assisted by consultants. The construction of sewers
in private new developments is the responsibility of the developer. Other sewer
construction is dealt with directly by the KSD through a contract and in case of
minor works by the civil engineering section of the district construction
division.
19.         The sewerage system has some deficiencies.  Some areas are subject
to flooding during heavy rainfall due to the limited capacity of certain sections
of the sewers. There is also considerable infiltration of groundwater due to
poor specification or construction. Periodicity of maintenance is insufficient
to prevent silting in the sewers, resulting in large quantities of sand and grit
reaching the wastewater treatment plant. Remedial and corrective measures are
being gradually adopted and implemented by KSD and the district offices.
Sewerage Master Plan
20.         The first Sewerage Master Plan (SMP) for Kwangju was prepared by SD
with the assistance of consultants (Saman Engineering) in 1984, based on a survey
of existing facilities in 1982. These included the collection system employing
open ditches, pipes and boxed culverts and the identification of discharges to
the Yongsan River and its tributaries. The updating study of the SMP with a time
horizon of 2011 was completed in early 1992. Detailed investigations and designs
to implement study recommendations are planned to be carried out from 1993
through 1996 with an estimated budget of about W 5 billion.
21.         The SMP proposes that new development and redevelopment should be
sewered by separate systems; in addition, apart from the city center, which is
likely to remain on a combined system, those areas presently served by combined
sewers would be gradually changed to a separate system. Such conversion would
reduce the frequency of discharges of wastewater into the rivers through storm
overflows. The entire system uses gravity with the exception of Song An, a small
area under development expected to generate about 2% of Kwangju wastewater, which
requires a pumping station. The present and proposed proportion of combined and
separate systems is shown on Table A 1.2.
22.         The SMP also proposes to  (a) replace combined sewers in poor
structural condition or having inadequate capacity; (b) reduce infiltration of
ground water by adopting mechanical joints in place of rope and cement mortar
joints for all new sewers; (c) eliminate open drains; (d) improve maintenance
within the districts; (e) eliminate the nightsoil collection and (f) install
catchpits to prevent sand and grit entering sewers and reaching WTP.

23.         Treatment capacity is planned to be increased in line with growing
population needs.  The first phase of the WTP at Yu Deoo  Dong (300,000 m3/d) will
be increased to 600,000 m3/d in 1996 and to 800,000 m /d in 2001.
24.          To avoid pumping wastewater from the newly developed semi-industrial
area at Pyung Dong, the SMP proposes constructing a separate treatment plant
about 8 km downstream at Songdae which will be developed in two stages -- each
of 60,000 m3/d and slated for completion in 1996 and 2001. The development of
treatment capacities in relation to generated wastewater shows Table A 1.3.

25.          In 1991, about 176,000 m3 of nightsoil (40%) from a population of
about 400,000 and septic tank sludge (60%) were collected by contractors employed
by the cleansing division and transported to the nightsoil treatment plant at Yu
Chon Dong. The treatment uses dual aeration and dewatering of sludge which is

Page 6
then composted by private contractors for further sale to farmers. The effluent
is discharged to sewers and further treated in WTP at Yu Deog Dong.
Solid Waste Management
26.         The solid waste services are managed by KCG's environmental bureau
through its cleansing division. Collection and disposal are decentralized to the
waste sections of the districts' environmental divisions.
27.         The collection of refuse is provided by four contractors employed by
the districts.   About 2350 ton/day of solid waste was collected in 1991 and
disposed at five landfills around the city, initially operated by the
municipalities before being incorporated into special city. The landfills are
all reaching the end of their life and will be closed during 1993.  A new site,
about 8 km from the city center and with an expected life of 10 years, has been
selected.  The design of the new sanitary landfill complies with environmental
requirements, including appropriate separation of waste in the landfill and
collection and treatment of leachate. The land acquisition has been completed
and on-going construction of the first phase comprising of about 30% of the
landfill total size is scheduled to be completed for starting operations in mid-
1993.
SEOUL COMPONENT
Population
28.         Seoul, the capital of Korea, is the country's largest city with 25%
of the national population. It accounts for 30% of GNP mainly from services such
as commerce, banking, transportation, communications as well as from
manufacturing, which is slowly declining due to decentralization. Nearly 4.0
million are employed, of which about 70% are in services and the public sector
and the remaining 30% in industry.
29.         Seoul's population more than doubled from 1.3 million in 1946 to 3.0
million in 1962, when the municipality was upgraded to special city status under
the control of the Government.   In that year Seoul city government (SCG) was
placed under the control of the Prime Minister, with the mayor being a minister
level appointee. The further rapid increase of population to almost 11 million
in 1991 was largely due to in-migration and gradual expansion of the
administrative area rather than natural growth. The administrative area of 268
km2 in 1946 more than doubled to 594 km2 in 1962 in connection with the
establishment of SCG. Minor adjustments in 1973 resulted in the present area of
605 km2.  SCG has recently begun to execute a long-term program designed to
control and maintain the population at the level of 12 million and has studied
various measures in coordination with the national government aimed at dispersing
the future surplus population.
30.           The city is divided into 22 self governing urban districts (Gu) and
494 sub-districts (Dong). The organization of SCG is shown in Chart 3.

31.         The water supply services are managed by Seoul Waterworks Office
(SWO), which is a self-financing municipal enterprise, consisting of two bureaus
(administration and waterworks facilities), nine branch offices, and supporting
materials and laboratory services, with 3,500 employees in total. The SWO is
headed by the assistant mayor for Waterworks.
32.         The production and distribution capacity of the water supply system
in 1991 was 5.65 million m3/d and daily average production was 4.90 million m3/d
or 450 lcd, including about 40% of non-revenue water.   Water services were
provided to 10.9 million or 99.9% of the population. Out of 1.6 million service
connections, about 88% were residential, using about 69% of water supplied; 12%
were commercial and institutional, using the remaining 31%.
33.         The facilities include nine water treatment plants of sizes varying
from 100,000 m3/d to 1.13 million m3/d, 151 balancing reservoirs with the total
volume of 944,000 m3, 77 boosting pump stations to ensure adequate pressure in
higher elevations, and about 18,900 km of pipes of various diameters, of which
the distribution network was 10,900 km. The SWO plans expansion of production
and distribution capacities to 7.15 million m3/d and 8.15 million m3/d in 1995
and 2000, respectively.
34.         The Han River and its tributaries are the source for all water
provided by the Seoul Waterworks. About 1.75 million m3/d are taken from Paldang
reservoir, designated as a "water preservation area", and 3.9 million m3/d from
stretches downstream from Paldang dam, still with relatively satisfactory
quality.
35.         The past and projected daily average water production and sales are
shown in Table A 1.4.

Water Conservation
36.         Only a portion of water entering the distribution system is sold to
customers.   The remaining part is classified as the non-revenue water (NRW)
attributed to leakage from the water supply network and houses internal plumbing,
defective water meters and other unknown losses. It is believed that leakage in
the distribution network represent a major part of NRW.
37.         In 1986, on basis of recommendations of studies carried out under the
Bank-supported Second Water Supply Project (LN 2350-KO), the Government adopted
the National Leak Detection Program directing each water supply agency at
establishing leakage section responsible for periodical leakage control and
repair of leaks. Further findings on leakage lead the Government to adopting,
in 1989, the National Water Improvement Program which instructs the water supply
agencies to upgrade, within 1990-1995, the distribution network through replacing
pipelines older that 15-20 years suspected to be constructed without the proper
testing and the corrosion protection, and to eliminate easily corroding pipe
materials.
38.         Implementation of these Government-initiated programs resulted in SWO
in gradual reduction of NRW from over 47% in 1986 to 38% in 1991.   Upon
completing the network rehabilitation the NRW is expected to reach 35%. Further
NRW reduction will require expanding activities beyond leakage control, including
review of water metering practices and assessment of various types and quality
of house internal plumbing.
39.         The impact of reducing NRW has been constricted by fast growing per-
capita water demand, reflecting rising living standards, such as replacement of
traditional toilets by flush facilities, provision of modern bath in new
apartments, larger use of washing machines, but also growing excessive use. In
Seoul the water sales per-capita grew from 153 lcd in 1980 to 283 lcd in 1991 or
1.8-times, and are projected at 424 lcd in 2001 or 2.8-times more than in 1980.
40.         Limited water resources and financial constraints of both water
supply as well as sewerage necessitate allocation of greater focus on water
conservation and demand management than in the past. The subject, however, is
not very well studied and also relates to local conditions. In connection with
the sewerage project the SWO agreed to undertake such a study which would provide
a data basis for future technical and financial action aimed at efficient water
conservation.
Sewerage and Drainage
41.         Sewerage and drainage services are managed by the sewerage bureau
through its treatment division (STD). Construction, operation and maintenance
of the drainage systems are decentralized to the districts, while those for
separate sewerage and interceptors are under the managers of WTP.
42.         About 85% of Seoul is served by 8,000 km of combined sewers, 660 km
of separate sewers and 310 km of interceptors. Combined sewers convey surface
water runoff together with wastewater discharges from domestic, industrial and
commercial premises.  In all cases, wastewater first passes through a primary



3 7                               ANNEX 1
Page 9
treatment, such as septic tanks, to remove solids from wastewater before it
enters the sewer.   Relatively small areas (about 2% of total) are served by
separate sewers whereby surface water and wastewater are collected into two
separate pipes. In some outer parts of the city, the traditional toilets are not
yet converted to flush toilets. Thus about 18% of the area with a population of
2.0 million depends on the collection of nightsoil.
43.         The dry weather flow in combined sewers is collected by 310 km of
interceptors laid on both sides of the Han river and its tributaries to convey
it to wastewater treatment plants.  The surplus over the dry flow, occurring
during heavy rainfall, flows directly into the river through storm water
overflows. Since the water level in the river normally rises over the outlets
of combined sewers automatic gates close and divert the surplus flows into about
60 retention basins provided with storm water pumping stations.
44.         The city area is divided into four sewerage districts, each provided
with a wastewater treatment plant: Chungrang and Nanji in the northern part of
the City and Tancheon and Anyang in southern part.
45.         The Chungrang (capacity 1.21 million m3/d, 3.76 million connected
population) and Tancheon (0.6 million m3/d, 1.8 million population) treatment
plants are conventional and use the activated sludge process as secondary
treatment.  The plants at Nanji (0.5 million m3/d, 1.8 million population) and
Anyang (1.0 million m3/d, 4.0 million population) provide only primary treatment;
but the secondary treatment units are under construction at both.
46.         The Chungrang plant also treats the nightsoil in a separate facility
(1,000 m3/d).   The septic tank sludge is treated in special facilities in
Chungrang,  Anyang  and  Nanji  (1,000  m3/d,  2,500  m3/d,  and  1,000  m3/d,
respectively).   The dewatered digested sludge,  generated in Chungrang and
Tancheon, and the dewatered primary sludge and septic tank sludge from Nanji,
Anyang disposed of at Nanji-do solid waste landfill.
47.         The operation and maintenance of treatment plants and interceptors
are provided by a staff of 1,260 in treatment plant offices (TPO). The TPOs are
headed by the directors who report to sewerage bureau's director general.
48.         The operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, including the
storm water pumping stations but excluding treatment plants, interceptors, and
sanitary sewers where the systems are separated, are provided by 22 district
sewerage divisions mainly by contractors.   In mid-1992,  the staff in the
districts totalled  1,300.   The district sewerage divisions are headed by
directors reporting to district directors general of construction bureaus.
Financing of operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, including pumping
stations, is provided from the district's general account and of treatment
facilities from the sewerage special account administered by the sewerage bureau.
49.         The development of the entire sewerage system is planned by the
sewerage bureau, which is also directly responsible for construction of treatment
facilities, including interceptors. The development of drainage and the combined
system follows the general direction of development plans prepared by the



- 38 -
ANNEX 1
Page 10
sewerage bureau but the construction is carried out under the responsibility of
the 22 district offices. Financing new development of treatment facilities is
provided from the sewerage special account with contributions from developers and
the city's general account while the development of the drainage and combined
system is mainly financed from the district general account.
50.         The sewerage system has shortcomings.  During heavy rainfall, there
are areas of flooding due to the limited capacity of local sewers. Infiltration
of ground water in the Anyang sewerage district, for example, has been estimated
at 39% of the raw sewage flow. Some sewers are damaged, some poorly constructed
and some are of insufficient capacity to meet present day and future needs.
Maintenance is often weak and leads to silting of the sewers.   Remedial and
corrective measures are being gradually adopted and implemented by STD and the
district offices.
Sewerage Master Plan
51.         The first SMP for Seoul was prepared by the SCG in 1984, based on a
survey of existing facilities in 1982;   these included collection systems
employing open ditches, pipes and boxed culverts as well as pumping stations,
storm overflows and two wastewater treatment plants. The updating study of SMP,
including expansion of its time horizon to 2015, was completed in early 1992.
Detailed investigations and designs to implement study recommendations are
planned to be carried out from 1993 through 1995, with an estimated budget of
about W 30 billion.
52.         Within the SCG area of 605 km2, about 210 km2 are mountainous,
unusable for development; of the remaining area of 395 km2, the combined and
separate sewerage system extend over 350 km2 and 45 km2, respectively.
53.         The SMP recognizes that those areas with a combined sewer system will
probably stay that way although some separation may be provided when suitable
opportunities arise, such as with new developments which have separate sewers.
The nightsoil collection system would be reduced and eventually eliminated by
2010 through replacement of traditional toilets by flush systems.
54.         The SMP proposes to (a) provide 31 new overflows with storm water
pumping stations and associated collecting basins; (b) increase the capacity of
42 of the 63 existing storm water facilities; (c) replace existing combined
sewers considered in poor structural condition or with insufficient capacity; (d)
reduce the infiltration of ground water in newly constructed sewers through
adoption of mechanical joints in place of outdated rope yarn and cement mortar
joints and (e) eliminate open drains.
55.         Design criteria for proposed surface water drainage is based on 5 and
10 year return periods of storms for branch and trunk surface water sewers,
respectively. The method and run-off coefficients adopted are well tried and
satisfactory.    Sewer  design  is based  on  connected population  and water
consumption. The SMP also proposes improving district maintenance procedures.
56.         The SMP proposes to continue increasing the treatment capacity in
line with growing population. As limited space constrains long-term expansion

of the four major plants, it is proposed to construct new subsidiary treatment
plants at Chungrang and Anyang sewerage district. The proposed development of

Niohtsoil Disposal and Treatment
57.         In 1991,  about 2.0.million people (18%) were using traditional
toilets in combination with a vault to store the nightsoil; the remaining 8.7
million (72%) used flush toilets that discharged into septic tanks.   (Direct
discharge into sanitary sewerage system is not permitted in Seoul with exception
of a few housing estates which are provided with trunk mains without storm water
overflows which lead wastewater directly in WTP). The nightsoil is collected
only by private contractors (21) and disposed of in Pukpu sanitary treatment
plant (600 m3/d) or in Chungrang wastewater treatment plant(1,000 m3/d).  The
sludge from the septic tanks is also collected only by private contractors (50)
and disposed of in Chungrang (1,000 m3/d), Anyang (2,500 m3/d) and Nanji (1,000
m3/d) wastewater treatment plants. In 1990, the contractors collected an average
1,600 m3/d of nightsoil and 4,500 m3/d of septic tank sludge.
Solid Waste Management
58.         The solid waste services are managed by SCG's two waste disposal
bureaus, both reporting to the waste management office. The collection of wastes
is provided either directly or through contractors by the district waste disposal
divisions under the overall direction of the cleansing bureau. The disposal of
wastes is carried out by the facilities bureau with no involvement of districts.
59.         In 1991 the city collected about 34,000 t/d of solid waste and
disposed it of in the Nanji-do landfill. Out of the total amount, about 18,000
t/d was general municipal refuse and ash from coal briquettes, about 14,000 t/d
was construction and demolition waste, and remaining the 2,000 t/d consisted of
industrial wastes (500 t/d) and dewatered sludge from water and wastewater
treatment plants.
60.         The Nanji-do landfill has been in use since 1977, but because it has
little remaining capacity and is considered environmentally unacceptable, it is
scheduled to be closed by the end of 1992. A new modern sanitary landfill is
under construction at Kimpo seashore with an expected life of 25 years. Due to
much greater average distance from the city, the collected waste will be routed
through 20 transfer stations, compressed, and transported by large-volume
vehicles in Kimpo landfill.
61.         Together with construction of the new sanitary landfill, the solid
waste collection system will be rationalized: out of 34,000 tons of refuse
collected daily, 15,000 of incombustible waste, such as ash from coal briquettes
and demolition waste will be compressed at transfer stations and disposed of at
the landfill.   The recyclable materials such as a certain type of paper and
metals, estimated at 4,000 tons will be separated and reused. About 15,000 tons
of combustible materials collected daily will be disposed of in 10 incineration
facilities spread over the city. Generated waste heat will be used for heating
nearby households.

KOREA
KWANGJU AND SEOUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.          The project  includes  Kwangju  and  Seoul  components.    Detailed
description is as follows:
KWANGJU COMPONENT
2.          The component includes:
(a)   the construction of the second phase of the WTP at Yu Deog Dong, a
wastewater pumping station at Song Am, and about 36 km of
interceptors; and
(b)   project preparation and implementation support, including:
(i)   engineering services for construction supervision, and
(ii) a water conservation study.
Kwanaiu Treatment Plant
3.          The WTP, to treat wastewater from the city's six main drainage
areas (Chungan, Ponchon, Soo Chang, Hanam, Songan, and Technopolis), is
situated at the confluence of the Yongsan and Kwangju Rivers, some 7 km west
of the city center. Wastewater generated in the city is conducted to the WTP
by interceptors made of pipes varying from 0.5 m to 1.5 m in diameter and box
culverts with sections from 1.5 m x 1.5 m to 3.0 m x 2.5 m, 55 km in total
length and constructed within the past few years.
4.          The WTP is being developed in phases.   The first phase, with a
capacity of 300,000 m3/day, was commissioned in two stages, primary treatment
in October 1989 and secondary treatment in June 1991. The second phase, to be
constructed under the project, will increase the capacity of the plant to
600,000 m3/d. The extension is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996.
A further extension of 200,000 m3/d is planned for completion in 2001.
5.          The treatment technology of the first  and  second phase  is a
conventional activated sludge process.  With the exception of settling tanks
which are circular in the first and rectangular in the second phase, all other
treatment units are identical.   The second phase of the treatment plant
includes the following procedures and units: (a) primary treatment including
screens, grit chambers, and primary settling tanks; (b) secondary treatment
including aeration tanks (with diffusers) and secondary settling tanks; (c)
sludge treatment including sludge thickeners, heated digesters, belt presses
for dewatering, and storage and loading facilities for sludge cake; (d)
effluent chlorination; (e) pumping equipment for incoming wastewater and

sludge handling and (f) buildings to house pumps, sludge pumps, blowers, heat
exchangers, chlorination equipment, water supply, sludge dowatering equipment
and stores.   The central administration building,  including control room,
laboratory and social facilities, was constructed in the first phase.
6.          All solids collected at screens and grit chambers (35 t/d) and
dewatered sludge (200 t/d) produced in the plant will be disposed of at a new
sanitary landfill site on the north side of Kwangju, about 14 km from the
plant.
7.          The  type  and  size  of  second  phase  key  treatment  units  and
supporting facilities are shown in Table A 2.1

13.         The study will be carried out in three localities:
(a)   Yang Dong 1 (low-income residential houses with 250 meters),
(b)   Daegum Dong (middle-income commercial houses with 250 meters), and
(c)   Nongseong l-Dong (middle-income residential apartments with 200
meters)
and will have three phases:
(a)   study design and preparation of study area;
(b)   data gathering; and
(c)   final report with evaluation of data and recommendations.
14.         The Kwangju Waterworks, which will implement and finance the study
within its water conservation activities, appointed the Director of its Water
Supply Division as the Project Manager to be responsible for managing the
study. In performing his duties he will be assisted by consultants planned to
be employed in early-1993.   The study will be implemented in three-and-half
years; the preparatory phase of nine months would be completed in December
1993, the data gathering phase of two years in December 1995 and the final

15.         The component includes: (a) the construction of the second phase
of the Anyang WTP; and (b) project preparation and implementation support,
including (i) engineering services for construction supervision, and (ii) a
water conservation study.
Anvang Treatment Plant
16.         The Anyang WTP, to treat wastewater from seven of Seoul's ten
southern districts (Seocho-Gu, Kwanak-Gu, Tongjak-Gu, Guro-Gu, Youngdungpo-Gu,
Yangchun-Gu, Kangseo-Gu) and from the neighboring Kwangmyong City, is situated
on the left bank of the Han River where it leaves Seoul.  The interceptors,
which are about 70 km and constructed of pipes with diameters varying from
0.5 m - 1.5 m and box culvert sections from one line of 1.4 m x 1.4 m to 3
lines of 4.0 m x 4.0 m, conduct wastewater generated in the districts to the
Anyang treatment plant. They were completed within the last several years.
17.         The WTP  is being  developed  in several  phases.    The primary
treatment of the first phase (1.0 million m3/d), has operated since July 1987
and the secondary treatment will be completed in December 1993.  The second
phase of equal size (1.0 million m3/d), to be constructed under the project,
will be commissioned also in two stages: one half of the additional capacity
(0.5 million m3/d) will be operative in December 1995 and the remaining 0.5
million m3/d a year later.
18.         Further  extensions  will  increase  the  daily maximum  treatment
capacity within the Anyang treatment area to 3.2 million m3/d, which is
expected to be generated in the seven districts by the year 2011.   Of this
quantity, about 2.6 million m3/d will be treated in Anyang WTP, and the rest
in two supporting plants, Dorim and Kwangmyong, serving Kwanag-Gu and
Kwangmyong  City.    The  key  indicators  showing  population,  generation  of
wastewater and development of the treatment capacity in the Anyang area are in
Table A 2.2
19.         The  treatment  technology  of  the  first  and  second  phase  is
conventional activated sludge process and the treatment units are essentially
identical. The second phase of the treatment plant comprises the following
processes and units: (a) primary treatment, including screens, grit chambers,
and primary settling tanks; (b) secondary treatment, including aeration tanks
with blowers, and secondary settling tanks, (c) sludge treatment, including
sludge thickeners, heated digesters, dewatering press filters, and storage and
loading of sludge cake; (d) pumping equipment, including sludge-, raw sewage-
and effluent pumps, chlorination facilities, and stand-by generator and (e)
buildings, including raw sewage- and effluent pumping stations, air blower
building, gas blower and heat exchange building, chlorination-, water supply-,
and generator buildings, sludge dewatering building and warehouse with
deodorization  fans  and  filters.       The  central  administration  building,
including control room, laboratory, workshops, and social facilities, was
constructed within the first phase.

20.         The  first phase also includes a facility  for treating sludge
collected from septic tanks by contractors, with a capacity of 2,000 m3/d.
The treatment units include unloading bays, sludge thickening, and sludge
dewatering.  The supernatant from thickening and dewatering press filters is
mixed with the raw wastewater at the inlet of the treatment plant and treated
in the plant.  All solids and sludge processed in the first phase of Anyang
plant (about 250 t/d of solids and primary sludge and 75 t/d of septic tank
sludge) are finally disposed of and mixed with the general refuse at the city
landfill at Nanji-do, about 20 km from Anyang treatment plant.

KWANGJU AND SEOUL SEWERAGE PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
General
1.          The Ministry of Environment (MOE) is the key agency for protecting
the environment in Korea. It (a) establishes policies, standards, and guidelines
for the implementation of environmental laws; (b) reviews the environmental
impact assessment (EIA) prepared for various projects and (c) monitors ambient
environmental quality.
2.          Wastewater treatment plant (WTP) projects are among those that
require that MOE must approve the EIA. The implementing agencies are responsible
for submitting an EIA to MOE (which also includes public opinions on the proposed
project), prior to construction. They must also comply with ZIA requirements and
environmental quality standards, which include monitoring the project's
activities. MOE, through its regional offices, periodically monitors compliance
with the EIA and the environmental quality standards.
KWANGJU COMPONENT
Description
3.          The component includes construction of (a) the second phase of Yu
Deog Dong WTP to increase its capacity from the existing 300,000 m3/d to 600,000
m3/d in 1996; (b) a sewage pumping station with the capacity of 18,210 m3/d and
(c) about 36 km of interceptors. The treatment process is conventional activated
sludge, identical to that used in the first phase, and the sludge generated will
be disposed of at the city's sanitary landfill after dewatering.  The WTP is
situated on lowland (about 20 m above the mean sea level) used for agriculture
at the confluence of the Yongsan and Kwangju rivers. Wastewater is collected
from six service areas through a network of combined as well as separate sewers
and interceptors.
4.          The effluent is being discharged in the Yongsan River between its
confluence with the Pungyongjung stream (650 m upstream) and the Kwangju River
(400 m downstream). The characteristics of the Yongsan River are shown in Table
A10.1.
Assessment of environmental impact
5.          The implementing agency, the Kwangju Sewerage Division, prepared,
with consultants' assistance (Saman Engineering), the EIA report for the
component in February 1990. The report evaluated the potential environmental
impacts of the WTP's (300,000 m3/d) expansion to 520,000 m3/d in 1996 and 720,000
m3/d in 2001. In later planning, the expansion was increased from the initial
220,000 m3/d to 300,000 m3/d. While the key findings of the ZIA were prepared
for the smaller plant, they are also valid, with minor modifications, for the
larger one.

6.          Using  the  mathematical  model  QUAL2E,  developed  by  the  US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the EIA report demonstrated the impact of
the WTP on water quality in the Yongsan River. The model projects substantial
improvement in BOD concentrations in the river downstream of the confluence
during the natural 10-day dry flow after the WTP-Phase II starts operating in
early-1997. The summary of the assessment is shown in Table A10.2 together with
samples taken in December 1988, before WTP-Phase I was completed, and in January
1991, after it began to operate.

environmental elements such as topography, geology, ecology, land use, air and
water quality, solid waste, noise, odor, population and traffic.   The main
affects and actions proposed to mitigate them are summarized in Table A10.3

8.          The EIA proposed an environmental management plan (EMP) that includes
training staff, monitoring effluent characteristics, properly disposing sludge
cake, and producing a monitoring plan. Four stations for monitoring odor and
water quality have been established; the monitoring will be once a month during
construction and once every three months during operation. Various options for
disposal of dewatered sludge were also considered and reuse in agricultural land
looked very attractive; however, due to unavailability of markets, disposal at
a sanitary landfill site was recommended as the next best solution.
Recuirement for mitigating actions
9.          In August 1990, MOE approved the EIA report and directed the city to
implement the measures it suggested which include the following.
(a)   Strengthen foundation of structure to prevent possible damage due to
land sinking;
(b)   Comply with MOE "Flying Dust Management Standards" to prevent dust
from damaging the area during construction;
(c)   Install drainage channels and sediment reservoirs on sites to be
excavated to avoid soil washout during rainfall;
(d)   Provide adequate land reserve in case tertiary treatment is needed
in the future;
(e)   Manage the sludge in accord with sanitary principles,  including
regular spraying of insecticides before disposal, and disposing
either at sanitary landfills or at agricultural compost sites;
(f)   Cover structures which generate odor as much as possible; odor must
be reduced by installing and operating deodorizing facilities;
(g)   Implement  landscape plan for the WTP area to create pleasant
surroundings;
(h)   Implement the EMP which would include mitigation measures as well as
monitoring in order to analyze the environmental impact of
construction and operation of the WTP on the surrounding area and to
establish measures to eliminate any negative effects.
Status of mitigating actions
10.         The city is complying or will comply with all of MOE's environmental
requirements for construction, operation and monitoring of the second phase of
WTP. The appropriate foundation of the structures, landscaping, and covers for
sludge thickeners as well as primary and aeration tanks are incorporated into the
design.   The city is constructing a modern, environmentally sound, sanitary
landfill which is expected to be completed in early 1993; a feasibility study for
constructing an incinerator near the WTP site is also being conducted. The city
would implement the EMP including monitoring and analyzing the actual impact of
the WTP and would take necessary actions to minimize any adverse effects as
required by MOE. The monitoring program would take not less than 12 months and



-78-                              ANNEX 10
Page 5
commence six months before the start of the operation of the second phase of
constructing the WTP. The proposed actions to mitigate the environmental impacts
of the WTP are satisfactory.
Reauirements for treatment Performance
11.         Starting January 1996, MOE standards for effluent from municipal WTPs
will be more stringent, changing from the present 30 mg/l for BOD and 70 mg/l for
SS to 20 mg/i for BOD and 20 mg/l for SS. The concentrations of BOD and SS in
the effluent from the Kwangju plant after WTP-Phase II starts operating (in
January 1997) are projected at 18 mg/l for BOD and 15 mg/l for SS, which complies
with the new standards.
Impact on receiving waters
12.         The treatment of wastewater generated in Kwangju attempts to maintain
water quality in the lower part of the Yongsan River at Class II levels (BOD not
more than 3 mg/I, suitable for use as a source for water supply) which would
require BOD concentrations at Kwangju of less than 6 mg/I. This is especially
important for Mokpo municipality which draws its water supply from the river near
its mouth.
13.         At present, and up to the end of 1996, the first phase of the WTP has
a capacity of 300,000 m3/d.   The wastewater generated in the WTP area is
estimated to increase from about 358,000 m3/d in 1992 to 520,000 m3/d in 1996.
In 1991, the annual average treatment efficiencies were 80% for BOD and 87% for
SS. The average concentrations of BOD and SS in raw wastewater were 99 mg/l and
102 mg/l, respectively, while those in the effluent were 20 mg/l and 13 mg/l.
Accordingly, about 12 tons of BOD and 10 tons of SS are discharged daily from the
WTP.  This contributes to concentrations of BOD of about 10 mg/l in the Yongsan
River downstream of the confluence point, which exceeds the maximum allowed of
6 mg/l (Class III).
14.         After the second phase is completed in early 1997, the treatment
capacity of the WTP will be increased to 600,000 m3/d.   With the expected
concentration of BOD and SS 139 mg/i each, the total BOD and SS generated in the
treatment area are estimated at 72 t/d each. About 62 t/d of BOD and 62 t/d of
SS will be removed in the plant and the remaining 10 t/d of each BOD and SS will
be discharged in the Yongsan River. Running of the QUEL2E model in 1992 using
the 1989 flows suggested 3-4 fold reduction of BOD concentrations in the Yongsan
River downstream of the confluence point. With the introduction of additional
treatment facilities upstream of the river basin during 1992-1996 (according to
the MOE water quality improvement program), the BOD concentration in the Yongsan
River downstream of the confluence point would be about 6 mg/l -- which would be
within water quality standards.

Monitoring and institutional capacities
15.         The WTP laboratory monitors performance daily.  Recently it also
began regularly monitoring water quality near the discharge point and in Kwangju
River. The laboratory is well equipped and includes instruments for heavy metal
analysis. There are 10 technical staff, six of whom are chemists. The present
capacity and performance of the WTP and the plan for new staffing and equipment
are adequate and satisfactory.
16.         Monitoring of industrial effluent, including that discharged into
public sewers, was conducted by MOE through its regional office in Kwangju.
Since July 1992, this responsibility was transferred to the KCG's Division of
Environment (KDE), the Office of Environmental Research (OER) and the districts.
The latter are responsible for collecting and delivering samples to OER and for
taking follow-up actions in case of non-compliance with allowable standards. KDE
collects and analyzes data for statistical and planning purposes.  Periodic
monitoring of KCG compliance and of its evaluating water quality in the Yongsan
River system will be conducted by the Kwangju Regional Office of MOE. Capacity
and performance of all these agencies are adequate and satisfactory.
Land accauisition
17.         The land acquisition process is regulated by law and consists of the
following steps: (a) the city issues a notice of land appropriation and
compensation to residents and owners; (b) the respective district appoints a
compensation committee consisting of 10-15 members, including the residents' and
owners' representatives and officials of the department requesting the
acquisition; (c) with assistance from two independent, certified land valuers,
the committee assesses commercial values of properties to be compensated
essentially using the average of values provided by each valuer; (d) the city
issues a notice to residents and owners on amounts offered for compensation. In
case an offer is not accepted within three months, the city asks MOC valuers to
re-evaluate the disputed property and assist in negotiations with the owner.
This last stage may take 2-3 weeks. If the offer is still not accepted, a court
will decide on the valuation and the land may then be acquired.
18.         The required land is being procured by the Sewerage Division; the
land for the WTP -- 202,422 m2 -- is agricultural, has 88 owners and is expected
to be acquired by October 1993. The land for the pumping station -- 2,908 m2 --
is partly agricultural:  2,326 m2 is owned by four individuals and procurement
is expected to be completed by the end of 1993; the remaining 582 m is public
and Government land. Details are shown in Table A10.4.
19.         The 202,422 m2 for the WTP was also occupied by a village with 36
households: 35 have been compensated (about 2.55 billion won) and have moved
(with city assistance) into apartments provided by the city as part of the
compensation package. The renter of the one remaining house has moved but the
owner of the premises has not accepted the compensation offer made by the city.
Acquisition of this last property is expected to be completed by October 1993.

of compensation involved, are available in the project file.
SEOUL COMPONENT
Description
21.         This component includes construction of the second phase of Anyang
WTP to increase its capacity from the existing 1.0 million m3/d to 2.0 million
m3/d by 1996. The treatment process is conventional activated sludge, identical
to the one used in the first phase. The digested sludge generated will continue
to be disposed of at the city sanitary landfill.
22.         The wastewater from the WTP catchment area of 132 km2 is collected
by interceptors (69 km) along the Han River and its southern tributaries,
connecting the network of combined (2,430 km) and separate (48 km) sewer systems.
The systems serve a population of about 4.2 million. In 1996, the population is
expected to reach 4.6 million and the wastewater generated, 2.0 million m3/day.
23.         The Anyang WTP is located on the left bank where the Han River leaves
Seoul.   The site is a lowland with the Olympic Road on the north side,
residential areas of Bang-Hwya and Magok villages to the east and south and a
hill to the west. At present, the WTP operates only primary treatment units with
a capacity of 1.0 million m3/d; secondary treatment units are under construction
with completion planned for 1993. The effluent is discharged into the Han River
at  a  location  about  4 km upstream of  the  Singok  underwater  dam.    The
characteristics of the Han River are shown in Table A10.5

Assessment of environmental impact
24.         The implementing agency, the Seoul Treatment Division, has prepared,
with consultants' assistance (Sunjin Engineering), the EIA for the component.
The EIA and proposed mitigating actions were submitted to MOE for preliminary
review and the public was given the opportunity to comment (as the law requires).
The final EIA was submitted to MOE in late July 1992 for its review and was
approved with conditions in October 1992.
25.         Using mathematical model QUAL2E, developed by the USEPA, the EIA
demonstrates the impact of the component on water quality in the Han River. The
model projects substantial improvement in BOD concentrations in the Han River
after the second phase begins operating in early 1997. It should be noted that
the BOD values at the discharge point reflect an overflow at the major
interceptor at the junction of the Anyang and the Han Rivers located between the
Sungsan Bridge and the Anyang WTP. The model results are shown in Table Al0.6,
together with sampling made in early 1992.

26.         The EIA assessed the potential negative impacts by selecting some key
elements, by considering national and international experience, MOE requirements,
and  conditions  at  the  units'  location.    The  selected  elements  included

topography, geology, ecology, land use, air quality, water quality, solid waste,
noise,  vibration,  odor,  population and traffic.   The expected impacts and
proposed mitigating actions are summarized in Table A10.7.

27.         The report proposed an environmental management plan that includes
acquiring additional staff, monitoring effluent characteristics, properly
disposing of sludge cake, and producing a monitoring plan. The water ecology,
air quality, noise, and water quality monitoring will occur every six month at
the sampling stations used in the EIA study during construction and operation.
Recuirement for mitigatina actions
28.         In October 1992 MOE approved the EIA and directed the city to
implement the measures it suggested. These include the following:
(a)   Increasing the ground level of the WTP to reduce possible flooding
of the Han River; preparing a plan to reduce noise, dust, and
traffic problems due to transportation of soil in advance;
excavating 818,368 m3 of soil;
(b)   Complying with MOE "Flying Dust Management Standards" to prevent
dust from damaging the area during construction;
(c)   Establishing a beautiful landscape near the residential area and
providing an adequate green zone to protect the residents from odor
and noise;
(d)   Extending the discharge pipe to a point downstream of the Singok Dam
in case the effluent from the WTP degrades the water quality of the
Han; monitoring the water quality continuously to provide measures
to improve it such as expanding the WTP and separate collection
system and reducing nitrogen and phosphorus by additional treatment.
(e)   Studying the merits and deficiencies of chlorination after treatment
in relation to the river's self-cleaning capacity;



- 84 -                           ANNEX 10
Page 11
(f)   Covering all structures which generate odor as much as possible;
reducing odor by installing and operating deodorizing facilities;
establishing a 30-50 m buffer zone;
(g)   Transporting 871 tons of solid waste generated from the WTP  to
Kimpo sanitary landfill; investigating the use of an incinerator as
a long-term solution; a qualified engineer is needed for operating
the sludge treatment process.
(h)   Installing   sound-absorbing  panels  to  reduce  noise  before
implementing the project.
(i)   Implementing the proposed EMP every quarter, including additional
water quality monitoring downstream of the Singok Dam; analyzing the
environmental impact of the construction and operation of the WTP on
the surrounding area; establishing measures to eliminate any
negative effects and reporting the results to MOE annually.
Status of mitigatino actions
29.         The city is complying or will comply with all of MOE's environmental
requirements for constructing, operating and monitoring the second phase of WTP.
The WTP plot would be filled up 1-2 m; the design includes an appropriate
foundation for the structures, landscaping, and cover sludge thickeners as well
as primary and aeration tanks. A study for possible use of an incinerator and
the need for extending the discharge pipe downstream of the Singok Dam will be
conducted at a later stage.   The city would implement the EMP  (including
monitoring and analyzing the actual impact of WTP) and would take necessary
actions to minimize any adverse effects as required by MOE.   The monitoring
program would take not less than 24 months and commence six months before the
start of the operation of the second phase of WTP; the actual assessment would
consider other factors affecting the environmental quality of the area.  The
proposed actions to mitigate the environmental impacts of the WTP are
satisfactory.
Reauirements for treatment Derformance
30.         Starting January 1996, MOE standards for WTP effluent will be
strengthened from the present 30 mg/l for BOD and 70 mg/l for SS to no more than
20 mg/l for BOD and 20 mg/l for SS. The projected concentrations of BOD and SS
in the effluent from the Anyang plant in 1996 are 13 mg/l for BOD and 12 mg/l for
Ss, which comply with the new standards.
Effect on receiving water
31.         The component forms a part of the Seoul sewerage master plan (SMP)
which aims to preserve and maintain the water quality in the Han River and its
tributaries at Class III, which is suitable for recreational fishing and boating
and contributes to the pleasant living conditions in Seoul's urban area. This
target has been generally achieved in the Han River upstream of the Anyang
discharge point.



- 85 -
ANNEX 10
Page 12
32.         At present, and up to the end of 1993, the first phase of Anyang WTP
will operate only primary treatment with a capacity of 1.0 million m3/d as
compared with about 1.5 million m3/d of wastewater generated in the area.  In
1990, the annual average treatment efficiencies were 32.5% for BOD and 43% for
SS. The average concentrations of BOD and SS of raw sewage were 80 mg/l and 128
mg/l, respectively, while those in the effluent were 54 mg/l and 73 mg/l.
Accordingly, about 94 tons of BOD and 137 tons of SS are being discharged daily
from the WTP, resulting in concentrations of BOD of about 7-9 mg/l in the river
near the discharge point. This exceeds the standards for Class III.
33.         After the completion of the secondary treatment plant in late 1993,
the BOD and SS concentrations in the effluent will both be reduced to 20 mg/l,
to meet standards.  With the average flow increased to about 1.8 million m /d,
the BOD and SS discharge in the river will be reduced to about 84 tons/d of BOD
and 124 tons/d of SS, resulting in concentrations of about 6 mg/l near the
discharge point.
34.         In early 1997, the treatment capacity of the WTP will be increased
to 2.0 million m3/d; the average daily flow of wastewater in the plant will be
1.85 million m3/d with the expected concentrations of 130 mg/l of BOD and 150
mg/l of SS; the total BOD and SS generated are estimated at 240 tons/d and 275
tons/d, respectively. About 200 tons/d of BOD and 235 tons of SS will be treated
in the plant and the remaining 40 tons/d of both BOD and SS, will be discharged
in the Han River, resulting in BOD concentrations of 4-5 mg/l near the discharge
point, or within the limits required for the Class III river water quality.
Monitoring and institutional capacities
35.         Monitoring of WTP performance is conducted daily by the Anyang WTP
office. The discharge outfall will be monitored after the secondary treatment
begins. The office is well equipped and includes new instruments for heavy metal
analysis.   It has eight technical staff, three of whom are chemists.  A new
laboratory with additional equipment and technical staff will be established
during construction of the second phase. The present capacity and performance
of the WTP and the plan for new staffing and equipment are adequate and
satisfactory.
36.         Monitoring of industrial effluent, including that discharged into
public sewers, and water quality of the Han River basin is conducted by MOE
through its regional office in Seoul. Since July 1992, the responsibility for
the Han River located within the Seoul City's boundary was transferred to the
SCG's Division of Environment (SDE), the Office of Environmental Research (OER),
and the districts.   The latter are responsible for collecting and delivering
samples to the OER and for taking follow-up actions in case of non-compliance
with allowable standards. The SDE collects and analyses data for statistical and
planning purposes.   Monitoring of the compliance with EIA and of OER water
quality in the Han River system will be conducted periodically by the Seoul
Regional Office of MOE. The OER is well equipped with highly qualified staff and
instruments for water quality analysis; it already monitors the water quality of
the Han River and its tributaries. Capacity and performance of these agencies
are adequate and satisfactory.

Land aca'uisition
37.         The site required for the WTP comes under the 1971 River Law by which
all river land was declared to be the property of the Government without
compensation. The 1984 Special River Law, while maintaining Government owner-
ship, provided for compensation. A Presidential order (1986) offered guidelines
for the evaluation and payment of compensation to those initial owners who
registered their claims over a period of three years after notification. The
Kangseo district office, acting on behalf of the city, gave such a notice in 1987
and registration was therefore acceptable until the end of 1990. At the end of
each registration year, two separate valuation companies evaluate the land of
claimants. The level of compensation offered to initial owners was one third the
average of the two evaluations since the site, which was river land, was subject
to flooding and therefore was of reduced value.   It is no longer subject to
flooding, because the river is now contained by an embankment surrounded by a
highway.
38.         The city has released funds annually and the district office has
arranged to compensate former owners in the order of the three registration years
and in the sequence of application. claimants were informed of the amount of
compensation and either accepted or rejected the offers. For those who did not
accept and who intend to appeal, the district office deposited funds in the court
of appeal. The court has to settle only the level of compensation; the land is
owned by the Government and will be transferred to the city by the National
Property Law. The area required for the WTP is 436,456 m2, of which 192,549 m2
have been acquired.   The position regarding initial owners, plots, and areas is
shown in Table A10.8.

39.         The 220 plots of private land have approximately 1,430 owners.
About 100 owners of 17 plots did not register; thus they do not qualify for
compensation, and the 129 owners of 43 plots were compensated (about 5.24 billion
won). Cases covering the remaining 160 plots which are claimed by about 1,200
owners, are before the courts.
40.         There are 16 farmers cultivating 293,915 m2 of the site.  They were
given notice about the new treatment plant, and have been instructed to plant no
further crops--since no compensation would be payable.
