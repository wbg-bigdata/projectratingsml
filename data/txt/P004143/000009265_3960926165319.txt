MEMOkANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE TAEGU CITY GOVERNMENT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A TAEGU URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Taegu City
Government with the guarantee of- the Republic of Korea for US$30 million
equivalent is submitted for your approval. The proposed loan would be
for a term of 15 years including 3 years grace at the standard Bank
variable interest rate. The proposed project would finance civil works,
equipment and consultant services for transportation improvements in
Taegu City.
2.        Background.  Increased urbanization and economic growth are
straining the capacity of Korea's urban transportation system. The
number of vehicles has risen dramatically, increasing at close to 20t
per annum in recent years, due primarily to the growth in private car
ownership. Higher incomes have made cars more affordable while the
increase in domestic automobile production has kept prices fairly
stable. At 14 cars per thousand perso-s, however, the level of
motorization is still low for a country at Korea's level of development,
and the number of vehicles is expected to continue to increase. The
Bank has been assisting the Government to address congestion, safety and
other urban transportation problems through the financing of road
investments, introduction of Transportation System Management (TSM)
techniqus.s, and rationalization of transport planning and traffic
management in city governments. TSM attempts to increase road capacity
and improve traffic flows through low-cost improvements (redesigning
intersections, introducing bus priority lanes, etc.) and is yet to be
carried out on a large scale in Korea. The Bank is already financing
urban transportation investments in Seoul and Pusan, the two largest
cities in Korea. The proposed project would assist Taegu City, the
third largest city in Korea (population 2.1 million in 1986), to address
its transportation problems. The Taegu City Government has already
taken steps to improve its transportation planning, traffic engineering
and public transportation management capabilities by consolidatih.g these
functions in a new Transportation Planning and Management Division.
3.        Proiect Objectives.    The objectives of the proposed project
would be to assist the Taegu City Government: (a) improve its
transportation system through the introduction and application of TSM
techniques and the construction of a major urban expressway and
associated links; and (b) build its institutional capacity to plan,
design and implement traffic and safety improvements, and deal with its
future transportation problems.



-2-
4.        Project Description  The project would consist of three major
components:
(a) Maior Road Investments (estimated cost US$134.4 million):
Acquisition of land and construction of around 9.5 km of the
Shinchon Expressway and connecting roads and bridges, and
consultant services for construction supervision;
(b) TSM and Safety Improvements (estimated cost US$10.4 million):
Construction of intersection improvements, channelization,
markings and pedestrian facilities, and instalation of traffic
signals; and
(c) Institutional Development (estimated cost US$0.9 million):
Advisory services for the Transportation Planning and
Management Division, training, and provision of traffic
surveying and monitoring equipment.
The total project coat is estimated at about US$145.7 million, of which
the foreign exchange component is around US$36.7 million. The project
would be carried out over five years (1988-92). The Bank loan would be
US$30 million and would be made to the Taegu City Government. The city
would bear the foreign exchange risk and provide the local counterpart
funding.
5.        Rationale For Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would
assist Taegu City to strengthen its transportation planning and manage-
ment capabilities.  The project follows the ongoing urban transportation
programs in Seoul (the Seoul Urban Transport Project, Loan 2514-K0) and
Pusan (the Pusan Urban Management Project, Loan 2801-K0). It forms an
integral part of the Bank's urban transportation strategy to assist the
Government to maintain the efficiency of Korea's major cities. This
would be achieved through the construction of new roads and through the
better utilization of the existing road network by the use of TSM
techniques and the strengthening of transport planning capabilities.
6.        Actions Agreed Upon.  The TSM program would be carried out
annually as a regular activity of the city. Therefore, the technical
assistance necessary to build up the city's institutional capacity to
implement the TSM programs is an important component of the project.
During negotations, confirmation was obtained on the scale and scope of
the advisory services, training and related equipment to be provided
under technical assistance, and on the financing arrangements since the
Government has decided not to utilize loan funds for technical assis-
tance. The design and timing of construction of the last section of the
Shinchon Expressway is directly linked to the construction of the
Kimhae-Taegu Highway which is currently under study by the Central
Government. Therefore the decision to proceed with construction would
need to be made after project effectiveness. During negotiations, it
was agreed that the Taegu City Government would provide a feasibility
study on alternative transport investments which would complement the
Expressway, should the last section of the Expressway not be constructed
during the project period. The auditing and reporting, and monitoring
arrangements were confirmed during negotiations.



3 -
7.       Justification.  The proposed project would reduce congestion
and improve traffic flows and safety within Taegu City, especially in
and around the central business district. The project would also
develop the city's transportation planning capabilities. Economic
benefits from the expressway and associated road investments are
expected to be savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and passenger
time savings. The economic rate of return of the expressway and
associated road investm.,-t.i is 25% based only on VOC savings.
8.        Risks.  The project poses no major risks.  There is a
possibility that unforseen difficulties with land acquisition could
result in delays in the construction of the expressway and/or associated
road works. Land would have to be acquired in close proximity to the
city center, involving the relocation of about 9,000 persons (2,300
families). However, this is not expected to pose a significant problem
given Taegu City Government's satisfactory land acquisition plan and
implementing capabilities. Experience in Korea indicates that the
assessment and payment of compensation to affected persons is done in a
fair and timely manner, and alternate housing is provided for
resettlement as necessary.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
