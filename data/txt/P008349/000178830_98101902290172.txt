LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Cyprus
Amount:             US$10 million
Terms:              15 years including three years of grace, at 8.0 percent
per annum.
Prolect             The project seeks to upgrade the incomes and quality
Description:       of life in the economically depressed Pitsilia region,
and includes the following investments: irrigation
and rehabilitation (1150 ha), soil conservation (2500
ha), land consolidation (500 ha), and on-farm water
distribution (1000 ha). Other investments include
village streets and farm roads, schools, health facili-
ties, domestic water supply, extension facilities and
farmer training, veterinary facilities, agricultural
research and special project-related studies. Although
not major risks, realization of the expected benefits
will depend on management's ability to coordinate and
control the project, and the results of systematic
tests of groundwater availability to determine the
levels of safe withdrawals for irrigation before the
implementation of water source distribution systems.
Project Costs:      The total estimated cost of the project is US$21.0 mil-
lion, of which about US$11.8 million is foreign exchange.
Contingencies total $7 million with price contingencies 33
percent and physical contingencies 17 percent of base cost.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR AN INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cyprus for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help fi-
nance an integrated rural development project. The loan would have a term of
fifteen years, including three years of grace, with interest at 8.0 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Cyprus (1151-CY) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in May 1976. It was based on the findings of an economic
mission which visited Cyprus in November/December 1975 to review the country's
economic situation and prospects, particularly in view of the events of July!
August 1974. An updating mission visited Cyprus in April 1977 and its main
conclusions follow. The mission also visited economically important areas in
the northern part of the island and held discussions with Turkish Cypriot
officials. Because sufficient reliable data are still not available for the
northern area, it is only possible to review adequately the economic situa-
tion and prospects for the southern Government-controlled part of the island.
3.        Cyprus' economy grew at 7 percent per annum between 1960 and 1972,
despite tension between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
The major contributing factors to this growth were: a competent Government
and dynamic entrepreneurs; a high rate of investment, especially in the pri-
vate sector; a rapid increase in agricultural exports contributing to a strong
overall balance of payments; and a flexible fiscal and monetary policy, which
not only helped to stimulate growth but also maintained domestic price stab-
ility.
4.        The unprecedented drought of 1973 caused serious economic difficul-
ties on the island, while the events of July/August 1974 then shattered the
growing economy. Cyprus is now divided into two essentially communal zones,
with little movement of people or goods between them. The southern part,
under the Government's control, constitutes 64 percent of the area of the
island; the northern 36 percent is under Turkish Cypriot control. Over
150,000 Greek Cypriots have moved south and about 45,000 Turkish Cypriots
north. About one-third of the total population was displaced and has in good
part been resettled with humanitarian assistance provided largely through the
UN. The Government-controlled area now has an estimated 480,000 people; the
area under Turkish Cypriot control about 150,000. Pending an island-wide
political solution based on the principle of a federation or confederation,
the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was proclaimed in February 1975. UN-
sponsored intercommunal talks towards such a possible solution are now under-
way.



5.        The events of July/August 1974 resulted in significant structural
changes and difficulties for the economy. In 1973, the GNP per capita for
the whole island was estimated at $1,460, while in 1975 for the Government-
controlled area it was estimated at $1,180, a drop of some 17 percent. The
unemployment rate in the Government-controlled area was initially about 25
percent; although faced with fewer refugees, the northern area still has a
considerable problem of unemployment and/or underemployment. The balance of
payments position also suffered. Both exports and imports of the area under
Government control fell by about 55 percent in the second half of 1974. About
47 percent of Cyprus' cultivated land is in the north, including areas which
produced over half the island's agricultural exports, but which have only been
partially exploited since 1974.
6.        The Government, through bold measures, succeeded in arresting and,
in 1976, reversing the economic decline in the area it controls. In August
1975, it consolidated initial and new measures into an Emergency Economic
Action Plan for 1975 and 1976. This Plan called for fixed investment of $275
million to create 16,000 to 20,000 new jobs, and efforts to reactivate indus-
try and agriculture. In industry, it aimed at a major revival of industrial
activity, through the creation of additional capacity in labor-intensive,
export-oriented industries to rehabilitate the available labor force, and
increase utilization of existing capital.
7.        In 1975, total output increased by about 12 percent, and employment
by 11 percent, from their very depressed levels in the second half of 1974.
The Cypriots were also successful in earning foreign exchange and obtaining
significant employment opportunities abroad by winning construction contracts
in the Middle East. With the balance of payments still in deficit, reserves
fell to the equivalent of six months' imports of goods and services despite
an inflow of $57 million in refugee aid.
8.        There was a further strong export-led recovery in 1976, with a
revival of private sector confidence and initiative assisted by Government
fiscal stimulation and investment. But investment, employment and GNP per
capita have still not regained the pre-1974 levels. Moreover, in examining
Cyprus' strong recovery, it should be kept in mind that in addition to the
existence of unutilized capacity including labor, low wages and little infla-
tion, much of the rapid growth was due to short-term external factors which
are unlikely to recur: greatly increased exports to Lebanon and large expend-
iture in Cyprus by Lebanese temporary residents; an agricultural export market
boosted by severe drought conditions in Western and Eastern Europe; and con-
tinuing international refugee aid. GDP at factor cost grew 16 percent in real
terms, a most remarkable achievement, with value added in agriculture up 20
percent and in manufacturing 22 percent. GNP per capita is estimated in 1976
to have reached about $1,480. The unemployment rate fell to 10 percent and
some industries began to experience labor shortages. Private consumption rose
14 percent in real terms while Government current expenditures remained level.
Gross fixed investment increased 12 percent, with most of the increase in
private investment and refugee housing. Large budget deficits continued as
the Government stimulated recovery and tried to meet the needs of refugees.
Consumer prices rose less than 4 percent, however, reflecting the existence
of substantial unutilized resources.



- 3 -
9.        After three years of increasing deficits, there was a remarkable
turn-around in the balance of payments in 1976. Receipts from merchandise
exports soared 73 percent, mostly from agricultural produce for the United
Kingdom and cement, clothing and footwear for the Middle East and Eastern
Europe. Payments for merchandise imports rose 33 percent in support of eco-
nomic reactivation and export production. The current account balance was
only slightly negative. The Government drew $40 million from the IMF oil and
compensatory financing facilities, and managed to recommence external borrow-
ing from bilateral and multilateral official sources during 1976, achieving an
overall balance of payments surplus of $43 million. The net contribution of
the short-term external factors mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which
included $47 million in international refugee aid, was much larger than this
overall surplus. Reserves therefore increased to $288 million by the end of
1976, equivalent to nearly seven months' imports of goods and services. There
are, however, prospects for some decline in the years ahead (paragraph 13
below).
10.       The pace and shape of medium-term economic development will depend
largely on the political situation. In view of the political uncertainties,
the Government is currently finalizing a second emergency plan for 1977 and
1978. Cyprus can count on several favorable factors to sustain economic
growth. These are: unutilized although difficult to harness water resources;
dynamic and responsible entrepreneurship; skilled labor; lower wage levels
than in continental Europe; and favorable location in relation to Middle
Eastern markets.
11.       The second emergency plan's initial growth target is likely to be
above 6-7 percent per annum for 1977-78. Investment will have to be increas-
ingly capital-intensive, since the large labor pool available a year ago has
diminished considerably. To finance investment, greater savings incentives
will be necessary, as also reduced public deficits through increased resource
mobilization. Even so, the Government expects an increased inflow of external
resources, and inevitably some drawdown of reserves will be needed.
12.       Balance of payments prospects, rather than supply potential, will
ultimately determine the feasibility of higher growth rates, which would re-
quire exceptionally rapid export expansion and import-substitution. While the
special factors of 1976 are unlikely to be repeated, Cyprus should be able to
gradually expand exports for Lebanon's reconstruction, attract tourists, and
benefit in the short-term from refugee aid which is now declining. Exports to
the Middle East can expand for some time. In the longer-term, however, growth
will be based increasingly on export-oriented manufacturing for Western
European markets. Success will depend on both this year's negotiations for a
second phase Association Agreement with the European Economic Community, and
achieving competitive prices, consistent quality, and longer production runs;
this may require a restructuring of industry over the medium-term.
13.       Despite the good prospects for export growth and progressive import-
substitution, the overall balance of payments outlook over the medium-term
will depend on increasing success in external borrowing, while maintaining a
more ample level of reserves than what is currently normal elsewhere, which



- 4 -
in Cyprus' recent experience and circumstances appears to be prudent. It has
just raised its first Euro-currency loan of $30 million. With Bank encour-
agement to try and gradually diversify its sources of official aid, Cyprus
succeeded in recently obtaining co-financing from the Kuwait Fund for the
Bank-financed Nicosia-Limassol Highway Project (1344-CY). After 1978, balance
of payments deficits are likely and medium-term growth will probably have to
be kept to moderate levels, restricting realization of the economy's potential
and delaying further rehabilitation of refugees.
14.       Cyprus' external debt has remained low, as a result of both the Gov-
ernment's past limited borrowing ability in a relatively uncertain context,
and its past policy of financing development internally. Total long-term
public debt disbursed and outstanding was $94 million, as of December 31, 1976,
with short-term debt a further $58 million. Public debt service was only 3.6
percent of exports in 1976. Given expected export growth, debt service should
remain low through the next decade. The Bank has always held a high proportion
of Cyprus' external public debt (42 percent of disbursed debt as of December
31, 1976), and received 34 percent of service payments on public debt in 1976.
Through this, the Bank has helped overcome Cyprus' relative inability to borrow
abroad during the 1960s and early 1970s. The Bank's exposure, although high,
remains reasonable given Cyprus' low external debt and debt service ratio, and
the Government's good economic management and policy of maintaining ample re-
serves. The exposure is expected to continue to decline gradually as Cyprus
continues to diversify its external borrowings. Cyprus is creditworthy for
additional Bank borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
15.       Bank lending to Cyprus began in 1963 and as of June 30, 1977, com-
prised twelve loans totalling $86.0 million (net of cancellations); of this,
$63.8 million (including $23.7 million undisbursed) was held by the Bank.
Bank lending to date has concentrated on providing Cyprus with essential
infrastructure and fostering much-needed institutional reforms. It has in-
cluded four power loans ($37.8 million), which assisted in the consolidation
and expansion of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, a ports loan ($11.5
million) which helped finance the construction of a new modern port at
Limassol (which now handles most southern Cyprus port traffic) and provided
the basis for the establishment of a national port authority; two sewerage
loans ($5.4 million) for Nicosia and Famagusta; the Paphos Irrigation Project
($14.0 million); two loans to the Cyprus Development Bank ($9.0 million); and
two highway loans ($15.4 million). Details of Bank loans to Cyprus are given
in Annex II.
16.       During a two year hiatus in Bank lending to Cyprus (until June
1976), the Bank maintained contact with the Government and, to the extent
feasible, also with the Turkish Cypriot administration, so as to keep abreast
of economic developments in Cyprus and to advance work on ongoing and future



projects. This facilitated the satisfactory resumption of work on most of the
ongoing projects, which had been set back for several months due to the 1974
events. The exceptions are: (i) the sewerage project in Famagusta, which
lies entirely in the area controlled by the Turkish Cypriots; and (ii) the
construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway, which was suspended because its
alignment virtually coincides with the line dividing the two communities (this
loan has since been amended, following Board approval in November 1976, to make
available the balance of its uncommitted funds for construction of the new
Nicosia-Limassol highway). The Bank has made sustained efforts to find ways
of serving the Turkish Cypriot, as well as the Greek Cypriot community, both
in developing new projects and in adapting old ones, but these have not yet
borne fruit.
17.       The Bank's objectives in Cyprus are to finance projects to meet
urgent needs for productive employment, exports and rehabilitation; to com-
plete essential infrastructure useful in the context of the whole country;
and to accelerate the recovery of the economy towards the level prevailing
before the 1974 events. When a political settlement is reached, the Bank
would seek to help both communities through support of projects designed to
improve living standards of those groups left out of the growing prosperity
prior to 1974; to help build up stronger institutions; to encourage a national
water policy; to develop resources on which both communities are dependent;
and to attract long-term development assistance from other sources.
18.       IFC's first investment in Cyprus was in a cement company in 1972.
The company has since become a leader in the island's successful export drive.
IFC has most recently invested in an asbestos cement pipe plant and is cur-
rently exploring other industrial investment opportunities on the island.
As of June 30, 1977, gross commitments totalled $3.6 million, of which $2.8
million were still held by IFC. Details of IFC investments in Cyprus are
given in Annex II.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
19.       Agriculture in the Economy.   Before 1974, agriculture accounted for
about 18 percent of GDP. The growth of agricultural value-added in the 1970s
had been somewhat uneven as a result of serious droughts in 1972 and 1973.
Agriculture contributed about 70 percent of all commodity exports, and employed
some 36 percent of the island's labor force. The events of 1974 had a profound
effect on the sector. With the division of the island, 80 percent of the
irrigated citrus plantations, 65 percent of the dryland cereal growing areas,
45 percent of the olives and 30 percent of the carob trees lie in the northern
part of Cyprus under Turkish Cypriot control. The whole of the vine-growing
area and most of the potato-growing and deciduous fruit areas lie in the
southern part under Government control. The large-scale displacements of
population included many thousands of farming families of both communities.



- 6 -
20.       To meet the new situation, the Emergency Economic Action Plan
for 1975 and 1976 for southern Cyprus emphasized quick-yielding small-scale
schemes that would absorb local and displaced labor in the short-run, and
provided for expanded financial assistance on concessionary terms to farmers.
These programs and policies enabled some 7,000 displaced persons to find
employment in the agricultural sector by late 1975, and an additional 6,000
by the end of 1976. Government policies thus contributed to the remarkable
recovery of agriculture in 1976, when value-added in the sector rose 20 per-
cent in real terms. Agriculture's contribution again reached 18 percent of
a lower GDP, but now with only 23 percent of the labor force thus employed.
Agriculture accounted for only 37 percent of commodity exports, owing to both
the loss of important export-producing areas and a rapid growth of manufac-
tured exports. Citrus, potatoes and grapes remained the chief agricultural
exports.
21.       The Government's short-term plans to absorb displaced labor through
the agricultural sector and expand agricultural production and exports have
met with some success. They will be continued through concessional financing
assistance for cereal and vegetable produce, and livestock production and
marketing. The Government is also giving priority to ongoing projects which
in the longer run will help to both absorb and retain farm labor, such as the
development of marginal land by soil conservation and reclamation measures,
pasture improvement, use of improved seeds, planting of tree crops, replanting
of vines, and completing the distribution works for irrigation from existing
and new dams and boreholes.
22.       Land Tenure.   The pattern of land tenure in Cyprus is a product
of tradition, inheritance laws, and population shifts and pressures. In the
project area, private parties own 60 percent of the land, the state 39 per-
cent, and communal ownership accounts for the remaining 1 percent. Joint
ownership of private farms is common, as is dual ownership, where the land
and the other productive farm assets belong to different persons. Holdings
are small, hardly exceeding three hectares in either the irrigated areas or
the vine-growing areas on the mountain slopes. They exhibit a high degree
of fragmentation, with small, irregularly shaped and scattered plots.
23.       These features have inhibited agricultural development, particularly
in the mountainous and more remote regions of the Troodos Massif where Pitsilia
is located, proving unfavorable for mechanization, irrigation, soil conserva-
tion and other improvement works. To mitigate these problems, the Government
established an authority in 1972 to organize, direct and coordinate all land
consolidation activities on the island. Significant progress has been made,
with five projects completed by 1974. In addition, the Government has planned
thirteen new projects (for dry and irrigated areas), six of which are within
the Bank-financed Paphos Irrigation Project (Loan 960-CY).
24.       Water Resources.   The rivers of Cyprus flow only during the winter
and spring months, while the limited groundwater is normally found at sub-
stantial depths and has thus been difficult to exploit. The main hope for
extending irrigation lies with surface water utilization. Due to the steep
topography, unfavorable geology, high erosion, and irregular river flows
requiring high storage capacities, harnessing surface water is both difficult
and expensive.



25.     Under the Cyprus Waterworks Law all new groundwater and all water
running to waste from rivers is the property of the Government, while water
from wells, springs or small streams used prior to the Law is privately owned.
Whereas the collective utilization of such privately owned water had been the
responsibility of private Irrigation Associations (IA), the Government, to
complement its land consolidation efforts, is now actively discouraging the
existence of LAs.
26.       Institutions.  The agricultural sector is primarily the respons-
ibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Cooperative Central Bank. The
Ministry has six well-staffed functional departments and is fully competent to
implement the proposed project. The various departments are (i) Agriculture,
which includes the Extension Service and the Soil Conservation Division; (ii)
Water Development (WDD), responsible for planning, designing and implementing
water resource development projects; (iii) Geological Survey; (iv) Meteorology;
(v) the Land Consolidation Authority; and (vi) the Agricultural Research In-
stitute.
27.       Until the events of 1974, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
Cooperative Banks had developed as the hub of a network of credit societies
which existed in virtually every village in Cyprus. Though information on the
activities of the Turkish Cypriot Cooperative Bank is now limited, it is esti-
mated that Cyprus has about 400 credit societies and 44 saving banks, which
together provide 85 percent of all short-term agricultural credit. The inter-
est rate charged by societies to farmers does not exceed 8.5 percent per annum.
There are over 60 societies for marketing, storing and processing produce and
for handling cereals.
28.       The Greek Cypriot Cooperative Bank today finances cooperative pack-
ing, storage, processing and farm machinery servicing facilities; makes bulk
purchases of fertilizers, seeds, and insecticides; arranges insurance services
for member societies, and operates various Government loan schemes with funds
made available by the Loan Commissioners (a Government committee operating
through the Treasury). Under this arrangement, the Cooperative Bank pays 3
percent interest to the Loan Commissioners and makes medium and long-term
loans at as little as 4.5 percent for irrigation works, improvements in water
use, soil conservation, land consolidation, boats and equipment for fishermen,
and various minor projects.
29.       Market Prospects.  Prior to 1950, the rural population of Cyprus
was for the most part engaged in subsistence agriculture on small family
farms with little diversification of crop production and little irrigation
of cultivated areas. Since then, however, a strong impetus to commercial
production of fruit, grapes and wine, vegetables, milk and meat has been
provided by the presence of British and United Nations troops, the develop-
ment of tourism and an export market for citrus, early potatoes, vegetables,
grapes, wines and sherry. A substantial trade with the United Kingdom has
been built up in part by exploiting a climate favorable for producing certain
fruits and vegetables earlier than other sources of supply. With Cyprus'



associate status in the EEC, and on the evidence of its 1976 success in mar-
keting agricultural products in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa,
growth in demand for Cyprus' produce should be sustained for some time to
come.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       Project History.  Since 1973, it has been the Government's policy to
foster economic development in areas in central and south Cyprus which are
less developed and poorer than those in the north, west and east of the island.
In implementing this policy of balanced island-wide development, the Government
has been trying to grapple with the difficult problem of increasing rural
incomes and improving the quality of life in those agricultural areas which
had been neglected due to their more difficult environment and relative isola-
tion. It is against this background, that the Government requested the Bank's
assistance in preparing and then financing the proposed integrated rural devel-
opment project in the Pitsilia region, located in the central Troodos Mountains.
31.       To this end, in late 1973 the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, and the Planning Bureau, with assistance from the Ministries of
Education, Health, and Interior began preparation of a project proposal.
Their planning papers were incorporated into a project preparation report
which, with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, was submitted
to the Bank in October 1976. Following additional Bank guidance on final
project design, particularly on the crucial institutional aspects for integ-
rated development, the project was appraised in two stages, in December 1976
and March 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington in July 1977. The
Cyprus delegation was led by Dr. A. Papasolomontos, Director General, Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and included representatives of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Treasury, and the Planning
Bureau.
32.       Project Area.  The inhabitants of the Pitsilia area are among Cyprus'
poorest, with a per capita income estimated in 1974 of US$310. With Cyprus'
GNP per capita then estimated at US$1,180, they are among the poverty group for
the island. The region contains 49 villages with a population estimated at
about 21,000, in an area of 61,100 hectares. The region lies mainly at eleva-
tions of between 500 and 1600 meters. The topography is particularly rugged
with a mountainous terrain dissected by numerous streams and deep valleys. As
a result, farming is difficult on limited patches of flat or terraced lands,
and village connecting roads are of a low standard with many of them unpaved.
Although housing is adequate, it is much poorer than in most parts of the
island; many villages suffer from an unsatisfactory supply of domestic water.
Similarly, water for irrigation purposes is both difficult to obtain and expen-
sive to exploit. Though elementary schooling is available in most villages,
because of outmigration, enrollment is declining, with many schools now small
enough to warrant consolidation into larger more efficient institutions. Simi-
larly, health facilities are insufficient, inadequately equipped and often



- 9 -
ill-suited to providing required services, with the result that residents are
forced to seek assistance some distance away in the already crowded facilities
of Nicosia and Limassol.
33.       The region is characterized by low crop yields and poor standards of
animal husbandry. Most farms are family operated, and use little hired labor.
The use of fertilizers is limited and as a result of the mountainous nature of
the terrain, there is little mechanization. Because of these difficult condi-
tions, the region suffers from high outmigration, with many young people either
leaving permanently for the more prosperous urban centers, or supplementing
their farm incomes by commuting to employment in the nearby cities. Only 21
percent of the farmers consider farming a full time or primary occupation, with
67 percent considering it a secondary job. Roughly half of family income is
from off-farm work, though even with such non-farm incomes, the 1974 per capita
income in the region, was particularly low (paragraph 32).
34.       Project Description.   The objective of the project is to stimulate
this economically depressed region, to increase the level of incomes by provid-
ing the incentives to develop the limited productive resources available, and
to improve the quality of life through upgraded social amenities and services.
The Government also hopes that this first multisectoral project will help limit
persistent outmigration from the region and can also serve as a successful
model for application in other less-developed regions of Cyprus.
35.       To achieve these objectives, the project provides for complementary
investments in productive, social and institutional infrastructure.
Productive Investments
(a) water resource development, including an earth-filled dam, bore-
holes, and pond storage, to irrigate about 1,150 ha through about
70 minor schemes, including 150 ha rehabilitated;
(b) construct soil conservation works, including substantial terrac-
ing because of steep terrain, on about 2,550 ha;
(c) complete land consolidation on about 500 ha;
(d) construct about 290 km of farm access roads;
(e) develop on-farm water distribution system on about 1,000 ha;
(f) provide incremental credit for working capital, agro-processing
such as pork and milk processing units, almond shelling, bee-
keeping and the like; and
(g) upgrade about 50 km of existing roads linking villages, and vil-
lages with trunk roads.



- 10 -
Social Investments
(h) construct two central elementary schools by consolidating about
twelve smaller schools to provide educational opportunities to
about 500 pupils;
(i) upgrade two existing rural health centers, three existing rural
health sub-centers, and modify existing facilities at the
Kyperounda sanatorium to provide for a 20-bed in-patient facility;
(j) upgrade domestic water supply facilities in about 15 villages;
and
(k) upgrade 20 km of existing village streets.
Institutional Investments
(1) reorganize and focus the agricultural extension facilities, and
construct a farmer training center;
(m) upgrade two existing veterinary health facilities;
(n) promote applied research on the specific agricultural problems of
the area; and
(o) conduct studies to (i) evaluate the system of investment financing
for the agricultural sector in Cyprus; (ii) assess the future
development opportunities in underdeveloped rural areas of Cyprus;
(iii) monitor and evaluate the effects of the project; and (iv)
review engineering, agricultural and other aspects of the project.
36.        Funds are also provided for the use of consultants in helping to
carry out the above-mentioned studies. Approximately 6 man months of consul-
tant services would be involved in the financing study, about 7 man months in
the study of future rural development opportunities, about 6 man months in the
project evaluation study, and about 6 man months in the review aspects of the
project. Costs per man month are estimated at $6,000, which are considered
reasonable.
37.       Project Costs and Financing.    The total estimated cost of the proj-
ect is US$21.0 million, of which about US$11.8 million is foreign exchange.
Contingencies total $7 million with price contingencies 33 percent and physical
contingencies 17 percent of base cost.

The proposed Bank loan of US$10.0 million (about 48 percent of the
total cost) would finance about 85 percent of the estimated foreign exchange
cost of the project. The balance of the foreign exchange costs will be made
available to the Government by the Council of Europe while the local costs,
which total $9.2 million, will be met by the Government. The Bank loan would
cover about $9.1 million of the costs for the productive components including
the dam and the minor irrigation works, and about $0.9 million of the costs
of the social and institutional components. Agricultural credit and working
capital needs will be met by the Government (Schedule 2 Part A(f)).
38.       Project Implementation.   The planning, design, construction and
maintenance of the project's only "major work", the Xyliatos Dam, would be
the responsibility of the Water Development Department (WDD).   Between 1960
and 1975 WDD designed and constructed 67 dams, 18 of which were comparable
in size to Xyliatos. Development of newly irrigated areas through the use of
ponds and boreholes, as well as irrigation rehabilitation, are the responsi-
bility of- the WDD which has to agree with the local Irrigation Division (ID)
or Irrigation Association (IA) on the terms and conditions for financing 1/
before beginning construction of a water source and its conveyance system
1/   An ID is a group of at least ten land owners who share and maintain
defined parts of the irrigation system. An IA is a group of at least
seven water owners (see paragraph 25).



- 12 -
(including the size and location of the water source). The social and
institutional components would be implemented by the relevant Ministry or
Department. These responsibilities for implementation are traditional in
Cyprus, have proved successful to date, and are therefore considered appro-
priate for the project.
39.       In order to be able to effectively select from among the many in-
vestment schemes which will be proposed by the local communities, a review
procedure will be used including eligibility criteria with rate of return
cut-off points for certain categories of investment: (i) a mini-feasibility
study will be prepared for each pond and borehole scheme; (ii) in the case of
such pond and borehole schemes, the cutoff economic rate of return used will
be 8 percent; (iii) in the case of rainfed soil conservation, a maximum cost
will be established to ensure a cutoff rate of return of 10 percent; (iv) in
the case of village roads, the cutoff rate of return will be 10 percent; (v)
land consolidation schemes will be carried out where at least 26 contiguous
hectares of land are to be newly irrigated (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07 (b),
Schedule 6). The Project Director will cause up-to-date records of costs and
returns to be kept and in accordance with a set of key indicators, will submit
progress reports on the project to the Bank on a six-month basis (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 3.09).
40.       The Government has agreed that:   (i) existing component design
criteria and staffing and equipment criteria will be maintained and that no
changes will be made in the design standards of farm and village roads without
prior consultation with the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(a) (D) and
(F)); (ii) the health, education, and extension facilities in the project
would be adequately staffed and funded (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (b);
(iii) the repair, maintenance, and replacement of facilities and equipment
in the project would be diligently carried out (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03);
and (iv) the agricultural research in the project area would be specific to
the region's needs in terms of both crop varieties and technology (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.01(a) (J)).
41.       Project Administration.  In view of the multisectoral nature of
the project, which necessitates the involvement of six different ministries,
the Government has agreed to create a special interministerial organization
to ensure a fully integrated approach. Formal coordination will be the
responsibility of the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources (MANR), who as Project Coordinator, will chair the Project
Coordination Committee. He will be assisted by a senior staff member from
MANR who will be the full time de facto project manager.
42.       To coordinate project policies and operational decisions, two commit-
tees will be created. The Project Policy Committee will provide the policy
framework for the project and ensure that the various project components are
conceived in an integrated manner. This Committee would be chaired by the
Minister of Agriculture. The Director General of MANR (as Project Coordinator)
and the Directors General or other senior representatives of the Planning
Bureau, the Ministries of Finance, Interior, Health, and Education, and the



- 13 -
Commission for Cooperative Development would be its members. A second commit-
tee, the Project Coordination Committee, would be responsible for all opera-
tional activities related to the project. Chaired by the Project Coordinator
and in collaboration with his full-time project assistant, this Committee
would be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the project.
Its members would include representatives from the four relevant departments
of MANR, namely Water Development, Agriculture, Land Consolidation, Geological
Survey, and representatives of the Ministries of Health, Education and Interior.
The Committee's tasks would include setting up the project organization, and
initiating discussions with villages on specific ponds, boreholes and other
schemes in which the villagers participate financially, as well as setting up
a project monitoring system. To ensure the timely and effective functioning
of this organization, the Government has agreed that it will be created and
appropriately staffed by November 30, 1977, and that the full-time project
assistant coordinator will be selected in consultation with the Bank (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.06).
43.       Cost Recovery.  Cyprus has a rather unique system whereby, instead
of financing 100 percent of the physical infrastructure for agricultural
development and seeking recovery through project charges, wherever appropriate
it makes the beneficiaries share a portion of the costs of both agricultural
investments of a productive nature, and social infrastructure investments,
including schools, health facilities, and village water supply. It does so,
by providing its share of the investment (called a "grant") and extending
"loans" to the farmers to finance their portion of the investment costs.
"Loans" are provided either directly to farmers, or through the village com-
munity, on concessionary terms. Interest and repayment periods vary according
to the type of investment involved and the income level of the farmer, and the
Government bears a greater proportion of the costs of social infrastructure
than of productive investments. This system is well established in Cyprus,
having been in existence for fifteen years.
44.       The Government's financing terms on "loans" for infrastructure, such
as the minor schemes, presently vary between 4.5 and 6 percent, and include a
grace period of up to 2 years depending on the crop. Due to the 5 to 7 year
gestation period for the tree crops to be produced extensively in the project
area, however, such a grace period would not be sufficient, even allowing for
intercropping in the early years. The farmers' cash flows would make it ex-
tremely difficult for them to service their debt and might well inhibit par-
ticipation in the project. To provide incentives to farmers to agree to such
investments and provide their share of the costs through the above-described
"loan" financing arrangements, the Government has agreed to: (i) lengthen
the grace and repayment periods and to capitalize interest during the grace
period, to better suit the cash flow sequences of the proposed cropping pat-
tern; (ii) raise the interest rate for on-farm systems and soil conservation
works to the top of the existing rate scale; (iii) adopt fixed terms and
conditions for financing of productive investments in the project area so
as to eliminate possible delays which currently result from negotiations
of terms and conditions between the Government and the local beneficiaries



- 14 -
(paragraph 38). Such a policy will entail only a marginally higher fiscal
burden on the Government (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07(a), Schedule 5). In
addition, the Government has agreed to complete by December 31, 1978, a
national study to evaluate the system of investment financing for the agri-
cultural sector, the recommendations of which would be discussed and agreed
to with the Bank and implemented nationally by July 1, 1980 (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.08). In order to avoid a too abrupt application of the new terms
and conditions, and in order to be able to take into account within the
project life the recommendations of the aforementioned study, the new terms
and conditions will be applied gradually over a period of four years (which
represents the estimated period necessary for the project to complete devel-
opment).
45.       The operation and maintenance costs, for most project components,
will be fully borne by the beneficiaries. For the dam, WDD will apply a water
charge which includes a portion for full recovery of operation and maintenance
costs. Government has agreed that this charge will be reviewed not less than
once every two years and that any change in operation and maintenance costs
will be reflected accordingly in adjustments to the water charge (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 4.03). For the ponds and boreholes the operation and maintenance
costs will be fully borne by the beneficiaries. For the health and school
facilities, the operation and maintenance costs will be partially or fully
borne by the village population. For village streets and the village water
supply, the operation and maintenance costs will be fully borne by the village
population. The cost of operating and maintaining village and farm roads will
be fully borne by the Government; partial cost recovery would be indirectly
achieved through gasoline and other road user charges.
46.       Procurement and Disbursement.   The civil works, distribution system,
and equipment for the Xyliatos Dam, costing about US$5.8 million will be pro-
cured under international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidelines. The civil works for storage ponds, soil con-
servation works, health, school and training facilities, amounting to US$9
million, will be too scattered and of too small a scale to attract foreign
competition, and will therefore be procured under local competitive bidding
(LCB). Local tenders are open to both foreign and local bidders. The water
distribution systems of minor irrigation schemes, soil conservation works,
rehabilitation, village water supply, on-farm investments, village streets and
farm roads, totalling US$4.9 million, will be constructed by force account.
Specifications and bidding documents for those items procured under ICB, and
for those contracts under LCB whose value exceeds US$250,000 will be approved
by the Bank before tendering. The dam and its distribution system will be a
single contract (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
47.       The proposed Bank loan wiil be disbursed over a period of five and
a half years against: 40 percent of the total cost of civil works; 100 per-
cent of the foreign cost of imported materials and equipment, and 100 percent
of local costs (ex-factory) for locally manufactured materials and equipment;
and 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultants. Disbursement



- 15 -
requests will be supported by full documentation except for civil works per-
formed under force account which will be made against a statement of expendi-
tures, the supporting documents of which will be retained by the executing
agency and be available for review by project supervision missions.
48.       Project Benefits.   The project will contribute to significant in-
creases in the productive infrastructure of the Pitsilia region. The most
important of these will be the 72 percent increase in irrigated area, in
addition to improvement of dryland farming through soil conservation works,
rehabilitation, farm roads, land consolidation, and an improved village roads
network. The project will increase production of vines, potatoes, vegetables,
deciduous fruit trees and citrus, which will be mostly for domestic markets,
with only small quantities of cherries, nuts and citrus for export. No market-
ing problems are envisaged. Though their benefits are not quantifiable, the
project's social and institutional investments will improve the services pro-
vided in the region (health, schooling, water supply, village streets and
farmer training), thus reducing the need for beneficiaries to look to the
cities for such services. By providing economic and social incentives to
farmers in the region, the project will induce young people to look on farming
in the area as an attractive alternative to off-farm work in the cities. With-
out an effort of this kind, outmigration will continue unabated, with signi-
ficant reductions in the production of deciduous fruits, grapes, and olives
in particular, a further decline in relative living standards for those who
remain in the region, and additional burdens on the Government in the form
of increased needs for social infrastructure and employment creation in urban
areas.
49.       The project is expected to provide some benefits to the entire
population of Pitsilia, estimated at about 21,000 people, although the number
of beneficiaries varies with each component. Water resource development will
benefit approximately 3,500 farmers, village water supply some 5,000 persons,
while health facilities and village streets are each expected to benefit
10,000 persons. Village roads are expected to benefit 100,000 persons, in-
cluding those who pass through but are not residents of Pitsilia. At full
development, the net income of area beneficiaries will be about US$610 per
capita, an increase of about 100 percent over current per capita incomes with
a much smaller proportion of it from off-farm work than now. The main contri-
bution of the project to Cyprus, however, may well be as a first example of
a fully integrated, economically viable set of investments which could ulti-
mately be applied to other less-favored regions on the island.
50.       The economic rate of return for the entire project is nearly 12.0
percent while for the productive components only it is 13 percent. The rates
of return for the main components are:    Xyliatos Dam (14 percent of base cost),
about 14 percent; pond schemes (27 percent of base cost), about 10 percent;
borehole schemes (14 percent of base cost), about 15 percent; village roads (6
percent of base cost), about 10 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates that
the rates of return for the whole project, calculated with costs raised and
benefits lowered by 10 percent, remain satisfactory. The topography, the
geology, and most important the supply of water, are all variables which carry
the possibility of significant variation in costs.



- 16 -
51.       Risks.  The principal risk lies in the area of management coordina-
tion. The proposed organizational structure (described in paragraphs 41 and
42) would mitigate this by improving both coordination and control of the
project. Another possible risk concerns groundwater availability and as a
result systematic tests are being carried out for one full dry season, to
determine the levels of safe withdrawals for irrigation, before the water
source distribution systems are implemented.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article II, Section IV(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex III.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 729 Nicosia Sewerage Prolect: US$2.7 million loan of April 5, 1971.
Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31, 1975;
(current) September 30, 1977.
The system was about 90 percent complete in July 1974, when construc-
tion was interrupted. The proposed treatment plant is located in the area
under the control of the Turkish Cypriots. Should continuing efforts to reach
a mutually satisfactory solution with the Turkish Cypriot administration prove
unsuccessful, the Nicosia Sewerage Board will consider completion of the proj-
ect by constructing a temporary low-cost treatment plant in the area under
their jurisdiction, with some assistance to be provided by the Government, so
that the system can be put into operation in 1978. Meanwhile, the Closing
Date will need extension.
Loan No. 730 Famagusta Sewerage Project: US$1.9 million loan of April 5, 1971.
Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31, 1975;
(current) March 31, 1978.
The project was about 90 percent complete by July 1974, when con-
struction was interrupted. The project site lies completely in Famagusta,
which is under the control of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Completion
of this project therefore depends on a political settlement.
Loan No. 904 First Highway Project: US$5.4 million loan of June 12, 1973.
Effective Date: September 12, 1973. Closing Date: (original) December 31,
1976; (current) December 31, 1979.
The construction element of Loan 904-CY, a new four-lane divided
Nicosia-Morphou highway, was interrupted by the events of July/August 1974
shortly after its start in May 1974; the Government is taking steps to ter-
minate the construction contract. The Government asked for and the Bank
agreed to a change of loan description that allows the use of up to US$3.6
million to make up the foreign exchange shortfall for the construction of
a new two-lane Nicosia-Limassol highway.
Loan No. 960 Paphos Irrigation Project: US$14.0 million loan of January 30,
1974. Effective Date: October 10, 1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Engineering of project works is nearing completion. Construction
contract for main canal has been awarded and earthwork excavation and con-
creting of culverts has started. Documents for other contracts are due in
the Bank for review shortly, and it is expected that most construction con-
tracts would be awarded during 1977. Presently, cost overrun is estimated
at 22%, but project cost will be reestimated later in 1977 following award
of major construction contracts.

Loan No. 1278 Second Cyprus Development Bank Project: US$6.0 million loan
of June 3, 1976. Effective Date: October 1, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,
1981.
Commitments and disbursements are projected to be more rapid than
foreseen at the time of the appraisal, reflecting the surging economic re-
covery in which CDB is playing an active part. After some delays due to the
extent of the required preparatory work, commitments under the $0.75 million
small-scale industry component of loan 1278-CY began in mid-1977; there is a
substantial demand for this type of loan. The management and staff of CDB are
capable, and have developed an excellent project appraisal and supervision
capability, often also used by the Government and commercial banks.
Loan No. 1344 Second Highway ProJect: US$10.0 million loan of December 31,
1976. Closing Date: April 30, 1982.
Due to the lack of co-financing, the new Nicosia-Limassol highway
project although designed to include some four-lane sections was originally
approved as a two-lane highway. In May of this year, however the Kuwait Fund
approved a $3.8 million loan to cover the foreign exchange shortfall required
to allow construction of a new Nicosia-Limassol highway with four-lane sections
where economically justified. This will be achieved by the Fund providing
parallel financing for a separate continuous section from Nicosia southward
for about 21 km. The proceeds of the Bank loan will then be applied to the
remaining part of the highway, including four and two-lane sections. This
loan is expected to be declared effective prior to October 14, 1977.
