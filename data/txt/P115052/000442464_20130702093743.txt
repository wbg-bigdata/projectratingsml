1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, Indonesia experienced a sustained and uninterrupted
reduction in poverty. The share of the population below the national poverty line dropped
from over 40% in 1976 to less than 12% in 1996. However, the Asian financial crisis, which
started in July 1997, wiped out much of these gains. By 1998, the poverty rate had doubled,
to over 24%, and the number of Indonesians living below the poverty line increased to almost
50 million. The financial crisis not only caused economic hardship but also led to greater
demand for public participation in government affairs, both by individual citizens and by
local sub-national governments. In 1999, the National Parliament passed two new
decentralization laws which shifted many responsibilities for government affairs from the
center to the provincial and district governments, and also provided these sub-national
governments with the financing needed to implement their newfound responsibilities.
In 2007 the Government of Indonesia (GOI) demonstrated its commitment to community-led
development and to mitigating the effects of the Global Financial Crisis by launching the
National Program for Community Empowerment (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan
Masyarakat, PNPM) through the scale up of the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) and
the Urban Poverty Project (UPP). At the national level, a steering committee (Pokja
Pengendali), chaired by the Coordinating Ministry of People’s Welfare (MENKO KESRA),
provides policy guidance and oversight. The group is chaired by the Coordinating Minister
for Community Welfare and its members include representatives from the Ministry of Home
Affairs, the National Planning Board (BAPPENAS), the Ministry of Finance, and relevant
line ministries. Coinciding with the creation of PNPM, GoI also established the PNPM
Support Facility (PSF) to harmonize and coordinate development partner efforts, including
the planning and targeting of financial assistance, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the
program’s operations and impact. The PSF is managed by a Joint Management Committee
(JMC) with representatives from GoI agencies and developing partners contributing at least
US$1 million to PNPM projects. The Bank co-chaired the JMC from its inception until
February 2013 when BAPPENAS became the sole chair.
Since 2008, the Bank has financed PNPM in rural areas through five projects, PNPM Rural I,
II, III, IV, and PNPM 2012-2015 (Table 1). The focus of this ICR is PNPM Rural III (“the
project?), which supported the national scale-up of the program, and was approved in March
2010. The project would cover 4,791 sub-districts (kecamatan) in 32 provinces, 4,371 of
which were already included in its predecessor projects. PNPM Rural III supported GoI’s
poverty reduction and community development policy and was also fully consistent with the
Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2009-2012, which emphasized engagements
with government counterparts and other stakeholders on critical governance and institutional
challenges. At the time of appraisal, the total cost of PNPM Rural III was estimated at
US$1,337 million, which was higher than in previous years because PNPM had reached
national coverage. The project would be financed from the proceeds of an IBRD Loan
(US$785m) and from the national budget (US$552m).

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
Project Development Objective
The PAD stated that “The project development objective (PDO) is for villagers in PNPM
rural locations to benefit from improved socio-economic and local governance conditions?.

The key performance indicators (KPIs) for the project outcomes were:4
1. Improved HH expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social services in a
   minimum of 4,100 sub-districts in 2010
2. EIRRs >30 % for major rural infrastructure types
3. Through a MDG/Community Conditional Cash Transfers pilot (also known as PNPM
   Generasi), improved health indicators in minimum of 200 sub-districts in 6 provinces:
    Immunization coverage for 12-23 month olds increases by at least 10% points from
      65% in 2007 to 75% in 2010;
    Prenatal care visits increase by at least 10% points from 71% in 2007 to 81% in 2010;
    Deliveries assisted by trained professionals increase by at least 10% points from 67%
      in 2007 to77% in 2010.5
4. >80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
   governance
Intermediate results indicators
The PAD identified 12 results indicators, aimed at measuring intermediate results in four
areas (indicators are in brackets):
1. Villagers participate in a process to plan, select and manage basic social and economic
   infrastructure provided through block grants (participation rate of women and poorest
   community members in planning and decision-making meetings, percentage of agreed
   work plans completed each year, number/type of infrastructure works, economic and


4
     These performance indicators were taken from the PAD. The Loan Agreement itself did not list any key
     indicators.
5
     The Bank revised 2005 baseline values of 38%, 56% and 40% to 65%, 71% and 67%, respectively when
     2007 data became available.


                                                            2
   education and health subprojects/activities completed, percentage of infrastructure work
   evaluated as of high quality, percentages of infrastructure works for which O&M
   arrangements are in place and/or functioning)
2. Consultants at the national, provincial and district levels are providing assistance to
   communities and local governments to implement PNPM (percentage of local
   government councils provide funds and/or oversee PNPM, percentage of planned
   consultant positions are filled in and consultants are trained by the time the project begins
   its 2010 socialization and planning cycle)
3. Project stakeholders use results of M&E activities and studies to improve project
   performance (percentage of PNPM Rural sub-districts in audit sample size, percentage of
   sampled villages that receive socialization material packages for PNPM in 2010)
4. Project management teams established in a timely manner and functioning (number of
   units established by March every year, facilitators managed and paid monthly,
   Kecamatan grants disbursed and accounted for)


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The immediate beneficiaries of the project were : (i) some 31 million villagers living in about
4,371 kecamatan already covered by PNPM Rural II, and (ii) approximately 3 million
villagers living in 420 kecamatan that were newly created by administrative restructuring.
The population in all 4,791 target kecamatan would benefit both directly and indirectly from
improved community infrastructure and services, grant assistance for poorest and most
vulnerable groups (such as scholarships and training courses), and improved access to
microcredit––all planned and implemented through a community-driven development (CDD)
process. Secondary beneficiaries would be (a) the Directorate of General for Community and
Village Empowerment in the Ministry of Home Affairs (the implementing agency), which
would benefit from increased capacity, (b) village level facilitators and partner agencies
providing implementation support, (c) the kabupaten governments in which the 4,791 target
kecamatan were located, who would benefit, inter alia, from training, field studies, and
institutional strengthening aimed at improving their planning capabilities, and (d) village
representative councils (Badan Perwakilan Desa or BPD), which would benefit from
technical assistance and advisory services in the process of establishing and strengthening
their role in channeling CDD funds to appropriate community activities and investments.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Kecamatan Grants (US$1,186.8 million, 58% Bank financing)
This component would provide block grants to participating kecamatan to finance activities
identified in village plans, including: (a) specific high-priority infrastructure investments, (b)
microcredit loans for women’s groups, and (c) social safety programs for the benefit of the
poorest and most vulnerable groups or individuals. Kecamatan grants would not finance
activities on the project’s negative list (such as land, religious buildings or government
offices). Each participating kecamatan would receive an annual block grant of IDR 900
million to IDR 3 billion depending on population, poverty incidence and remoteness, to


                                                3
finance investments in one or more of the above categories, in accordance with their
community development plans (with a maximum allocation of 25% to revolving loan funds
(RLF), provided that the village has a repayment rate of at least 80% of active RLFs). In
addition to the core sub-district planning and block grant scheme, PNPM Rural has special
projects funded through grants from PSF, the most of important of which is PNPM Generasi,
an incentivized block grant scheme for the achievement of Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) related to health and education.
Component 2: Facilitation Support (US$78.5 million, 97% Bank financing)
This component would support the development of community capacities for planning and
project management through support for sub-district (kecamatan) technical and social
facilitators and district (kabupaten) facilitators. It would also include activities to strengthen
inter-village organizations and forums, and local government coordination and oversight.
Component 3: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance (US$41.7 million,
55% Bank financing)
The project would be managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the (the Directorate-
General of Village Community Empowerment (DG-PMD or simply “PMD?) in the Ministry
of Home Affairs. The PMU would hire consultants and facilitators to assist in project
implementation. Technical assistance would be provided through National Management
Consultants (NMC) at the central level, and provincial Regional Management Consultants
(RMC), with RMC offices in the participating district, facilitators at the kecamatan level and
village cadres. In addition, this component would finance strategic development of PNPM,
the project’s monitoring and evaluation program, and an enhanced audit program that
provides capacity development support for district government auditors. This component
would also finance most project training other than community-level training.
Component 4: Project Management Support (US$30.0m, 7% Bank financing)
The component would provide support to PNPM’s special programs, which include pilot
projects, government add-ons, and crisis-response activities (natural disasters, conflict, and
financial). Most of these operational costs would be covered by the Government from central
and local government budgets.

1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised, but the scope, costs, and amount of Bank financing were
increased through Additional Financing (AF) and GoI also increased its funding to the project.
1.7 Other significant changes
PNPM Rural was conceived as a flexible platform for community development that could be
readily adapted in case of crisis and natural disaster. There were three additional financings
that were approved during project: Post-Crisis Support, Disaster Management Support, and
PNPM Generasi.
Additional financing for post-crisis support. In 2011, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) provided a grant in an amount of US$32.7 million to
GoI to finance additional block grants and facilitation for 433 kecamatan in seven provinces
identified by BAPPENAS as being most at risk from the global financial crisis. These
provinces were: Bengkulu, Jawa Tengah, Jawa Timur, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara Timur,
Gorontalo, and Sulawesi Tengah. The kecamatan were selected on the basis of (i) high


                                                4
expand the poverty incidence, and (ii) good performance during prior PNPM cycles. The
grant was channeled through the PSF and became effective in July 2011. With this AF the
project produced additional infrastructure outputs, as presented in Table A2.2 (page 20).
Delinking of Generasi and post-disaster grants. At the time of appraisal, it was envisaged
that part of the proceeds of the US$785 million loan would be allocated to co-finance PNPM
Generasi, a pilot block grant scheme aimed at accelerating the achievement of lagging
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in maternal and child health and universal access to
basic education. In 2010, the project financed US$ 24.4 million of “Generasi? block grants in
164 kecamatan (of total 212 Generasi participating kecamatan). In August 2010, shortly after
the PNPM Rural III loan was declared effective, GOI received a US$10.2 million grant from
development partners in PSF to support PNPM Generasi scale-up. For administrative
purposes, the Bank decided to delink this pilot project from PNPM Rural III in December
2012. For the same reason, a US$13.9 million grant for disaster management support––which
GOI received in March 2011 and was originally also approved as Additional Financing to
PNPM Rural III –– was delinked from PNPM Rural III in November 2012 and continuous
implementation in 2013. Separate ICRs will be prepared for both projects.
Change to geographical scope. In 2011, the number of kecamatan covered by the original
project (excluding the Additional Financing) was increased by 229, from 4,791 to 5,020. Of
these, 178 were formerly financed by the Bank-supported program “Support for Poor and
Disadvantaged Areas? (SPADA); the project was closed in December 2011 and all 178 “ex-
SPADA? kecamatan were added to PNPM Rural III at the request of GoI. The remaining 51
kecamatan were newly created by of a split off from one or more of the original 4,791
kecamatan.

2.   Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of background analysis and lessons learned from previous projects. The
project was an expansion of the first and second PNPM Rural projects, which were being
implemented at the time of appraisal. Because these projects were performing well, the
design of PNPM Rural III was based on the design of PNPM Rural I and II, but with several
modifications to reflect lessons learned from their implementation:
 Provision of additional support for financial management. During implementation of
     PNPM Rural I and II, it became clear that communities needed more support to comply
     with financial management procedures and to address complaints about misuse of funds.
     The project therefore provided additional district-level consultants to oversee complaints
     handling systems and supervise financial management.
 Increased audit coverage. Research during the predecessor projects had shown that audit
     effectiveness increases when coverage reaches at least 20% of all participating sub-
     districts and audit findings are shared with the community and local government.
     Coverage of 20% and exit briefings were therefore included in project design.
 Restructuring of the micro-credit component. Although these activities were popular and
     repayment rates of revolving loan funds (RLFs) were relatively high, PMD was unable
     to support and administer RLFs sufficiently because there was no explicit design or
     oversight arrangements of the RLF activities. The project would therefore gradually



                                              5
    phase out RLFs and design alternative methods for providing the poor with access to
    financial services.


Assessment of project design. As indicated above, the project design followed the success-
ful models of CDD projects and incorporated lessons learned from previous PNPM Rural
projects. The project was also designed to help GoI implement a roadmap for the future
development of PNPM. At the time of project preparation in 2010, GoI had recently
completed the first of two phases i.e. the scale-up of PNPM to a nationwide program. This
resulted in a major increase in the financing requirements, which the project helped to meet.
In addition, the project’s design significantly increased training in supervision and project
implementation, especially in the area of financial management. The design of PNPM Rural
III also supported GoI with the implementation of the second phase of the roadmap, the key
features of which are: (i) increased responsibilities for local governments to co-finance
PNPM in their jurisdictions, (ii) increased collaboration with technical ministries, and (iii)
gradual inclusion of other CDD poverty reduction initiatives into PNPM.
Government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory processes. The
Government of Indonesia played a central role in developing a national CDD and poverty
alleviation program that merged the numerous projects that had previously operated at
community level. This approach was prepared with the involvement of stakeholders at the
central and sub-national level, including NGOs and community-based organizations. GoI’s
resolve to avoid delays in project implementation by pre-financing all block grants
demonstrated a major financial commitment.
Risks and risk mitigation measures. The project risk was rated as “moderate? after risk
mitigation, and this rating was deemed appropriate. Although the project risk analysis in the
PAD did not mention avoidable delays in budget approvals and consultant recruitment by GoI
as sources of risks, these risks were nonetheless taken into consideration during project
implementation.

2.2 Implementation
Factors outside the control of the government or the implementation agency
 Natural disasters and global financial crisis. During the project implementation period,
 kecamatan covered by PNPM Rural III were hit by volcanic eruptions and tsunamis and
 others were at risk from the fall-out of the global financial crisis. The project was required
 to mobilize additional financing at short notice.

Factors subject to the control of the government or the implementation agency
Positive factors
 Strong political commitment. The project was able to secure support at the highest levels of
 government. GoI’s commitment to improve service delivery to the poor was highlighted by
 its decisions to scale up the project significantly (from about 2,900 kecamatan to almost
 5,000 kecamatan) and thus create the world’s largest community-driven development
 program. The vast majority of participating district governments were willing to co-finance
 5-20% of the project cost from their own resources, and a substantial minority provided
 funds over and above this minimum required amount.


                                              6
    Flexibility. From the start the implementing agency and the Bank were willing to modify
    the design of the project in response to changing circumstances. For example, in 2011 block
    grant amounts were increased in kecamatan that were hit hardest by the economic downturn
    in 2010. The CDD design allowed the communities to put the available funds where it
    mattered most to them and to manage these funds directly.
    Effective anti-corruption strategy. Individuals and independent organizations in beneficiary
    communities used channels of communication established by the project (such as the
    complaints handling unit or individual facilitators) to report incidences of suspected
    corruption. Follow-up actions, including local government coordination and withholding of
    funds distribution, proved effective in combating corruption. Corruption largely consisted
    of small and isolated cases. However where corruption was systemic, for example in
    Sulawesi Tenggara and Maluku, GoI suspended the disbursement of block grants until PMD
    had taken corrective action.
    Pre-financing of block grants by GoI. During KDP and PNPM Rural I and II there were
    delays in the disbursement of block grants which impacted negatively on implementation.
    Government agreed to pre-finance all block grants from the national budget which were
    then reimbursed later from the loan.
Areas for Improvement
      Limited operational commitment by the implementing agency. In spite of strong
       political support, the implementing agency was initially unable to adequately manage
       the transition of PNPM from a relatively small project to a nationwide program, and
       responded late to the Bank’s request for corrective actions. There was, in particular, a
       need to more clearly define roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines between PMD,
       NMC, and RMCs. Pre-service and refresher training for facilitators was delivered late
       and was of poor quality. Throughout the project PMD did not have sufficient staff to
       effectively manage and oversee PNPM. Effectiveness of NMC support was problematic
       and an INT investigation into alleged fraud and corruption was substantiated (cf.
       Fiduciary Compliance).
      Ineffective facilitator management at provincial level. In the first stages of project
       implementation, some provinces were not transparent in the recruitment, selection,
       mobilization, and performance evaluation of facilitators. In addition, many facilitator
       positions were filled by insufficiently trained persons, or remained unfilled for long
       periods which were partly due to uncompetitive salaries. There were also indications of
       provincial government officials seeking to suppress complaints, prevent sanctions to
       corrupt facilitators, and misuse training budgets.
      Weaknesses in procurement procedures, practices, and oversight mechanism.
       Community procurement procedures and practices were often not transparent and only
       intended to comply with PNPM’s administrative procedures. As evidenced from BPKP
       procurement review and the Bank's ex-post review reports sometimes these procedures
       were not properly complied with and there might be evidence of mark-ups.
      Delays in disbursement. At the central level, there were avoidable delays in disburse-
       ment of funds, especially for Post-Crisis and Disaster Management Support. In addition,
       many local governments were late in releasing their counterpart funds which resulted in
       late completion of sub-projects.



                                                7
Mid-Term Review. The project did not carry out a Mid-Term Review, however, the
preparation of PNPM Rural IV which started in 2010 served as an opportunity to closely
review project implementation and institutional arrangements and agree with GOI on a set of
corrective actions. Component 1, Kecamatan block grants, which accounted for about 90% of
the project cost, was disbursed within 18 months from effectiveness.
Effectiveness of risk mitigation. Mitigation of project risks was generally good. The
specific risks related to pro-poor targeting and fiduciary controls were mitigated effectively
during implementation. However, risks related to project management were greater than
anticipated and led to intensify dialogue between GoI and development partners. It resulted in
the identification of five key areas to improve fiduciary management and governance which
were largely implemented during 2011-2012. The shortcomings did not fundamentally
undermine achievement of the project outcomes.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The project measured progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) using a
management information system (MIS), augmented by a series of qualitative and quantitative
surveys and the results of regular supervision missions.
(a)   M&E design. At the time of appraisal, a management information system was already
      in place to monitor and evaluate PNPM. The same system would be used to monitor and
      evaluate the implementation of PNPM Rural III. In addition, the PAD listed a series of
      surveys and studies that would be undertaken during project implementation. In
      agreement with GOI these evaluations were managed by PSF.
(b)   M&E implementation. MIS data were published on the project website
      (http://www.pnpm-perdesaan.co.id) and updated on a monthly basis until December
      2011.The MIS already had problems during the predecessor projects and was unable to
      cope with the national scale-up. No standardized reporting was being carried out, and
      the lack of reliable and timely information compromised the system’s usefulness. In
      2011, PMD requested AusAID to recruit a firm to improve the MIS; it is expected that
      this activity will be completed in the second half of 2013. The surveys and studies
      defined mentioned in Annex 3 of the PAD were all conducted before the project closing
      date.
(c)   M&E utilization. The utilization of the MIS was compromised by the fact that the
      system was unable to generate timely and reliable information. As a result, both GoI
      and the Bank relied more heavily on the findings of supervision missions and the
      planned surveys and studies to monitor and evaluate project implementation. Data
      collected from these sources helped the project to (i) identify and remedy quality
      problems and to incorporate better controls as the project progressed, (ii) fine-tune the
      targeting of resources to the areas with the greatest needs and to help achieve the
      greatest impacts, and (iii) improve control of fund flows and accountability for sub-
      grants.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
For the most part, safeguards compliance was rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory.
The project triggered safeguard policies related to environmental assessment (OD/BP 4.01),
natural habitats (OP/BP 4.04), indigenous peoples (OP/BP 4.10) and involuntary resettlement



                                               8
(OP/BP 4.12). Supervision missions confirmed that the project did not cause significant
adverse environmental or social impacts. The project did not finance land acquisition. Given
the small size the subprojects financed by the project, it was a priori expected that any
adverse social and environmental impacts of such subprojects would be small or negligible.
Indeed, the project generated substantial social and environmental benefits, especially
through investments in drainage, water supply and sanitation. Facilitators struggled to fill in
safeguards forms correctly but no evidence was found that this had negative impacts.
As to fiduciary compliance, the project encountered some problems with financial
management primarily because RLF groups were often unable to comply with FM guidelines,
especially those related to safekeeping and the dissemination of financial reports. The
recruitment of additional financial consultants at district level helped to mitigate these
problems. The project received an unqualified opinion from an external auditor in 2011 and
2012, and according to the aide memoire of June 2012, the project’s financial management
was generally acceptable.6 There were no serious procurement issues under the project and
corrective action was taken for deficiencies in facilitator recruitment. PMD’s procurement
capacity was flagged as weak which caused delays in 2012 in the recruitment of NMC and
RMCs.

Following an investigation, which substantiated allegations of misrepresentation and fraud in
the PNPM Rural III and IV projects, the World Bank concluded a Negotiated Resolution
Agreement with the NMC debarring the firm for three years. INT is currently investigating
allegations of misuse of funds in the designated account, and has conducted a forensic review
of the use of block grant funds in a sample of 12 sub-districts and villages across Indonesia.
In response to the risks identified by INT’s concluded and ongoing investigation, PNPM
Rural now includes a combination of strengthened internal controls and oversight
mechanisms, and social controls and downward accountability. Ministry of Home Affairs,
responsible for implementing PNPM Rural and related special programs, has determined to
set up a Joint Secretariat to improve coordination and programming between the core PNPM
Rural project and its special programs (e.g., PNPM Generasi).


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(a)     Transition arrangements. Not applicable.
(b)     Follow-up projects. In 2010, GoI requested the Bank to finance the Fourth National
        Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas. A loan for US$531.2 million
        was approved in July 2011. This was followed by a US$650 million loan for the
        National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas 2012-2015, which was
        approved in December 2012.
(c)     Future impact evaluation. Not applicable.

The PDO is deemed relevant since it complemented the Government’s efforts to alleviate
poverty in rural areas, empower local communities, and mitigate the potential effects of the
Global Financial Crisis. The project enabled the Government to scale up the program to reach
national scale and the additional financing for PNPM Generasi, Post Crisis, and Disaster
Management Support responded to expressed needs in health and education, anticipated
vulnerability of the 2010 financial crisis, and natural disaster reconstruction. GoI recently
confirmed its commitment to the program through the adoption of the PNPM Roadmap
which sets the program’s course beyond 2015, the end of the mandate of the current
administration.7 The Bank’s new CPS covering fiscal years 2013 to 2015 has a four-pronged
approach: pro-poor, pro-growth, pro-job, and pro-environment. PNPM Rural remains at the
center of the new CPS, with its CDD approach aiming to improve existing government
programs, to strengthen institutions and to improve the links between different levels of
government.
Therefore, at completion the project was still highly relevant to the objectives of both the
Bank and the Government of Indonesia.
Discussions were held during the implementation support missions and preparation for
PNPM Rural IV to confirm whether the project design was still appropriate and what
corrective actions were needed for the implementation challenges, particularly the capacity
constraints of PMD. With support from the steering committee, PMD acted on many of the
suggestions for improvement.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective
The objective of the project, to ensure that villagers in project locations were able to benefit
from improved socio-economic and local governance conditions, was successfully achieved
based on its key performance indicators:
    Improved HH expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social services in
     a minimum of 4,100 sub-districts in 2010. According to an impact evaluation finalized
     in 2011, during 2007-2009 the increase in the consumption rate of poor households in
     project locations was 9.1%, substantially higher than the target in the PAD (2.0%).
     Although the study period preceded the project it can be assumed that similar benefits
     would be derived from PNPM Rural III8
    EIRRs >30 % for major rural infrastructure types. A study undertaken in 2012 found
     that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of a sample of 48 small-scale
     infrastructure projects financed by PNPM during 2007-2011 ranged from 35% to 50%,
     which was substantially higher than that the targeted EIRR of 30%.9
    Through the MDG/Community Conditional Cash Transfers pilot, improved health
     indicators in a minimum of 200 sub-districts in 6 provinces. The PNPM Generasi
     impact evaluation shows increases of 10-11% in immunization coverage (for 12-23
     month olds), prenatal care visits, and deliveries assisted by trained professionals in

        kecamatan covered by PNPM Generasi during the 30-month evaluation period between
        2007 and 2010 period10. Although there was no subsequent impact evaluation the team
        had ample evidence to assume that the impacts measured over this period would be
        similar, if not larger, in expansion locations. This is based on the findings of the impact
        evaluation that PNPM Generasi had largest impacts in areas with low health and
        education performance. (“On average, the program was about twice as effective in areas
        at the 10th percentile of service provision (very low health and education status) at
        baseline?.11 Additional Financing for PNPM Generasi was used to expand the program
        to areas with low health and education status.
       >80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local level
        governance. According to a technical evaluation conducted in 2012, 89% of PNPM-
        financed sub-projects that were implemented during 2007-2011 are functional and
        adequately utilized by communities.12

The Additional Financings for Post-Crisis and Disaster Management Support had no separate
KPI and co-financed Component 1, and 2, respectively. The eligibility criteria for AF-
financed block grants were the same as for block grants financing from the original project
loan.

3.3     Efficiency
PNPM Rural III was efficient in its investments assessed by the economic rate of return and
unit rate norms of subprojects financed by the project. As mentioned in Section 3.2, EIRRs
ranged from 35% to 50%, significantly higher than that the targeted EIRR of 30%. Unit rate
norms are highly favorable for community-executed infrastructure projects. In 2012, PSF
commissioned a technical evaluation of a representative sample of 1,765 subprojects financed
by PNPM Rural (95% of the samples were financed by PNPM Rural 3).13 According to this
study, sub-projects are typically 15 to 25% less costly to construct than similar projects
undertaken by line ministries. Cost savings are substantially higher (sometimes exceeding
50% of line ministry costs) for works that involve large amounts of unskilled labor. It is also
acknowledged that intensive facilitation and capacity building to the community, combined
with improved local governance conditions, contributed to the community’s capacity to plan
and construct good quality, low-cost small-scale infrastructure.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was consistent with the priorities of GoI and the CPS of the Bank for Indonesia.
Based on a consolidation of the three elements of outcome, the overall rating is satisfactory.

The project was and remains highly relevant for the Borrower and the Bank and has largely
achieved its PDO.
The PNPM Generasi pilot had a statistically significant positive impact on all but one of the
Key Performance Indicators it was designed to address. The main long-term impact was a
decrease in malnutrition.
In spite of these positive results there was limited impact on improvements in overall local
governance in Indonesia which reasonably should not be expected from a project that absorbs
less than one percent of the national budget. The project also struggled with a number of
implementation challenges related to long standing institutional capacity issues that were
further exacerbated as a result of the national scale up.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As mentioned in section 3.2. PNPM Rural has had a positive impact on reducing poverty in
participating communities and effectively included poor households in community meetings
as well as in benefiting them through gainful employment in construction activities.

PNPM had a positive impact on increasing the role of women and poor community members
in planning and decision making. During the period of 2010-2012 on average 46% and 55%
of meeting participants were women and poor community members.

The impact evaluation for PNPM Generasi 14 showed that participating communities were
effective at targeting direct benefits to the poor (defined as the bottom two quintiles of per-
capita consumption), particularly those benefits delivered in kind, such as uniforms, school
supplies, and supplementary feeding. PNPM Generasi also saw a high level of women’s
participation. From 2007 to 2009 on average 68% of participants in program socialization,
planning, and accountability meetings were women.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys. PSF undertook evaluations of the project’s impact on household
expenditure, gender balance, community-level governance, and reviewed the technical and
economic performance of the subprojects used by project beneficiaries. The key findings of
these studies are summarized in Annex 3 and 5.
Stakeholder workshop. On February 18, 2013, PSF invited key stakeholder to a workshop
in Jakarta to comment on the initial findings of the project evaluation presented in this ICR.
The vast majority of the participants agreed that PNPM has brought major benefits to the
country and should be continued beyond 2014. To further strengthen PNPM, it was deemed
necessary to improve coordination between planning and central and sub-national level,
improve the (currently unfavorable) ratio between facilitators and their workload, and
increase the financial contribution of district governments (see Annex 6 for details).

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The “Risk to Development Outcome? is defined as the risk that the (expected) development
outcomes of the project—at the time of this assessment—will not be maintained or realized.
As described in Section 3.4, the project’s development outcomes remain highly relevant. By
achieving these outcomes, the project has contributed to establishing effective, participatory
and representative community institutions that can mobilize villagers for the preparation and
implementation of community development plans, thereby ensuring that villagers in project
locations were able to benefit from improved socio-economic and local governance
conditions. Both central and local governments have indicated a strong and long-term
commitment to the financing of PNPM. If the central and local governments would withdraw
their support for community-driven development, a major portion of the project’s investment
will be at risk. Although the impact of such as withdrawal would be significant, the
likelihood of this happening is considered negligible given GoI’s long-term commitment to
PNPM. For these reasons, the overall “risk to development outcome? is rated as “moderate?.
5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The strengths of the original project design are:
    Strategic relevance. The project successfully contributed to the further development of
     PNPM, as outlined in the Government’s roadmap for the program, and helped
     implement the Bank’s strategy for engagement with communities (refer to the Bank’s
     2009-2012 CPS for Indonesia).
    Robustness. The design of the project was based on the design of PNPM Rural I and
     PNPM Rural II, with minor modifications to reflect lessons learned from these projects
     (limited sustainability of RLFs, need for increased audit coverage, need for increased
     support for financial management, and delays in disbursement of block grants). The
     Bank deliberately kept design changes to a minimum, not only because of the
     satisfactory performance of the two predecessor projects, but also the project helped to
     upscale PNPM Rural to a nationwide program, and the Bank’s risk assessment indicated
     that introducing substantial design changes during the up scaling process was not
     deemed prudent. The design of the project also took anticipated weaknesses of the
     Executing Agency explicitly into consideration by inserting the condition that “the
     PMD Secretariat shall be provided with adequate funds and other resources? in the
     Loan Agreement.
    Flexibility. The Loan Agreement for the financing of the project only stipulated general
     principles, but did not provide detail about its implementation (instead, detailed
     implementation arrangements were described in a project manual prepared by the
     implementing agency). This provided GoI and the Bank with the flexibility to modify
     implementation arrangements in response to changing circumstances.
The design of the two Additional Financing projects was based on the original project, but
only contained two of its four components (Kecamatan Grants and Facilitation Support).


                                               13
However, the amount of post-crisis block grants financed by the AF (IDR500-800 million per
kecamatan) was relatively small compared to block grants provided by the original project
(IDR750-3,000 million per kecamatan), thereby limiting the potential impact of the AF.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank mobilized and maintained throughout implementation a multi-disciplinary locally-
based supervision team with substantial experience in supervising previous Bank-financed
CDD projects in Indonesia. The team included fiduciary and safeguards staff who reported
findings and mitigation measures in the aide-mémoires. Formal implementation support
missions were carried out twice a year and were conducted together with Government and
donor partners who visited a wide spread of project locations. Starting in 2011 PSF mobilized
a team of field implementation specialists and fiduciary staff to provide additional
implementation support. The RLF sub-component was supervised through the same
arrangements. The team was able to identify, report in the aide-mémoires, and proactively
address key issues adversely affecting achievement of the PDOs an early stage, notably
problems with financial management, data accuracy and quality, budget execution and
revision, consultant staff performance, coordination, and facilitator recruitment. Based on the
findings of the supervision team, the Bank took the unusual step of putting the preparation of
future PNPM loans on hold until the implementing agency had completed an agreed package
of corrective actions. Because of these supervision efforts, performance in most areas
improved over time (as described in detail in the ISRs). The MIS and the management and
oversight capacity of PMD remained problematic. Additionally, a considerable number of
evaluation studies were carried out and brought valuable insights and findings for improving
design and implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank’s team was diligent in confirming the relevance of the project design based on the
predecessor operations and incorporating lessons learnt. Project preparation was relatively
fast and low cost. They aimed to ensure closer coordination between the relevant government
counterparts and stakeholders during project implementation and pro-actively identified
bottlenecks and proposed corrective actions. Based on the ratings for quality at entry and
quality of supervision, the Bank’s overall performance is rated as “satisfactory?.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Performance of the Government
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
At the highest level, the Government showed substantial commitment to the project
witnessed by the national scale-up of the program, pre-financing of block grants, and the
recent adoption of the PNPM Roadmap. With the help of the implementing agency, the
project was prepared within six months, a relatively short time for a project of the complexity
and scale of PNPM Rural III. The project was immediately ready for implementation because
it continued supporting the ongoing PNPM program. However, the Government did not
adequately address implementation issues (see Areas for Improvement in Section 2.2) in a
timely manner, as well as ensure the effective implementation of the M&E system, and the


                                              14
phasing out of the RLFs. These shortcomings were deemed moderate, however, and the
performance of the Government was consequently rated “moderately satisfactory?.

 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
It is acknowledged that PMD played an essential role in ensuring that the project achieved its
development objective in a satisfactory manner, implemented on time, and was generally
facilitated adequately. Evaluations indicated that socio-economic and local governance
conditions improved in sampled project locations (PNPM Rural Impact Evaluation and
Qualitative Impact Evaluation, 2010) with high rate of infrastructures quality and
functionality (Technical Evaluation, 2012). However, PMD failed to address the issues noted
under Areas for Improvement in Section 2.2 in a timely manner. In addition, it failed to
provide standardized reporting (see Section 2.3), did not follow through on phasing out the
RLF sub-component and did not identify other options for the poor to access financing. It
also failed to manage the NMC properly, which resulted in the substantiated allegations of
misrepresentation and fraud, discussed in Section 2.4. On balance, the performance of the
Implementing Agency is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
GoI showed strong ongoing support to PNPM and the project was managed reasonably well
by the Implementing Agency. The overall performance of the Borrower was rated
“moderately satisfactory?.

6.   Lessons Learned
    Capacity building of an implementing agency responsible for a nationwide CDD
     program requires substantial time and effort. In spite of the problems mentioned in
     Section 5.2(b), the involvement of the implementing agency was essential for the achie-
     vement of the project’s development indicators, and it is recommended that the Bank
     provided continued support, especially for fiduciary oversight, capacity building for
     implementation support, and reporting.
    Capacity building of communities is a long-term and iterative process which over time
     may lead to inclusive and transparent decision making. Communities can then use that
     experience to manage own resources or those transferred from government, outside of
     PNPM. Project guidelines (procurement, financial management, implementation cycle,
     etc) have to evolve to take into account changing community competencies. Project
     managers must avoid to overload such guidelines and to make them too bureaucratic.
    A robust MIS is essential for a nationwide CDD program. Although the project was able
     to monitor progress against its KPIs by surveys and studies (augmented by processed
     MIS data), a publicly accessible system that presents reliable and regularly updated
     information is needed to instill a culture of accountability and transparency at all levels
     of project implementation.
    Pre-financing of block grants by GoI is effective. This approach was pioneered by the
     project and resulted in a significant reduction in delays in disbursement of block grants
     compared to PNPM Rural I and II.



                                              15
     The quality of facilitators is the main driver of community-based project
      implementation quality. For this reason, it is essential that the Government: (i) offer
      competitive salaries and adequate allowances to facilitators, (ii) ensure that vacant
      facilitator position as promptly filled, and (iii) that facilitators receive good quality
      training.
All lessons have general applicability for similar operations in Indonesia and comparable
countries.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Overview. During project implementation, the Bank approved three sources of Additional
Financing:
     a US$10.2 million grant to support PNPM Generasi (signed in August 2010),
     a US$13.9 million grant for disaster management support (signed in March 2011), and
     a US$32.7 million grant to co-finance additional block grants and facilitator support in
      kecamatan in seven provinces most adversely affected by the economic downturn in
      2010 and 2011; these block grants were therefore also referred to as “post-crisis? (the
      grant agreement was signed in June 2011).
For managerial purposes, the Bank decided to delink the grants for PNPM Generasi and
disaster management support from PNPM Rural III. This annex therefore only provides an
overview of outputs financed from the proceeds of the US$785 million loan (IBRD-78670),
the US$32.7 million grant for post-crisis support (TF-99616) and related counterpart fund
contributions.

Component 1: Kecamatan Grants.
Kecamatan grants for PNPM Rural III. This component provided block grants to
kecamatan to finance competitive grant proposals selected according to priorities identified
in community development plans for investments in: (i) physical infrastructure, (ii) social
programs, and (iii) revolving loan funds (RLFs). In 2010 and 2011, the project financed
almost 170,000 proposals in over 5,000 kecamatan throughout Indonesia. More than half of
these proposals were developed by women’s groups (Table A2.1). Block grant amounts
ranged from IDR 750 million (US$ 80,000) to IDR 3 billion (US$320,000) per kecamatan
per year, depending on population, poverty incidence and remoteness. Communities were
allowed to allocate a maximum of 25% of the total kecamatan block grant amount to revol-
ving loan funds (provided that the recipient RLF had a repayment rate of at least 80%). Most
block grants for infrastructure and social programs were allocated to village roads, water
supply facilities and communal sanitation, followed by investments in new education and
health facilities (Table A2.2). The infrastructure financed from the kecamatan block grants
generated temporary employment for 4.75 million persons, of which about 3.57 million (or
75% of the total) were classified as poor.
Block grant allocations to revolving loan funds benefited over 1.75 million women in
approximately 162,000 savings groups. During project preparation it had been planned that
this sub-component would phased out and that alternative access to finance options for the
poor would be identified. However PMD showed no interest in such a change. Revolving
loan funds for savings and loan groups have not had a dedicated implementation and
oversight mechanism appropriate for such economic activities. Based on CHS data, RLF
related claims account for over 70 percent of all complaints submitted through complaints
handling mechanisms. An in-depth assessment of RLF performance in four provinces which
was completed in 2011 revealed a number of weaknesses in RLF operations and systems,
including: (i) Widespread perception that loans provided by RLFs are effectively grants and
subsidies, erodes financial discipline and repayment morale in many RLFs; (ii) legal
ownership of the RLF funds is unclear; (iii) declining loan repayment rates and consequent
increase in the level of non-performing loans. At the end of 2011, non-performing loans


                                             18
(NPL) accounted for 23 percent of the loan portfolio; and (iv) weak management capacity in
most RLFs in need of strengthening. Sub-district facilitators need to be trained on the
principles and practices of loan management. Only about half of the RLFs assessed in the
pilot provinces have realistic prospects of becoming sustainable operations, with adequate
capacity building support. A middle group of RLFs need to make significant efforts to
improve performance, while a smaller number of RLFs are not sustainable.
During the preparation of PNPM 2012-2015 GOI agreed to address areas of governance,
transparency, accountability and supervision of RLFs. The Operations Manual (OM) has
been revised and facilitators are being informed of the changes.

Kecamatan grants for “post-crisis? support. In 2011, the project provided additional block
grants to 433 kecamatan in seven provinces identified by BAPPENAS as being most in need
of additional grants (Bengkulu, Jawa Tengah, Jawa Timur, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara Timur,
Gorontalo, and Sulawesi Tengah). Each kecamatan received a block grant amount ranging
from IDR 500-800 million (US$55,000-90,000) in addition to ordinary block grants from
PNPM. There was no difference between the eligibility criteria and delivery mechanism of
“post-crisis? grants and ordinary kecamatan grants provided by the project. By the end of
December 2012, post-crisis grants had financed about 2,800 proposals developed by
community groups. The share of block grant proposals originated by women’s groups
accounted for 17% of all proposals, a much lower share than for ordinary PNPM Rural III
grants (Table A2.1). The allocation of post-crisis block grants by type of infrastructure was
broadly comparable to the allocation of “regular? block grants, with the exception of the
rehabilitated school buildings and health facilities, of which a disproportionately large
number was financed from post-crisis block grants (Table A2.2). Apart from physical
infrastructure, the post-crisis block grants also financed investments in social safety programs
(including 1,356 scholarships and 11,948 nutrition programs) and provided revolving funds
to 672 community groups, which benefited almost 5,400 persons).
Kecamatan grants for PNPM Generasi. In 2010, the project provided 212 kecamatan with
block grants earmarked for investments in the education and health sectors. Although a
portion of these block grants was allocated to finance physical infrastructure (such as school
buildings), they were mainly allocated to provide financial support to students, teachers,
pregnant women, young mothers and babies (Table A2.4).
Technical quality. As reported in various aides-memoires, the technical quality of the
community infrastructure was generally good, even though many provinces were unable to
recruit the required number of technical facilitators (mainly because facilitator salaries in this
field were not deemed competitive). In 2012, PSF commissioned a technical evaluation of a
representative sample 1,765 subprojects financed by PNPM Rural. 15 According to the

provinces evaluated to date to be fully in conformance with the project’s technical goals.?
More specifically, the evaluators founds that over 82% of the subprojects were rated to be of
high quality, 14% of acceptable quality, and 4% failed. Almost 90% of inspected subprojects
were still functioning as intended upon completion.

Sustainability. Poor operations and maintenance (O&M) remains a major concern for village
infrastructure throughout Indonesia, however as mentioned above the technical evaluation
confirmed that 90% of sub-projects built during 2009-2011 are functional and used by
communities. This implies that O&M is adequate. For all infrastructure constructed, the
project required the establishment of an O&M committee at the village level, as a means to
instill a sense of ownership for the infrastructure financed by the Project. Although this is
considered a useful step towards improved sustainability of village infrastructure, the
technical evaluation also showed that O&M is problematic for infrastructure types without
direct personal benefits (notably roads and drains). 16 The Bank recognizes that long-term
engagement is needed to resolve this long-standing problem of inadequate O&M.

Component 2: Facilitation Support.
This component financed 23,088 person months of facilitators to support the development of
community capacities for planning and project management through support for sub-district


16
     The apparent contradiction between high overall technical quality and limited commitment to O&M may
     be explained by the fact that all subprojects covered by the evaluation were constructed during 2007-
     2011, and therefore relatively new (on average 2.5 years old) when the evaluation was undertaken.

(kecamatan) technical, financial and social facilitators and district (kabupaten) facilitators.
Facilitators also helped strengthen inter-village organizations and forums, and local
government coordination and oversight. The primary outcome of this component was
facilitation of over 170,000 grant proposals in accordance with PNPM Rural guidelines. It
should be noted, however, that the workload of the facilitators was higher than envisaged at
the time of appraisal, the main reasons being:
    Facilitators of PNPM Rural’s regular program were expected to also facilitate post-
     crisis and post-disaster grants. However, the introduction of these grants was not
     accompanied by an increase in the number of facilitators (in 2011, PMD announced that
     it would increase transport allowances for facilitators in kecamatan eligible for post-
     disaster grants but did not follow through).
    In many provinces, the actual number of facilitators was often lower than the planned
     number of facilitators, partly because of delays in recruitment but also because
     provincial governments were often unable to recruit facilitators with the required
     experience the salary level stipulated by PMD (this problem especially hampered the
     recruitment of technical facilitators, even after lowering entry requirements).
    Facilitators are often called upon by local government to help with surveys and data
     collection.
The relatively high workload, compared to relative modest wages, resulted in high turnover
of facilitators, which adversely affected the overall quality of facilitation.

Component 3: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance.
This activity was managed by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in PMD, with technical
assistance provided through a National Management Consultant (NMC) at the central level,
Regional Management Consultants (RMCs) at the provincial level, with offices in the
participating district governments, and facilitators at the kecamatan level. This component
financed consultants (624 person-months) to assist in various aspects of project
implementation. The outcome was the provision of the technical assistance needed to manage
the project and the monitor and coordinate the extensive field presence of facilitators at the
local level that is required to successfully implement this type of community driven project.
The main shortcomings in this component was the modest quality of consultants in the NMC
and RMC, unclear roles and responsibilities between these consultants and PMD which led
i.a. to the issuance of conflicting instructions to kecamatan facilitators, and delay in the
delivery of pre-service and refresher training. A further problem was the inability of the NMC
to maintain or improve the MIS and the Complaints Handling System which resulted in
unreliable data and the lack of responsiveness to complaints made by project stakeholders.
Component 3 also financed several studies and evaluations to support the Government with
the evaluation of PNPM Rural (see Annex 9 for details).

Component 4: Project Management Support.
At the time of appraisal, it was envisaged that this component would provide support to
PNPM’s special programs, including pilot projects and crisis-response activities. Such
support was provided until PNPM Generasi and Post-Disaster Support were delinked from
the project. Post-crisis grants were directly added onto regular block grants for PNPM Rural
III, and their implementation did not require dedicated project management support. As a
result, there were few Bank-financed outputs recorded under this component.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction. In 2012, PSF commissioned a study to analyze the economic benefits of
“average? infrastructure projects planned and financed by PNPM Rural. This annex
summarizes the final report, which analyzes a sample of 48 small-scale infrastructure projects
from the three sectors that together account for the majority of PNPM Rural investments:
water supply, roads and bridges, and irrigation.17 The sample was taken from 39 villages in
four provinces (East Nusa Tenggara, West Sulawesi, West Kalimantan and Central Java), and
covered projects completed between 2007 and 2011. The report presented the results of three
types of economic and financial analysis: (i) economic internal rate of return, (ii) general
income multiplier, and (iii) cost-efficiency. The field work, survey enumeration, data
collection, and computation and analytical methodology of the 2012 study in essence
replicated an earlier (2004-5) study that visited more projects in more locations.
Economic internal rate of return. The World Bank Handbook on Economic Analysis of
Investment Operations requires the real economic rate of return (EIRR) of Bank-financed
subprojects to be equal or higher than the opportunity cost of capital to the country. In the
case of Indonesia, the World Bank usually estimates the opportunity cost of capital at 12%
per annum. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) for the 48 projects analyzed ranged
from 35 to 75 percent. The EIRR was on average highest for irrigation projects, followed by
roads and bridges and then water supply. Regionally, average EIRRs for projects carried out
in Central Java were higher than in the three other provinces. Overall, the range of EIRRs
found for recent projects are comparable with the 2004/5 results, which indicated a range of
39 to 68 percent for the same types of sub-projects in an expanded set of regions.
General income multiplier. The report also presents estimates of the income multiplier of
infrastructure projects financed by PNPM Rural III. Page 22 of the report defines the term
income multiplier as “the circulation of money in a village caused by the utilization of funds
for the development of PNPM infrastructure projects?. The report methodology measured the
increase in the local circulation of money from “first-round? effects only, or the increase in
local transactions resulting directly from the increases in income experienced by those who
were paid to contribute to the project (in either labor, materials, tools, or other fixed capital).
The highest weighted multipliers were observed in the irrigation sector (1.34), followed by
water supply (1.28) and roads (1.18). This is again broadly in line with the 2004/5 results that
indicated an average income multiplier of 1.2.
Cost efficiency. The actual cost of all 48 projects was compared to a theoretical cost of
constructing the same infrastructure but assuming it had been undertaken by local
government contractors. The results of the analysis are comparable to the findings of similar
studies on cost savings of community-driven development projects, especially when
undertaken by the communities themselves (swadaya) instead of using community
contracting. Cost savings were highest for roads and bridges (22%-33%), followed by water
supply (19%-28%), and irrigation (20%-25%). The recent 2012 results are again broadly
similar to the 2004/5 study (which performed similar simulations for a larger set of

                           Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Introduction. PSF commissioned a series of studies that assessed satisfaction of project
stakeholders with various aspects of PNPM Rural.
The Technical Evaluation of Infrastructure 2012 18 reviewed sub-projects constructed
between 2007 and 2011 in twelve provinces and 165 districts. A total of 1,765 sub-projects
were surveyed for the technical quality and interviews were held with beneficiaries to gauge
their satisfaction with the infrastructure constructed. 82% of the projects were evaluated to be
of high and 14% of acceptable quality while 4% of projects failed. It was found that 90% of
projects were functioning and used as intended. 56% of respondents had a high appreciation
of the infrastructure while 34% considered it average.
The Community-Level Governance Review 2012 consisted of an analysis of governance,
accountability and corruption strengths and weaknesses at the local level (hamlet, village and
sub-district).19 It aimed to understand how governance in the program is changing at village
level and examine how wider changes in PNPM may be affecting transparency, participation
and accountability within the program. The review found that the state of local governance
in PNPM is mixed. It is still remarkably strong, but faces problems. Participation rates are
still mostly high, but the quality of participation has in some places declined. There are
weaknesses in transparency and information sharing. The performance of accountability
mechanisms in the program—such as the village accountability meetings and the creation of
the BKAD and BP-UPK—varies, and the incidence of serious corruption is up. Despite this,
the ‘foundations’ of PNPM are still strong. These foundations, though, are being eroded by
serious pressure from ‘higher-up’ problems related to the broader governance environment,
changes in the program design, and problems with implementation and management.
Although the foundations of PNPM are mostly still strong enough to withstand these
challenges, in some places, they have combined to cause multiple accountability and local
governance failures. PNPM must address these program design, implementation and
management issues to avoid undoing its years of good work at community level.
PSF also commissioned a study in 2012 to generate operational recommendations for
maximizing the quality of participation by women in PNPM planning and decision-making
and to present PMD with relevant background information on the design process of the 2012-
2014 of PNPM Rural20. The final report of the study contains a summary of the methodology
and findings and recommendation related to national-level management and leadership,
program design and monitoring, staffing and staff development, and new initiatives. The
recommendations include a gender disaggregated MIS, budgeting and staffing for gender
initiatives, better knowledge management and sharing of lessons on women’s participation in
PNPM. The review also recommended a revision of the operations manual to include gender
responsive social mapping and women’s only planning and decision meetings in the
communities.

On 18 February 2013, PSF invited representatives of the central government, NGOs,
development partners and consultants and facilitators involved in the implementation of
PNPM Rural III to a workshop in Jakarta to comment on the initial findings of the project
evaluation presented in this ICR. The vast majority of the participants agreed that PNPM has
brought major benefits to the country and should be continued beyond 2014. To further
strengthen PNPM, it was deemed necessary to improve coordination between planning and
central and sub-national level, improve the (currently unfavorable) ratio between facilitators
and their workload, and increase the financial contribution of district government. The
participants also identified a series of additional lessons learned, the most important of which
can be summarized as follows:
      Improve reporting. There is a need for outcome-based reporting on PNPM. Projects
       such as PNPM Rural III should measure outputs and outcomes, not only inputs.
      Improve coordination between central and sub-national governments. This can be
       achieved if PMD would increase the involvement of district government agencies
       (other than PMD at kabupaten level) in the implementation of PNPM Rural.
      Improve coordination at the district government level. There is especially a need for
       better integration between district government plans and planning for PNPM.
      Secure financial commitment from district governments. Even though most district
       governments claim that PNPM Rural is a highly effective means to alleviate poverty,
       few kabupaten have thus far invested substantial sums from their own resources in
       PNPM Rural III (in addition to the minimum required contribution), mainly because
       of opposition from local parliaments (DPRD). There is a clear need for more
       commitment from DPRD to augment the budget for PNPM Rural. At the minimum,
       district governments should not decrease their financial support to PNPM.
      Facilitators are essential for PNPM implementation. This is mainly because of
       capacity constraints at the local level (empowerment of communities remains of sub-
       optimal levels). However, the quality of participation depends on facilitation strategy
       and available financial support.
      Do not change the design of successful components. PNPM taught the government to
       place trust in communities, and be transparent, accountable and gender-sensitive. Any
       future project design should be able to retain these important elements.

  National Rural Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan)
            Directorate General of Community and Village Empowerment
                                 Ministry of Home Affairs
1. Introduction
   1.    The National Rural Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri
         Perdesaan –) is the largest community-driven development (CDD) program in
         Indonesia, as well as in the world. The PNPM Program was started in 2007, as a
         continuation of the Kecamatan Development Program (Program Pengembangan
         Kecamatan-PPK) that began in 1998 in limited areas. The program then scaled up
         and to date it has touched more than 60,000 villages in all regions, except Jakarta,
         the nation’s capital. The loan for PNPM III took effect in July 2010, to finance
         PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan activities in FY 2010 ad 2011, added with funding and
         technical assistance in 2012. PNPM III was followed by PNPM IV and PNPM V
         loan, which will be used in FY 2013 and 2014.
   2.    The main activity of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan is to channel support to villages,
         and the funding support is used as grants to build the required village infrastructure
         and to support education and health activities. The funds can also be provided as
         loans to women’s groups in villages. The funds are channeled directly to the
         communities, not to regional government offices, and the decisions are made by
         communities themselves. The funds are self-managed by the communities, with the
         assistance of a number of facilitators contracted by provincial governments.
   3.    The processes conducted by the government and the communities have not changed
         much during both PPK and PNPM, although there have been refinements in the
         focus and program rules. The main activities in the process of using the assistance
         funds, including planning, implementation, supervision, and maintenance activities,
         go through a one-year cycle. Planning activities include meetings at the village and
         sub-district levels to identify activity priorities that can be funded. These planning
         activities also include brainstorming activities, special consultations with women,
         community consultations at the village and inter-village levels, verification of
         proposals, and creation of design documents and budget plan. Implementation
         activities include construction, procurement of materials, supervision, quality
         control, and various types of administration. Supervision includes supervision visits,
         accountability by village teams, and internal and external audits. Responsibility for
         maintenance lies with the village itself, but the communities are trained beforehand.

  4.   Activities in the field are owned by the communities, but [they] involve the
       government as well as consultants or facilitators at every level: national, province,
       district, and sub-district.


2. Specific Changes for PNPM III
  2.1. General
       2.1.1.    Over time the amount of funds and the number of locations included in the
                 PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan Program continued to increase with time.
       2.1.2.    The Program is focused for the objective of Community Empowerment.
                 The rules and policies were changed in a way to allow ownership by
                 communities, rather than making it a top-down program, which was very
                 common in the past. The rules have some flexibility, according to local
                 situation and capacity. One of the conclusion is community need to be
                 trusted
       2.1.3.    It is hoped that PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan will also involve more local
                 government, not only the central government. Field facilitators are
                 contracted directly by the provincial government, and the village assistance
                 funds are being co-managed through the district government.
  2.2. Enhancing Community Empowerment
       2.2.1.    Community empowerment is assisted by two planning process directions.
                 Optimization is used in order to expedite the planning process, especially
                 when there are activities that have been approved but cannot yet be funded
                 in the prior fiscal year. If activity is still needed and the plan still
                 reasonable, planning process need not be repeated.
       2.2.2.    Integration is also related to community empowerment, because what is
                 needed and prioritized by the people must really be considered by the
                 district planning process, which previously almost always used a top-down
                 or black box planning system.
       2.2.3.    One of the activities that developed during PNPM III is the creation of the
                 Village Medium Term Development Planning (RPJMDes) that had been
                 developed for quite some time in PPK and PNPM by using the process of
                 village visioning and government planning rules. RPJMDes is five-year
                 plan, with each year partly becoming the Village Working Development
                 Plan (RKP). Trainings about RPJMDes preparation and quality assessment
                 for RPJMDes output have been conducted.
       2.2.4.    PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan program is also more focused on community
                 training. The training was developed specially for program actors at the
                 village and the inter-village levels. In addition to optimization, integration,
                 and preparation activities of RPJMDes, training is given to all kinds of
                 teams in the community, in order to enhance the quality of community
                 teams in the planning, implementation, and financial areas.
       2.2.5.    In 2010 and 2011 the Community Learning Forum (Ruang Belajar
                 Masyarakat - RBM) activity was designed and implemented. In this


                                             33
               activity, which began at the integration area, the communities were given
               trainings in specific topics, and the trainings were managed by the team
               from the respective communities. Trainings included the topic of
               Community-based Monitoring, advocacy, media, and others.
2.3. Improvements of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan Program Aspects
     2.3.1.    Capacity Building Aspect
     2.3.1.1. RBM lessons are already available.
     2.3.1.2. Pre-service training of sub-district facilitators was increased by the end of
              2011, so that new facilitator candidates are given two trainings: the first
              one for 11 days before placement, and then 10 days after three months’
              work in the field. The substance of the two training sessions have been
              changed from previous trainings, to include new elements that have been
              developed, such as safeguards material, maintenance, Early Warning
              Signs, and micro-hydro.
     2.3.1.3. Refresher trainings are targeted for all facilitators in the field, in districts as
              well as sub-districts. The 2010 refreshers are focused more on integration.
              2011 refreshers include more topics, but many problems occurred during
              their implementation in many regions, due to problems in procuring [the
              services of] Event Organizers.
     2.3.1.4. Training for Technical Cadres was designed in 2011, with the target of two
              persons per village in all regions. The training comprises of 53 topics in
              nine modules, with the duration of twelve working days. The training
              module was designed by members of Training Development Consultant,
              and NMC. Training consolidation was given as part of refresher, and then
              conducted in the districts by District Technical Facilitators.
     2.3.2.    Management Aspect
     2.3.2.1. There are changes in the position of UPK Facilitator to become Finance
              Facilitator in every district. The facilitator must focus on the financial
              aspect, especially funds disbursed through UPK at sub-district level:
              Community Direct Assistance (Bantuan Langsung Masyarakat), Activity
              Operational Funds (Dana Operasional Kegiatan) for community training
              and planning, and Revolving Funds.
     2.3.2.2. Beginning from late 2011, PMD was assisted by two advisors and a
              specialist funded by AusAID. Team comprises of experts in training,
              Human Resource management, tender, MIS, and finance.
     2.3.2.3. During PNPM III, the training management at the national level was
              moved from NMC to Training Development Consultant, consisting of four
              training areas and thirteen trainers. TDC was expected to improve the
              design of all sorts of activities and supervise the training by supervising
              Training Specialists in the province. NMCs, which previously had several
              people in the training field, no longer have training specialists.
     2.3.2.4. Performance evaluation system for facilitators was redesigned in 2011,
              with the expectation that the system will be easier to administer than the
              old system. For the nine types of facilitators and assistant facilitators at the


                                            34
              district and sub-district levels, an assessment format was created along
              with the filling guidelines. The format included all existing activities in the
              Terms of Reference along with the skills needed by a facilitator in the
              field.
     2.3.2.5. In 2010 assistant facilitators were assigned at the district level: technical
              and non-technical assistants. An assistant is placed in a district with more
              than 15 sub-districts, due to the problem of span-of-control if a district
              facilitator must supervise and guide too many people. If a district has more
              than 30 sub-districts, a district facilitator will be assisted by two couples of
              assistants
     2.3.3.   PNPM Policy Aspect
     2.3.3.1. At the end of FY 2011 the discussions on a Joint PNPM Secretariat at
              PMD started. The Secretariat is expected to help synchronize and
              communicate all existing PNPM programs at PMD, which then included
              PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan at the Directorate of Community Institution and
              Training (Direktorat Kelembagaan dan Pelatihan Masyarakat), PNPM
              Generasi at the Socio-Cultural Directorate (Direktorat Sosial Budaya),
              PNPM Lingkungan Mandiri Perdesaan at the Natural Resources and
              Appropriate Use Technology Directorate (Direktorat Sumber Daya Alam
              dan Teknologi Tepat Guna), PNPM PISEW at the Community Business
              and Economy Directorate (Direktorat Usaha dan Ekonomi Masyarakat).
              In addition to this program, there are many other activities under PNPM
              Mandiri Perdesaan, including natural disasters, RESPEK in Papua, post-
              crisis, and borders. The issue on the Joint Secretariat has been discussed
              and planned, even though it is yet to be finalized.
     2.3.3.2. A Facilitator Certification process has taken place, which was designed in
              2011. Certification is mandatory requirement for program consultants, so
              the establishment of a Professional Certification Institute and certification
              method has been planned.
     2.3.3.3. There have been policy changes regarding Safeguards. In August 2010,
              beginning with a workshop in Jakarta. The World Bank elaborated with
              three types of safeguards that must be taken into account, and PMD related
              that there are already 28 types of safeguards in place for PNPM Mandiri
              Perdesaan, which is already included in refresher material. Safeguards
              from the World Bank included environmental impacts, land donations, and
              indigenous communities.
2.4. Connections to Other Programs
     2.4.1.   PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan is connected to other programs at the
              Directorate General of PMD, which as earlier stated was the reason that
              there will be a Joint PNPM Secretariat at PMD. Some of the programs are
              managed as a part of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan: RESPEK, post-crisis, and
              borders.
     2.4.2.   PNPM Generasi started as a pilot within PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan, but
              was finally moved to other Directorates. While in fact, in all Generasi



                                           35
                 locations there are also PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan and the majority of
                 rules follow the same process as Mandiri Perdesaan.
       2.4.3.    PNPM Lingkungan Mandiri Perdesaan also started along with PPK, but
                 has long been moved to other directorates. Although separate, it is
                 expected that there will be good cooperation, because the two programs
                 still need input from each other.
       2.4.4.    There is PNPM RESPEK Pertanian (Agriculture) program in Papua and
                 West Papua, which is funded by the International Fund for Agricultural
                 Development (IFAD). This activity is also related to PNPM Mandiri
                 Perdesaan in several districts in Papua and West Papua.
       2.4.5.    PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan is always involved in activities handling the
                 reconstruction of natural disaster regions. In the PNPM III period many
                 natural disasters took place in Indonesia helped by the government through
                 PNPM. Housing construction activity in Nias is ongoing in PNPM III, as a
                 result of the earthquake in March 2005. In Yogyakarta and Central Java,
                 West Java and West Sumatra there are also post-disaster assistance, each
                 as a result of earthquakes.
       2.4.6.    In this period there have been official visits from other countries who want
                 to learn from PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan. The most frequent and serious
                 cooperation is with the National Solidarity Program in Afghanistan. NSP
                 began by learning from PPK, but during the visit in this period, there was a
                 two-way interaction. There were several program aspects that the team
                 from Afghanistan still wanted to learn, but there are two program aspects
                 at NSP that need to be studied by PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan, namely MIS
                 and monitoring & evaluation, because PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan is still
                 weak. Other visitors that came during these period included guests from
                 Mongolia, China, Timor-Leste, Laos, Philippines, and Kenya.
       2.4.7.    PMD staff also went to University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland,
                 Australia in order to create cooperation with universities for trainings at
                 PMD, especially at Education and Training Centers.
3. Weaknesses in PNPM Implementation and Lessons Learned
  3.3. Burdens
       3.3.1.    PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan is a great burden for one government sub-
                 directorate [to manage], which is one of the reasons why programs like
                 Generasi and Lingkungan Mandiri Perdesaan have been moved to other
                 directorates or sub-directorates. Most of the funds available at the Ministry
                 of Home Affairs are managed by one program. Because of the prevailing
                 government system, it is difficult to involve a number of relatively senior
                 civil servants to address issues and actions on a day-to-day basis.
       3.3.2.    The workload of facilitators in the field is also greater. For many districts,
                 district facilitators (three persons) are assisted by two or four assistants, but
                 at the sub-district level (usually two persons) [they are] rarely assisted by
                 assistants. The number of villages involved in sub-districts is sometimes
                 big enough and the amount of funds is large enough, so that the number of



                                              36
              meetings and activities to be supervised is increasing. This is a span-of-
              control issue.
     3.3.3.   Aside from the span-of-control issue, facilitators are also burdened by
              other tasks, especially reporting and data collection from all villages.
              Assisted a little because those who pass pre-service training but are not yet
              assigned to sub-districts can be assigned as FK or FT assistants while
              waiting for vacancies that can be filled. The problem of facilitator
              workload in the field has been a long-standing critical issue, as a result
              PMD and NMC want to change and simplify some of the prevailing rules.
              However, usually there will be additional documents and data collection
              asked by the program.
     3.3.4.   A more serious problem in the field, perhaps, is the impression that the
              motivation of the facilitators (and sometimes the motivation of the village
              team) has decreased. Some of the facilitators see the work of a facilitator in
              the field as just a regular position, and their spirit and idealism would
              disappear. There have been efforts to change this mindset by changing the
              [parameters] that are evaluated in the performance evaluation system, but
              this problem persists.
3.4. System and Rules
     3.4.1.   There are many systemic and regulatory changes stemming from
              weaknesses in the field. The most prominent [of these] is the safeguards
              rule. This rule, developed with the World Bank, was caused by weaknesses
              in documentation of problems of environment impact, land donations, and
              adat communities. Even though the three topics have rarely grown into
              serious problems, facilitators are expected to have greater attention to these
              problems, in order to prevent serious problems. The safeguards rule
              prepared by PMD is a warning on 28 issues that require greater attention
              from facilitators, because the items and the rules can better ensure
              participation and quality in the field.
     3.4.2.   There was a visit by NSP team from Afghanistan that provided input for
              the monitoring system and MIS system at PNPM. Their input was quite
              consistent with internal assessment, which saw that there are still many
              weaknesses with MIS. In addition to late reports and much data not being
              reported, the quality of the information is often not verified before being
              sent. The NSP MIS team provided a lot of input to PMD and donors about
              creating a new system, namely, a web-based one.
     3.4.3.   According to the World Bank as well as the internal auditor, the goods and
              services procurement system is seen to be weak. The weakness also
              includes how the procurement process [itself] is conducted, as well as
              issues of transparency, accountability, and perhaps corruption. By our
              estimates, the main problem is at the level of understanding and skills of
              the procurement team and the facilitators. The second influence is the
              facilitator’s workload. Corruption possibly is the third problem, where the
              village team seeks profit from the procurement process. The improvements
              include training, guidance, improving controls and transparency by the
              community and facilitators, as well as simplifying procurement rules.


                                          37
     3.4.4.   A very big issue is the process of improving the program quality in two
              provinces in Papua. In November 2011, a multi-party workshop was held
              in Makassar specifically to address program improvements in Papua,
              however, no improvements or changes have been made thus far. The issue
              that was agreed included simplifying the system of planning and
              implementation, using NGO and church personnel to help the process of
              community facilitation, among others. The RESPEK program was halted
              by the Government of West Papua Province.
     3.4.5.   There is a tendency for equal distribution recently, namely, villages within
              a sub-district would choose smaller activities so that all villages can get
              their BLM share every year. In addition to the problem of sub-project size,
              the communities lower their specification so that it is cheaper. For
              example, the road width is narrowed from 3 meters to 2.5 meters; concrete
              thickness is thinned from 15 cm to 10 cm; some of the ditches required,
              perhaps, are not proposed. Such things shrunk the benefits from the
              infrastructure built. This tendency can only be overcome by strengthening
              the knowledge of communities and the facilitators, so that communities
              would choose activities in sub-districts with the most benefit.
     3.4.6.   Rules for revolving funds must also be reconsidered, because there are all
              kinds of problems in the micro-credit area. This includes the tenure
              duration of UPK members, the role of BP-UPK, and the use of UPK
              service funds.
     3.4.7.   The audit quality of the consultant team (NMC, RMC, and districts) as
              well as follow up to BPKP or Bawasda audits must also be increased.
     3.4.8.   The complaint and problem [handling] elements often do not function as
              intended. The special Complaint Handling System application has been
              identified as one of the things that must be improved urgently. The
              problems include information about the problem or reporting that are not
              received by the Central Satker (Satuan Kerja – Work Unit in PMD for
              PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan), as well as the follow-ups to the problems that
              have been reported.
3.5. Supervision
     3.5.1.   There are two types of supervision that has lead to two priorities. The first
              supervision is program supervision, to see the rate of progress of activities
              and activity quality, including the number of beneficiaries of activities.
              Supervisors using this technique will prioritize things like disbursement,
              physical progress, and completion documents. The second supervision is
              supervision of actors, including facilitators and community teams.
              Supervisors using this technique provide more feedback and guidance, in
              order to strengthen actors. With this second system, people in the field will
              be more honest and open.
     3.5.2.   Officials at the central, provincial, and district levels, as well as senior
              consultants—often prioritize progress over quality and knowledge transfer
              or institutional strengthening. Considering that community empowerment




                                         38
              and community capacity building is the main goal, supervision priority
              often goes the other way around.
3.6. Capacity Building
     3.6.1.   Facilitator’s capacity needs to be taken into account. All sub-district
              facilitators are seen to be the same, while there are actually two quite
              different types of facilitators. Many facilitators have little experience. They
              should be continuing to learn, including learning from the experience in
              the field and by In-Service Training. However, there are also many
              facilitators who are highly experienced, and these facilitators should be
              prepared to guide more junior facilitators.
     3.6.2.   All facilitators should already possess some general skills, so that they can
              work more effectively and can be promoted. Skills that are needed include
              training, writing, and presentation, evaluation, and computer skills. Many
              junior as well as senior facilitators do not have these skills. The program
              itself does not have the material to train them in these basic fields, as
              having such skills is seen as compulsory.
     3.6.3.   The 2011 refresher training was quite a disappointment, because class
              results were not sent to the Central Satker. The Central Satker wanted to
              get input from the field, but some of the locations did not conduct the
              refreshers (due to Event Organizer problems) or did not send in their
              results. The technical facilitators as well as training specialists in provinces
              were not reprimanded when the processes were not conducted according to
              instructions.
     3.6.4.   Some topics are still missing from training modules. Two most needed
              topics included suspended bridges and micro-hydro.
     3.6.5.   No training has been conducted for microcredit borrower groups, while
              many groups have not yet mastered marketing, business planning, and
              group dynamic skills. The training has been proposed since 2003, but [so
              far] has not [even] been planned.
3.7. Relations with Other Institutions
     3.7.1.   One problem that has often occurred pertains to relations with the field
              team from PSF. It is often reported that the field team often comes to the
              field to find problems and to instruct facilitators and communities. Clearly
              this does not include all members of the team, but there are team members
              who are not ready to work as observers, with the results related to PMD.
              They are often irate in the field, so they look far different from guests who
              come to study a situation and to help people in the field. They are welcome
              to provide input to help, but sometimes the input given is not right.
     3.7.2.   One of the reasons a Joint Secretariat is planned is to ensure that the work
              of the two programs will be mutual and not cause conflict. At this time,
              problems still occur, for example the Generasi work still burdens Mandiri
              Perdesaan technical facilitators, because the rules are quite different. Also,
              sometimes there are more fundamental problems because what is




                                          39
                happening in one program contradicts the rules of another program. This
                issue also happens when a sub-district is flagged as problematic.
       3.7.3.   From the beginning of PPK, it was designed with a Single Door policy, so
                that people in the field will not be burdened too much by other institutions.
                The functional track guidelines also explain that donors must always go
                through PMD and not directly contact people in the field. This rule is
                sometimes violated. There are field visits that occur without PMD’s
                knowledge.
       3.7.4.   In 2011 there was a plan to start a partnership between PNPM Mandiri
                Perdesaan and the Central Statistics Agency (BPS). This activity was
                intended to check whether data collected during PODES survey are truly
                consistent with the facts in the field. To collect such facts, technical
                facilitators and technical cadres collect data only regarding several topics.
                The forms that have been agreed to be used are often changed and the
                system is also changed, and in the end facilitators do not receive data from
                BPS to be crosschecked. In the end, payments to technical cadres are also
                unclear. From the World Bank’s perspective, it is the fault of the PNPM
                Team. Whereas, according to the PNPM Team, BPS and the World Bank
                often change the rules and the tasks to the point that it becomes less
                attractive and less useful.
4. Short Recommendations for the Future
  4.3. General Recommendations
       4.3.1.   It is hoped that the program can tolerate more flexibility in the rules. There
                are activities like Proposal Verification that should be done with various
                methods, as the situations vary greatly. There are many other such
                activities, especially for very difficult regions and regions with vastly
                different culture.
       4.3.2.   The design of PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan actually prioritizes teamwork,
                while many people work as individuals. Everyone should actually see
                themselves as members of several teams – team lead from above, team that
                goes below, and team on the same level.
       4.3.3.   The quality of supervision is an area where improvement is required at all
                levels and locations. As for program supervision, clearly it can easily
                improve, as long as the computer application is developed and output
                standardization is taken care of, unlike the supervision to people.
                Supervision of people requires a change in the attitude of supervisors, so
                that they are willing to help and improve the quality of people in the field.
       4.3.4.   Cooperation with local governments must also be increased. In the
                beginning of PPK, there was not much cooperation with the government at
                the village, sub-district, district, or provincial levels. Now it has to be
                increased at all levels, to consider sustainability.
       4.3.5.   One thing that is very much needed is the collection and distribution of
                good practices that cannot yet be done. Good practices needs to be
                contributed by everyone who is involved in PNPM, not only Central



                                            40
              people. Good practices also include the collection of design examples from
              the field, so that others can learn from designs considered good.
     4.3.6.   Similar to the collection of good practices is experiential learning,
              including learning from mistakes and failures, both technical and non-
              technical.
     4.3.7.   It is hoped that all consultant and facilitators as well as government
              apparatus are able to function as trainers.
     4.3.8.   It is true; everyone must be ready to learn independently. It is not enough
              to learn from IST, refreshers, and so forth. There is an incredible amount
              of knowledge, so people should be delighted to learn on their own.
     4.3.9.   One common issue is about management. Many people do not understand
              that supervisors must be able to function as leaders rather than just
              managers. A leader will influence the attitude of all his staff. Leadership
              can be learned, but there is no such learning for potential leaders and
              sometimes people who are selected do not yet have such capability.
4.4. New Activities
     4.4.1.   One of the very important activities for PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan as well
              as PMD is improving MIS, following recommendations of experts from
              Afghanistan.
     4.4.2.   Activities of the Joint Secretariat must be completed and made so that they
              function immediately, not only as a formality.
     4.4.3.   The existence of UPK has been a long-standing issue, so that the unit can
              be established with legality and permanently.
     4.4.4.   There needs to be training for microcredit borrower groups, because the
              loans are big and potential. This is like [how it used to be] back then, when
              at the Manpower Ministry the focus of benefits from village infrastructure
              program was shifted from only short-term benefits to be long-term
              benefits.
     4.4.5.   One improvement in the field is very important, that is, to improve the
              quality of meetings. Meetings happen often, but there are not necessarily a
              lot of benefits.
     4.4.6.   The Barefoot Engineers training needs to be added because the demand for
              technical facilitators in Papua is very high, and this can also be considered
              for other regions that also face difficulties in recruiting engineering
              graduates. In other places, perhaps STM (Technical Vocational Schools)
              graduates can be recruited as potential facilitators.
     4.4.7.   It is hoped that technical knowledge transfer can take place for village
              technical cadres, so they are better able to design and calculate, so that
              villages can be more independent technically.
     4.4.8.   Learning at PNPM must use the e-learning methodology and
              correspondence, so that training and learning can be done inexpensively.
     4.4.9.   Facilitator certification process must be developed.


                                         41
4.4.10. There is a lot of knowledge from refresher trainings to be developed in the
        field: survey of prices between regions; monitoring of participation, rules
        and quality; such as early warning system.
4.4.11. The rule about [facilitator] roaming is clearly useful; however it has been
        difficult to apply. It is hoped that applicable procedures can be found.
4.4.12. One of the suggestions about training is to have changes in the system of
        selection of passing participants. Training will also be more effective if
        training does not include elements of selection, because the selection
        process needs a lot of time from trainers and to change the mindset of
        participants, who do not want to learn and only want to pass.
4.4.13. Maintenance is one of the activities at PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan that
        needs more attention. It is hoped that a pilot is conducted about funding
        maintenance activities that are beyond village capacity, but only limited to
        villages who have diligently conducted maintenance despite the
        limitations.
