I.      INTRODUCTION

1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Vice
President for additional financing from the multi-donor funded PNPM Support Facility (PSF)
(TF070967 and TF071562) to three existing Bank projects in the Republic of Indonesia as
follows:

        (a)      a grant in the amount of US$14.1 million for the Third National Program for
                 Community Empowerment in Rural Areas (PNPM-Rural III) - Disaster
                 Management Support Project, Project Number 115052, Loan Number 7867-ID;

        (b)      a grant in the amount of US$1.4 million for the Third National Program for
                 Community Empowerment in Urban Areas (PNPM-Urban III) - Disaster
                 Management Support Project, Project Number P118113, Loan Number 7866-ID;
                 and

        (c)      a grant in the amount of US$11.5 million for Community-Based Settlement
                 Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project1 (Rekompak) under the National
                 Program for Community Empowerment, Project Number 103457.

2.      The proposed grants will help finance the costs associated with the Government of
Indonesia’s (GoI) disaster management efforts at the community level, including facilitating
recovery from the recent natural disasters that struck the country in October 2010. Additional
financing being provided to each project would continue to finance the same types of activities
currently financed under those projects, but in disaster-affected areas. The closing date for the
additional financing for the three projects would be December 31, 2012.


II.     BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING

3.      Background. In October 2010 Indonesia was struck by three major natural disasters:
flash floods in Wasior (Papua); an earthquake which triggered a tsunami that hit Mentawai (West
Sumatra); and volcanic eruptions in Merapi (Central Java and Yogyakarta). These events have
resulted in the deaths of hundreds and the displacement of tens of thousands of people, and
caused significant economic losses to the already poor populations.

4.     GoI has requested emergency assistance to use the PNPM platform and aligned
community driven development (CDD) mechanisms, including Rekompak, as a key pillar of its
recovery strategy for these three areas. However, the proposed grants will not be limited to these
geographic areas, except for Rekompak which will cover only Central Java/Yogyakarta, but may

  In addition to the US$11.5 million grant from the PNPM Support Facility Trust Fund, the Java Reconstruction
Fund (JRF (TF070639, a trust fund managed by the World Bank for post 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake) plans to
allocate its remaining US$3.5 million to the Rekompak project to support post disaster recovery in Central Java and
Yogyakarta from the October 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi.


                                                        1
be expanded to areas affected by future disasters as may be agreed from time to time among the
Bank, GoI and the donors to the PSF.

5.       Rationale. PNPM provides a platform and implementation mechanism to: (a) access
existing trust funds through the PSF; and (b) transfer these resources directly to communities
through block grants to finance disaster recovery activities. The ongoing Rekompak project,
originally funded through the Java Reconstruction Fund (JFR) trust fund, by definition is a
rehabilitation and reconstruction project and has a well performing project management unit on
the ground in Central Java and Yogyakarta. Allocating the proposed US$11.5 through the PSF
would promote economies of scale and continuity with on-going disaster management support
activities.

6.     Key attributes of PNPM and Rekompak that lend themselves well to disaster recovery
include:

       •   A well established network of community facilitators, based and operating in every
           sub-district of the country (in the case of PNPM), able to carry out damage and loss
           assessments and to facilitate communities in the identification, planning and
           implementation of disaster recovery activities.

       •   Existing social capital and institutional mechanisms developed through PNPM, and
           its predecessors the Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) and Urban Poverty
           Program (UPP), allowing communities to efficiently prioritize, plan, implement and
           manage disaster recovery activities at the community level.

       •   Established financial architecture and efficient management practices that enable the
           transfer of resources directly to the sub-districts with robust fiduciary controls.

       •   A comprehensive set of PNPM operational procedures to expedite and support
           disaster recovery, which have been used with success in Aceh, Nias, Papua, Nusa
           Tenggara Timur (NTT), West Sumatra, and West Java.

7.     Consistency with Country Partnership Strategy. The community-driven development
approach of both PNPM and Rekompak is a key component of the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for 2009-2012 (“Investing in Indonesia’s Institutions?), which emphasizes
engagements with government counterparts and other stakeholders who are committed to
addressing critical governance and institutional challenges. The proposed additional financing
will support three of the five thematic areas of the CPS: (a) Infrastructure; (b) Community
Development and Social Protection; and (c) Environmental Sustainability and Disaster
Mitigation.

8.    Fit with National Disaster Management Framework. Indonesia’s Disaster
Management Law (Law No. 24) includes community-based disaster risk management (CDRM).
CDRM focuses on ways to encourage and invite more active participation from local
government and community members in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of




                                               2
disaster management programs. The proposed additional financing will make a direct
contribution to the CDRM component of the National Disaster Management Framework.

9.      Partnerships. A number of donor partners already provide support for emergency
reconstruction. As with PNPM and Rekompak, the additional financing activities will work
closely with these partners, including: (a) Australian Emergency Disaster Recovery program; (b)
New Zealand Aid Agency, which provided earthquake resistance engineering training to PNPM;
(c) the multi-donor JRF, which supports the preparation and implementation of community
reconstruction plans; and (d) the International Labor Organization’s intensive works training
program, which helped the PNPM reconstruction program in Nias. Trust fund activities will be
reported and captured in the joint BNPB/UNDP/World Bank Multi Donor Financing Facility for
Disaster Management to further ensure coordination of disaster recovery efforts.

10.    Project Performance. Performance for PNPM-Urban III (and its predecessor UPP) and
Rekompak have been satisfactory. PNPM-Urban III disbursed $44 million in its first year, 2010,
and is operating in more than 5,000 wards. Rekompak JRF has met or exceeded all of its
performance indicators.

11.      The overall PNPM Rural program, including its predecessor KDP, has been successful.
PNPM Rural III, the parent project for one of the proposed additional finance projects, had
implementation problems during the first few months after its approval on March 31, 2010.
However, issues identified have since been resolved by: (a) clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of the various stakeholders; (b) engaging a qualified team leader for the national
management consultant team on an interim basis, while the competitive selection of the national
management consulting firm is in process; (c) recentralizing the contracts of district and sub-
district project managers in light of experience with decentralizing them to the provincial project
managers; (d) increasing the salary scales of facilitators to avoid high turnover and to fill
vacancies; (e) completing the design of a web-based complaint system, that mirrors the system
used in PNPM Urban; (e) restoring initial training requirements and allocating budgets
accordingly; and (f) engaging IT specialists to address issues relating to the MIS. Going forward,
as part of the preparation for the PNPM-Rural IV loan, a comprehensive review of the
governance and financial management aspects of the program will be carried out. The review
will include a risk identification exercise, including the extent to which information systems
reliably support fiduciary management and decision making. A component of the PNPM-Rural
IV project would support addressing the identified risks and gaps.


III.   PROPOSED CHANGES

12.     The project development objective (PDO) for the PNPM-Rural III - Disaster
Management Support is for villagers in PNPM-Rural locations to benefit from improved socio-
economic and local governance conditions in disaster affected areas. The PDO for PNPM-Urban
III - Disaster Management Support is to assist the GoI to ensure that the urban poor benefit from
improved socio-economic and local governance conditions in disaster affected areas. The PDO
for Rekompak is to assist in meeting the needs of eligible households for earthquake-resistant
housing and community priority investment in the affected areas. The proposed additional


                                                3
      financing supports and contributes to the PDOs for the original projects through the scale-up of
      activities in disaster affected rural and urban areas.

      13.     Activities to be supported by the Proposed Additional Financing for PNPM-Rural
      III - Disaster Management Support (US$14.1 million):

             (a) Component I: Disaster Management Kecamatan Grants (US$12.9 million). The
                 additional financing will provide grants to beneficiaries (i) planning for community
                 development, including the preparation of sub-grant proposals, (ii) training and
                 capacity building, including in development planning and investment, (iii) investment
                 in social and economic infrastructure identified through community development
                 planning, (iv) investment in activities identified through community development
                 planning using Revolving funds, and (v) preparing for and responding to disaster,
                 emergency or catastrophic events, as needed, through sub-projects. It will also
                 provide grants to beneficiaries for Pilot and Special Programs.

             (b) Component II: Facilitation Support (US$1.0 million). The additional financing will
                 support technical advisory services, training and other material support, through
                 facilitators, to strengthen the capacity of Kabupaten and Kecamatan government
                 institutions and communities in development planning and investment.

             (c) Component III: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance (US$0.2
                 million). This component would provide technical advisory services, training and
                 other material support for PNPM implementation at national-, Province-, Kabupaten-,
                 and Kecamatan- levels, including training of facilitators, monitoring and evaluation,
                 and enhanced technical and financial audits.

14.   Outcome indicators. Two additional outcome indicators have been added and four revised in
      the case of PNPM-Rural III (Table 1a). Annex 1a: Results Framework and Monitoring provides
      further detail on project indicators.

IV.        APPRAISAL SUMMARY

17.     Economic analysis. As reflected in the Project Appraisal Documents for PNPM-Rural III
and Rekompak, the original projects have a high economic internal rate of return. Since the
proposed additional financing merely increases funds available for the same type of activities, it
is expected that the additional financing would also be economically justified. The mid-term
evaluation of Rekompak found over 20% savings compared to contractor-executed village
infrastructure projects. Technical audit conducted by two prominent universities for the housing
component indicated that 98% of the housing was of good seismic standard quality. In the case
of PNPM-Rural III, an economic analysis for KDP (the predecessor to the PNPM Rural projects)
found a weighted average economic rate of return of 52.7%, which is expected to be valid for
PNPM III Rural as well the proposed additional financing to the project. In the case of PNPM-

Urban III a study has shown that an investment built through PNPM urban is about 30% cheaper
and of good quality.

18.    Technical. The proposed additional financing would support community recovery and
reconstruction activities identified in GoI damage and loss assessments, which are a part of
GoI’s/BNPB’s recovery activities and disaster management framework. PNPM’s ability to
provide a fast-acting, locally owned mechanism for bridging the gap between humanitarian
recovery and development is promising but not yet proven. PSF, through additional trust funds,
would utilize international and national NGOs, technical specialists, and other organizations that
can provide extra support to PNPM field teams. It would also support evaluations to assess how
PNPM can fit into GoI’s plans for a national emergency response mechanism. PSF would
provide hands-on, technical oversight and support to ensure vulnerable populations are fully
engaged in reconstruction planning and management.

19.    Institutional.    Experience to date indicates that the existing implementation
arrangements under the PNPM and Rekompak projects are suitable for planning, implementing,
coordinating, monitoring, and evaluation of community level disaster management activities.

20.     Financial Management. Existing financial management (FM) arrangements will be
maintained with no major changes and with the same risks and mitigation mechanisms remaining
applicable. This additional financing may stretch the capacity of the project management unit.
Mitigation measures for this additional financing include the provision of additional technical
assistance to the central and local levels. Financial management risk rating for the additional
financing of these three projects is assessed as substantial before mitigation and moderate after
mitigation.

21.    The key issue common to the three projects is inadequate capacity at the community level
to manage sub-projects and the limited capacity of local governments and field facilitators to
supervise sub-project implementation. This is being mitigated through enhanced support to the
communities and robust training to the community facilitators. District and provincial
consultants also carry out reviews on a random basis to ensure that adequate support is being
provided to the communities.
22.    The following actions of the PNPM Rural III fiduciary action plan have been
implemented:

       (a) A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by the state audit commission
           (BPKP), PMD, and the Inspector General, MOHA to involve local government
           inspectorates in the audit. BPKP has developed an audit manual and other training
           materials for local government inspectorates. The training will commence shortly,
           and the audit for FY10 will be undertaken jointly by BPKP and the local government
           auditors.

       (b) An additional FM consultant has been hired at the PMU, and each district now has
           an FM consultant.




                                                8
23.     Disbursement Arrangements. Disbursement arrangements will reflect the funding
structure of PSF, which includes a multi-donor fund and a single donor fund. The additional
financing grants for PNPM-Rural III - Disaster Management Support and Rekompak will be
financed by both these trust funds, while PNPM-Urban III - Disaster Management Support will
be financed solely out of the multi-donor fund.

24.      The applicable disbursement methods will be (a) Advance, (b) Reimbursement, and (c)
Direct Payment. Applications for the Replenishments of the Designated Account (DA)
advance may be submitted quarterly based on Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), supported by:
(a) list of payments for contracts under Bank prior together with records evidencing such
expenditures; (ii) IFRs for all other expenditures; and (iii) the DA reconciliation statement.
25.      Procurement. Procurement for the proposed additional financing would be carried out
in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits?
dated May 2004 (Rev October 2006 and May 2010); and “Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers? dated May 2004 (Rev October 2006 and
May 2010), and provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreements. The procurement arrangements
for each of the three grants are expected to follow those of the respective original projects. The
major portion of the funds under the additional financing for the three projects will be for sub-
grants to communities under established CDD procurement procedures and manuals, financing
individual consultants and amendments of existing consultant contracts with firms. Three new
packages for services will be procured under NCB and one new consultant firm will be selected
under CQS. Project implementing agencies have adequate experience with similar procurements
in Bank projects.

26.     Safeguards. The safeguard category of the additional financing projects is Category B,
which is the same as that of the parent projects. Environmental and social frameworks (ESMF)
currently in place for the PNPM-Rural III and PNPM-Urban III will be applied to activities
under the proposed additional financing grants. In the case of Rekompak, updates to the project
manual for Rekompak to reflect the latest safeguards documents will be a condition of
disbursement under the additional financing for Category 1: Sub-Grants for Housing
Reconstruction and for Category 2: Sub-Grant for Priority Investments.

27.    As mentioned, the proposed additional financing will make use of the existing PNPM
platform and aligned CDD mechanisms, including Rekompak, to support Indonesia’s disaster
management efforts. The potential benefits from scaling up the PNPM and Rekompak activities
are expected to be high, and include quicker initiation of recovery and reconstruction activities,
and serving as an established disaster recovery mechanism that could be easily utilized to
channel additional resources and initiate recovery activities in any disaster affected areas or
emergency situation in Indonesia.

28.     Risks. Annex 2 shows the Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) for the
additional financing projects. As indicated earlier, PNPM III Urban and the Rekompak Project
are being implemented in a satisfactory manner. Implementation risks identified in the on-going
projects, in particular in the case of PNPM III Rural (adequacy of the fiduciary systems and
controls to ensure transparency and reduce risks of corruption) have already been addressed.
Government and the implementing agencies are making good progress on their implementation,


                                                9
and additional mitigation measures have been incorporated under the proposed additional
financing operations, including improvements to normal mechanisms to control corruption as
expanded audits and extra on-site PSF supervision.
