PROJECT COMPLETION
REPORT
TURKEY: ISTANBUL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(LOAN 892-TU)
PREFACE
The Project consisted of the expansion of the Istanbul power
distribution network by adding some 550MVA of primary and secondary substation
capacity and the installation of about 110 km of primary, 250 km of secondary
and 470 km of low-voltage distribution lines and underground cables. The
project also included a telemetering system, communication equipment, service
vehicles, fault locators, construction equipment and consulting services for
engineering and various studies. A Bank loan of US$14 million for the project
was made in May 1973. The loan was fully disbursed and closed on February 28,
19 81.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa (EMENA) Regional Office on the basis of the findings of
project completion missions which visited Turkey in May 1981 and May 1982 and
a study of the Appraisal Report and other documents in the Bank's files.
The PCR summarizes the main points of particular interest -- notably,
difficulties in achieving institution-building objectives, some aspects of
procurement, loan effectiveness conditions and efficiency improvements.
Following normal procedures, a draft copy of the report was sent to the
Borrower (Government) and the Beneficiary (IETT) for their comments. Those
comments which were received have been taken into account in finalizing this
report, and are attached to the report as Annexes 10, 11 and 12.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY: ISTANBUL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(LOAN 892-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 892-TU was for the Istanbul Power Distribution Project
implemented by the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel Company (IETT),
the beneficiary of the loan. The Projec.t originally comprised all of the 1974
and 1975 investment program of IETT's Electricity Department. Although the
Appraisal Report anticipated completion of the Project by mid-1976, the actual
physical construction is expected to be completed only by mid-1984, a delay of
eight years.
The Project illustrates a constructive relationship between the Bank
and the Borrower/Beneficiary where increased supervision efforts resulted in
the completion of a rather difficult and complex power distribution project
(para. 8.1).
The Project was delayed about 2 years because of delays in the
preparation of bidding documents. IETT's consultants were not experienced in
dealing with general conditions and procedural matters.   The Project was also
delayed because of shortage of local funds (paras. 3.2 & 3.6). The main
objectives of the physical facilities of the Project such as rehabilitation of
the distribution system and improving the quality of power supply in the
Istanbul area have by and large been achieved. However, the institutional
goals have not been fully achieved.
IETT's financial performance was unsatisfactory (paras. 5.1 - 5.6)
largely due to Government's unwillingness to increase tariffs to keep pace
with inflation. IETT's internal cash generation during the project period
amounted to only 4% of its construction expenditures and the resultant
shortfall in internally generated funds delayed project implementation. One
of the objectives of the Project was to separate the electric utility from the
transport and gas utility operations (para. 5.7); however, this objective was
not accomplished during the Project period. According to the Government,
actions are now being taken to meet this objective by transferring the
municipal electric utilities to TEK for operation which will solve the problem
of the municipalities diverting funds from the electric utility into the
transport operations (para. 5.3 and Annex 10).
IETT had problems of recruiting and retaining competent and
experienced staff due to constraints on salaries. Salaries were not
competitive with the private sector and Government was not in a position to
improve salaries in relation to the private sector (para. 6.6). During the
Project implementation period there were numerous changes in the management
level of IETT resulting in poor planning and a lack of continuity of
objectives (para 6.5).






TURKEY
ISTANBUL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Loan 892-TU
PROJECT ODMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The power system in Turkey is fully interconnected and several
organizations are involved in its operations. The Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK), a State Economic Enterprise (SEE), is responsible for
electricity generation and transmission in most of the provinces in
Turkey. Only in four out of sixty-seven provinces are power operations in
the hands of two private power companies. Turkey has over a hundred muni-
cipal and regional power distribution entities of which the largest one is
the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel Company (IETT), the benefi-
c iary of Loan 892-TU made in 1973. IETT's operations cover electricity
distribution, public transport (buses, trolleys and tunnel) and two gas
plants in and around the Municipality of Istanbul. The Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources (MOE) has official jurisdiction over the development
of energy resources in Turkey and power supply activities. The organiza-
tions such as TEK and IETT are subject to close Governmental supervision
and their autonomy has been severely limited by the lack of freedom in set-
ting personnel policies and by the Government's role in determining prices
of their good's and services.
1.2      The electric power subsector grew rapidly over most of the period
since 1965, although there has been a sharp decline in the rate of growth
in the last few years. The average rate of growth of electricity sales
since 1965 has been about 11% p.a.  Since 1971, it has not been possible to
meet the full demands on the interconnected system mainly because of delays
in construction of power plants and also because of breakdowns of power
plants in operation. The shortfall in supply rose from about 2% of demand
in 1971 to about 10% in 1981. The power shortages would have been worse
but for the rising trend of electricity import from the USSR and Bulgaria,
which in 1980 accounted for 5% of total supplies. Most of the power cuts
were achieved by interruptions of supply to the municipalities for a speci-
fied number of hours each day. During certain periods of the year, power
supply cuts were for as long as 5 to 8 hours daily. The main reasons for
the power shortages were delays in construction of power plants, major
plant breakdowns, and lack or shortage of liquid fuel and replacement parts
arising from shortages of foreign exchange. In order to reduce power
shortages, many gas turbines have been installed and operated excessively,
resulting in their frequent breakdowns.. The Turkish power system has only
a few modern and reliable power plants and these are capable of generating
less than half of the power requirements. To alleviate the problem of
power shortages in the future, Turkey has a huge power investment program,



- 2 -
including many large generating plants (e.g. Elbistan, a steam station;
Karakaya and Ataturk, hydro stations) which require enormous investments
and long construction time. Nevertheless, TEK expects continuing shortages
of power for the next two or three years, even if ongoing projects are
completed according to their current schedules, and the shortages could
persist much longer in the event of continuing project delays.
1.3      The Project entity (IETT) has experienced power shortages since
the Project was appraised in 1973. The quality of the power supply has
also been rather poor.  In addition to regular power supply cuts, voltage
and frequency were below the required standards. Power losses have been
excessive at about 16% annually.  Since these deficiencies were mainly the
result of deficiencies of the national power generation and transmission
system, IETT has been unable to undertake any significant remedial measures
to improve the quality of the power supply in its distribution area.
Operating in these difficult circumstances, IETT has been struggling just
to keep the problems to a minimum, knowing fully that it would not be pos-
sible either to prevent or eliminate them.
1.4      This Project Completion Report is based on a completion report
prepared by IETT and on information obtained by a Bank mission from IETT
and other Turkish power related institutions inMay 1981. The Project's
operating performance was again reviewed in May 1982 after allowing
sufficient time to enable a judgement to be made on such operating
performance (para. 4.1).
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin, Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.1      The Project had its origin in the overall Istanbul urban develop-
ment plans which were initiated in the late 1960s. The Bank Group assisted
the Government in the improvement and expansion of the urban growth of
Istanbul through its lending operations (Credit 324-TU and Loan 844-TU of
1970). The study of the modernization of the Istanbul distribution network
prepared in 1969 and updated in 1971 by IETT's expatriate consultants
(Consultant "A"), served as a Project feasibility study. This study was
also reviewed and approved by TEK and MOE. The consultant's study covered
the power distribution system requirements in the period 1969-1982. An-
other study prepared by expatriate consultant "B" reviewed IETT's electri-
city and gas organizational structure and operations and made a number of
proposals for their improvement. These studies helped determine the choice
of the Project, which was identified in mid-1970 in the course of investi-
gation by the Bank Group of Istanbul's urban development problems. Other
Bank Group lending operations for power generation and transmission pro-
jects in the Turkish power subsector had also highlighted the necessity for
lending for power distribution, and Istanbul was considered as most de-
serving of the Bank Group's assistance in this respect. The Project was
appraised in June/July 1972 and negotiations were held in Washington in
January 1973. No problems arose during negotiations and agreements were
easily reached between the Bank and the Borrower (the Government of Turkey)
and the Beneficiary (IETT). No signficant changes from the original scope



- 3 -
lere made in the Project as presented to the Board of Directors.   The Bank
requested four specific studies to be undertaken by IETT in order to
improve its organization and services. Details of these studies are given
in para. 2.2. Annex 1 sets forth the major covenants of the Loan and
Project Agreements. It appears from hindsight that the Government and IETT
had not fully comprehended the likely impact of the covenants, particularly
the financial covenants. At the time of Loan signing, IETT's staff was not
able to cope with the task of preparing the basic Project procurement
documents that started two years after.
Project Description
2.2      The Project originally comprised all of the 1974 and 1975 invest-
ment program of IETT's Electricity Department and consisted of the expan-
sion of 34.5/10-kV primary and 10/0.4-kV secondary substation capacity by
some 390 MVA and 160 MVA respectively both by the expansion of existing
ones and the establishment of new ones and the erection and installation of
about 110 km of primary, 250 km of secondary and 470 km of low-voltage
distribution lines and underground cables. In addition, 40 MVAR of
capacitors were to have been installed to improve voltage regulation and
the power factor, but these were subsequently dropped, as the consultant
found that they were not necessary at this stage of network development.
The Project also included the procurement of (i) a telemeasuring and
teleprinter system to form the nucleus of a load dispatching center; (ii)
radio and telephone equipment to improve communications; (iii) service
vehicles, cable fault locators and construction equipment; (iv) electricity
meters; and (v) consulting services for (a) providing the engineering for
the Project, (b) a management study, (c) a power market study, (d) a
transport study and (e) a study of the Istanbul gas service.
Project Objectives
2.3      The principal objectives of the Project were; rehabilitating the
distribution system; meeting urgent short-term expansion requirements;
establishing the basis for a long-term development program; and initiating
institutional reforms on the basis of organization and management studies
as well as planning and development studies of IETT's power, transport and
gas supply activities. The studies of long-term power investment, trans-
port sector and public gas supply were planned to be closely coordinated
with overall improvements of institutional capabilities in the Istanbul
metropolitan area for integrated planning and coordinated preparation and
implementation of priority investments. The main thrust of the intended
institutional changes was the separation of the organization, administra-
tion and financing of the three IETT services (electricity, transport and
gas supply). At the time of the appraisal, the electricity operation was
financially viable, while transportation and gas supply were incurring
heavy losses. The Project was expected to correct IETT's serious financial
and organizational deficiencies and to improve the quality of its services.



2.4      The infonnation available at the time of the appraisal did not al-
low a realistic forecast of Project results.  The key assumptions made in
arriving at IETT's forecast sales and energy requirements were based on an
optimistic annual growth rate (10.5Z p.a. ). The changes in energy prices,
pattern of usage, effects of tariffs and restrictions in the power supply
had not been expressed in quantitative terms. Furthermore, load management
and energy conservation measures apparently were not incorporated into the
forecasts. There were clearly many uncertainties, such as power supply
constraints, which were not taken into account in making IETT's growth
projections for the long-term.
III.  IMPLEMENTATION
3.1      The conditions of loan effectiveness were confined to various
legal actions (authorization and ratification of loan documents and the
subsidiary Loan Agreement) . The loan was made effective on October 31,
1973, about two months late.  However, the delay had practically no adverse
impact on the start-up of the Project and its implementation schedule.
Project Execution
3.2      There was an initial delay of about two years in the preparation
of bidding documents. IETT's consultants from the Middle East Technical
University (Consultant "C") were late in drafting technical specifications
and had no experience in dealing with general conditions and other
procedural matters. With the assistance of the Bank staff these documents
were prepared in early 1976. The shortage of local funds also contributed
to delays.
3.3      Based on the conclusion of the consultants' studies of the
Istanbul distribution network that the planned installation of the power
capacitors was not needed to improve voltage regulation in the mostly
underground Istanbul distribution network, this component of the Project
was dropped in 1975. The original study by the Electricite de France
(Consultant "A") did not adequately cover the reactive power component
aspects and this deficiency was corrected by Consultant "C". Furthermore,
because of the shortage of foreign exchange funds, the telemeasuring,
teleprinter and radio equipment have not been procured, although there is a
need for it. Other changes in the Project were the increased length of
distribution cables and the addition of a number of power distribution
transformers. These changes resulted from the extended Project period
covering the years after 1974/75 and were justified.
3.4      The Project was completed by May 1981 except for some 35/10-KV
transformer stations. Out of 17 transformer substations included in the
Project, only seven have been completed. Four substations, currently under
construction, are expected to be commissioned by mid-1983. Two existing
substations that were planned to be expanded have been expanded, but to a
smaller capacity than originally planned in 1972. The construction of the
remaining four substations has not started so far either due to unresolved
site problems or changes in the 35-KV distribution network.  It is expected
that these would also be completed within a period of two years on
alternative sites which are available for construction. All cables and



- 5 -
overhead lines have been erected. The service vehicles are in operation
but problems of maintenance and spare parts have already appeared. IETT's
construction staff, assisted by local contractors for civil works (buil-
dings) , was responsible for the construction of the Project. Although the
appraisal report anticipated completion of the Project by mid-1976, the
actual physical construction is expected to be completed only by mid-1984,
a delay of eight years. The main factors causing delays were IETT's
unfamiliarity with the World Bank's procurement requirements, its
inefficient organization and management, frequent changes in its top
management following changes of Government, lack of clear autonomy for IETT
vis-a-vis Government and the Mayor of Istanbul, poor quality of staff, and
mounting financial difficulties, not only of IETT but of the country as a
whole. These factors were not anticipated during the Project appraisal.
It was only because of the increased supervision efforts that the
procurement and construction activity picked up in the late 1970s. The
original time schedule was optimistic even for well organized power
entities.
Reporting
3.5      The Borrower and the Beneficiary were informed of the Bank's
reporting requirements immediately after loan signing; however, reporting
always remained unsatisfactory. The progress reports on the Project were
irregular and late; they did not contain the necessary information and did
not give any real insight into Project problems. Part of the problem was
that IETT did not have a coordination unit responsible for Project re-
porting and there was also no continuity of staff in handling the loan
related activities.
Pro cure ment
3.6      IETT had difficulties in accepting and applying the Bank's
guidelines on procurement, which resulted in long delays in connection with
contract awards. Part of the problem was the inexperience of the IETT
staff responsible for procurement matters. The Ministry of Industry also
objected for some time to the importation of foreign goods and delayed
issuance of import permits. The contract for 35/10-kV distribution
switchgear was in dispute between IETT and the Bank for one year.  IETT
insisted on awarding the contract for this equipment to a local
manufacturer supplier, who was not the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
It was only after a good deal of discussions and long delays that the
Borrower and IETT reluctantly agreed to award the cbntract to the lowest
bidder. This caused an additional delay of about two years in equipment
deliveries and thus in Project completion. Details of the awarded
contracts are given in Annex 2.
Project Costs
3.7      The final cost of the Project was US$132.02 million as against the
original estimate of US$40.22 million. A detailed comparison of these
costs is given in Annex 3. The increases in the foreign and local costs
are 21% and 339% respectively over the appraisal estimates. The foreign
cost increases would have been more had the power capacitors (40 MVAR) and



-6-
communication equipment, originally included in the Project, not been
dropped, and had some. Project items obtainable in the local currency (low
voltage distribution equipment) not been excluded from the Project's
foreign exchange costs. The high increase in the local cost reflects the
impact of very high inflation on labor and material costs as well as some
increase in the Project's scope. Cost overruns were financed by the
Government and IETT, e.g. the Government provided funds for the purchase of
power transformers in East Germany.
Disbursements
3.8      The original estimate of disbursements and the actual disburse-
ments are given in Annex 4. Cumulative disbursements were much lower than
the appraisal estimates during Project implementation due to start-up and
procurement delays. (para. 3.2). The Bank provided needed assistance in
accelerating disbursements through special contractual arrangements with
the suppliers, such as increased advances and replacement of the retention
money with bank guarantees.
Peformance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.9      The performance of the consultants for the Project's physical
facilities was satisfactory except in respect of the preparation of bidding
documents and evaluation of bids. The suppliers performed satisfactorily
and even offered technical assistance in supervision of equipment erection
that had not been contracted. The local civil works contractors for sub-
station buildings proved to be competent and capable of carrying out their
contracts.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1      Since the 35/10-KV distribution substations, which represent the
main component of the Project, have not been in service long enough and
some of them have not even been commissioned (para. 3.4), it is difficult
to compare the actual operating performance of the Project's physical
facilities with the expectations at appraisal. However, it is clear that
the quality of the power supply in Istanbul has improved in the last two
years. This is mainly due to the installation of the power distribution
equipment covered under the Project. The number of power supply outages in
IETT's distribution network have been reduced in 1981, particularly in
power transformer substations. Electricity losses dropped from 16.97% in
1980 to 16.01% in 1981, the first year in which the Project facilities were
in operation. The voltage conditions have also somewhat improved. Other
Project facilities and equipment that have been in operation have not shown
any specific operational problems. For example, there has not been any
major breakdown in the installed 35-kV underground cables. Likewise,
equipment such as electricity meters and relays have functioned
satisfactorily. The service vehicles were also operating satisfactorily
until 1979-1980 when the problem of spare parts arose; some of these
vehicles have been out of service from time to time. IETT is not capable
of maintaining the service vehicles properly and of securing needed spare
parts, but this is not a problem peculiar to IETT alone; rather it is a
nation-wide problem arising from the acute shortage of foreign exchange.



- 7 -
4.2      There were no major deviations or changes in the Project designs
or its major components. Reliable and proven equipment has been used for
the Project facilities. IETT's staff operates these facilities satis-
factorily. Some equipment and materials have been stored for a long
period, e.g. power transformers, and it is not clear whether all necessary
measures have been undertaken to properly protect this equipment and
material s.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMAI'E
Financial Results
5.1      IETT's financial performance was unsatisfactory during the Project
period. Its tariffs did not keep pace with inflation (see table below) and
its operating expenses increased faster than its revenues with the result
that it sustained operating losses in 1977, 1978 and 1979. Its net cash
generation during 1972-1980 was only 4% of expansion requirements as
against the covenanted 40% (para. 5.6).
5.2      The income statements, balance sheets, and sources and applica-
tions of funds statements for the combined electricity, transport and gas
utilities of IETT for the years ended December 31, 1972 through 1980 are
presented in Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. The financial statements compare
the SAR estimates for the years 1972-1976 with the actual results; but
because the Project was delayed beyond the original estimate of 1972-1976,
and was actually not started until 1974 and is not yet complete, the finan-
cial statements for the years 1977-1980 are also presented to give the
total Project financial performance. The SAR financial estimates for 1972-
1976 were prepared using the existing rate of exchange in 1971 of LT 14 to
US$1.00. The Turkish lira was devalued drastically over the years 1972-
1980 (from 14 LT/US$1 to 91 LT/US$l) , particularly during 1977-1980 (from
16 LT/US$l to 91 LT/US$). The actual LT/US$ exchange rates during the
period of January 1, 1972-December 31, 1980 are presented in Annex 9.
IETT's sales of electricity were estimated in the SAR to be about 11,947.0
GWh for the period 1972-1976; the actual sales of 10,856.5 GWh were about
9% less than the estimates. Revenues from the sales of electricity were
estimated at LT 4,637.2 million for the years 1972-1976 based on the
average sale price during this period of about 40 kurus per kWh
(US$.03/kWh). IETT's tariffs were adjusted regularly from 1974 on, and
resulted in actual revenues of LT 5,877.6 million for the years 1972-1976.
But as stated in para. 5.1 above, in real terms the increased electricity
distribution tariffs did not keep up with inflation.

IETT's electricity tariffs effective April 1, 1981 are presented in Annex
5.5. IETT's operating expenses for' the electric utility (including the
cost of purchased power from TEK) increased faster than revenues and the
electric utility sustained net operating losses during the years 1977, 1978
and 1979. The operating revenues and operating expenses of IETT per kWh of
electricity sales are as follows;

5.3      The transport and gas utilities of IETT sustained very sizeable
operating losses for the years 1972-1980 with losses during the years

- 9 -
1975-1976 almost double the SAR estimates for the transport utility due to
the impact of the increased fuel prices beginning in 1974. IETT's losses
in the transport and gas utilities caused severe cash problems and forced
IETT to use electricity income to finance the losses in the transport and
gas utilities.  This diversion of electricity funds prevented IETT from
paying TEK for electricity purchased for resale in IETT's distribution sys-
tem, and in turn TEK was unable to pay its bill for the fuel for generation
of electricity.!' The diversion of electricity funds also slowed the
Project because IETT was not able to generate the necessary local funds
required for the Project. IETT's transport and gas utility operating
results for the years 1972-1980 are as follows:
Transport           Gas              Total
LT Millions      LT Millions      LT Millions
Total Operating Revenues         5,772.8            849.1           6,621.9
Less Operating Expenses         12,601.6          1,625.0          14,226.6
Net Operating Income       (6,828.8)          (775.9)         (7,604.7)
IETT's transport and gas utilities sustained total net operating losses of
LT 7,604.7 million for the years 1972-1980 which were offset in part by the
small net operating income of LT 305.8 million of the electric utility.
The deficit operations of the transport and gas utilities required subsi-
dies from the Municipality and the Government in the form of consolidation
of debts for fuel for the transport system and coal used in the manufacture
of gas and for the debt service of the transport and gas utilities.
5.4      Annex 5.4 summarizes the operations of IETT for the years 1972-
1980. Electricity sales increased an average of 8.7% during 1972-1978. In
1978-1980 TEK was unable to meet the demands for electricity in Istanbul
and the sales during these years reflect the reduction in the quantity of
power supplied to IETT by TEK. IETT's total number of electricity con-
sumers increased from 700,000 in 1972 to 1,160,000 in 1980, an incrase of
66% or about 8% annually. Energy losses arising largely from illegal
connections and distribution line losses continue to be heavy (about 16%).
The transport utility increased the number of passengers carried in 1980 by
nearly 45% over 1979 due to the addition of 600 new buses and the higher
gasoline prices which tended to keep people from driving individual
automobiles and increased fares for taxis and dolmuses (routed taxis)
Manufactured gas sales increased about 53% during 1972-1980 because of the
lower price of manufactured gas compared to the prices of fuel oil and
bottled gas which increased very rapidly during 1974-1980.
1/ As indicated in Annex 10, since the closing of the loan the municipal
assets were transferred to TEK beginning November 1, 1982 and the transfer
is required to be completed within the next two years.

Performance under the Revenue Covenant
5.5      The Loan Aiieement required that IETT increase electricity tariffs
to levels to provide either at least 40% of the average of the actual
electricity construction program for the previous year and planned
electricity construction expenditure for the current year, or 100% of the
reserve for expansion of the system required for the previous year under
Article 28 of Law No. 1312 (the TEK Law) whichever is the greater. Any
shortfall in any year was required to be made up in the following year.
IETT proposed annual electricity tariffs sufficient for it to achieve the
goal but delays on the part of the Government in approving the tariff
increases prevented IETT from achieving the 40% level of cash generation.
Duiring 1972-1980, the actual level of internal cash generation was only 4%
as against the required 40%. By 1978 Government subsidies were required
even for the electric utility of IETT to carry out a linited construction
program. The diversion of electricity funds for the operation of the
transport and gas utilities necessitated Government's consolidation of the
debts of LETT to TEK along with the municipalities' debts and Government's
debts to IETT for electricity used by the municipality and for Government's
operations. The consolidation of accounts cleared the amounts due and
payable but did not provide the actual cash necessary for daily
operations, particularly for the local costs of the construction program of
the electric utility.

1972-1980 are as follows:

Accounting
5.7      The separation of the electric utility from the transport and gas
utilities was an important Project objective. The Loan Agreement provided
that not later than December 31, 1974, the Borrower would initiate
institutional, organizational and financial arrangements which would lead
to the establishment of an organization or organizations serving the
Istanbul Metropolitan Area with (i) the distribution of electricity (ii)
public transport services, and (iii) the manufacture and supply of gas. In
May, 1973 the Borrower confirmed that all necessary action, including
legislation would be taken to reorganize IETT's activities; but no concrete
action was actually taken to effect such a reorganization. Pending the
separation of the utilities, IETT and the Government agreed to separate the
accounts and to open separate bank accounts for the three utility
departments of IETT and for the head office, effective from July 1, 1973.
The management of IETT finally separated the accounts effective January 1,
1978 by establishing four accounting sections for the three utilities and
the head office. The accounts of IETT from 1978 were maintained by each
Department with its own income and expenditure accounts and balance
sheets.  Separate bank accounts were also opened in 1978 for the electric
utility, but when funds were available from the electric utility, they were
still diverted to the overall operations of IETT. Information was received
from TEK in their "Comments on PCR" (Annex 10) that actions were taken by
Government to transfer IETT's electric utility assets to TEK from
November 1, 1982.



- 12 -
Auditing
5.8      The Project Agreement required IETT to have the accounts and
financial statements of each of its Departments audited in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent audi-
tors acceptable to the Bank, and to furnish to the Bank not later than four
months after the end of the fiscal year, certified copies in the English
language of the audit report and financial statements.  The Bank accepted
the Inspectors of the Ministry of Finance to be independent auditors; but
reserved the right to review the decision at any time during the Loan.
Through 1977 the annual audit report was being submitted late each year due
to staff constraints of the Ministry of Finance; and in 1978 the issue was
raised by the Bank suggesting that IETT hire an independent auditor in
order that the audit be completed within the agreed time frame. However,
the Government maintained that under the existing laws of Turkey an inde-
pendent auditor could not be hired by IETT. Consequently, the audit re-
ports for the years 1978 and 1979 were also submitted to the Bank about six
months late. A similar delay occurred in respect of the audit report for
1980. The quality of the audit was not always satisfactory and the audit
reports did not address the issues of the diversion of funds from the
electricity to other Departments.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORM4NCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Power Market Study
6.1      Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower had agreed to cause a power
market study of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area to be carried out by
December 31, 1974. The study was to include a preliminary survey to help
identify the precise location of the power distribution facilities needed
in IETT's service area in 1974 and 1975, and a long-term power market
review covering the period 1976-1985 to be conducted in coordination with
the Istanbul Master Plan Bureau and the appropriate urban authorities,
including feasibility studies of future power distribution development and
a review of the retail tariff structure.  It was expected that TEK would be
responsible for the power market study.  Since TEK had not shown any initi-
ative to undertake this study, IETT engaged Consultant "C" in 1974 to con-
duct it. In the study, the load growth in the Istanbul area in the period
1973-1985 has been analysed. The analysis of the power demand was done in
detail on an annual basis up to and including 1976, and as a general out-
line until 1985 on the basis of three-year periods. The study provides the
basis for determining the facilities required to meet the load growth in
the future in the most economical way and is a useful tool for IETT in its
planning activities. The tariff study for Turkey as a whole has been pre-
pared by TEK and its consultants, including retail tariffs applicable in
the IETT's power supply area.  These two analyses were the first major
studies related to power distribution and the power subsector as a whole
successfully completed by Turkish institutions. However, tariff action
continued to be dictated, at least until September 1980, more by political
considerations than by financial or economic ones.



- 13 -
Management and Organization Study
6.2      As required under the Loan Agreement, IETT employed a consultant
(Consultant "B") to undertake a management and organization study of the
company. The purpose of the study was to improve IETT's work methods, in-
troduce greater delegation of authority throughout IETT, review inventory
and accounting systems and assist in implementing the changes necessary to
achieve separate departmental accounting. The study was completed in 1975
and parts of it such as the separation of accounts for the electric, trans-
port and gas utilities (see para. 5.7 for details) have been implemented.
Transport System Study
6.3      The transport system study was undertaken by an expatriate   con-
sultant (Consultant "D") with the aim of determining the most appropriate
organization, administration and means of financing a public transport
system serving the Greater Istanbul Metropolitan Area, including the separ-
ation of public transport from the distribution of electricity.   The study
analysed in detail IETT's transportation department, its organization and
general conditions in the period 1960-1975. Particular attention was paid
to the financial aspects of the public transport accounting and tariff
issues. A number of recommendations were made to achieve improvements in
operation, maintenance and repairs. Although the organizational changes
proposed by the consultant have not yet been implemented, substantial
improvements have been made in maintenance and repair of buses,
establishment of the mobile control service, rearrangement of running
schedules of buses and introduction of express bus lines, revision of
fares, and application of computers in IETT's transport operations.
Gas Supply Study
6.4      The appointment of the consultant to carry out a study on the most
appropriate measures to be taken with regard to the manufacture and distri-
bution of gas in the Istanbul Metropolitan Area including the integration
of the existing gas systems and the separation of gas supply from the dis-
tribution of electricity remained under dispute between IETT and the Mayor
of Istanbul for about one year. Ultimately IETT employed an expatriate
consultant (Consultant "E") for this purpose in 1975. The study, which was
the only one ever on the gas supply in Istanbul, was completed in 1976. It
provides a detailed framework for gas supply development and operations in
Istanbul, including suggestions for necessary modifications of the gas
pipeline network as well as increases in gas tariffs. The MOE has still to
approve the gas supply extensions proposed by IETT based on the gas supply
study.
Management's Effectiveness
6.5      There has not been much improvement in IETT's management structure
or in its effectiveness. The present IETT management was appointed a year
ago by the military governor of Istanbul and it is too early to judge its
effectiveness. All previous IETT's general managers opposed the
decentralization of the company's operations and establishment of separate



- 14 -
and autonomous entities for electricity, public transport and gas supply.
Iong-range planning, including planning of manpower development and other
institution-building activities have not been fully developed. The
consultant's studies have had some beneficial impact on management's
effectiveness, although many of their recommmendations have not been
implemented.
Staff Growth and Development
6.6      The number of employees increased from 11,541 in 1972 to 13,150 in
1975 and dropped to 12,857 in 1980 of which laborers were 10,123. Annex
No. 6 shows details of IETT's staffing situation. The number of customers
per IETT's employee increased from 180 in 1972 to 233 in 1980 (about 30%).
Similar improvements were made in the transport and gas supply departments.
These improvements have been made basically since 1976, and very likely
reflect the impact of the consultants' recommendations (elimination of fare
collectors, reduction in the number of electricity and gas meter readers,
etc.). IETT has had problems in recruiting competent and experienced staff
in adequate numbers and in retaining trained staff. Staff salaries are not
competitive considering other employment opportunities for qualified staff
and there is a continuous movement of staff to other, mostly private,
companies where salaries are much higher.  IETT is well aware of this
problem but is helpless in solving this problem which is common to all
parastatal organizations in Turkey.
Consultants
6.7      The consultants have provided satisfactory service to IETT and
their overall impact on IETT's development and services has been positive.
Some of the consultants' recommendations have been adopted, but these are
mostly those where Government approval was not needed.   There have been no
basic changes in IETT's organizational structure; this structure is in fact
determined by the IETT law (No. 3645 of 1939). Contrary to the major ob-
jective of Loan 892-TU, there were also no substantial institutional
changes, such as the separation of organization, administration and finan-
cing of electricity, public transport and gas supply. The problems of
parastatal organizations like IETT can only be resolved through the reform
of all state economic enterprises and municipal entities on a country-wide
basis and it is almost impossible to achieve any progress in separate
individual enterprises, such as IETT, where still all major decisions are
being made by the Government or municipal authorities.
VII. ECONOMIC REVALUATION
7.1      At appraisal, IETT's forecast for the period 1972-1976 indicated
an increase in total electricity sales from 1,880 GWh in 1972 to 2,725 GWh
in 1976, with an annual growth of 10.5%. This estimate was considered to
be conservative. However, actual sales were 1,859 GWh in 1972 and 2,580
GWh in 1976 (annual increase of about 9%) . In 1974, sales were 2% less
than in 1973. Obviously, it was difficult to forecast the effects of oil
price increases, and changes in tariffs on the pattern of usage of electri-
city. The appraisal report does not show sales forecasts, after 1976.



- 15 -
There was practically no increase in electricity sales in the period 1977-
1980 (less than 1%) . The main reason for the stagnation in this period was
severe power supply restrictions in Turkey as a result of lack of fuel
arising from foreign exchange problems and breakdowns of major generating
plants.  Electricity losses remained high (about 16% in 1981). The
electricity losses reflect an undeveloped power distribution network and
excessively low voltage levels in the bulk power supply system.
7.2      Power supply outages in the period 1976-1980 have increased sub-
stantially, both in number and duration. Annex 7 shows details of the
power supply outages in the Istanbul area. The number of outages increased
from 8,311 in 1976 to 11,578 in 1980 and their duration almost doubled.
With the implementation of the Project's physical facilities the excessive
number of supply outages and power losses have been reduced.
7.3      In the staff appraisal report the return on investment for the
Project was based on IETT's power distribution program for 1972-75.   It was
defined as the discount rate at which the present worth of the Project's
capital and operating costs over the Project life equals the present worth
of the benefits in the form of attributable revenues. Only benefits from
electricity sales were taken into account. The rate of return in the Pro-
ject was calculated as 30%. On the same basis, the rate of return is now
estimated to be 14% (Annex 8).  The lower rate of return is mainly attribu-
table to the increased Project costs and delays in the implementation of
appropriate tariff measures.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1      The Bank maintained good relations with the Borrower and Benefici-
ary during both the loan processing and Project implementation. At apprai-
sal, the Bank's assessment of the power subsector problems in Turkey was
much too optimistic. Although the serious financial and organizational
problems of IETT were identified, the Project was considered worthwhile
because of 'the urgent need for a more reliable power supply and for the
correction of various deficiencies in IETT's system and operation. The
loan was essential for the financing of the Project's physical facilities
and consultants' studies. Moreover, if the loan had not been made, it is
likely that the IETT power distribution network extension would have been
substantially curtailed or delayed. From a technical point of view, the
Project has fulfilled its purpose.  However, the Project objectives related
to the institution-building and financial aspects have not been achieved as
expected. IETT's Project implementation and procurement scheduling were
not realistic. The Bank's assistance in procurement related matters should
have been offered much earlier, i.e. prior to negotiations or, at the
latest, immediately after the loan signing. Although there was no
continuity of Bank staff in the first three years or so, thereafter
practically the same staff supervised the Project regularly through 1979.
The supervision mission planned for 1980 was postponed because of the
political events of September 1980.



- 16 -
8.2      The Bank certainly made a significant contribution to the Project.
In the future, increased investments in power distribution facilities are
likely to be required. Bank support for such priority investments would
have to be accompanied by essential improvements in the institutional
arrangements for distribution activities.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
Overall Achievements
9.1      The main objectives of the Project's physical facilities by and
large have been achieved. The Project has improved the quality of IETT's
services and resulted in more efficient power distribution operations.
Although the various consultants' studies represent a significant
contribution, and a number of the operational improvements in IETT's
electricity, public transport and gas departments can be credited to these
studies, the institutional goals of the loan have not been fully achieved.
The Bank lending was instrumental in introducing various changes in IETT's
operations and planning procedures but still much remains to be done for
establishing autonomous and financially viable entities in the Istanbul
area responsible for electricity distribution, public transport and gas
supply.
Lessons Learned
9.2      The main lessons to be drawn from this lending operation are:
(i) Institution-building objectives in IETT's power distribution
system cannot be achieved without basic reforms and changes in
Turkish State Economic Enterprises and municipal entities;
(ii)  In the case of new borrowers, appropriate efforts should be made
to familiarize them thoroughly with the Bank Group's procurement
requirements at least by the time of negotiations, if not during
Project preparation and appraisal. Furthermore, it would be also
appropriate to carefully screen the qualifications of engineering
consultants and their capabilities to advise adequately on
procurement matters;
(iii)  The Bank needs to ensure that at least the accounts of the organ-
izations with combined utility operations be separated before loan
effectiveness, in order that financial performance could be ac-
curately determined, and the necessary local funds provided for
financing planned investments; and
(iv)  Further lending to power distribution entities (municipal)!' in
Turkey should seek to achieve a satisfactory resolution of the
basic institutional problems and to improve system efficiency.

transfer municipal electricity assets to TEK from November 1, 1982.

Dear Sir,
In reference to your letter dated October 5,1982 and attached
draft report on the tstanbul Power Distribution Project, we would
like to inform you that the Completion Report has been carefully
examined pointly by the authorities from TEK's Planning and
Coordination Division and IETT's former Electrical Operations
organization and the following comments have been deemed appropriate:
(Incorporated         - Due to the recent changes in the TEK's Foundation Law Nr.2705,
in Para. 5.3           which has been in effect since September 10, 1982, from
and 9.2)               November 1,1982, on, the electrical operation organizations
of all the municipal entities within the country dealing
with electricity services either alone or in a combined
manner, along with gas and public transportation divisions,
shall be seperated from such utilities and transferred to
TEK with their all legal and financial rights and
Telephone          liabilities plus their fixed assets and personnel resources.
This transferring process has been already underway for
the municipal utilities of large cities like tstanbul
(IETT), Ankara (EGO) and tzmir (ESHOT) etc. and according
to the new requirements of the Law shall be completed for
other towns within the next two years.
Therefore, due to this consolidation process, in accordance
with a certain two-year schedule, there will remain no single
municipal organization in the form neither a seperate nor a combined
utility operation as far as municipal electricity services are
concerned.
Consequently, your statements and comments concerning
institutional problems and seperation process of accounts of the
municipal organizations with combined operations should be reviewed
and updated accordingly ; particUlarly, recommendations under the
chapter conclusions should be revised in this respect.
In all your correspondence please quote the date and referenco of our letter,
and enclose two copies of your letter.     TEK MODEL 47/11 Adel IX0 0O 5. :977 21X29



Annex 10

-42-
(Reflected in      - In paragraph 2.2. It should be pointed out that the actual
para. 3.7)          project implemented by the support of the Loan TU-892t did
not cover the power transformers at 10 kV level but the
switchgear only. In fact, 10 kV power transformers were
procured from other resources. The same applies for the overhead
lines' equipment both at 10 and 35 kV.
Apart from the points indicated above, we would like to let you
know that we share the same views and statements in your draft report
and confirm our full agreement with them.
